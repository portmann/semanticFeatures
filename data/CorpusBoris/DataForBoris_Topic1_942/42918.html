As Much as a Third of Discouraged Workers Might Return - Real Time Economics - WSJ There is still plenty of room for improvement in the U.S. job market despite recent strides, according to a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund. The debate over how much â€œslackâ€? or unused capacity remains in the job market is crucial for Federal Reserve officials as they decide when to start raising short-term interest rates from near zero. If there is little slack, policy makers will want to raise rates soon to make sure the economy doesnâ€™t overheat and cause inflation to take off. But if there still are many people available for work if offered, officials can wait longer before lifting borrowing costs. The IMF paper suggests Fed officials can take their time . â€œLabor market slack remains, although it has closed considerably over the course of the recovery,â€? write Ravi Balakrishnan, Mai Dao, Juan SolÃ© and Jeremy Zook. â€œThis slack goes beyond that signaled by the unemployment rate, and takes account of the labor force participation rate being below trend and many employees working part time involuntarily.â€? The U.S. jobless rate was 5.5% in March, but a broader gauge of underemployment that includes workers who have part-time jobs but would like full-time work was 10.9%, the Labor Department reported. The labor force participation rateâ€”the share of adult civilians holding jobs or looking for workâ€”was 62.7% last month, matching its lowest level in 36 years. The paper finds that between a quarter and a third of the post-2007 decline in participation, will likely be reversed. However, the long-term decline, due in part to demographic factors such as an aging population, will eventually resume, the research suggests. The authors note another sign of slack in the number of workers who have been unemployed for more than six months, which has continued to decline but remains well above the prerecession level. The paper focuses on some of the main reasons many Fed officials want to keep interest rates very low for a while longer, to help spur economic growth and hiring. â€œLabor market slack remains and will only decline gradually, pointing to a still important role for stimulative macro-economic policies to help reach full employment,â€? the paper says. The Fed is likely to leave its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday at effectively zero after the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Its post-meeting statement will describe how officials view recent labor market developments.
