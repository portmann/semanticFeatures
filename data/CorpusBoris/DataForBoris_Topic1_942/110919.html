Fed’s Williams: U.S. Still on Track For 2015 Rate Rise - Real Time Economics - WSJ John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, shown here in March, said on Wednesday that despite financial crises in Greece and China, the Fed is on track to raise U.S. interest rates by the end of this year. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco PresidentÂ John Williams sounded a note of confidence on Wednesday that the U.S. economy won’t be derailed by ominous events in China and Greece. His remarks again indicated the U.S. central bank will raise rates this year. “Policy is data dependent,” Mr. Williams said. But given the positive outlook for the U.S., “I still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to raise rates poses its own risks,” he said. The official added that the easiest path is for the Fed to move rates up off near- zero levels before inflation goes over the central bank’s 2% price target, saying “I see a safer course in starting sooner and proceeding more gradually” with rate rises. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, called the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose by 0.2% in May from the same month a year ago. Mr. Williams’ comments came from a speech given in Los Angeles before the International Conference of Commercial Bank Economists. He is a voting member of the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. He spoke as the Fed released minutes from its mid-June policy meeting. That document showed some rising concern about overseas events. But more broadly, most Fed officials sill expect to raise rates this year. Much of what Mr. Williams had to say tracked a speech he gave on June 19, immediately in the wake of the FOMC meeting. He repeated that after a recent trip to Asia, he is confident that China has the tools to deal with imbalances in its economy. Mr. Williams didn’t comment on the the stock market tumult now roiling that nation, which is fueling fears that the trouble could spread to other markets. “China has shown that it has both the will and the leeway to take the necessary policy actions” to keep its economy on track. Mr. Williams said leaders there are realistic that growth rates of the past can’t be repeated and that sustainable growth rates are likely to be lower than the current 7% target. Speaking with reporters after the speech, Mr. Williams said China’s stock-market chaos could have an impact on global markets. But he said it was clear that market was due for some sort of correction, “so I don’t think this is a big issue for the U.S. economy.” Mr. Williams also said in his speech that he expects the U.S. to be able to withstand collateral damage from the unresolved situation in Greece, where that nation’s position in the European Union remains very much in doubt. “There are risks, but I see them as unlikely to overturn the otherwise strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy,” Mr. Williams said. He said foreign investor exposure to Greece is “relatively limited,” and “the European Central Bank appears to have the means and will to limit the financial fallout that could affect the rest of the euro area.” Broader market disruptions are a “unlikely tail risk,” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Williams repeated in his speech his optimism about the U.S. economy’s path. He said “our employment goal is in sight” and he expects the jobless rate to edge down from its current 5.3% level to around 5% by the close of 2015, moving even lower next year. He said wage gains are a sign the job market is “nearly healed.” Mr. Williams also said inflation, which has fallen short of the Fed’s 2% target for three years, is likely to tick higher and hit desired levels by the end of next year. But he added he’d like to see confirmation inflation is moving up before shifting the stance of Fed interest rate policy.
