Fed Forward Guidance: A Look Back  - Real Time Economics - WSJ After years of promising interest rates will stay low for a while, the Federal Reserve is likely to become a bit less predictable. Since late 2008, the Fed has used a variety of verbal expressionsâ€”a policy approach known as “ forward guidance “– to assure investors its benchmark short-term rate would probably stay near zero for some time. Never known for colorful language, the Fed used vague terms like â€œpatient,â€? â€œconsiderable timeâ€? and â€œextended period,â€? to describe how long it would likely hold rates very low. On some occasions officials gave more precise dates and economic markers to influence expectations. The hope was such pledges would cause the markets to hold long-term rates lower for longer, rather than nudge them higher in anticipation of a Fed rate increase. Now, as Fed officials discuss raising rates this year, they are preparing to drop such assurances. Instead, they would like to shift to terminology that gives them, in Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s words, the ability to mull rate rises on a “ meeting-by-meeting basis. ” The Fed is expected on Wednesday to drop its promise to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to start raising rates. Ms Yellen has said the term meant the central bank would not raise rates at the following two meetings. Scrapping it would open the door to a rate increase at the June policy meeting, which several Fed officials want to consider. Some economists think the Fed might say insteadâ€”as Ms. Yellen did in recent congressional testimonyâ€”the central bank wonâ€™tÂ raise rates until it is “ reasonably confident ” that inflation will move back toward its 2% target–an amorphous concept that gives the Fed more wiggle room. Here is a look back at the Fedâ€™s forward guidance in its various iterations since late 2008, as expressed in the Federal Open Market Committeeâ€™s postmeeting statements. Dec. 16, 2008: The Fed cuts its benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, to zero for the first time in the central bankâ€™s 100-year history, saying it expects that â€œweak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.â€? The commitment is repeated in January 2009 . March 18, 2009: The Fed starts saying it expects to hold the fed funds rate near zero “ for an extended period. ” Officials never said how long an â€œextended periodâ€? might be. Sept. 21, 2011: The Fed drops â€œextended period,â€? opting for specific calendar guidance. It expects to hold rates low â€œat least through mid-2013.â€? Jan. 25, 2012: The fed funds rate is likely to stay near zero â€œat least through late 2014.â€? Sept. 13, 2012: Officials now expect to hold the fund rate near zero â€œat least through mid-2015.” Â The Fed also says it expects to hold the rate very low â€œfor a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.â€? They repeat this language at the October meeting. Dec. 12, 2012: They keep the â€œconsiderable timeâ€? phrase, but link it to the duration of their third bond-buying program . They say they expect to hold the fed funds rate near zero for â€œa considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.â€? Since many officials are unhappy with the calendar-based guidance, they also stop saying they will hold rates super low through some specified date. Instead, they set numeric thresholds, saying theyâ€™ll keep rates low â€œat least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2%, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committeeâ€™s 2% longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.â€? March 20, 2014: The thresholds work for some time, but then officials run into a predicamentâ€”the jobless rate is falling much faster than they had forecast, bringing unemployment closer to 6.5% more quickly than anticipated. By February, ahead of the Fedâ€™s March 2014 meeting, the rate has fallen to 6.7%. So the Fed drops the thresholds and goes back to more qualitative guidance. In deciding how long to hold rates near zero, it â€œwill assess progressâ€”both realized and expectedâ€”toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation.â€? The Fed repeats it will wait to raise rates for â€œa considerable timeâ€? after the bond-buying ends. Ms. Yellen says at her Dec. 17, 2014: The Fed ends its bond-buying program in October, and in December replaces the â€œconsiderable timeâ€? languageÂ with a vow to be â€œpatientâ€? in raising interest rates. The Fed â€œcan be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.â€? Â The phrase is repeated in the January statement.
