Fed Officials Trim Back Estimates Of Interest Rate Rises Amid Big Forecast Changes  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve officials expect the path of future interest rate increases to be less aggressive compared to their projections from the end of last year, according to updated forecasts released Wednesday. The policymakers also weighed in on their expectations for the economy over the next few years. They cut their outlook for growth. On the jobs front, central bankers see bigger declines in the jobless rate, and project inflation to be weaker. They also believe the jobless rate can fall to a lower level without sparking price pressures. In the projections, a strong majority of Fed officials–15 out of 17–continue to predict the central bank will raise what are now near-zero short-term rates this year, while two predict the Fed will act next year. Officials see a reduced amount of rate increases this year. Their median estimate for the Fed’s short-term interest rate target at the end of the year now stands at 0.625%, versus the 1.125% level forecast at the end of December. The median projection for the fed funds target at the end of 2016 is 1.875%, while the longer run estimate of the fed funds target rate held steady to 3.750%. The Fed’s forecasts were released in conjunction with the announcement of the outcome of the two-day rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting. In that gathering, officials continued to prepare the way for interest rates increases. While the Fed left short-term interest rates unchanged at the rock-bottom levels they’ve rested at since the end of 2008, officials ended a commitment to be “patient” about the timing of future interest rate increases. Ahead of the Fed meeting, a number of officials noted that the door to rate rises opens with the Fed’s mid-June meeting. The Fed’s forecasts arrive as the economy enjoyed a solid year in 2014, and a less certain start to 2015. While job gains have been and are widely expected to remain strong, growth data over the start of the year has been less steady, raising some questions about what will be seen over the remainder of the year. Inflation continues to be significantly softer than Fed officials would like to see, and is being pulled down by the sharp drop in oil prices. The forecasts are derived from submissions of the Washington-based governors and the leaders of the 12 regional banks. The forecasts from the Dallas and Philadelphia banks were submitted by represenatives from those banks. Dallas leader Richard Fisher retires on Thursday and is not attending the FOMC meeting, while Philadelphia’s former chief Charles Plosser stepped down at the start of the month. The Fed’s central tendency for growth-it strips out high and low forecasts submitted by Fed officials-came in at 2.3% to 2.7% for this year, versus the 2.6% to 3% range projected in December. For 2016, Fed officials see growth at 2.3% to 2.7%, with the long-run potential estimated at 2% to 2.3%, unchanged from December’s forecast. Fed officials remain upbeat on the jobs market. They see what is currently a 5.5% jobless rate coming in between 5% and 5.2% this year, from December’s projection of 5.2% to 5.3% for this year. Next year, officials see the jobless rate between 4.9% and 5.1%. In a notable change, the estimate of the longer run jobless rate was lowered to 5% to 5.2% from 5.2% to 5.5%. On the prices front, officials still see slow progress in getting inflation back up to their official 2% target. Policymakers project the personal consumption expenditures price index to come in between 0.6% and 0.8% this year, compared with the 1% to 1.6% forecast from December. In 2016, the Fed sees inflation at 1.7% to 1.9%.
