It's Not What The Fed Will Do, It's What It Will Say - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Recently, many Fed members have highlighted the improvement in the US economy over the last few months, increasing the possibilities of a rate hike as soon as in September. Following Ms. Yellen's speech at Jackson Hole, the possibilities of a rate hike in September jumped to 42%, but declined afterward to 20% on September 15th. We agree with the consensus view that the Fed could remain on hold the next few weeks. However, we think that the Fed fund futures are underestimating the probabilities of a rate hike before year-end. We think that Fed members could revise down their projection for the Fed funds rate at 2016-end from 0.9% to 0.75% and for 2017 from 1.6% to below 1.5%. The Federal Reserve could decide to raise the Fed funds rate to 0.5/0.75% from 0.25%/0.5% at the end of next week's FOMC monetary policy meeting (September 20-21st). It would be the first rate hike since December '15. Indeed, recently many Fed members have highlighted the positive trend in the US economy, increasing the possibilities of a rate hike as soon as in September. Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech at the Jackson Hole monetary policy symposium on August 26th was a clear example. Yellen explained that "in light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the Federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months." According to Bloomberg's calculations based on the Fed funds futures rate, the possibilities of a 25bp rate hike in September jumped to 42% following Ms. Yellen's speech on August 26, but declined afterward to 20% on September 15. The possibilities of a rate hike in December are now 50%, down from 65% on August 26. Weaker-than-expected economic data released over the last few weeks was the main reason for the downward trend in expectations. The main source of concern was the significant drop in the ISM confidence indices in August. 1) The ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 for the first time since February. A value below 50 is considered a signal of recession for the manufacturing sector in the following 2-3 months. 2) The ISM non-manufacturing index declined from 55.5 to 51.4, the lowest level since 2010. The decline of these indices was a sign that US economic activity could lose momentum in late 2016. The data released Thursday confirmed that US economic activity has softened during the summer: retail sales declined by 0.3% m/m in August (-0.1% m/m ex-auto and -0.1% ex-auto & gas), and the Empire manufacturing index - the first business confidence index for September - remained in contractive territory despite rebounding from -4.2 to -1.99. While we agree with the consensus view that the Fed could remain on hold the next few weeks due to the latest economic data, we think that Fed funds futures are underestimating the probabilities of a rate hike before year-end. Indeed, the Fed could see the stabilization of the unemployment rate below 5% and the CPI core above 2%; signs that a further normalization of the ultra-expansionary monetary policy implemented following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy are needed. The strong rally of the S&P 500 and the decline of government bond yields during the summer could also favor a rate hike. For this reason, while our base scenario is for the Fed to raise rates in December, we would not be surprised to see a rate hike next week. Monetary policy is still expansive according to all the main Fed funds rate rules. According to the Taylor rule, Fed funds rate should be at 3.5%, while according to our modified Taylor model, it should be at 1.5%. In this scenario, the economic projections of the Fed's board members and Yellen's press conference will take center stage. With economic activity softening, we think the GDP estimate for 2016 could be revised downward from the 2% projected in June to 1.8% (consensus estimate is 1.5%) while 2017 and 2018 estimates could remain unchanged at 2%. We do not expect any change for the projections on unemployment rate (4.7% in 2016 and 4.6% in 2017 and 2018) and PCE (1.4%, 1.9% and 2% in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively). More importantly, we think that Fed members could revise down their projections for the Fed funds rate at 2016-end from 0.9% to 0.75% and for 2017 from 1.6% to below 1.5%. This is to avoid repeating the mistake it did at 2015-end when aggressive Fed funds projections caused a steep decline in the equity market. During the press conference, Chairwoman Yellen should also confirm that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very modest pace. If our estimates are correct, the financial market's reaction could be muted. Otherwise, a repeat of the January decline could be in sight.
