5 Things to Watch for in the Fed Minutes - WSJ The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its Jan. 26-27 meeting, but offered no clear signal about the likely path for rates in coming months. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in two days of congressional testimony, cited several risks to the U.S. economy that could cause the Fed to hold rates steady for now, but stressed repeatedly that monetary policy was not on a â€œpreset course.â€? The minutes of the Fed meeting last month, set for release Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST, could provide new details of the Fedâ€™s internal deliberations. Here are five things to watch for. The most notable change in the Fedâ€™s January statement was its decision to not assess the balance of risks to the U.S. economy, after saying in December they were balanced. Usually, Fed officials state whether they believe the economy is more likely to perform above or below expectationsâ€”known as â€œupsideâ€? or â€œdownsideâ€? risk in central bank jargon. In January, they punted, saying simply they were â€œclosely monitoringâ€? developments. That suggests there was great uncertainty among them about the economic outlook . The minutes could shed light on the internal debate. By last December, it appeared the August bout of global market turmoil had eased, prompting Ms. Yellen to declare that, â€œ downside risks from abroad have lessened since late summer.â€?Â When Ms. Yellen testified before Congress last week, her tone had changed. â€œForeign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth ,â€? she warned.Â Will this latest flare-up die down, as it did in the fall? Or are we in for something potentially more serious? The minutes couldÂ tell usÂ Fed officialsâ€™ take. When the Fed raised interest rates in December, officials suggested they were leaning towardÂ  four rate increases of a quarter percentage point each through 2016. Economists and traders now see it more likely the Fed will raise rates less if at all this year. While the minutes will likely not explicitly tell us whenâ€”or ifâ€”the Fed will next raise rates, they might reveal which way Fed policy makers were leaning. As it does at the start of every year, the Fed in January released a separate statement on its longer-run goals and policy strategy. This year, the statement pointedly called the central bankâ€™s 2% inflation target a â€œsymmetricâ€? goal, meaning it doesnâ€™t want inflation much above or below that level. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard voted against the goals statement because the new language â€œis not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.â€? The minutes could give us some insight into the internal debate behind the revision. Two days after the Fedâ€™s January meeting, the Bank of Japan surprised Â the world by dropping interest rates into negative territory. Then last week, Swedenâ€™s Riksbankâ€™s moved further Â into negative territory, lowering its main interest rate to minus 0.5%. Since then, negative rates have been a hot topic in monetary circles. Ms. Yellen, facing a barrage of questions on the topic last week, told lawmakers the Fed was â€œ taking a look at them .â€?Â The minutes will show whether Fed officials had any interest in discussing the option last month. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
