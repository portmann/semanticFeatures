Chicago Fed Says Natural Jobless Rate At Or Under 5%, Will Fall Further Over Time - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORKâ€”Economists at the Chicago Fed argue in a new paper the U.S. economy remains even farther from a truly hot labor market than many central bankers think. The economyâ€™s so-called natural unemployment rate likely lies at or below 5%, and it will go even lower over time, the analysts say in a note published Monday. The natural rateâ€”sometimes called the full-employment rate or the long-term rateâ€”is the lowest level of unemployment that does not generate higher inflation. It is hard to determine and changes over time, vexing Federal Reserve officials who are considering it as they debate when to raise short-term interest rates from near zero. The Chicago Fedâ€™s analysis contrasts with the collective view of Fed officials, who estimate the long-run unemployment rate ranges between 5% and 5.2%. The national jobless rate was 5.4% in April. All this matters greatly to the Fed because of the implications for interest rates. Many policy makers say they want to raise interest rates before hitting the full employment rate, all else being equal, to keep price pressures from accelerating too quickly. So if their estimated range is right, they should start lifting rates pretty soon. But if the full-employment rate is lower, say closer to 5%, they can afford to wait a bit longer. The problem is, divining the natural rate is tricky. Doing so relies in part in unmeasurable things like the economyâ€™s potential growth rate, which depends in part on demographic trends and labor market patterns. The Chicago Fed paper says â€œsignificant labor market slack remainsâ€? in the U.S. despite a rapid decline in the unemployment rate. That means there are lots of people available to work or work longer hours if they got the chance, such as folks who are working part time involuntarily or who have stopped looking for work because they got discouraged in the past. This points to a natural rate of 5% or lower, the authors said in the research note. The analysts said key evidence for their conclusion is the recent modest pace of U.S. wage gains. The natural jobless rate is likely to fall even further, they say. â€œDemographic and other changes should continue to lower the natural rate for at least the remainder of the decade,â€? and push it down to 4.4% to 4.8% by 2020. The findings of the Chicago Fed paper help bolster the case made by the bankâ€™s president, Charles Evans, that raising interest rates is something that should not happen soon. While most Fed officials expect to start boosting borrowing costs this year, Mr. Evans has said the central bank should hold off until 2016. With inflation so far under the Fedâ€™s 2% target, he sees no urgency to act, and worries moving too soon will make it harder to get back up to that goal. The Chicago Fed paper provides additional evidence for those who say the Fedâ€™s benchmark short-term interest rate could be left at a lower level than its historical norm for a long time to come. And if short-term rates are lower on average in the future, the Fed would have less room to lower interest rates when the next round of economic trouble arrives, which in turn would increase the odds of having to resort to controversial stimulus programs like long-term bond buying in a crisis.
