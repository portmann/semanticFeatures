Parsing Bank of Japanâ€™s New Price Patience: Fresh Easing Delayed? - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda leaves a news conference at BOJ headquarters in April. The central bank’s march toward its inflation goal will take longer than expected, the bank indicated Thursday. Given the ongoing weakness in Japanese growth and inflation , most Bank of Japan watchers believe the prospect of added stimulus by the central bank is a question of when rather than if. But many analysts are now pushing back their forecasts for when the trigger will be pulled, following the central bank’s extension of its self-imposed deadline for hitting its inflation target. “The change in the wording on the timing of 2% inflation suggests reduced urgency,” wrote Izumi Devalier, an economist with HSBC Global Research. “We still think further BOJ easing is in the cards,” Devalier added, but she now sees it closer to the end of this year, instead of her prior expectation of a summer move. Because the BOJ “pushed out the timeline” of its goal, “we are also pushing out the timing of the BOJ’s additional easing by six months,” wrote Masaaki Kanno of J.P. Morgan . He now expects a move in January at the earliest, compared with his previous view that the bank would choose July for another round of “qualitative and quantitative easing”–the label adopted by the BOJ in April 2013 for its radical campaign to break deflation. Some forecasters wereÂ braced for a third round of QQE as soon as this week, when policy makers met Thursday to review their semi-annual price and growth forecasts. BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda unleashed QQE2 last October, when his board was forced to lower its forecasts at a similar meeting. The sharp drop in expectations for inflation at the time prompted him to expand his program to shore up the outlook. This week, once again, the central bank’s forecasters were marking down their estimates, driven by still-soft oil prices and consumption. But instead of adding fresh firepower to try and counter the trend, they said they were now aiming to hit 2% inflation by Sept. 2016, later than their previous pledge to hit the target by next March. “We see a risk that the BOJ’s unexpected shift to a later timeframe for achieving 2% inflation may push back additional monetary easing from our baseline scenario” of July, wrote Goldman Sachs Japan economist Naohiko Baba. New uncertainty about BOJ easing comes as questions have also emerged about the timing of the next policy move by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The American central bank is steering in the opposite direction, mulling when to tighten monetary conditions with higher interest rates, as the U.S. economy seems to be heading into a robust expansion. At the beginning of the year, many Fed watchers were betting on a June increase. But a spate of soft U.S. data has pushed back expectations to September or later . One common thread connecting monetary policy across the Pacific is the dollar-yen exchange rate. Expectations of easing in Japan tend to weaken the yen against the dollar, especially when combined with anticipation of Fed tightening. But dollar strength that hurts exporters was cited as a factor in the recent U.S. slowdown, which in turn undermines growth prospects for Japan in its biggest overseas market. Many Japanese consumers have also complained that a weaker yen has pinched them by pushing up costs of imported goods, raising the political risks of fresh central bank stimulus. Still, many traders remain wary about reading too much into Mr. Kuroda’s professions of newfound patience. A year ago, many forecasters were betting on extra BOJ action, especially as evidence mounted that the April 2014 sales tax increase did more damage to the economy than anticipated. But a steady stream of optimistic public statements by Mr. Kuroda and colleagues managed to quell such expectations. The BOJ then struck with QQE2, and the surprise effect triggered a particularly sharp drop in the yen and big jump in the Nikkei Stock Average. Officials later said they felt the element of surprise would magnify the effectiveness of their actions.
