(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) In addition to keeping tabs on Greece’s debt talks and implementing a â‚¬60 billion-a-month quantitative easing program , the European Central Bank president has been writing lots of letters to European parliamentarians. The ECB released nine such letters on Friday, which are responses by the ECB head to questions posed to him by members of European parliament. The topics run the gamut from the ECB’s QE program to electronic money ,Â  Cypriot banks , non- performing loans Â and even the ECB’s new skyscraper headquarters .Â Mr. Draghi doesn’t break much new ground in his letters, but they do show his latest thinking on monetary policy and other matters. In a letter to parliamentarian Ramon Tremosa i Balcells dated May 7, Mr. Draghi said the ECB’s â‚¬60 billion-a-month bond program is “proceeding smoothly” and in line with the ECB’s target. “Concerns about the scarcity of bonds are therefore not warranted at this juncture,” Mr. Draghi wrote, adding, “while there is no reason to change the composition of the purchases at the moment, the programme is sufficiently flexible to be adjusted should circumstances change.” With the ECB’s last interest rate cuts in September, rates “reached their effective lower bound,” Mr. Draghi wrote to parliamentarian JonÃ¡s FernÃ¡ndez , and further easing has been done mainly through the asset-purchase program. “These measures are effective in easing the monetary policy stance, as witnessed by the considerable easing of financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private sector over the past months, and notable improvements in borrowing conditions for firms and households, with a pick-up in the demand for credit,” Mr. Draghi wrote. Mr. Draghi also addressed the ECB’s emergency liquidity assistance program, or ELA. Through this program, Greek banks that are unable to borrow from the ECB’s regular lending facilities can access loans from the Greek central bank, which carry a higher interest rate. The full ECB governing council can restrict or deny ELA loans with a two-thirds majority. The ECB on Wednesday approved a â‚¬2 billion increase in Greek ELA to â‚¬78.9 billion. “The Governing Council carefully assesses the features of the transactions, their liquidity effects and whether it would be appropriate to impose specific conditions in order to protect the integrity of the ECBâ€™s monetary policy,” Mr. Draghi wrote to Dimitrios Papadimoulis . In a letter to “Members of the European Parliament,” Mr. Draghi wrote Â that he wouldn’t “speculate on the scenario described in your letter” without going into detail on what that speculation was. He did add: “Let me stress that the irrevocability of the euro has been part of the EU framework since the Treaty of Maastricht.” “As I have stated repeatedly, including before European Parliament, the withdrawal of a Member State from the euro area is not foreseen in the Treaties,” he wrote.
