Grand Central: Add Treasury Market Volatility To List of Known Unknowns  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Eurozone Leaders Reach Unanimous Agreement on Greece Beijing Faces New Challenges After Stock-Market Rout Financial regulators are putting out a report Monday about unusual behavior in the $13 trillion U.S. Treasury bond market. As my colleague Katy Burne explains in a WSJ story today, trading in the market has grown thin and prone to unpredictable lurches in bond yields. It has regulators worried, because it could lead to volatility that hurts the economy and markets when the Fed starts raising interest rates. Treasury market gyrations on October 15 have gotten a great deal of attention and will be the focus of the report. But as Fed Governor Lael Brainard noted in a recent speech , it wasnâ€™t an isolated event. Late on March 18, the day of a Fed policy meeting, the U.S. dollar depreciated against the euro by 1.75% in less than three minutes, a large drop in a short interval. A few weeks later, German bunds yields swung wildly at a time of little market news. And before all that there was the â€œtaper tantrumâ€? of 2013 when U.S. Treasury yields shot up as the Fed considered ending its bond-buying program. The regulators themselves might be a cause of the problem. New rules on capital and liquidity for banks have made them reluctant to hold much bond inventory and play aggressively as middlemen in the market, making it less liquid and harder to clear very big trades by investors. So will the report shoulder the blame for this new market risk? Donâ€™t count on it. â€œReductions in broker-dealer inventories occurred prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, suggesting that factors other than regulation may also be contributing,â€? Ms. Brainard said. Instead, they seem likely to file this under the category of what former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once called â€œknown unknowns,â€? problems they know are lurking, but donâ€™t know how to explain, fix or predict. Eurozone Leaders Reach Unanimous Agreement on Greece.Â Eurozone leaders said Monday morning that they would give Greece up to â‚¬86 billion ($96 billion) in fresh bailout loans as long as the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras manages to implement a round of punishing austerity measures in the coming days . Greek, Chinese and Puerto Rican Crises All Fall Short of Going Global. Â As economic turmoil erupted on three continents in recent weeks, a familiar ingredient from past crises was notably absent : panic.Â  In Europe, Greece veered dangerously close to exiting the euro after defaulting on debt. In China, a historic stock bubble appears to be deflating. In North America, Puerto Rico threatens one of the biggest government defaults in U.S. history.Â  But the rest of the world has experienced little of contagion that followed the deepening U.S. mortgage crisis in the fall of 2008 and subsequent Greek debt crises. Yet other kinds of contagion — political and economic — still threaten. Yellen: Fed Still on Track Despite Turmoil. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reaffirmed the central bankâ€™s plan to start raising short-term U.S. interest rates later this year and pointed to tentative signs that wages are on the rise as slack gets reduced in the labor market. Her comments were the first from the Fed leader since a series of international events — including default in Greece and a stock market tumble in China — raised doubts in financial markets about whether the Fed would stick to its plan to raise rates this year. Five Quotes From Janet Yellenâ€™s Speech on the U.S. Economy Rosengren Still Eyes 2015 Rate Increases. Boston FedÂ PresidentÂ Eric RosengrenÂ said Friday the U.S. central bank needs to keep a close eye on overseas events to make sure they donâ€™t upend the American economy and get in the way of raising short-term interest rates later in the year. But amid fast-moving events in Greece and elsewhere, Fed officials need to make sure trouble abroad isnâ€™t changing the outlook for the U.S. before acting, he said. Inflation Is Low, but U.S. Consumers Still Feel a Pinch. Â Fed officials often note their concern about low U.S. inflation. That lament may surprise consumers who are paying more every year for cable services, car insurance and dental check-ups.Â Chalk it up to a divide between goods and services . Concern About Trading of U.S. Treasurys Prompts Review by Regulators. Â U.S. regulators have become increasingly concerned in recent months about unstable trading in the $12.6 trillion U.S. Treasury market, where investors turn for safe-haven securities and set interest rates that are a benchmark for much of the rest of the global financial system. Beijing Faces New Challenges After Stock-Market Rout.Â Chinaâ€™s stock-market crisis promises long-lasting political and economic fallout , according to investors, executives, analysts and diplomats, after days of government intervention intended to prop up share prices. Uganda Raises Key Lending Rate. Â Ugandaâ€™s central bank raised its key lending rate on Monday to dampen inflationary pressures resulting from the huge slide in the local shilling in recent weeks. U.K. Aims to Boost Productivity. The U.K. government announced a package of measures Friday aimed at boosting British productivity, a critical yardstick of an economyâ€™s health that lags behind other large Western economies and hasnâ€™t improved in eight years. A centerpiece of the package was aimed atÂ encouraging more buildingÂ by overhauling planning regulation, which the government says is a key impediment to productivity growth. Booms and Busts Are Typical for Shanghai, Shenzhen shares. Even as Chinaâ€™s stock markets rebound after a brutal selloff, they are behaving like no other markets in the world. Taken together, Chinaâ€™s two stock markets rank second in the world in market capitalization behind the New York Stock Exchange, and in the top 10 in terms of number of listed companies. Despite their size, Chinaâ€™s markets trade like the wildest emerging markets with huge volatility, big boom and bust cycles driven by fast-trading individual investors and heavy involvement from the government.Â  -0915 GMT BOE Carney and MPVC colleagues appear before Treasury Committee -1145 GMT BOE Carney and FPC colleagues appear before Treasury Committee -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Commerce Department releases retail-sales data for June -Bank of Japan releases a policy statement -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Labor Department releases producer-price index for June -9:15 a.m. EDT: Fed releases U.S. industrial-production data for June -10 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Yellen testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington -10 a.m. EDT: Bank of Canada releases a policy statement -11:15 a.m. EDT: BOCâ€™sÂ PolozÂ speaks at a press conference in Ottawa -12:25 p.m. EDT: Cleveland Fedâ€™sÂ MesterÂ speaks in Columbus, Ohio -2 p.m. EDT: Fed releases Beige Book report -3 p.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on the economic outlook in Mesa, Ariz. -0900 GMT Eurozone final June inflation and May trade -1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT): European Central Bank releases a policy statement -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Labor Department releases consumer-price index for June -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Commerce Department releases housing starts and permits data for June Banking After the Crisis. The Cleveland Fedâ€™s Kristle Cortes and Sara Millington assess the recovery of the financial system, six years after the end of the recession. While the picture is brighter, there are some worrisome trends, they find. â€œIncreases in loans and profits both point to healthier banks, but the increase in loan-loss provisions could mean that banks fear the prospect of increased loan defaults or that they are responding to losses they are already experiencing,â€? they write. â€œThe mixed signals from financial institutions may indicate that banks are continuing to recover slowly while trying to provide support for future growth in the industry.â€? The Role of the ECB. James McBride and Christopher Alessi analyze the role of the ECB in the ongoing Greek talks for the Council on Foreign Relations. They find that the central bank has been drawn into the political fray by the talks. â€œThough the ECB is an avowedly nonpolitical institution, Greece’s reliance on ELA gave the bank an unavoidable role in the fraught negotiations over a new Greek bailoutâ€¦It capped ELA, forcing Greece toÂ impose capital controls, but it has not halted its supportâ€”leaving its role in resolving the continent’s persistent debt crises both larger and more uncertain than ever.â€? Modernizing the IMF. Harold James and Domenico Lombardi argue on Project Syndicate that the International Monetary Fund should add Chinaâ€™s currency to its Special Drawing Rights basket. â€œThe SDR can be of real value, serving as a stable reference unit at a time of increasing exchange-rate volatility,â€? they write. â€œOf course, if the SDR is to assume this role, it must be used more widely. Most importantly, it should be traded privately and used as a basis for private credit. Under these circumstances, however, the SDR basket would need to be more comprehensive, including the currencies of large emerging economies, beginning with China.â€? Working Americans.
