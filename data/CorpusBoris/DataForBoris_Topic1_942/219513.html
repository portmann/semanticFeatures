Redacted Version of the October 2015 FOMC Statement | The Aleph Blog David Merkel is an investment professional, and like every investment professional, he makes mistakes. David encourages you to do your own independent "due diligence" on any idea that he talks about, because he could be wrong. Nothing written here, at RealMoney, Wall Street All-Stars, or anywhere else David may write is an invitation to buy or sell any particular security; at most, David is handing out educated guesses as to what the markets may do. David is fond of saying, "The markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you," and so he encourages caution in investing. Risk control wins the game in the long run, not bold moves. Even the best strategies of the past fail, sometimes spectacularly, when you least expect it. David is not immune to that, so please understand that any past success of his will be probably be followed by failures. Also, though David runs Aleph Investments, LLC, this blog is not a part of that business. This blog exists to educate investors, and give something back. It is not intended as advertisement for Aleph Investments; David is not soliciting business through it. When David, or a client of David's has an interest in a security mentioned, full disclosure will be given, as has been past practice for all that David does on the web. Disclosure is the breakfast of champions. Additionally, David may occasionally write about accounting, actuarial, insurance, and tax topics, but nothing written here, at RealMoney, or anywhere else is meant to be formal "advice" in those areas. Consult a reputable professional in those areas to get personal, tailored advice that meets the specialized needs that David can have no knowledge of. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Shows less certainty about current GDP. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady. Nonetheless, labor market indicators, on balance, show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. Shades labor employment down a little. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. No change.Â  TIPS are showing lower inflation expectations since the last meeting. 5y forward 5y inflation implied from TIPS is near 1.79%, down 0.11% from September. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. No change. Any time they mention the â€œstatutory mandate,â€? it is to excuse bad policy. Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. Well, that sentence lasted for one meeting.Â  Would that more got chopped out of the statement. Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.

The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. CPI is at +0.0% now, yoy .Â  States that they have a global view of what they need to watch.Â  Good luck with that. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress–both realized and expected–toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Gives the impression that a change might be coming at the next meeting, but the way the FOMC thinks about monetary policy is currently scattered, to say the least. I wouldnâ€™t make too much of this change.Â  The FOMC is big on their newfound flexibility, and isnâ€™t going to be very predictable for some time. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.

No rules, just guesswork from academics and bureaucrats with bad theories on economics. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

No change.Â  Changing that would be a cheap way to effect a tightening. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer; Dennis P. Lockhart; Jerome H. Powell; Daniel K. Tarullo; and John C. Williams. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L.

We need some people in the Fed and in the government who realize that balance sheets matter â€“ for households, corporations, governments, and central banks.Â  Remove anyone who is a neoclassical economist â€“ they missed the last crisis; they will miss the next one. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. This FOMC statement was yet another great big nothing. Only notable changes were shading household spending up, and employment and GDP down. Donâ€™t expect tightening in December. People should conclude that the FOMC has no idea of when the FOMC will tighten policy, if ever.Â  The FOMC says that any future change to policy is contingent on almost everything. On the new phrase, â€œwhether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting,â€? I would not make much of it. It gives the impression that a change might be coming at the next meeting, but the way the FOMC thinks about monetary policy is currently scattered, to say the least.Â  I wouldnâ€™t make too much of this change.Â  The FOMC is big on their newfound flexibility, and isnâ€™t going to be very predictable for some time. Despite lower unemployment levels, labor market conditions are still pretty punk. Much of the unemployment rate improvement comes more from discouraged workers, and part-time workers.Â  Wage growth is weak also. Equities fall and bonds rise. Commodity prices fall and the dollar rises.Â  This is a sign that the markets anticipate more economic weakness. The FOMC says that any future change to policy is contingent on almost everything. Donâ€™t know they keep an optimistic view of GDP growth, especially amid falling monetary velocity. The key variables on Fed Policy are capacity utilization, labor market indicators, inflation trends, and inflation expectations. As a result, the FOMC ainâ€™t moving rates up, absent improvement in labor market indicators, much higher inflation, or a US Dollar crisis. We have a congress of doves for 2015 on the FOMC. Things will continue to be boring as far as dissents go.Â  We need some people in the Fed and in the government who realize that balance sheets matter â€“ for households, corporations, governments, and central banks.Â  Remove anyone who is a neoclassical economist â€“ they missed the last crisis; they will miss the next one. David J. Merkel, CFA, FSA, is a leading commentator at the excellent investment website RealMoney.com .  Back in 2003, after several years of correspondence, James Cramer invited David to write for the site, and write he does — on equity and bond portfolio management, macroeconomics, derivatives, quantitative strategies, insurance issues, corporate governance, and more.  His specialty is looking at the interlinkages in the markets in order to understand individual markets better. David is also presently a senior investment analyst at Hovde Capital, responsible for analysis and valuation of investment opportunities for the FIP funds, particularly of companies in the insurance industry.  He also manages the internal profit sharing and charitable endowment monies of the firm. Prior to joining Hovde in 2003, Merkel managed corporate bonds for Dwight Asset Management. In 1998, he joined the Mount Washington Investment Group as the Mortgage Bond and Asset Liability manager after working with Provident Mutual, AIG and Pacific Standard Life. His background as a life actuary has given David a different perspective on investing.  How do you earn money without taking undue risk?  How do you convey ideas about investing while showing a proper level of uncertainty on the likelihood of success?  How do the various markets fit together, telling us us a broader story than any single piece?  These are the themes that David will deal with in this blog. Merkel holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Johns Hopkins University.  In his spare time, he takes care of his eight children with his wonderful wife Ruth. View all posts by David Merkel ?
