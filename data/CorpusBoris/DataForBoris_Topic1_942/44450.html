Grand Central: Bank of Japan Moves Goalposts, Keeps Playbook — For Now - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Japan Stands Pat as Inflation Weakens Faced with a sharp drop in the inflation outlook six months ago, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda stunned global financial markets — and officials inside the central bank — by expanding his already-massive stimulus program. As the BOJ unveiled Thursday its new semi-annual forecast, policymakers were once again forced to mark down their official inflation projection, and to push back further the date when they hope to hit their 2% target. But this time, officials passed up a chance to pump still more money into the Japanese economy, adding a new humility to their once-cocky campaign to end deflation. The main headline from the one-day meeting: the central bank now says it expects to hit the inflation target “around the first half of fiscal 2016,” which starts in April 2016 — and only if oil prices rise. That’s later than the previous goal of “in or around fiscal 2015.” Translated into plain English, that means the original April 2013 pledge of hitting 2% inflation in two years has now slipped from three years to three and a half years — or longer. For the just-ended fiscal year and the current one, the BOJ now expects its chief inflation gauge to hit just 0.8%, less than halfway toward the target. One board member sees inflation this year of just 0.2%, or barely out of deflation. The ever-upbeat Mr. Kuroda says the shortfall between pledge and reality is largely the result of oil, and that the broader framework for a growth and price recovery remains in place. And yet he conceded during his press conference that unexpectedly weak consumption has also damped price pressures.Â  The BOJ now estimates GDP shrank by 0.9% for the year ended March, about twice as bad as forecast just three months earlier. Why didn’t the BOJ add more stimulus? Mr. Kuroda simply said he didn’t see the need, and he wouldn’t hesitate to do more if he felt inflation was slipping off track. But there are also signs of spreading doubts about the effectiveness of further action, at least for now. Three of the nine board members openly doubted Mr. Kuroda’s ability to hit his target under even the new, delayed timetable. One cloud hanging over Japan’s forecast is new weakness in the U.S.Â  That’s in part the result of the strong dollar — the flipside of a yen weakened by BOJ easing. Most BOJ watchers still think it’s only a matter of time before Mr. Kuroda once more tries to expand the central bank’s stimulus. But he’ll probably want to make sure he has a board majority behind him. Last October’s easing passed by a narrow 5 to 4 vote. The term for one of those dissenters expires in June, and he will be replaced in the July meeting by a new member assumed to be more sympathetic to Mr. Kuroda’s cause. Slowing Growth is Giving the Fed Pause. The economyâ€™s sharp first-quarter slowdown is giving Federal Reserve officials pause. The nationâ€™s central bank pointed to cooling economic activity and reduced job-market gains in its policy statement Wednesday, underscoring uncertainty among officials about when the economy will rebound and clouding the timing of when they will begin to raise interest rates. Earlier in 2015, many officials thought a midyear rate increase was possible. Now it looks highly unlikely . - A Rare Win for Economic Forecasting : The Atlanta Fed Almost Nails Its First-Quarter Growth Estimate. Fed Tests Press Teleconference.

The Homeownership Rate Is Now the Lowest Since 1989, But Thereâ€™s a Silver Lining. The U.S. homeownership rate continued to decline in the first quarter of 2015, hitting 63.8%, its lowest level since 1989. But economists saw a silver lining in that number. For the second consecutive quarter, the number of total households â€“ renters and owners â€“ jumped significantly. Because many of those new households are renting, that can drive down the homeownership rate as a percentage of total households, while providing a glimmer of hope in the long term because eventually, those renters will likely buy homes . -8:30 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Tarullo speaks in Washington about tailoring community bank regulation and supervision -Bank of Mexico releases a policy statement.
