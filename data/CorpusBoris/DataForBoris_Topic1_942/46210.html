Mester says June 'on the table' for possible Fed rate hike | Reuters Cleveland Federal Reserve President and CEO Loretta Mester gives her keynote address at the 2014 Financial Stability Conference in Washington December 5, 2014. PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is getting close to the appropriate time to raise interest rates and all scheduled policy meetings, including one in June, are "on the table" for a move, a top Fed official said on Friday. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who in the past has urged a rate hike before mid-year, told reporters that the decision will hinge on incoming economic data and, in particular, on employment reports for the months of April and May. The U.S. economy's weak winter performance, including near-zero GDP growth, has pushed back market expectations for a policy tightening to September or December, when key Fed meetings are also planned. Yet the Fed has telegraphed a rate hike this year, and inflation and employment are not too far from targets. Mester said most of the weakness was "transitory." "All meetings are on the table ... I'm going into each meeting with an assessment of the data that has come in," she said after a speech on consumer credit at the Philadelphia Fed, where in the past she ran the research department. "There are a whole bunch of data releases that will come out between now and June. But to me the employment reports will be indicative of a lot," Mester said. Inflation data released Thursday, including a report showing solid wage gains in the first quarter, "show things are coming back a little bit," added Mester, who does not vote on policy until next year under a rotation. She was the first Fed official to speak publicly about policy after the Federal Open Market Committee closed a meeting Wednesday with a statement highlighting the first-quarter weakness but also paving the way to a rate hike at any point. Asked about the statement, Mester said it did not reflect decreasing confidence that inflation will rebound to a 2 percent target. "We're getting close to the point where it will be time to lift off," she said of the coming hike.
