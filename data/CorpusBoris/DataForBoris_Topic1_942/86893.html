Grand Central: For Clues on Number of 2015 Rate Hikes, Watch the Fedâ€™s Dots  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Russia Cuts Key Rate To 11.5% The Federal Reserveâ€™s policy meeting this week isnâ€™t expected to result in an interest rate increase, but it will provide important clues about how many times officials expect to move before the year is over. At the Fedâ€™s March policy meeting, seven officials, representing the median of estimates, put the target federal funds rate at 0.675% by year-end. The estimates meant that the center of the Fedâ€™s 17-member policy making committee foresaw the central bank raising interest rates two times in quarter percentage point increments before the year was over from 0.13% presently. Wall Street analysts are now watching to see whether any in this core seven shifts down to projecting just one increase this year. Disappointing first half growth appears to have put a first move off until September and spurred talk in markets that officials might just move once and then see how the economy responds. â€œWe think the ranks of these less-than-two hikers will grow,â€? J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli said in a research note Friday. In March, just one Fed official projected only one rate increase this year to 0.375%. Two projected no increase at all. Seven officials in March saw a more aggressive path of more than two rate increases, including one official who saw the fed funds rate reaching 1.675% by year end. The ranks of officials projecting a more aggressive path will presumably shrink as well if the Fed gets through the June meeting with no action, as expected. The shifting of these projections in the Fedâ€™s famous â€œdot plotâ€? may in the end say more about where the Fed is going next than anything in the central bankâ€™s official policy statement Wednesday or the press conference by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen that follows. Fed Hones Tricky Message as It Nears Boosting Rates. Â Federal Reserve officials face a communications challenge as they tiptoe toward raising short-term interest rates later this year. They want to reassure investors and the broader public that rate increases, when they come, are likely to be gradual and not jarring. At the same time, they want to avoid making promises , as in the past, about where rates are going. Fed Officials Cheat Sheet. Federal Reserve officials heading into this weekâ€™s policy meeting have recently offered nuanced guidance about the outlook for interest rates. Theyâ€™ve made clear they wonâ€™t raise their benchmark short-term rate from near zero this week, and many indicated they still expect to move some time this year. But they havenâ€™t provided much guidance on when exactly that first rate increase is likely to occur, other than to say it will depend on the economyâ€™s health. Their recent comments reflect a modestly more optimistic view than at their April meeting, when many were troubled by the economyâ€™s dreadful start the year and uncertain about whether it would give way to a decent rebound.

Chris Kent insisted “monetary policy is working.” Bank of Russia Cuts Key Rate To 11.5%. The Bank of Russia cut interest rates Monday for the fourth time this year to counter an Â economic contraction, but the bank said that the scope for more monetary easing is limited by inflationary risks. The central bank cut its key rate by one percentage point to 11.5%. The rate move was priced in by the market after central bank officials pledged to lower the cost of borrowing. Still, after four cuts so far this year, the key rate is above the level of 10.5% seen in early December, 2014 before an emergency hike to 17% that helped to stabilize the plummeting ruble–Dow Jones Newswires.

The St. Louis Fedâ€™s Maximiliano Dvorkin looks at sophisticated labor market indexes to see whether they differ from the regular unemployment rate. His conclusion: They donâ€™t. â€œThe unemployment rate is reflective of underlying labor market health, as represented by the indexes. In addition, a closer inspection of the figures suggests that this strong link between the indexes and the unemployment rate does not appear to have changed recently, which suggests that the unemployment rate is still as good at measuring labor market conditions as it has been in the past,â€? he concludes. More Predictable? A paper published by the European Central Bank looked at whether the minutes of the Bank of Englandâ€™s policy meetings help investors make better predictions about future changes in interest rates. The research comes not long after the ECB decided to start publishing an account of its officialsâ€™ deliberations. The paper concludes that minutes do indeed influence rate expectations in financial markets, though at the cost of some extra volatility in asset prices. Three Economic Puzzles Now Less Puzzling.
