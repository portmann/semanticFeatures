To boldly go where no central banker has gone before | Journalist Profile | Reuters.com central banking | Charles Evans | Fed | Federal Reserve | John Williams | monetary policy | Narayana Kocherlakota | Princess Leia | San Francisco | Spock | star trek | Star Wars John Williams, chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, happens to have the same name as the guy who wrote the music for the Star Wars films. Judging from his speeches of late, the Fedâ€™s own Williams is something of a sci-fan himself. Â Thursday in Salt Lake City he borrowed from the iconic greeting of Star Trekâ€™s Spock with a talk titled â€œThe Economic Outlook: Live long and Prosper.â€? Earlier this month he riffed on Star Wars, with a speech subtitled â€œMay the (economic) force be with you.â€? In July, he spoke about â€œThe recoveryâ€™s final frontierâ€? (see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098382/ ). So it is quite logical that the enterprising captain of the Fedâ€™s farthest-flung Western outpost would be keen on exploring strange new worlds. And here I donâ€™t just mean voyaging to Los Angeles, where he was on Monday, or to Spokane, Wash., where he treks next week. Williams, like most Fed officials, believes that after nearly seven years of extraordinarily easy monetary policy, the U.S. economy is finally ready to leave near-zero interest rates behind. On Thursday, Williams repeated his view that the Fed should raise interest rates this year. Not all U.S. central bankers agree â€“ one can almost hear Minneapolis Fedâ€™s Kocherlakota or Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans echoing Princess Leiaâ€™s warning, â€œI have a bad feeling about this.â€? Certainly, if the Fed can successfully raise rates without quickly needing to cut them again, it will have pulled off what several other global central banks â€“ the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, Swedenâ€™s Riksbank — Â have tried to do, but failed. Raising rates this year, as Williams hopes and expects to, would indeed be a bold move; and if the first hike is followed by others, he would indeed be taking the Fed where no other central bank has gone before.
