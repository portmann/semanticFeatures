5 Things to Watch at This Weekâ€™s Fed Meeting - WSJ TheÂ Federal Reserveâ€™s two-day policy meeting this week may be the calm before the storm. The central bank is unlikely to start raising short-term interest rates before September at the earliest. ChairwomanÂ Janet YellenÂ is not holding a press conference and the Fed wonâ€™t release updated economic projections. But officialsÂ  may drop fresh clues Â about the economyâ€™s trajectory and, by extension, the outlook for policy. Here are five things to watch when the Fed issues its policy statement Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT. It would be a surpriseâ€“to say the leastâ€“if the Fed on Wednesday raised its benchmark short-term interest rate for the first time since 2006. Policy makers havenâ€™t telegraphed an imminent move, and no private economist surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this month predicted a July liftoff. Officials could offer hints about whether the big moment is approaching by tweaking their description of the economy and whether it is approaching the central bankâ€™s goals, but an explicit signal seems unlikely given the Fedâ€™s stated intention of reacting to incoming data meeting by meeting. The Fed has said it wants to see further improvement in the labor market before beginning to raise rates. Ms. Yellen told lawmakers earlier this month that the job market â€œhas continued to show progress toward our objective of maximum employment,â€? and added that â€œthe labor market is getting demonstrably closer â€¦to a more normal state.â€? If the policy statement includes a similarly upbeat assessment, it could signal that liftoff is approaching. Officials have said they want to be â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will rise to their 2% annual target before raising rates. Watch for changes from Juneâ€™s policy statement for insight on their thinking. For example, last month the statement said â€œenergy prices appear to have stabilized,â€? but oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks. The Fedâ€™s June statement noted a moderate pace of economic growth, helped by moderate growth in household spending. Ms. Yellen told lawmakers this month that strong auto sales suggest â€œthat many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items.â€? Stronger consumer spending would offer an important boost to the broader U.S. economy, though the Commerce Departmentâ€™s weak reading on retail sales during June might temper any enthusiasm. If the Fed’s policy statement is approved by a 10-0 vote, it would be the fifth unanimous decision in a rowâ€”the Fedâ€™s longest dissent-free streak since 2009. But unanimity wonâ€™t last forever. At the June 16-17 meeting, one unnamed official was ready to vote for a rate increase â€œbut also expressed a willingness to wait another meeting or two for additional data,â€? according to the minutes . Keep an eye on Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who was a regular dissenter in recent years but has voted with the majority so far in 2015. to Read Today: China Market Rout Fuels Questions on Beijing's Approach, Boy Scouts Poised to End Ban on Gay Leaders, and More • You must enter the verification code below to send.
