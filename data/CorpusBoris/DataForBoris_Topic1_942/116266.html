Grand Central: Janet Yellen Has Relationship Issues  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Donald Kohn is seen by many people at the Federal Reserve as the heart and soul of the place, having served for 40 years at the U.S. central bank, including as Ben Bernankeâ€™s loyal vice chairman during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. When Mr. Kohn, now at the Brookings Institution and the Bank of England, Â says there is a problem at the Fed, it usually means there is a problem and it usually gets the attention of others inside the central bank. In a story by my colleagues Kate Davidson and Victoria McGrane , Mr. Kohn says the Fed has a problem with Congress. A growing number of lawmakers and Congressional staff members donâ€™t see the Fed as being cooperative. The perception has grown in part out of congressional inquiries into an alleged leak from the central bank in September 2012. The central bank isnâ€™t turning over documents, it says because investigations are ongoing. As the story lays out, however, frustrations among lawmakers and staff go beyond that, even to getting answers from the FedÂ on routine questions. â€œThe Fed needs to be very careful that it is acting in a way that the middle two-thirds of the Congress will see as reasonable, and responding to the Congress promptly and reasonably,â€? Mr. Kohn told The Wall Street Journal. â€œThat perception isnâ€™t there.â€? This matters because Congress is considering legislation that could reform the Fedâ€™s structure or responsibilities and affect its independence to make decisions on interest rates. Its relationship with lawmakers could affect how this debate about its future as an institution plays out. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is working on the problem. She has increased her interactions with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Tomorrow she begins two days of hearings on the economy and monetary policy. Beyond anything she says about interest rates, her approach to this issue will matter greatly. Yellenâ€™s Fed Flounders in Political Arena. Almost 18 months after taking the helm at the central bank, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is struggling to manage an increasingly strained relationship with Congress. At best, the confrontations pose a distraction for the Fed as it prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. At worst, it could damage the central bankâ€™s reputation in a way that hinders its effectiveness, potentially through legislative changes to how it conducts monetary policy. Yellen Ramped Up Outreach to Republicans in May. Ms. Yellen met with lawmakers or spoke with them over the phone 11 times that month, according to her calendar. Thatâ€™s nearly twice as many meetings with lawmakers as she held in March, her second-busiest month for Hill outreach since taking the Fedâ€™s helm in February 2014. Hensarling: House Committee Will Interview Fed Staffers. A House committee has lined up â€œa numberâ€? of interviews withÂ FedÂ staffers related to the possible leak of confidential information from a 2012 Fed policy meeting, the panelâ€™s chairman said in an interview. House Financial Services CommitteeÂ ChairmanÂ Jeb HensarlingÂ (R., Texas) said the Fed has no legal basis for refusing to comply fully with aÂ subpoenaÂ from the committeeÂ on the leak probe.Â Ms. Yellen has said she canâ€™t release all the information sought lest it interfered with other investigations. U.S. Finds â€˜No Single Causeâ€™ of Treasurys Tremor. U.S. officials concluded there was â€œno single causeâ€? of the unprecedented volatility that hit U.S. Treasury marketsÂ Oct. 15, 2014Â instead citing broad changes in the structure of Treasury markets, including the growing role of high-speed trading. Wall Streetâ€™s Top Cop Takes Harder Line. Â The Securities and Exchange Commission has ratcheted up its punishment of individuals, more than doubling the typical fine over the past decade amid pressure to prove the agency is tough on Wall Street. ECB To Leave Emergency Lending for Greek Banks Unchanged. The ECBâ€™s decision maintains a freeze on emergency liquidity assistance, or ELA, at about â‚¬89 billion ($99.21 billion) that has been in place since June 28. That move, a little more than two weeks ago, forced Greece toÂ shut its banks Â and set a limit on ATM withdrawals of â‚¬60 a day. Greece Deal Will Take Time to Reach Banks. The countryâ€™s frozen financial system, battered by bad loans and fleeing depositors, will need major surgery to get back on its feet again. The period of convalescence will be a further drag on an already reeling economy. It will take a few days at the least for banks to offer even limited service beyond the small cash withdrawals that account holders and pensioners are permitted. A full lifting of the capital controls that prevent money from flooding out of Greece could take months or more, analysts and bankers say. BOE’s Carney: Greek Deal Will Require ‘Herculean’ Effort.Â Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Tuesday that implementing the agreement reached between Greece and its creditors for a third bailout will require a “Herculean” effort by all parties. “The task of execution will be extremely difficult for all parties involved,” Mr. Carney said, during testimony to lawmakers–Dow Jones Newswires. China Central Bank: Will Continue To Implement Prudent Monetary Policies. Â China’s central bank on Tuesday reiterated it would keep its monetary policies prudent to support growth in the world’s second-largest economy, but warned against underestimating what it called a “complicated” situation. The People’s Bank of China said in a statement posted on its website that it will use a variety of monetary policies to maintain moderate liquidity. The statement, which was issued after policy makers met in the second-quarter regular meeting, didn’t elaborate on specific measures–Dow Jones Newswires. Bank Indonesia Keeps Benchmark Rate Unchanged.Â Bank Indonesia on Tuesday kept its benchmark BI rate unchanged at 7.50, showing the bank’s resolve to continue pursuing economic stability over growth.Â ”The decision is aimed at bringing inflation to the 3%-5% target for this year and next year,” Bank Indonesia spokesman Tirta Segara said–Dow Jones Newswires. No Single Cause for Oct. 15 Treasury Market Volatility. U. S. officials concluded there was â€œno single causeâ€? of the unprecedented volatility that hit U.S. Treasury marketsÂ Oct. 15, 2014, citing instead broad changes in the structure of Treasury markets, including the growing role of high-speed trading. The conclusions add to aÂ burgeoning debateÂ about why the Treasury market, long seen as one of the worldâ€™s safest, is becoming more volatile . -1145 GMTÂ (7:45 a.m. EDT) Â BOE Carney and FPC colleagues appear before Treasury Committee -1445 GMTÂ (10 a.m. EDT) ECBâ€™s Mersch speaks in Frankfurt -1715 GMTÂ (1:15 p.m. EDT) BOE Miles speaks What Markets Are Signaling About Inflation Expectations. Christopher J. Neely of the St. Louis Fed examines the different inflation expectations among Fed officials and markets, a trend that â€œindicates lack of credibility,â€? he said. â€œFirst, markets might believe that the Fed will systematically overpredict inflation, which would mean less accommodative policy than necessary to hit the inflation target. The fact that the Fed and private forecasters have repeatedly overpredicted inflation since 2012 is consistent with this explanation. Second, markets might believe that economic conditions will be so weakâ€”the equilibrium real interest rate will be so lowâ€”that the Fed will be unable to hit a 2 percent inflation target. This is a much more disturbing possibility.â€? The Atlanta Fedâ€™s Dissenting Policy. Fed officials havenâ€™t always acted in sync. Eugene N. White writes about a little-known instance in the aftermath of World War I in which the Atlanta Fed injected more capital into banks in an era when the board was trying to curb inflation. â€œViewing the collapse of the price of cotton, the dominant crop in the region, as a systemic shock to the Sixth District, the Atlanta Fed increased discounting and enabled capital infusions to aid its member banks,â€? he writes. â€œThe Federal Reserve Board applied considerable pressure on the Atlanta Fed to adhere to its policy and follow a simple Bagehot-style rule. The Atlanta Fed was vindicated when the shock to cotton prices proved to be temporary, and the Board conceded that the Reserve Bank had intervened appropriately.â€? Fed, Markets Out of Step on Rates Dance. Investors donâ€™t think the Fed will begin raising rates in September, writes Justin Lahart in the Journal. That could color Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony on Capitol Hill this week. â€œFed funds futures, which price off of expected overnight rates, suggest the chances are only about one in three,â€? he writes. â€œIn the weeks ahead key officials may point out that September is still on the table. The most important of those is Ms. Yellen, who is giving her semiannual testimony before Congress this week. She may sound a little more hawkish than investors expect.â€? The Limit to Beijingâ€™s Financial Guarantee. Chinaâ€™s recent market volatility was not unexpected, writes Michael Pettis in the Journal. â€œHistory suggests that developing countries that have experienced growth â€˜miraclesâ€™ tend to develop risky financial systems and unstable national balance sheets. â€¦ Thatâ€™s because in periods of rapid growth, riskier institutions do well. Soon balance sheets across the economy incorporate similar types of risk.â€? The solution now, he argues, is for Chinese authorities to limit their involvement. â€œThe more that Beijing is seen to guarantee, the less pressure there is among Chinese institutions to pay the cost of repairing their balance sheets, raising the chance that Beijing will take on excessive risk. This makes China itself increasingly vulnerable to destabilizing shocks.â€? Factory output across the eurozone fell in May and last rose in February, an indication that its economic recovery remained weak as Greece and its creditors struggled to find ways to keep the heavily indebted country inside the currency area. The Philippine central bank said Tuesday it expects the peso, along with other Asian currencies, to give some ground to the U.S. dollar as financial markets focus on an impending increase in U.S. interest rates following a bailout deal for Greece–Dow Jones Newswires. Brazil Sees Limited Success in Inflation Fight. Economists reduced slightly their forecast for inflation over the next year to 5.44% from 5.45%, according to the weekly central-bank survey of 100 economists. It was the second consecutive outlook reduction. â€“ Down Jones Newswires India Inflation Rises More Than Expected. The consumer-inflation rate climbed to 5.40% in June from a year earlier, compared with 5.01% a month earlier, government data showed. The reading overshot economists’ expectations of a 5.1% rise. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox . FEEDBACK LOOP: Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.
