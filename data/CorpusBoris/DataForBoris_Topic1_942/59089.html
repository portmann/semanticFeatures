Bank of Korea Holds Benchmark Rate Steady - Real Time Economics - WSJ South Korea’s central bank on Friday kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a second straight month as widely expected. Analysts say the Bank of Korea is still gauging the effect of its surprise March policy rate cut to a record low of 1.75%. Fifteen of 18 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the bank to stand pat on rates this month, while three forecast another rate cut. Korean policymakers are awaiting more economic data through the second quarter to better assess the state of the economy after a moderate recovery in the first quarter. The Bank of Korea is also wary of keeping borrowing costs too low because of the country’s already high levels of household debt. The latest economic indicators give mixed signals: exports suffered a fourth straight monthly decline in April due to slow global demand and as the won’s strength against the euro and yen weighs on shipments overseas. However, domestic demand has been gradually picking up as property and stock markets show signs of recovery following three rate cuts since last August. Exports shrank 8.0% in April from a year earlier-the worst fall in two years-as demand for Korean-made cars, ships, electronics goods and petroleum products declined around the world. The government says it plans to announce measures in June to aid local exporters. The International Monetary Fund said this week Korea’s economy is expected to grow 3.1% for 2015–slower than its April forecast of 3.3%–due to weaker exports and other reasons. The central bank last month also cut its growth forecast for this year to 3.1% from 3.4%. South Korea’s economy grew 3.3% in 2014.
