Fed Officials Should Pay the Bond Market Less Mind, Jeremy Stein Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve policy may have underreacted to strong economic activity over the years because officials were too afraid to spook U.S. government bondholders, Harvard University economist and former Fed governor Jeremy Stein writes in a new paper. Mr. Stein, known for staking out contrarian views as a policy maker, continues the trend with a new working paper that argues the Fedâ€™s approach to interest rate increases may have been too gradual and predictable Â in the past. The paper was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. â€œSociety would be better off appointing a central banker who cares less about the bond market,â€? write Mr. Stein and co-author Adi Sunderam. Mr. Steinâ€™s research has often focused on the interactions between financial markets and the economy. During his tenure, he was a proponent of incorporating financial stability concerns into the central bankâ€™s thinking about monetary policy. In March, Mr. Stein joined BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, a more than $20 billion New York hedge-fund firm, as a paid consultant. Messrs. Stein and Sunderam study transcripts of Federal Open Market Committee meetings and find â€œan increasing emphasis over time by the FOMC on financial-market considerations.â€? They say the Fedâ€™s â€œgradualismâ€? in raising interest rates became so clearly telegraphed during the chairmanship of Alan Greenspan and continuing under his successor Ben Bernanke that markets came to anticipate it. This predictability in turn, means that when the Fed starts raising its benchmark short-term rate from near zero, investors could see the initial move as the first in a continuous series of similar-sized rate increases, expecting a greater tightening of monetary conditions than envisioned by policy makers, the authors say. Because this could cause long-term interest rates to rise, Fed officials are hesitant to raise their short-term rate, trapping the central bank in a low-rate environment, Mr. Stein says. â€œThis strong sensitivity of long-term rates to changes in the policy rate makes the Fed all the more reluctant to move the policy rate, hence validating the initial conjecture of inertia,â€? he says. The authors caution their findings are intended as fodder for longer-run debate rather than as an immediate policy prescription, particularly with interest rates near zero since December 2008. â€œWe do not believe our model has much advice to give with respect to the near-term question of how rapidly the Fed should lift rates in the months following its liftoff from the zero lower bound,â€? they write. â€œIt may be something that is better undertaken over a longer horizon, or at a time when the economy is in a less fragile state.â€?
