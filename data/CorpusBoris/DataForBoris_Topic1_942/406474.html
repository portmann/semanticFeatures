Lacker On The June Meeting | Seeking Alpha Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker was interviewed by Ylan Mui, of the WaPo : I never completely make up my mind before a meeting, but at this point it looks to me as if the case for raising rates looks to be pretty strong in June. Inflation is moving decidedly toward 2 percent. Labor markets have tightened very significantly. The concerns, the downside risks that we saw at the very beginning of this year, have dissipated. And we're very far away from the benchmarks that we have to guide where rates ought to be. To me that adds up to a pretty strong case for a June move. But as I said, I don't make up my mind until the meeting comes. Lacker may be right about the need for a rate increase in June, but I don't see these reasons as being persuasive: Market forecasts call for under 2% inflation over the next 5-10 years. Those forecasts may be biased, but even Fed forecasts don't show any overshooting. Yes, "downside risks" have dissipated, but only because the Fed held off raising rates this year. Early in the year, the markets were very concerned about the impact of a rate increase on both the US and global economy. One of the reasons that markets are calm right now is that they view a June rate increase as very unlikely. I'm not sure that Janet Yellen would like to risk this outcome . Yes, rates are very far below the levels called for by famous "benchmarks", but that merely proves that those benchmarks are not reliable in the 21st century. The Wicksellian equilibrium rate has fallen sharply. If that were not the case, and the benchmarks still held, we'd be in the midst of another Great Inflation by now. At the end of the interview, Lacker talks about productivity: I'm optimistic about productivity growth in the longer run. I think productivity growth generally depends on the generation of ideas and the implementation of those ideas. I think we have all the ingredients for generating very useful ideas here. This continues to be a relatively good place to implement good ideas. I'm less optimistic than Lacker. Ironically, the strongest argument for a rate increase in June is if you assume that 1.2% RGDP growth is the new normal, as I've claimed. In that case, overheating is more likely to occur with even 3.5% NGDP growth. In contrast, were RGDP growth to return to the 3% of the 20th century, then current NGDP growth would be too slow, and easier money would be needed going forward to hit the Fed's inflation target.
