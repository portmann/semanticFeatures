Australia Central Bank Kent: ‘Monetary Policy Is Working’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ Interest-rate cuts are effective in combating Australia’s economic slowdown, although their effects on the economy have changed over time and the headwinds are stiff, the deputy head of the central bank said Monday. Amid a fierce debate about whether more rate cuts will help the resource-rich economy out of its recent slump, Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Gov. Chris Kent insisted “monetary policy is working.” “Monetary policy is clearly working to support demand, although it is working against some strong headwinds,” he told an audience in Canberra. Rates have been lowered twice this year as the RBA has moved to support the economy and head off a rise in unemployment. The cash rate has been dropped to an unprecedented 2.0% as sagging commodity prices slam growth. Mr. Kent’s comments come after RBA Gov. Glenn Stevens told economists last week he was open to further rate cuts, fueling debate on whether even lower rates would have much effect. Mr. Stevens also warned of growing risks from lower rates, pointing to the “crazy” pace of house price growth in Sydney. “It is not that monetary policy is entirely powerless, but its marginal effect may be smaller, and the associated risks greater, the lower interest rates go from already very low levels. I think everyone can see that,” Mr. Stevens said. He echoed earlier comments by Treasury head John Fraser that the Sydney housing market was seeing “unequivocal” signs of a house price bubble. Still, Mr. Stevens’ junior colleague, Mr. Kent, signaled his confidence, saying the mechanics of monetary policy were still sound. But he added that the RBA might benefit from access to more specific household spending data to see how lower rates pass through to the economy. “To know more about this, it would be helpful to better understand the behaviors of different types of households using household-level data,” Mr. Kent said. To be sure, the economy is under some major stresses that are complicating the policy process, he said. A sharp downturn in mining investment, government efforts to address the deficit, and the stubbornly high Australian dollar are all factors preventing stronger growth, he added. Economic modeling shows interest-rate cuts are about “as effective as usual,” he added. But it may be too soon for the models to detect subtle changes in the economy. Mr. Kent said the clearest signs of the ongoing effectiveness of policy were in the housing market, where construction is growing strongly. But he warned that the home construction sector might be starting to run up against supply-side roadblocks that could drive up house prices even further. Consumer spending was also rising, he said, but here too economic forces were changing the way people spend. “Some indebted households appear to be taking advantage of low interest rates to pay down their debts faster than has been the norm, perhaps in response to weaker prospects for income growth,” he said.
