BOE’s Haldane: Record-Low Rates Necessary for Continued Recovery - Real Time Economics - WSJ LONDONâ€”Raising interest rates too early could risk another recession in the U.K., the Bank of Englandâ€™s chief economist Andy Haldane plans to say during a speech Tuesday. According to a prepared text of the speech, Mr. Haldane plans to argue that the central bank should keep the short-term policy rate at its current record-low of 0.5% for the short-to-medium term. â€œA policy of early lift-off could be self-defeating. It would risk generating the very recession today it was seeking to insure against tomorrow,â€? Mr. Haldane plans to say in the speech, according to the text. Mr. Haldane is one of the nine members of the central bankâ€™s interest-rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Although inflation in the U.K. remains subdued, the Bank of England expects it to return to the targeted 2% annual growth by the second quarter of 2017. These forecasts are based around the current belief by investors that the central bank will begin raising interest rates in mid-2016. However, some economists say recent improvements in wages could create upwards pressure on prices, which could drive the bank to act earlier. Regular pay for British employees grew at the fastest pace in more than six years during the three months to April, official figures showed this month. Since economic growth in the U.K. has so far not been matched by an increase in productivityâ€”a key gauge of the nationâ€™s economic potentialâ€”some Bank of England officials are concerned inflation could mount faster than expected. At the last meeting of the BOEâ€™s rate-setting body, officials unanimously decided to hold off raising interest rates, but for two members, the decision was â€œfinely balanced,â€? minutes of the session revealed. By contrast, Mr. Haldane, who is generally considered as one of the more dovish members of the rate-setting committee, plans in Tuesdayâ€™s speech to warn that even a modest interest-rate rise could deliver bad news to already cautious consumers and risk slowing economic growth in Britain. This in turn could force the bank to move interest rates back down. â€œThese self-reinforcing tendencies explain why the glue sticking interest rates to their floor has been so powerful,â€? Mr. Haldane plans to say. According to the BOEâ€™s chief economist, recent data on wages is likely an aftereffect of how weak pay growth has been in the last two years. â€œWages are not about to embark on a rocket-propelled ascent,â€? he will add.
