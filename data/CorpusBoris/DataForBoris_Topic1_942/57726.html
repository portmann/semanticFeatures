Fed Officials Tell Markets the Training Wheels Are Off - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ultimately, the first interest rate rise should ‘not be a big surprise’ when it happens, said New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley. After years of telling markets what to expect on the interest-rate front, Federal Reserve officials are telling traders and investors to figure out the outlook on their own. The influential presidents of the New York and San Francisco regional Fed banks seemed eager Tuesday to offer lessons in how market participants should be thinking about central bank policy. Until their March policy meeting, Fed officials had used code such as”patient” and “considerable time” to guide market participants on how long the central bank might wait before lifting short-term interest rates from near zero. By dropping such language, the Fed has made clear it can consider raising rates at any coming meeting, and the decision will depend on how economic data affect the policy makers’ forecasts. They have said they want to be confident the labor market is improving and inflation will rise toward their 2% target. What the Fed wants to achieve is “well specified” and “market participants should be able to think right along with policymakers, adjusting their views about the prospects for normalization in response to the incoming data,” New York Fed President William Dudley said in a speech early Tuesday in Zurich. “The timing of liftoff will depend on how the economic outlook evolves. Since the economic outlook is uncertain, this means the timing of liftoff must also be uncertain,” Mr. Dudley said. Ultimately, the first rate rise should “not be a big surprise” when it happens, he said. Still, Fed officials have noted there has been a disconnect between what they expect for short-term rates and what investors are pricing in. At various points in recent months, markets have expected a less aggressive series of rate rises than central bankers have been predicting. San Francisco Fed President John Williams, speaking in New York Tuesday, said, “we have to accept the fact that market participants will come to their own conclusions” about the outlook, Mr. Williams said. Mr. Williams said the degree of disconnect between the central bank and the markets would matter most to the Fed. “If it’s just a difference in probabilities” about the interest rate outlook “I’m not so worried about that,” he said. Atlanta Fed leader Dennis Lockhart, speaking in Baton Rouge, La., last Wednesday, said markets appeared to be expecting a first interest-rate increase in September and “that’s a reasonable alignment with what I think to be the likely policy outlook.” The Fed officials’ comments came amid a bout of financial market volatility, including sharp losses in German bond and European equity prices . Â The U.S. Treasury 10-year note, which is a major influence on long-term borrowing costs globally, has been under pressure, with its yield hitting a six-month-high Tuesday before retreating. Rising borrowing costs could create additional headwinds for economic growth, and that could affect choices Fed officials’ forecasts. More broadly, market turbulence, at a time when financial stability is a priority, could be a concern for the Fed. Too much turmoil could give some policy makers a reason to wait longer to move on interest rates.
