Fed’s Williams Sees Value in Policy Rules, Albeit With Caveats - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Thursday monetary policy rules could have benefits for central bank policy making. But in order for these rules to be truly effective, they have to be able to say something about what the Fed would do when short-term rates need to be lowered to zero in the event of new economic stress. â€œThere is no question we will hit the zero lower boundâ€? someday in future, Mr. Williams said at a conference held by Stanford Universityâ€™s Hoover Institution. Short-term rates currently rest at near zero levels, but the Fed is angling to raise them at some point. Mr. Williams did not comment on the outlook for rates in his remarks. The Fed current pursues what it calls its dual-mandate and seeks to keep price pressures low while promoting strong job growth. Some economists would like to see the Fed adopt a formal rule that would govern how it changes short-term interest rates, but many Fed officials have said such a system would not work well in a complex economy and financial system. Mr. Williamsâ€™ observation of the problem rules can have when monetary policy is targeting zero short-term rates is a key issue. The Fed lowered rates to near zero levels in 2008 and provided additional stimulus to the economy via bond buying programs.
