Fedâ€™s Williams preps new Tee-shirt after rate hike central bankers | central banking | economics | economy | Fed | fed funds rate | federal reserve | interest rates | john williams | monetary policy | san francisco fed | united states San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams earlier this year got so sick of answering reportersâ€™ questions about when the U.S. central bank would raise rates that he had his son design a Tee-shirt that he could just give out. â€œMonetary policy,â€? read the Tee-shirt, above an illustration of a computer with an arrow zigzagging upward out of the screen. â€œItâ€™s data dependent.â€? His point: the Fed isnâ€™t on a timetable, but will raise rates when the economic data calls for it. Now that the Fed finally has raised rates, Williams has sent his son back to the drawing board, he told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Heâ€™s mum on what the Tee-shirt will say. With Williams a sci-fi fan, and the newest Star Wars installment out this weekend, I guessed it would say â€œThe Fed Awakens,â€? but he laughed so hard at that I figure it wasnâ€™t what he had been thinking. So I went back to my drawing board and came up with a few other suggestions: â€œMonetary policy: been there, done that, stop asking.â€? â€œMonetary policy: itâ€™s still data dependent.â€?
