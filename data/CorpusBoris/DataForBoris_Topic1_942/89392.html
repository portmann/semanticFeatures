Some of the Fedâ€™s Dots Will Be More Equal Than Others - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen herself has cautioned not to read too much into dot-plot projections and their movements. â€œI think that one should not look to the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the [Fed] wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large,â€? sheÂ said in March 2014. Federal Reserve-watchers on Wednesday will dissect policy makersâ€™ latest economic projections for clues to the path of interest rates in the coming months and years. But divining meaning from the â€œdot plotâ€? of interest-rate estimates can be difficult. One complication, among many : Two sets of projections were submitted by interim policy makers â€”D. Blake PrichardÂ andÂ Helen E. Holcombâ€”Â from regional reserve banks where the presidency is vacant, according to bank spokespeople. Mr. PrichardÂ is the Philadelphia Fedâ€™s acting president ; Patrick Harker is expected to take office July 1 and succeed the retired Charles Plosser. Ms. HolcombÂ is the Dallas Fedâ€™s interim president as the search continues for a successor to Richard Fisher , who also retired this spring . Both Mr. Prichard andÂ Ms. Holcomb also submitted projections ahead of the March Fed meeting, when a downward shift in the dots implied officials saw a more gradual path of rate increases in the coming years. The dot plot from March 18. Each shaded circle shows the outlook (rounded to the nearest 1/8 percentage point) of a particular Fed official. Did that represent a genuine change in policy makersâ€™ opinions, or could it have partly reflected the retirements of Mr. Plosser and Mr. Fisher ? Both men were skeptics of the Fedâ€™s easy-money policies and had signaled support for early rate increases. Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that the shift in rate projections reflected actual changes in the Fedâ€™s economic outlook. â€œCertainly there are changes in the assessments of the economy and forecasts for the economy that would point in the direction of downward adjustment in the funds rate path,â€? she told reporters on March 18. Still, the dots arenâ€™t labeled, so thereâ€™s no way to track an officialâ€™s projections over time or distinguish, say, Ms. Yellenâ€™s prediction from anyone elseâ€™s guess about where the benchmark federal funds rate will land in the coming years. Economists have warned the chart should be taken with a grain of salt . No less an authority than Ms. Yellen has cautioned not to read too much into the dots and their movements. â€œI think that one should not look to the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the [Fed] wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large,â€? Ms. Yellen said in March 2014 . But that wonâ€™t stop Fed-watchers from scrutinizing the dots for clues, just as they pore over slight shifts in the policy statement and the precise wording of meeting minutes and other documents . â€œWhether the [Federal Open Market] Committee likes it or not, there is no way the 2015 dots wonâ€™t send a message about liftoff,â€?
