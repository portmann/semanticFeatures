Grand Central: Bank of Englandâ€™s Fiscal Worries Ease - Real Time Economics - WSJ Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King once quipped that central bankers arenâ€™t really obsessed with inflation. What keeps them up at night is fiscal policy. The BOE has been waiting anxiously for months now for British Treasury chief George Osborne to spell out how quickly he intends to close the U.K.â€™s budget deficit over the course of the next five-year parliament, after falling short during his first term in office. Mr. Osborne and Prime Minister David Cameron won re-election in May at the head of a Conservative-only government, after five years in which their center-right party was in coalition with the center-left Liberal Democrats. With a budget deficit equivalent to 5% of gross domestic product and no Liberals to restrain his enthusiasm for cutting public spending, there was some speculation that Mr. Osborne might have been planning to accelerate his budget squeeze to meet his targets well before the next election in 2020. That could have had a knock-on effect on the timing of the BOEâ€™s first rate rise. The central bank is forecast to raise its benchmark rate from 0.5% in mid-2016, but a bigger-than-expected budget squeeze might have persuaded officials to postpone. In the end, the budget squeeze Mr. Osborne unveiled in his latest tax and spending plans Wednesday was actually looser than many were anticipating.The mix of tax increases and spending cuts he announced is forecast to close the budget gap in early 2020, a year later than the plans he presented at his final budget in coalition back in March. So the fiscal headwind the BOE was anticipating in the months ahead as it inches towards rate increases may not blow so hard after all. Economists think that alone probably wonâ€™t be enough to bring forward a rate rise. With the Greek crisis back in the headlines and Britainâ€™s poor productivity growth showing only the barest signs of improving, there are plenty of other things around to keep Mr. Kingâ€™s successor awake at night. Global Tumult Could Cause Fed Rate Pause. Worries about global turbulence and soft spots in the domestic economy weighed on Federal Reserve officials when they gathered at their June policy meeting, trepidations that could cause them to wait longer before raising short-term interest rates. Several Fed officials have said publicly since the June meeting that a first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade could be warranted as early as September. But minutes of the June 16-17 gathering, released Wednesday, showed their underlying unease about taking that big step.Â  Fed Officials Worried Last Month About Greece. They worried last month that a failure of Greek debt negotiations could roil European markets and perhaps spill over to the U.S., the minutes showed. Policy Makers Finally See Housing Sector Upswing. For the first time in a while,Â FedÂ officials feel better about the U.S. housing market . â€œSigns of stronger housing activity were encouraging,â€? the minutes said. Was That You, Jeff Lacker? One member of the Fedâ€™s policy committee was ready to raise interest rates at the June meeting, the minutes said. But that person â€œalso expressed a willingness to wait another meeting or two for additional data before raising the target range.â€? That may have been Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who voted with the majority last month despite signaling support earlier in the year for a June rate increase.â€”Dow Jones Newswires Fed Still on Track for 2015 Rate Rise. San FranciscoÂ Fed PresidentÂ John WilliamsÂ expressed confidence Wednesday that the U.S. economy wonâ€™t be derailed by ominous events in China and Greece, in remarks that once again indicated the U.S. central bank will raise rates this year. Given the positive outlook for the U.S., he said, â€œI still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to raise rates poses its own risks.â€?

ECB Policy Makers Forced to Deal With Possibility of â€˜Grexitâ€™.

Tame Inflation Gives China More Leeway on Monetary Policy.Â Consumer inflation in China edged up in June, though will likely remain tame the rest of the year, economists said, leaving Beijing leeway to try to rejuvenate growth in the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. China Stocks Make Biggest Daily Gain in Six Years. Â Chinese shares made their biggest daily gain in six years Thursday, restoring confidence in Beijingâ€™s suite of attempts to rescue its struggling stock market. The Man Tasked With Stopping Chinaâ€™s Stock Selloff. Â As Chinese stocks reached another in a string of highs on June 12th, the nationâ€™s top securities regulator,Â Xiao Gang,Â suggested to an elite group of Communist Party officials that the market still had room to climb . Bank of England Keeps Interest Rate Unchanged.Â The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate steady Thursday as robust growth at home is offset by concerns about a darkening economic outlook overseas. Central Banks Get It Right, and Wrongâ€”Bloomberg. The Fed is the most optimistic. The Bank of Japan made the biggest mistake. The Bank of Canada is the most accurate, but it’s got the easiest job. These are just a few of the findings of Bloomberg’s first-ever ranking of Group of Seven central banks according to their ability to forecast their own economies . Bank of Korea Cuts Growth Outlook for 2015.Â South Korea’s central bank on Thursday lowered its growth forecast for this year, highlighting strong headwind facing Asia’s fourth-largest economy.

Forward Guidance and the State of the Economy. Forward guidance has its limits as a policy tool for the Fed and other central banks, economists Benjamin D. Keen, Alexander W. Richter and Nathaniel A. Throckmorton wrote in a recently updated research paper. Among other things, they wrote, “the stimulative effect of forward guidance falls as the economy deteriorates or as households expect a slower recovery because there is a smaller margin to lower expected policy rates.” As a result, they concluded, the Fedâ€™s forward guidance in recent years likely had only â€œa limited effectâ€? on the economy. Higher Rates Wouldnâ€™t Tame Bubbles Even if Central Banks Tried. Economists at theÂ International Monetary FundÂ  have found a new reason for central bank officials to avoid using interest rates to dampen asset bubbles and market risk: it probably wouldnâ€™t work. Thatâ€™s the finding of aÂ new working paperÂ that identifies different patterns in lending between banks and nonbanks. The gap means raising borrowing costs to curb market excesses might simply push risks into less regulated financial firms sometimes referred to as the â€œshadowâ€? banking system. Debt Relief for Greece is Inescapable, writes Martin Wolf in the FT. â€œA big questionâ€¦is whether the members of the currency union should want exit risk to be a core part of the eurozoneâ€™s construction. I think they should not because such a eurozone would be frighteningly fragile. In light of this risk, it is in the interests of members to seek a solution to the crisis that does not force exit at least until all alternatives are exhausted. They should also recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. Debt relief is inescapable.â€? Why Corporate America Could Use More Competition. The Journalâ€™s Greg Ip raises concerns about the rise of corporate mergers. This wave could represent both a revival in business confidence and something more troubling: a decline in competition as market power becomes concentrated in the hands of fewer companies. Competition forces companies to invest in new products and new capacity to hold on to customers and capture new ones. Less-intense competition may thus explain some of the puzzles that hang over the U.S. economy,â€? he writes. Consumer Credit Rises at a Slower Pace in May. Outstanding consumer credit, a reflection of all debt besides mortgages, rose $16.09 billion or at a 5.7% annual rate in May, theÂ FedÂ said Wednesday. New Market for Jumbo Loans.
