ECB’s Hansson: ‘Premature’ to Start Discussion on Ending Quantitative Easing - Real Time Economics - WSJ TALLINNâ€”It’s too early to discuss tapering the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing program scheduled to end in September 2016, a member of the ECB’s governing council said Wednesday. “Things are developing slightly more positively than expected a few months ago,” said Ardo Hansson in an interview with The Wall Street Journal after a press conference. He said some “soft indicators” for the eurozone were “quite good,” but said it was hard to know how much of this could be attributed to ECB policies, rather than structural reforms or the state of energy prices. Mr. Hansson, who also heads Estonia’s central bank, said it’s “premature” to discuss whether the ECB should end its QE program early, should inflation reach the ECB’s 2% goal ahead of expectations. The ECB decided early this year that it would buy â‚¬60 billion ($65.5 billion) per month in mostly government bonds to try to lift inflation closer to the central bank’s medium-term target. Some critics worry that the ECB won’t have enough bonds to buy, but Mr. Hansson doesn’t see this on the horizon. “If it happens, we have to take it under consideration. But our experience during the first month and a half doesn’t indicate we have to consider this any time soon,” Mr. Hansson said. In an earlier press conference Wednesday, Mr. Hansson said that the issue of haircuts, or discounts, applied to Greek bonds presented as collateral in the ECB’s emergency lending program for Greek banks deserved attention. “Technical work on this issue is ongoing. We could of course discuss this issue. It deserves to be discussed. And I hope it will be on our agenda [in the] upcoming months,” Mr. Hansson said. ECB President Mario Draghi said at the central bank’s regular media briefing earlier in April that the issue of haircuts on Greek bonds was “mentioned” but “not discussed” at the meeting. Greek banks have been under pressure since early February when the ECB effectively cut off their access to the ECB’s regular loans amid concerns that the country’s government wouldn’t be able to reach a deal with creditors on its bailout. Since then banks have had to rely on an emergency lending facility that offers tougher conditions. The ECB approves it every week.
