5 Quotes From Janet Yellen’s Speech at the San Francisco Fed - WSJ Federal ReserveÂ ChairwomanÂ Janet YellenÂ offered a cautious message on the prospect of interest rate increases Â in a speech Friday, saying the central bank expects to begin raising rates this year and then proceed gradually after that.Â Here are five key quotes from her prepared remarks, delivered toÂ  a conference at the San Francisco Fed . â€œLike most of my [Fed] colleagues, I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this year.â€? â€œIf conditions do evolve in the manner that most of my [Fed] colleagues and I anticipate, I would expect the level of the federal funds rate to be normalized only gradually, reflecting the gradual diminution of headwinds from the financial crisis and the balance of risks I have enumerated of moving either too slowly or too quickly. â€œWe need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of monetary policy are felt only after long lags. This means that policy makers cannot wait until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy. I would not consider it prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the verge of reaching, our inflation objective.â€? â€œI would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage growth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were to weaken, if market-based measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably further, or if survey-based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.â€? â€œThe [Fed] does not intend to embark on any predetermined course of tightening following an initial decision to raise the funds rate target range–one that, for example, would involve similarly sized rate increases at every meeting or on some other schedule. Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as economic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and inflation.â€? • You must enter the verification code below to send.
