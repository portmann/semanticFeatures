Market Expectations Trump Survey-based Signals When Predicting Inflation  - Real Time Economics - WSJ As oil prices plunged and anxiety rose over events in Europe, market-based inflation expectations levels dropped precipitously in recent months. When it comes to divining the inflation outlook, trust market-based measures over the expectations of the broader public, says an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in a recent research report . Based on their past performance as predictors of inflation, market signals about direction of prices â€œare much more accurate than survey-based measures,â€? writes Kevin Kliesen. Central bankers gauge the expected path of inflation in two ways–via prices for government bonds with yields that adjust for inflation and by surveys of the inflation expectations of economists and the broader public, he writes. Fed officials and many private sector economists believe expectations of future inflation are a critical driver of actual price increases. Many believe inflation will converge with its expected level. So managing inflation expectations is a critical Fed goal as it seeks to keep inflation around its 2% price target. The Fed has failed to hit this target for nearly three years, but many officials have been able to remain confident theyâ€™ll get to where they want to be based on the relative stability of inflation expectations. The problem is, theyâ€™ve been getting conflicting signals. As oil prices plunged and market anxiety rose over events in Europe, market-based inflation expectations levels dropped precipitously in recent months. Meanwhile, survey-based readings were steadier. Key Fed officials tended to put more weight on the survey measures. The new research backs up the preference of Mr. Kliesenâ€™s boss, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , who has said he prefers the real-time message given by investors who have money on the line. Mr. Kliesen observes that when one looks at inflation expectations formed in the early 2000s, both market and survey-based measures did a poor job and overestimated how high inflation would prove to be. But in that contest, market-based measures of inflation were lower than what the public expected, so they were the better predictor. One caveat to the findings is that the period under study covers that of the financial crisis and the worst economic downturn seen since the Great Depression. The hit those events imposed on the economy were not foreseen, and the persistence of economic weakness since then has remained a matter of concern for policymakers and economists. That said, what people think about the future of inflation remains very important to Fed officials. They have said they wonâ€™t raise short-term interest rates from near zero until they are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will rise to 2%. That confidence could be bolstered if survey respondents and markets continue to think inflation will return to target. Still, the St. Louis Fed research shows that when it comes to inflation, while markets may have a better track record, knowing the future path of prices is tricky business.
