A Brief History of U.S. Inflation Since 1775 - Real Time Economics - WSJ In 1974, the economistÂ Herbert Stein, then a top adviser to PresidentÂ Richard Nixon, calledÂ inflationÂ â€œaÂ Hydra-headedÂ monsterâ€? that â€œcame in various formsâ€”sometimes led by wages, sometimes by prices, by foods, by oil; sometimes it was domestic and sometimes imported.â€?Â  Over the past 240 years, the rate of inflation has been much higher and much lower than it is today. And what’s changed even more is the extent to which economists thought they understood why prices were rising, asÂ we explored in today’s Wall Street Journal . From the U.S. Revolutionary War to World War II, inflation swung around much more dramatically than it does today. Especially in periods of war, prices would surge, to be followed by long periods of deflation. Over long periods of time, these dramatic swings tended to balance out, but it was a far cry from what anyone today would likely consider “price stability.” But tracking and attempting to predict and control inflation came along much more recently. The Federal Reserve was signed into law in 1913, and the Labor Department began compiling the consumer-price index in 1919. (Figures prior to that date come fromÂ  the Historical Statistics of the United States .) Confidence in the ability to predict and control inflation rose in the late 1950s after the economist A.W. Phillips documented a link between unemployment and inflation, theÂ  now-infamous “Phillips Curve.” But when this theory failed to explain the inflation of the 1970s, economists grew less certain. In 1974, the economist Herbert Stein, then a top adviser to President Richard Nixon, calledÂ inflationÂ â€œa Hydra-headed monsterâ€? that â€œcame in various formsâ€”sometimes led by wages, sometimes by prices, by foods, by oil; sometimes it was domestic and sometimes imported.â€?Â Any attempt to tame prices resulted in moreÂ inflation, just like the mythological monster, â€œgrowing two new heads each time one was cut off,â€? he wrote. Inflation confidence would vacillate once more. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of confidenceâ€”sometimes extremeâ€”that central banks tightly controlled their inflation rates. But the recession beginning in 2007 has again called that confidence into question. Many economists believed a period of prolonged mass unemployment would lead to a deflationary spiral. This forecast, however, never came to pass. In a recent review of research on low inflation , the Fed economist Michael Kiley wrote: While the level of inflation is low by historical standards, the decline in inflation since the onset of the Great Recession has been less than many popular models of the inflation process would have predicted and, as a result, research in recent years has emphasized that inflation has been surprisingly high, not low. In recent years, however, central banks have made the opposite mistake. They have forecast thatÂ inflation would quickly return to their 2% target, and inflation has been surprisingly low, not high, compared to what they’ve forecast. (Those who forecast hyperinflation were even more incorrect; the central bank has failed at returning inflation to 2% a year, let alone into the double digits.) Perhaps Herb Stein had it right all along, that inflation is a Hydra-headed monster. The Fed controls but one head, with others harnessed to the expectations of consumers and businesses, the effects of demographics, policiesÂ of government spending and taxation, and an increasingly globalized world where at least some price-setting for goods, services and wages can happen internationally.
