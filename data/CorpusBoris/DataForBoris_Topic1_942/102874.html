Fed’s Bullard: Over Time, Tighter Policy May Be Needed To Ward Off Bubbles - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard warned Tuesday that very low interest rates could create problems in the financial system, and suggested that in the future the U.S. central bank may need to set short-term rates at higher levels than would normally be the case to mitigate those risks. Mr. Bullard’s comments came from slides that were to accompany a presentation the official was to make before a local group in St. Louis. Mr. Bullard, who does not currently hold a voting role on the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, did not say anything about the economy’s near-term prospects for growth and monetary policy. In his slides, the official noted that “the Fed should hedge against the possibility of a third major macroeconomic bubble in coming years by shading interest rates somewhat higher than otherwise” would be the case based on historical norms. “The benefit would be a longer, more stable economic expansion.” Mr. Bullard warned “my view is that low interest rates tend to feed the bubble process.” He did not point to any major imbalances right now even as he flagged high stock market levels as something to watch, acknowledging the role of technology could be changing how the economy interacts with financial markets. Mr. Bullard also noted that start-up firms, who when successful generate outsized job creation, are now being formed at a slower pace. Mr. Bullard’s suggesting that rates may need to be lifted more aggressively in the future puts him at odds with some of his central bank colleagues. Many key Fed officials are now gravitating to the view that changes in labor market demographics and other forces may mean the Fed could keep rates at a lower level relative to historic benchmarks. Most officials now expect that the long-term fed funds rate target, now at near zero levels, will likely stand at around 3.75%. The Fed is widely expected to raise its overnight target rate later in the year, with some officials saying that could happen at the September policy meeting.
