Dammit Janet! | Seeking Alpha The Fed keeps pontificating, markets keep reacting. More dovish tones were struck on Tuesday. What is the market currently pricing in? --Dammit Janet, Rocky Horror Picture Show, 1973 U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen took to the podium once again on Tuesday. And despite the fact that she expressed much of the same sentiments shared during her post-FOMC press conference back on March 16, markets once again got all whipped up on the news, as they have rallied to new 2016 highs in the hours since. With Yellen's latest dovish tones to offset the recently hawkish comments from a few other Fed members, it is worthwhile to revisit the current interest rate outlook for the remainder of 2016 to see what has changed. But before going any further, it is worthwhile to explore a few points. First, if it is to a more normalized environment that the Fed wishes to return, the members of the Federal Reserve need to go away to a dark room or a deserted island for a while and simply not be seen. What exactly is the point of having all of these Fed members go out with such widely divergent views, all of which move markets, over such a short period of time? One Fed member says that April rate hikes are on the table, then another backs it up, then the next says no hikes for the foreseeable future, and so on. I get that it's a draw to get Fed members to speak at an event. I've been to a number of such events myself. But if the Fed as a group does not have a substantive and consistent point behind what they are out in the public saying at any given point in time, they should simply not talk about monetary policy and instead stick to more theoretical and academic topics. Otherwise, the endless pontifications by the Fed member du jour do nothing more than trip up a market that is already complex enough for the average investor to navigate on any given trading day. Put more directly, shush it up already. Second, if the Fed wants to get policy back to normal, it needs to do more than simply say that it wants to get policy back to normal. Don't waste the breath and effort proclaiming the plan to normalize policy over the course of 2016 and then chicken out when the market is repeatedly serving you up the opportunity to hike interest rates on a silver platter. Lastly, stop trying to endlessly coddle and micromanage financial markets. We get that you're still reeling from the shock of the financial crisis nearly a decade ago now and are hypersensitive to scaring the markets on any given trading day. But raising interest rates a few times by 25 basis points is in a totally different ballpark than allowing a systemically important financial institution like Lehman Brothers to fail. We're all adults in the stock market (NYSEARCA: SPY ), and we can handle the pain that should come with putting our capital at risk on a daily basis. Give us a jolt or two every now and then to keep us on our toes -- it's good for us after all. Otherwise, endless coddling leads to spoiled investors that feel free to make bad decisions like shoveling out too much capital to oil exploration firms already leveraged to their eyeballs under the notion that oil prices (NYSEARCA: OIL ) were going to stay over $100 per barrel forever. Overall, an economy does not always have to be good all of the time. Allowing it to be the good, bad or mediocre economy it has to be at any given point in time is the true path to growth over time. Let's begin with April. I previously assigned a 0% probability to the Fed hiking rates in April, as I am of the opinion that the cautious Fed will want a post-meeting press conference to reassure financial markets following any rate hike, and April is a non-press conference meeting. But the probabilities that I assign do not matter. Instead, it is the probabilities that the market is assigning that carry weight. And at present, the CME Group 30-Day Fed Fund futures are pricing in a 5% probability for a rate hike in April. This is down from a 20% chance for an April hike prior to the Fed's March meeting. In short, an April rate hike is all but off the table. What about the next post-meeting press conference Fed gathering in June? The market had been pricing in a 43% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in June just prior to the Fed's March meeting. Today, it is only pricing in a 26% chance. How about further out in the year in September when the Fed next has a meeting with a post presser? The futures market is currently pricing in a 47% chance for a rate hike. Of course, this was effectively the same probability for a June rate hike only a few weeks ago, so this is definitely subject to change as we draw closer to the actual meeting. Included in this reading is a 9% chance that we will see 25 basis point hikes in both June and September. What about December? The markets are currently pricing in a 61% chance for at least a 25 basis point increase in interest rates by December. This includes a 17% chance for at least two quarter point hikes by December and a slim 3% probability for 25 basis point hikes in June, September and December. Putting this all together, it seems the market is currently expecting one more 25 basis point interest rate hike taking place sometime before the end of 2016 and more likely in the second half of the year. Whether the Fed is actually able to claim this one rate hike remains to be seen, but it is a far cry from the four rate hikes that some were expecting at the end of last year. The Fed continues to let opportunity slip through their fingers. They are already way to late in trying to raise interest rates, and they are now going far too slowly now that they have actually got the process underway. Indeed, the U.S. and global economy is struggling, but we are no longer at a stage where we need extraordinarily aggressive monetary policy (operative word here being "extraordinary" and not "ordinary") to rescue the global financial system. In many respects, it could be easily argued that these policies are now doing more harm than good. As a result, if the Fed really wants to normalize interest rates, it needs to let go of the fear and act now while capital markets are giving them the window of opportunity to do so. For the longer they wait, eventually the ability to do so will pass and the Fed will be stuck with nothing but bad choices from a policy perspective. The Fed needs to be brave and do what it needs to do. Investors can handle it and will be better for any of the adjustments that have to be made along the way in trying to get back to some semblance of normal for financial markets once again.
