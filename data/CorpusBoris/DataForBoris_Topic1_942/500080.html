What The New York Fed Just Said About Inflation - PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) | Seeking Alpha We're looking for clues ahead of the Fed's September 21 decision. The New York Fed president is said to be close to Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The New York Fed district just reported the highest level of inflation expectations for the year. We've been saying, even after Fed Governor Brainard's speech, a rate hike is on the table. Like other Federal Reserve districts, the New York Fed conducts many surveys and produces much analysis. They just completed their monthly work, which includes an important inflation expectations survey. Other than the PCE price index the Fed constantly calls out "inflation expectations." It is a key Fed measure. This measure just hit a new high for 2016. That will be top of mind going into their September 21 decision. We think a rate hike is very much "on the table." If it is the case that the Fed does raise rates it will be a market shock and send markets ( SPY , QQQ ) spinning. Here's what they said in their last minutes . Staff Economic Outlook: The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower. Measures of inflation expectations were little changed yet the risk to inflation was to the "downside" because "longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower." The Fed is close-to or at their congressional mandate for full employment. They are near their 2% inflation mandate with PCE at 1.6%. The risk to that inflation mandate though is "longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower." What if we were to tell you the main risk to not meeting their mandates is turning back up? The risk of not meeting both mandates simultaneously would disappear. Removing that last risk (according to the last FOMC minutes) would give the Fed a clear path to arrive at both their jobs mandate and their inflation mandate. Let's Turn To The New York Fed Survey Just Released Yesterday. Now that we have totally set you up to be interested to know how the one clear remaining risk to their mandate is doing, we'll show you. But first we remind you the setup. Fed President Rosengren worried us. Fed Governor Brainard calmed us down . The Wall Street Journal just told us the Fed is divided. We showed that really-really most of the Fed districts saw a pickup in August from July . That's why the Fed is divided. They see the economy picking up. Why would they want to hold back a rate hike? And now because they all saw a pickup the Fed Chair needs to wander around the US from Fed district to Fed district to know just what she should be thinking for this next rate decision. You don't believe us? Here's what the Wall Street Journal just reported. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will spend the week before the central bank's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting conferring behind the scenes with 16 officials to listen to their views and plot out a plan for the meeting. She confronts a divided group of policy makers and the potential for more internal dissent than has been common during her tenure running the Fed since 2014. They are divided, dissenting and disgruntled (we added disgruntled just for fun). The economy is picking up in their eyes and they want to vote to raise rates. Yes, they want to do that ahead of the election. So now the Fed Chair needs to march around from town to town to hear them out or talk them down. But she really listens to the Fed Vice Chair Fischer and the New York Fed President Dudley. In this case we're talking about New York Fed President Dudley. As for Fed Vice Chair Fischer we have already shown that he may still be ok with a rate hike even after the slower NFP number. What was the New York Fed President Dudley just delivered to his desk yesterday? A report that inflation is picking up. Remember the quote from the FOMC minutes that inflation expectations were one of the last few things holding back inflation. Not anymore. It just picked up. Click to enlargeData: New York FED, Survey Of Consumer Expectations . Lines And Opinion: The New York Fed wants us to say that they do not confirm or deny our opinion. The pure data is the New York Fed's. The lines and commentary is our own. After being in a clear multi-year downtrend the trend is changing to point up. In fact the one-year inflation expectations hit "the highest measure of the year." Also keep in mind the New York Fed President Dudley was on record to say , "We are edging closer towards the point in time when it will be appropriate to raise rates further." When asked whether a September rate hike was on the table, Dudley said, "Yeah, I think it is possible." He said that before the last NFP report. We did not hear from him since. He was also on record to call the market "complacent" by not expecting a hike. Strong words. We'd guess that he may not have changed from those statements in August. And now with a key measure showing the risk to inflation dissipating, his New York Fed data may have him confirm his comments September 21. Conclusion: Pulling The Setup All Together The WSJ just came out to say the Fed is divided. The blackout period has started and Fed officials are no longer supposed to come out with any more comments. In the meantime a key inflation metric may remove some remaining downside risk to inflation. Jobs and wages picked up in August's Beige Book. That's what Fed Chair Yellen will hear about when she runs around to speak to these officials this week. Not many others thinks so. Fed Chair Yellen needs more information. Fed Districts are dissenting. Fed Vice Chair Fischer may have what he needs. New York Fed President Dudley just received a pickup report on inflation. OK, Fed Governor Brainard is still a dove but many others are not. That leaves the market almost positive that there will be no rate hike. The reality is that there can and may be a rate hike. If there is a rate hike you can bet the market is going to take one big wallop that day.
