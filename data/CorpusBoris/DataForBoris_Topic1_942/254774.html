Janet Yellenâ€™s Congressional Testimonyâ€”Live Analysis - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before a Joint Congressional Economic hearing on the economic outlook on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet YellenÂ visitedÂ Capitol Hill ThursdayÂ to continue preparing the public for the central bank’s first rate increase in nearly a decade.Â  With a Fed decision less than two weeks away, Ms. Yellen told lawmakersÂ she expects continued improvement in the labor market and overall economy.Â  Catch up here on herÂ testimony to the Joint Economic CommitteeÂ and the Q&A with lawmakers as it happened. Yellen: Strong Dollar Will Lead to â€˜Gradualâ€™ Monetary Policy Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is welcomed by the chair of the Joint Congressional Economic hearing, Sen. Daniel Coats (R., Ind.). WELCOME: Janet Yellen is on Capitol Hill today for another fun-fest with lawmakers, preparing them for the Federal Reserveâ€™s first rate increase in nearly a decade. On Dec. 16, the Fed chairwoman isÂ likely to come before the cameras to explain the Fedâ€™s decision to lift rates from near zero. Today, sheâ€™ll need to smile as widely as possible as she avoidsÂ saying explicitlyÂ what will happen in two weeks. ButÂ everyone knows whatâ€™s up.Â  Her remarks Wednesday to the Economic Club of Washington laid the groundwork rather exhaustively. Sheâ€™ll deliver a much shorter synopsis to lawmakers at 10 a.m., followed by a couple of hours of Q&A. YELLEN DAY 2: This is our second time hearing from the Fed chief in just two days. To recap her remarks from yesterday: Â Ms. Yellen appears ready to raise rates this month barring a fairly major surprise to the economic outlook. TESTIMONY TIME:Â Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony is out . She is confident in the economic outlook and says raising rates will be a testament to the economyâ€™s recovery. SAY IT LOUD: Ms. Yellen isÂ going to have to shout from here to getÂ anyone who isnâ€™t prepared for a rate increase to get it together. In closing, the economy has come a long way toward the FOMCâ€™s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. When the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to. DÃ‰JÃ€ VU:Â Thereâ€™s a lot of rehash between todayâ€™s remarks and yesterdayâ€™s. For example, hereâ€™s one of the key passages from yesterday on the potential for the first interest rate increase in nine years: That initial rate increase would reflect the Committeeâ€™s judgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to 2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation. As I have already noted, I currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market. Ongoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane. THE R-WORD:Â It’s relatively uncommon for the Federal Reserve to acknowledge that its policy errors can lead to real economic harm. Ms. Yellen’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, was always insistent that the most recent recession had little to do with the Fed’s monetary policy prior to the financial crisis. Some Fed criticis, however, have argued that the central bank kept interest rates too low for too long in the early 2000s, and that this contributed to the enormous amount of credit creation and mortgage debt that helped fill the floodgates of the financial crisis.Â  Ms. Yellen has made no comment about the pre-crisis period here. But her remarks today and yesterday accept the premise that, if the Fed stays too easy for too long, there is a real risk of this causing recession. Her warning today (emphasis at the end is ours): Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disruptingÂ financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Â Video:Â Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that she anticipates interest rates rising soon, in reaction to continued economic growth and higher inflation. THE LABOR OUTLOOK:Â Ms. Yellen has now begun her testimony. The prepared remarks open with her assessment of the labor market, based on the Labor Departmentâ€™s monthly jobs report. The unemployment rate is down to 5% , the economy has added 13 million jobs since 2010 and are higher than their prerecession peak by almost 4.5 million. Since June, the economy has added about 195,000 jobs a month. This underscores just how important tomorrowâ€™s jobs report will be. That report will be the Fedâ€™s final major report on the U.S. economy before their December meeting. One way to think about the risks from that report is whether Ms. Yellen would have to rewrite the opening of her speech based on what comes out tomorrow. YELLEN HEARTS CONGRESS:Â Fed chiefs spendÂ quite a bit of time with lawmakers, trying toÂ helpÂ them understand why they shouldnâ€™t hate everythingÂ the central bank does. (At leastÂ thatâ€™s how the relationshipÂ withÂ Republicans has lookedÂ in recent years.) So how does Ms. Yellen feel about Congress? Â Like Ben Bernanke, she knows very well who is ultimately in charge of her fate. She made that clear in the Q&AÂ withÂ the economicÂ club .Â  Q:Â Why do you think it is, with greater transparency, that some people running for president, who are Republicans and some members of the Congress who are Republicans, donâ€™t seem to like the Fed that much, in some respects, and they want to have legislation that constrains what you do now? Is that a concern to you? And why do you think you have this concern by certain people in the Republican Party? YELLEN:Â Well, look, let me just say, the Federal Reserve is a nonpartisan institution. We are accountable to Congress. We take our responsibility for that accountability seriously. There are members of Congress, not only Republicans but Democrats as well, who have proposed a variety of ideas both publicly and in draft legislation, as well as privately, about changes that should be made about how the Federal Reserve operates. And, look, it is up to Congress. We are a creature of Congress. The Federal Reserve was established by Congress with legislation. And it is up to Congress to consider if changes are appropriate. We have dialogue with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in the House and in the Senate. The members often come to us and ask us our views. And we provide feedback on their views or legislation they have in mind. Now, you know, there has been a push in Congress among some members for sounds like greater transparency to audit the Fed. And this in particular, I mean, I always do offer my views about when Iâ€™m asked by members of Congress about particular legislation. CORE CORE INFLATION: Hereâ€™s aÂ subtle change from yesterdayâ€™s speech. Yesterday Ms. Yellen noted that overall inflation is nearly zero and that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was about 1-1/4 percent. She repeated that today. But yesterday, Ms. Yellen added an estimate that core inflation was also being held down by the strong U.S. dollar and perhaps trickle through effects of the plunge in oil prices. She included an estimate that, accounting for these effects, the â€œunderlying rate of inflationâ€? in the U.S. has been â€œrunning in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.â€? She dropped that numerical estimate today, perhaps uninterested in going too far down the road of explaining to Congress that neither overall inflation nor core inflation are good enough to get at the true â€œunderlying rate of inflation.â€? MARKET CHECK: Ms. Yellenâ€™sÂ comments Wednesday gave markets aÂ minor jolt, sending stocks down a bit. Today, her counterpart in Europe took care of that.Â  Mario Draghiâ€™s minor disappointment at the European Central Bank sent the euro surging against the dollar and put U.S. stocks on a slightly weaker footing. Ms. Yellenâ€™s reinforcement of her message is taking care of the rest, pushing U.S. stocks down slightly. But the fact that the stock market remains near its all-time high, less than two weeks from a rate increase, is likely considered a huge success by Fed officials. Q&A TIME: The first question, go figure, is about the eurozone going in the other direction withÂ monetary policy. Ms. Yellen notes that a weak global economy and different expectations about monetary policy have led to a â€œsubstantial appreciationâ€? of the dollar, ultimately weighing onÂ U.S. exports. But the relative strengthÂ at home is enough to offset the rising dollar, she says. â€œThe combination of solid domestic spending coupled with a drag from abroad â€¦ will continue to lead to growth that is somewhat above trend and on a continuing path of labor market improvement.â€? The strength of the dollar â€œmeans that monetary policy for the U.S. is more likely to follow a gradual path.â€? THE FED IN A WORLD ON FIRE: How does all the trouble around the world, including all the terrorism worries, factor into the Fedâ€™s thinking? Hereâ€™s aÂ careful answer fromÂ a Fed chief that works for just about any issue: â€œThose risks are ones that we watch very carefully.â€? Ms. Yellen says those risks â€œhave the potential to have a significant economic effect,â€? though she doesnâ€™t see one at this point. In the aftermath of the financial crisis the U.S. has seen cautious behavior among households and businesses for a number of reasons. â€œI would add geopolitical risk as a further factor causing that kind of cautiousness.â€? FED INDEPENDENCE:Â Ms. Yellen reiterated her opposition to recentÂ legislation that would require the Fed to follow a policy rule in setting interest rates. Ms. Yellen reprised her arguments that â€œwhile such rules are useful as reference points in monetary policy, to set the federal funds rate in that way, without deeper analysis of whatâ€™s appropriate for the economy, would be extremely damaging.â€? Ms. Yellen noted that one version of those rules would call for the Fedâ€™s target interest rate to already be at 2%. Ms. Yellen seems ready to lead the Fed toward raising rates by about a quarter of a percentage point above zero in December. But she doesnâ€™t think itâ€™d be appropriate for the U.S. to be anywhere near 2%. The bills odds may not be very good: President Barack Obama has signaled heâ€™d veto the legislation even if it did ultimately get through Congress. A KEY REMINDER FROM THE FED CHIEF: Ms.Â Yellen says donâ€™t put too much weight on Fridayâ€™s jobs report. Though the Fed will be watching the numbers carefully, â€œWe canâ€™t overweight any particular number,â€? she said. â€œWe need to look at underlying trends in the data.â€? On Wednesday and again in her testimony Thursday, she said the job market is improving and gradually reducing slack in the economy. Her warning about not overweighting Fridayâ€™s number means it will take a big surprise to alter her already expressed view that the economy is improving and apparently about ready for an initial interest rate increase.Â  INCOME INEQUALITY:Â In response to a question, Ms. Yellen calls rising income inequality a â€œdisturbing trend.â€? She cites the usual suspects as causes, including technological change and globalization. And her â€œlet me be clearâ€? line tosses it right back at your elected officials: â€œThese trends are not ones the Federal Reserve can address.â€? FUNDING THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND: The House has passed legislation that Â would pay for highway construction by using the Federal Reserveâ€™s surplus account . Ms. Yellen shared an analysis that resembles aÂ  critique of this legislation that has been spelled out by her predecessor Ben Bernanke and by debt hawks Â like the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget: in essence, thatÂ raiding the Fedâ€™s surplus is essentially a budget gimmick. She also noted that as a central bank, Fed capital is not like a regular bankâ€™s capital. But she wouldnâ€™t call it irrelevant: Ms. Yellen said that holding some capital enhances the Fedâ€™s credibility. DOLLAR WOES: The dollar discussion continues. Will theÂ divide between the Fed and the ECB keep pushing up the dollar?Â  â€œI believe much of that expectation is already built into the market and into exchange rates,â€? Ms. Yellen says. But then she adds: â€œI wouldnâ€™t forecast where the dollar is heading.â€? Of course, a congressional hearing is a step behind the markets. The committee chairman just noted how the dollar is weakening against the euro this morning. Ms. Yellen notes that she caught a bit of the ECB action earlier in the morning. “My understanding is that the market expected some actions which were not forthcoming.” (Keep your fingers crossed for U.S. lawmakers to discuss the idea of negative interest rates. Your mind will be blown.) 85%:Â That’s the number that explains why Janet Yellen isn’t too worried about the fact that the European Central Bank and others are still easing monetary policy while she’s contemplating tightening it. Asked about this divergence among the world’s central banks, Ms. Yellen noted that in the U.S. economy: “85% of spending comes from consumers, investment spending and housing.” That’s not to say exports and imports don’t matter, just that the internal U.S. domestic economy is enormous.Â  “Overall, I would say that the total, despite this foreign weakness, overall weâ€™re on a solid course,” Ms. Yellen said. EDUCATION: A little over an hour into the hearing,Â the fact that lawmakers areÂ asking about early childhood education tells us something about the Fedâ€™s communications. The hot questions about monetary policy arenâ€™t yielding much new information. The Fed is likely raising rates in two weeks and that debateÂ is largely over. Asked about investment in early education, Ms. YellenÂ seizes the opportunity to assess a keyÂ problem ofÂ the recovery. â€œOne of the most disappointing aspects of U.S. economic performance is that the pace of growth and the pace of productivity growth have been very depressed.â€? That means it hasnâ€™t taken much economic growth to see substantial improvement in the labor market, she says.Â  â€œLong-term living standards â€¦ really do depend on productivity growth,â€? Ms. Yellen says. So Congress should put considerable attention on policies to addressÂ it, such as education andÂ making life easier for entrepreneurs. HIGHER RATES, MORE BORROWING?Â Â Congressman John Delaney (D., Md.) just asked Ms. Yellen whether or not higher rates might actually convince some people to borrow because theyâ€™d assumed they could just keep waiting because rates are low. â€œIn general, higher levels of interest rates, I think, do tend to make borrowing more expensive and discourage it,â€? Ms. Yellen responded. â€œBut it will occur in the context of a stronger economy,â€? she added. â€œI would not expect to see borrowing go down or lending go down when we raise rates modestly.â€? But would people rush in from the sidelines and begin borrowing? â€œThatâ€™s a temporary effect,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œI donâ€™t want to encourage the idea that I believe higher rates, in and of themselves, would permanently tend to boost borrowing and spending.â€? TED TIME: This is the part of the hearing where we get our dose of presidential politics, courtesy of Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas). And itâ€™s a special one. Sen. Cruz, being a presidential candidate, is being super-dramatic by reading a critique of the Fed in 2008 similar to one he offered during a recent debate. But he seems to have some of his dates and facts off by a degree or two. He cites Fed policy in the summer of 2008 andÂ the FedÂ â€œshifting to a tighter monetary policyâ€?Â that led to a scramble for cash and caused asset prices to collapse. No surprise, all this drama withoutÂ clear facts does not yield the desired response. Ms. Yellen is confused, of course, because the FedÂ started easing policy in the second half of 2007.Â In mid-2008, Ben Bernanke was fighting off hawks who wanted to tighten monetary policy. By the end of 2008, we ended up with rates pinned nearly at zero â€” where weâ€™ve been for seven years. Ms. YellenÂ notes much of this, saying â€œI think the Fed responded pretty promptlyâ€? in using monetary policy to deal with the crisis. Â  We have a feeling Sen. Cruzâ€™s critique is going to be updated for the next time. We hope he keeps the drama, though. Itâ€™s a great touch for those of us who report on monetary policy and arenâ€™t usually treated to a dramaticÂ tone in these settings. HOW MANY JOBS?Â A key question for economists, when studying the jobs report, is accounting for how many jobs it takes just to keep up with the growing U.S. population and the flood of new graduates that hit the labor market every year. This is a complicated demographic calculation, and Ms. Yellen said she estimates thatÂ it probably â€œrequires under 100,000 jobs per monthâ€? to absorb new workers that are coming into the labor force. â€œThereâ€™s a downward trend in the labor force due to its aging,â€? she said. Making progress on unemployment and absorbing new workers â€œrequires quite a bit less than the 200,000 a month or so that weâ€™ve had,â€? she said. Ms. Yellen also said that, with the aging of the U.S. population, â€œI donâ€™t think we should expect to see labor-force participation move up a great deal over time.â€? This is simply a concession to the reality that a huge number of people were born in the late 1940s and 1950s â€” the post-World War II baby boom. Do the math on the age of the baby Â boomers. Theyâ€™re nowÂ retiring en masse. RECESSION RISKS:Â This is the part of the hearing where a congressman gets to cite a forecast for a 65% chance of a recession next yearÂ (from Citigroup recently) and see how much the Fed chief squirms. Ms. Yellen, less than two weeks away from raising rates, must have taken notice when that Citi forecast emerged.Â  She notes that theÂ FOMC would only raise rates if itÂ expected above-trend economic growth. “Of course there’s always uncertainty that pertains to the economic outlook. There are always shocks that occur.” “I absolutely wouldn’t see it as anything approaching 65%.” But noÂ recession estimate is coming from the Fed chief today. A CALM HEARING:Â This has been one of the least-heated hearings on the Fed in a long time. Ms. Yellenâ€™s semiannual testimony has often been characterized by tense exchanges between the Fed chief and criticalâ€”often visibly angryâ€”members of Congress. Todayâ€™s hearing has been remarkably staid and civil. Maybe that reflects, more than anything, that the economy is improving to the point that the heat is coming off the Fed. Ms. Yellen says itâ€™s â€œone of the things that leads me to believe â€¦ there does remain a margin of slack in the labor market.â€? Â  The Fed sees unemployment in the long run at 4.9%, just below the 5% rate we saw in October. But the U-6, rate (accounting for people who are underemployed and have stopped looking for work even though they want jobs) â€œremains higher than where it ought to be.â€? THE COSTS OF REGULATION:Â A question Ms. Yellen often faces from Congress is whether the Fed’s new regulations — prompted primarily by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul — are harming the banking system and dragging down the economy. Ms. Yellen said the most important impact of these rules, however, “is to make the financial system far safer and sounder and less crisis-prone than it was prior to the financial crisis.” She cited one estimate that the financial crisis had cost the economy $16 trillion. Clearly if the regulations prevent a repeat of such an episode, that’s quite a benefit. But for now, that’s largely an untested proposition? Is the U.S. better protected from a major crisis? It might take a major crisis to know.Â  ON SAVING: A couple of mildly sharp questions about why savers are getting such low returns on their savingsÂ (compared to an earlier era)Â allows Ms. Yellen to explain supply and demand for your deposits. “We had a different economy then and many things are different domestically and globally than they were then,” Ms. Yellen says.Â  “If there were a huge demand for those funds, interest rates would be bid up to a level we’re more accustomed to having experienced historically.” THE END: Two hours from a FedÂ chief yieldedÂ nothing that shocked lawmakers or investors. That’s exactly howÂ Ms. Yellen and the Fed wanted it, two weeks before aÂ first rate increase. Thanks for joining us.
