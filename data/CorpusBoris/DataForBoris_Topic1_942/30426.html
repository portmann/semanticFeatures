ECB’s Praet Says Eurozone Bond-Buying Program Will Continue - Real Time Economics - WSJ The European Central Bank‘s bond-buying program will likely continue at least until September 2016, as previously announced, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said Thursday. In announcing a sizable asset-purchase program and a specific time frame for its implementation, “we are very strongly confident, unfortunately, that is what will be needed,” Mr. Praet said during a panel discussion in Washington. There are no discussions now about tapering bond purchases or a time to exit the program, he said. The ECB announced in January it would buy a total of â‚¬60 billion ($63.8 billion) a month in assets until September 2016, and potentially longer if eurozone inflation continued to lag behind the central bank’s target of just under 2%. ECB President Mario Draghi earlier this week said there have already been signs of success in stimulating the eurozone economy . But he too shrugged off the idea that the program, which launched in March, could end early. “I’m quite surprised by the attention a possible exit from the program receives when we’ve only been in the program for a month,” Mr. Draghi said on Wednesday. Mr. Praet spoke Thursday at an event hosted by the International Monetary Fund and moderated by Jon Hilsenrath, chief economics correspondent of The Wall Street Journal.
