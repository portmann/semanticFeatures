Economists Welcome New BOE Decision-Making Procedures - Real Time Economics - WSJ Britainâ€™s top economists have broadly welcomed a suite of reforms proposed by the Bank of England last year aimed at making its decision-making processes more transparent. Following a review published in December by former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh, the BOE said that from August this year it will publish minutes of officialsâ€™ deliberations alongside their policy decisions. The minutes are currently published with a two-week lag. The central bank said it also intends to release full transcripts of policy meetings after an eight-year lag. Underpinning the proposals is a plan to move to a schedule of eight policy decisions a year instead of the current 12 and extend policy meetings over seven days from the current three. A survey of prominent economists published Tuesday by the Centre for Macroeconomics found 65% of those polled agreed the BOEâ€™s proposals will help observers understand rate-settersâ€™ decisions and draw inferences about future changes in policy. Fewer respondentsâ€”56%â€”were convinced the changes justify spreading policy meetings over seven days. Several said the longer schedule increases the chances that policy decisions leak. Calls for greater transparency from central banks, whose activities were once shrouded in secrecy, have grown louder in recent years as the institutions have taken on greater responsibility for smoothing the normal ebb and flow of the economy and safeguarding the financial system.
