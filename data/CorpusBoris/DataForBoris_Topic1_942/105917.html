Central Banks Must Remain Focused While Rates Are Low, Says  Lithuanian Central Bank Governor - Real Time Economics - WSJ VILNIUS, Lithuaniaâ€”Central banks must remain focused while interest rates are low and be prepared to help creditors estimate loan repayment capacity in a prudent way whenÂ rates go up again, a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council said on Friday. â€œWe are determined not to lose direction. Especially now, when the prevailing environment of particularly low interest rates requires special vigilance,â€? Lithuanian central bank governor VitasÂ Vasiliauskas said at a conference in Vilnius on Friday. â€œWe have to be prepared for interest rates returning to the ‘normal’ level and help both lenders and borrowers estimate their loan repayment capacity in a prudent way. As it has been said, our strategy should be ’tilting against the wind’ of building up imbalances in the credit market, he said. Mr. Vasiliauskas reminded conference-goers that there has been an unexpected series of bank failures that have cost â€œfar too much,â€? and asked: â€œWhy does history repeat itself? One of the possible answers is that because we tend to forget lessons from the past.â€? He added that he did not know whether history will repeat itself and said that he saw the current situation as â€œunique in several aspectsâ€?. â€œNow, the responsibility is assigned. To us: central banks, supervisory agencies, financial stability committees,â€? Mr. Vasiliauskas said, adding that the institutions sought this responsibility and assumed this duty voluntarily.
