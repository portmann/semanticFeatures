Fed Chief Janet Yellen’s Report to Congressâ€”Live Analysis - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet YellenÂ visits lawmakers Wednesday and Thursday for two days of congressional testimony, offering her views publicly for the first time since the central bank raised interest rates in December. InvestorsÂ will be watching for signs that the Fed will hold offâ€”at least until after Marchâ€”on any further rate increasesÂ amid mounting unease in financial markets and worries about global growth. She’ll go before the House Financial ServicesÂ Committee on Wednesday at 10 a.m. Eastern and the Senate Banking Committee a day later. Follow all the action here as it unfolds Wednesday. THE FED VS. THE MARKET: The funny thing about these standoffs is how markets want certainty in a world that provides little of it. Looking at markets this morning (not exactly excited by the Fedâ€™s testimony) makes that clear. Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony goes about as far as the head of a committee can go if she wants to maintain the notion that the Fed is still run by a committee. The central bank started the year expecting to raise interest rates four times. Investors are betting itâ€™ll be zero times and seemed to want Ms. Yellen to at least rule out the first one in March. She did not, but she went pretty far considering the fact that the Fed just started raising rates two months ago. If the March meeting were held today, the words in her testimony make it clear the Fed would not be raising rates today. But sheâ€™s not going to say that without the committee agreeing. THEÂ OIL OUTLOOK:Â Nothing has confounded economic forecasters more over the past year than what’s happened with oil prices, so it’s interesting to see Ms. Yellen weigh in on the topic too. She seems skeptical of the view that low oil prices are a negative for the U.S. economy .Â Her key remarks on oil are spread throughout the speech, but here’s a compilation of them: Minus: “In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year.” Plus: “Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income–aided in part by the declines in oil prices.” Plus: Bad financial conditions “could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.” Minus:Â “Low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries.” Plus: “Economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect.” On balance she sees the negatives from oil as primarily focused on the oil sector and commodity-producing countries. By contrast, the positives she mentions apply to the broader economy. This suggests Ms. Yellen and the Fed still sees low oil prices as primarily a good thing. DOWNSIDES OF A STRONG DOLLAR: The Fed’s monetary policy report delves into some of the implications of a particularly strong U.S. currency. The report said a stronger dollar has reduced import prices, pushing down core inflation by 0.5 percentage point. Likewise, falling oil prices have held down firmsâ€™ production and distribution costs and weighed on core consumer price inflation â€œsomewhat.â€? Once oil prices stabilize and the dollar stops rising, the Fed expects both core and overall inflation to move up towards its 2% target â€œover the medium term.â€? The report also notes how divergence among central banks of the worldâ€™s developed economies is contributing to the dollarâ€™s strength and cutting into U.S. exports in a way that could delay the Fedâ€™s rate increases. â€œAll else being equal, a smaller contribution to the U.S. economy from the external sector likely points to a more gradual pace of policy normalization in the United States,â€? the report said. Likewise, the strong dollar will boost other developed countries exports by making their currencies relatively weaker. That, the report said, could allow central banks in Europe or Japan â€œto provide less monetary accommodation â€“ or to start removing it earlier â€“ than would otherwise be the case.â€? FAITH IN THE PHILLIPS CURVE: U.S. inflation â€œis expected to remain low in the near term,â€? Ms. Yellen says. But downward pressure from declining energy prices and a strengthening dollar should wane â€œonce oil and import prices stop falling.â€? Ms. Yellen continues to emphasize the central role of the labor market in inflation dynamics, noting that inflation should rise gradually to the Fedâ€™s 2% annual goal â€œas the labor market strengthens further.â€? On that front, she highlights â€œsolid improvementâ€? in key measures of job-market health, but notes some slack likely remains. â€œThere is still room for further sustainable improvement,â€? she says. On inflation expectations, she says market-based measures of inflation compensation â€œhave moved down to historically low levelsâ€? although â€œchanges in risk and liquidity premiums over the past year and a halfâ€? appear to be a significant contributor to that trend. She also noted that some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are â€œat the low end of their recent rangesâ€? though she described them as â€œreasonable stableâ€? on the whole. A FED NOT ON AUTOPILOT: The Fed continues to expect a gradual pace of interest-rate increases, Ms. Yellen says in her congressional testimony. But â€œby no meansâ€? is monetary policy â€œon a preset course,â€? she adds. â€œThe actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2% inflation.â€? She also defends the Fedâ€™s December decision to begin boosting rates in familiar language, saying policy remains accommodative and that delaying the start of the process for too long might have led to an â€œabrupt tighteningâ€? that â€œcould increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.â€? YELLEN TO THE RESCUE?Â The testimony is out, and itâ€™s a lot of what markets wanted. No promises but lots of reassurances. In other words, the Fed wants you to know a March rate increase is far from a certainty. Ms. YellenÂ says financial conditions â€œhave recently become less supportive of growthâ€? and reiterates that the Fed expects â€œgradualâ€? rate increases. It hits the key notes about stresses in China and elsewhere overseas, weakening inflation expectations and more. A couple ofÂ key lines: â€œFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they persist, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.â€? PROGRAMMING NOTES: The action gets started early today. Ms. Yellenâ€™s written testimony and the Fedâ€™s semi-annual monetary policy report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. That gives lawmakers a bit of time to digest it â€” even though few of them will â€” before the 10 a.m. hearing. Based on experience, weâ€™re likely in store for about three hours of Chair Yellen sitting in her chair and listening to speeches (with a few questions thrown in). FINANCIAL FEARS? The biggest item on the Fed’s worry list must be financial conditions. The sharp swings in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities cannot inspire confidence in any business trying to make sense of the economic outlook. Are markets flashing warning signs about the global economic outlook? Or are they just doing their usual thing, looking for reassurance about economic stimulus from central bankers? Ms. Yellen will have plenty of opportunities to weigh in. The job market is in good shape with low unemployment, moderate payroll growth and faster wage growth. But economic growth is rather unremarkable, with an annualized 0.7% expansion in the fourth quarter. Inflation remains the weakest link. Headline inflation is proving to be lower than Fed officials expected, due to oil prices that seem to never stop dropping. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is a bit more stable. But inflation expectations — a core piece of central bankers’ inflation outlooks — are slipping. That’s not a good sign for their quest to lift inflation to healthier levels. WELCOME: It’s a big day for Janet Yellen. The economic outlook is cloudy and financial markets are stormy. Tossing politicians into the mix, in an election year, isn’t usually what you’d consider a recipe for clarity. The Federal Reserve chairwoman starts her two days of Capitol Hill testimony with a visit to the House Financial Services Committee. Her biggest task will be to soothe the public (particularly those ever-anxious investors) without boxing herself in about the central bank’s next move on interest rates.

Nothing facilitates the looting and asset-stripping of the middle and working classes more efficiently than the boom-bust cycles perpetrated by the Fed and its Wall Street cohorts.  So now it would appear that the Great Muppet Slaughter of 2016 is about to commence, which will end with the .1% concentrating even more wealth and power in its own hands.  Heckova job, Yellen. Agree, it just takes time for low oil prices to work its way thru before effects are felt  in a meaningful way.
