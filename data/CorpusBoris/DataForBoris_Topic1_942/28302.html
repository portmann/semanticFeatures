Bullard: Now May Be Good Time to Start Raising Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard thinks the U.S. economy “is much closer to normal than it has been for many years.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Wednesday “now” may be the appropriate time to begin raising short-term interest rates from near zero, with the U.S. economy poised for a boom and unemployment headed below 5%. “There’s a mismatch between the monetary policy side, which is still at emergency settings, and the economy itself, which is arguably reasonably close to normal,” Mr. Bullard said at a conference in Washington. “Now may be a good time to begin normalizing monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next couple of years.” Mr. Bullard has been a consistent advocate for raising the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate from near zero. In recent months, he signaled he would have been willing to boost borrowing costs this spring. Mr. Bullard has also warned that if rates haven’t gone up by the fall, it could be a problem for the Fed and the broader economy. “If I’m right that you’ve got a coming boom in the U.S. economy and you’re going to keep interest rates that low through that boom that sounds like a recipe for asset market bubbles, and they’ve been a killer for the U.S. economy in the last 20 years,” he said. On Wednesday, Mr. Bullard declined to name a specific time for the first interest rate increase. “I’m being deliberately vague on that because it really is supposed to depend on the data and I haven’t seen all the data for the spring yet,” he said. Most Fed officials favor raising rates this year, with key policy makers pointing to the middle of the year as the time when central bankers will start actively weighing action. But a recent string of weak economic data has given some pause, potentially pushing later the timing of the first rate raise. Mr. Bullard, who isn’t a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, is fairly confident economic growth will accelerate again, aided by low oil prices and low borrowing costs. Mr. Bullard was upbeat on the job market. “Assuming the economy continues to improve over the next couple of years and nothing bad happens, this is what you’re going to see–you’re going to see unemployment down in the 4% range,” he said. “Any time you have unemployment in the 4% range that is basically boom time.” The unemployment rate was 5.5% in March, though some economists have cautioned that other factors–such as low labor-force participation, a relatively high number of involuntary part-timers and weak wage growth–imply there’s still significant slack in the labor market. Very weak inflation, which has undershot the Fed’s 2% target for nearly three years, is likely to rise, Mr. Bullard said. He shrugged off a decline in market-based measures of inflation expectations and said he will reassess that situation once oil prices stabilize. Mr. Bullard isn’t worried that a strong rise in the dollar will slow the U.S. expansion. “Real exchange rate movements are not reliably associated with future [gross domestic product] growth in the U.S. data since 1983,” he noted. Another argument for boosting rates is related to the growing risk that the longer the Fed keeps rates at ultra-low levels, they could fuel asset bubbles that could burst and send the economy back into recession, he said. “If a bubble in a key asset market develops, history has shown that we have little ability to contain it,” Mr. Bullard said. “A gradual normalization would help to mitigate this risk while still providing significant monetary policy accommodation for the U.S. economy,” he said.
