The Case For Not Raising Rates, Part 1: Economic Data Analysis | Seeking Alpha The current consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed will raise rates at their next meeting on December 15-16. The challenge with this consensus is that it does not conform to the data coming out of both the domestic and international economy. I will explore the case for not raising rates in two parts: The first will explore economic data, and the second will explore debt and GDP. The Efficacy of Monetary Tightening within a Context of Global Economic Instability: Reviewing the Case for Why Removing Monetary Accommodation is Not Warranted On Wednesday of last week, Janet Yellen spoke to the Economic Club of Washington D.C., and on Thursday she spoke to congress about the economy. Her comments described an economy largely on the way to recovery. This has led many on Wall Street to believe that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting on December 15-16th. She also reiterated that it is the overall path of the increase in rates and not the date of liftoff that is most important. In assessing whether the Fed should raise rates or not, I believe we have to look at the data. The Fed has a mandate of maximum employment within a context of price stability. When we look at the domestic data, there is tremendous slack in the labor force, and the rate of inflation is severely below the Fed's 2% target. On Friday, we saw 211,000 in job creation and a slight increase in wages of 0.2%. While the unemployment rate (U-3) remained steady, the U-6, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, ticked up from 9.8% to 9.9%. Additionally, while many argue for a decoupling of the US from the rest of the world, this is clearly not the case. Further weakness from overseas remains a concern for monetary policy makers and has been cited in recent decisions not to raise rates. The continued threat of deflationary pressure remains at the door of the developed world, despite the vast accommodation provided by the world's central banks. Economic Data Domestically and Globally Remains Weak Just because unemployment is falling that's not a reason to raise rates.…There is no harm in having low unemployment in the country except insofar as that generates wage pressures and that shows up in inflation. But I don't see that in my inflation outlook. Central banks around the world remain highly accommodative. The US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at the emergency level of the zero lower bound and instituted high levels of quantitative easing, purchasing massive amounts of securities and growing the Fed balance sheet by over $4 trillion. Despite this unprecedented action, velocity on M2 remains at a 60 year low. While many believe the economy is at full employment, a more complete picture of employment illustrates the number of people unemployed remains a serious concern for the economy. The current U-6 unemployment rate is just below 10%, the participation rate also remains at a low not seen in over 35 years at 62.5%. Many people who were pushed out of the labor force during the 2008 recession, have yet to return. There is a disturbing number of people working part time who prefer to work full time, and other marginally attached workers. This indicates an economy far away from full employment. The recent ISM manufacturing data showed the manufacturing sector of the economy is in recession. ISM came in at a disappointing 55.9 from 59.1 the previous month, which illustrated concerns about how strong this economy is. Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, has recently cut rates that were already negative to further accommodate a weak economy in the Eurozone. While Mark Carney of the BOE, recently stated that rates would stay lower for longer as a slowing global economy caused him to reverse his belief of raising rates sooner. The BOJ has recently indicated that it will continue to remain accommodative and keep the QE program going, as the Japanese economy continues to contract. Furthermore, the rate of inflation remains drastically low across the developed world with Europe posting a 0.9% inflation print, down from the 1.1% previously recorded. This remains at less than half of the ECB's target of 2% inflation suggesting that further accommodation is necessary, and the risks of deflation remain very real in the Eurozone. Japanese inflation is likewise showing deflationary pressures are real and should be considered by monetary policy makers throughout the developed world. In the US the inflation rate, as measured by the Feds preferred inflation gauge the PCE, remains severely subdued from their 2% target, which leads to questions about whether it is prudent for the Fed to hike rates off the zero lower bound with such domestic and global risks to the economy. I would say the preponderance of the evidence is clearly aligned in the camp that rising rates would be a mistake given the weak domestic economic data, and growing global risks of deflation. It's clear that the dynamics of both the growth of M2 and the rate of velocity has moved outside the Feds control, indicating that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy remains ineffectual at bringing about the fullness of the change desired. This leaves many to conclude that the Fed should end all plans for further QE that may exist, raise rates, and slow the growth of debt, while also putting a lid on future inflation. While slowing the rate of growth in debt levels is certainly a necessary objective to achieve sustainable economic growth, to do so would further harm the economy. Many contend that the economy is not in an emergency state and therefore the Fed should liftoff from 0%. I respectfully disagree, as markets remain completely dependent on central banks, and a large percentage of the increase we have seen in the stock market is the result of financial engineering rather than organic growth. In Part II, I will explore the output gap and the lack of inflation, as well as how debt will be a restraint to economic growth going forward. I will also explore case studies of rising rates from history. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
