Grand Central: June Minutes Could Point to Rate Split Inside the Fed - Real Time Economics - WSJ June Minutes Could Point to Rate Split Inside the Fed European Central Bank Holds Key to Greeceâ€™s Future MANUEL BALCE CENETA/ASSOCIATED PRESS In an important passage of the minutes of the Federal Reserveâ€™s April policy meeting, the central bank summarized the views of officials about the odds of an interest rate increase by midyear. â€œMany participants â€¦ thought it unlikely that the data available in June would provide sufficient confirmation that the conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate had been satisfied,â€? the Fed said, â€œalthough they generally did not rule out this possibility.â€? The central bank thus set the stage for no rate action at its June meeting. Minutes of the June meeting, to be released Wednesday, could similarly provide clues about the Fedâ€™s discussions about the outlook for a rate move in July and September. A July increase, of course now, looks highly unlikely. Itâ€™s hard to see how officials could envision having enough evidence by July 28-29 to support a rate increase. Concerns inside the Fed about Greeceâ€™s debt crisis were rising at the time of the Fedâ€™s June meeting. The minutes could thus send a confirming signal that the coming meeting likely will be a non-event. The discussion around September, however, becomes more interesting. The Fedâ€™s interest rate forecasts released in June showed a split among officials about the outlook for rates this year. Among ten centrist Fed officials, five saw two rate increases this year and five expected just one. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen pointed to the split in her press conference following the meeting of the Fedâ€™s rate-setting committee. â€œThere are obviously a range of opinions, both in the market and among Committee members, at this time on what the appropriate stance of policy is likely to be later this year and next year,â€? she said. The June minutes are important because they could provide new context around that split and how it is shaping internal discussions. At the very least, it seems likely the Fed will signal that a September move is possible, a point that several officials have made since the June gathering. More interesting would be any revelation of discussions about tactics as a rate increase approaches. Officials who wanted two rate increases likely expected to make the first move in September. Officials who wanted just one rate increase could choose to act in September or December. The minutes also need to be read knowing they are somewhat stale. Greece hadnâ€™t defaulted on its debt when Fed officials last met. Chinaâ€™s stock market hadnâ€™t started to tumble. Those developments will clearly make some Fed officials shift in their seats as they look ahead to the rest of the year.

For more details, read our global roundup of how the third quarter could play out for central banks around the world. Five Things to Watch for in the Fed Minutes. TheÂ FedÂ last monthÂ signaled it was on track Â to start raising short-term interest rates later this year. But to get there, officials must navigate muddled signals on the economy at home and potential turmoil overseas. Important new details about the Fedâ€™s outlook for rates emerge Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, when the Fed releases minutes of its June 16-17 policy meeting. Here are five things to watch . IMF: U.S. Economy Could Stall With Premature Rate Increases. The Fed risks stalling the U.S. economy by raising interest rates too early, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday as it urged theÂ  central bank to wait until 2016 before raising short-term rates from near zero. The IMFâ€™s call is at odds with Fed officialsâ€™ signals that they are likely to move later this year. Fed Hits Santander With Enforcement Action. The Fed issued a stinging lecture to troubled Spanish bank Banco Santander SA, faulting the lenderâ€™s U.S. unit for failing to meet regulatorsâ€™ standards on a range of basic business operations. Tuesdayâ€™s move was unusually broad in scope for a bank of Santanderâ€™s size and represents the latest crackdown by U.S. regulators, who have been pressing the largest U.S. banks to improve their risk management. The move stems from the bankâ€™s repeated failure to address the regulatorâ€™s concerns about its U.S. operations. China Takes More Steps to Stop â€˜Irrationalâ€™ Selling. Â A raft of Chinese government agencies stepped up efforts Wednesday to shore up Chinaâ€™s plunging stock markets that the securities regulator described as facing panic and irrational selling.Â Agencies ranging from the markets regulator to the commission that oversees large state-owned companies announced measures to promote the buying of shares. Much of the government firepower was concentrated on the China Securities Finance Corp., a unit of the China Securities Regulatory Commission that provides brokers with financing for margin trading. Eurozone Sets Sunday Deadline for Greece Financing Deal. Â Eurozone leaders set Greece a Sunday deadline to come up with new and even-tougher economic measures if the country wants to avoid defaulting on the European Central Bank and crashing out of the currency union. European Central Bank Holds Key to Greeceâ€™s Future. A looming bond payment by Greece to the European Central Bank is emerging as the potentially decisive event in the countryâ€™s attempt to stay in the euro and avoid a banking collapse. ECB Lifts the Veil on Emergency Liquidity Assistance.Â The European Central Bank has Â lifted the veil Â a bit on a program that typically operates in the shadows but has gained prominence in recent months during Greeceâ€™s debt drama: Emergency Liquidity Assistance, or ELA. On Monday, the ECBÂ said in a statementÂ Â that it had maintained its cap on ELA for Greek banks and alsoÂ raised the haircutsÂ on collateral that must be posted for new loans. Here are five main issues addressed by theÂ ECBâ€™s report. BRICS Central Banks Sign Forex Reserves Pool Pact. Five major emerging national economies known by the acronym BRICS were a step closer to setting up a $100 billion pool of mutual reserves by signing an â€œoperational agreementâ€? on a visit to Moscow, the Bank of Russia said Tuesday. The pool would be drawn on by the central banks of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa whenever they suffered a shortage of dollar liquidity, helping them maintain financial stability, Russiaâ€™s central bank said. BOE Officials Held Special Meeting to Discuss Greece. Â Bank of England officials held a special meeting on June 29 to discuss the deteriorating situation in Greece and how it might affect the U.K.â€™s banks and wider economy, according to a record of officialsâ€™ recent deliberations published Wednesday. When Global Banking Standards Conflict With Local Needs.Â Central banks in the developing world are caught between adhering to international banking standards and serving potential customers who are unable to meet those standards, as greater access to banking services becomes a mainstream policy goal . Positive Economic News Masks Underlying Problems. News coverage of the global economy improved sharply in June, but not for the right reasons, according to a report released Tuesday. TheÂ Absolute Strategy Research/Wall Street Journal global composite newsflow index increased to a 10-month high of 56.5 in June from 55.1 in May. An index above 50 denotes net positive news coverage on economic topics. Analysts at ASR warned the composition of the indexâ€™s improvement is â€œless than ideal.â€? Thatâ€™s because the increases were concentrated in the inflation and monetary policy components, while the labor and revenue news flow indexes weakened last month. The eurozone composite index also strengthened sharply, to 59.6 from 55.8 in May, but the reading might have been even stronger if not for news stories on the Greek debt crisis ahead of theÂ July 5 vote . -2 p.m. EDT: Federal Reserve releases minutes of its June 16-17 policy meeting -2 p.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on the economic outlook in Los Angeles European and U.S. Public Debt Crises, Compared. “The recent debt crises in Europe and the U.S. states feature similar sharp increases in spreads on government Â debt but also show important differences. In Europe, the crisis occurred at high government indebtedness levels and had spillovers to the private sector. In the United States, state government indebtedness was low, and the crisis had no spillovers to the private sector,â€? the authors of a paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Â write. â€œThese different debt experiences result from the interplay between differences in the ability of governments to interfere in private external debt contracts and differences in the flexibility of state fiscal institutions.â€? China Response to Selloff Reveals Insecurity. â€œFar more than simply a market crisis, the Chinese leadership views turmoil on the Shanghai stock exchange as a potential security threat to the regime,â€? Andrew Browne writes in the Journal. â€œThat helps explain the barrage of measures unleashed by financial authorities to counter a sudden market downturn that threatened to shake public confidence in the government.â€? Why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut. Erik Berglof writes on Project Syndicate that Ukraine, which is trying to defeat its oligarchs and the Russians, needs some help from creditors. â€œFor the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992, Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform. There are signs that the oligarchsâ€™ grip is beginning to loosen, owing partly to internal conflicts among them. The EU and the US are working to help resolve its conflict with Russia. Ukraineâ€™s private creditors must now do their part, recognize the countryâ€™s economic and political situation, and accept a haircut on their bonds. Neither the Ukrainian economy â€“ nor its political system â€“ can afford that they do otherwise.â€? Job Openings Remains at Historic Highs. Job openings ticked up slightly to 5.36 million in May, from a revised reading of 5.33 million the previous month, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Trade Gap Widens. The U.S. trade gap widened 2.9% to a seasonally adjusted $41.87 billion in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The widening reflected a continuation of a downward trend in exports and stable demand for imports, outside of oil. Growth is set to slow across more of the worldâ€™s largest economies, including the U.S. and China , according to leading indicators released Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The National Bank of Poland left its interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, in line with expectations and its earlier guidance.
