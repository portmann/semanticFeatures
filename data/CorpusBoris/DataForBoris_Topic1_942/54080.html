Fed’s Dudley: Successful Community Banks Grow Conservatively - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley on Friday said community banks that fare best have been executing a careful balancing act between growth and risk taking. Mr. Dudley, who was speaking to a gathering of Bronx bankers, weighed in the wake of the release of the April jobs report. He didn’t address the national economic outlook or monetary policy in his prepared remarks. Instead, Mr. Dudley focused on local economic conditions and banking and credit issues. He flagged the importance of community bankers and the role they play in supporting the growth of small businesses, which are critical for job creation. “A foundation built on good risk management practices and intimate local knowledge helped the successful banks to thrive during one of this country’s most difficult financial periods,” Mr. Dudley said in his speech. “The banks that prosper in the future will likely have characteristics similar to those that outperformed during the financial crisis,” he said.
