Grand Central: ‘Super Thursday to Offer Signal on UK Rate Outlook - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fedâ€™s Yellen Kept Up Outreach to Congressional Republicans in June The Federal Reserve Is Ready for Rate Hikes But Bond Market Is Skeptica Obamaâ€™s Fed Pick Says Sheâ€™ll Take an Unpaid Leave From Michigan Job Bank of England watchers are bracing themselves for an unusually large barrage of information Thursday that should offer fresh clues as to when officials are likely to raise interest rates. The BOE is due to publish minutes of the Monetary Policy Committeeâ€™s deliberations alongside its monthly policy decision for the first time. The minutes, which include a record of how individual policymakers voted, are usually published with a two-week lag. The central bank will also publish its quarterly inflation report, a 50-page collection of economic forecasts thatâ€™s invaluable for investors trying to work out officialsâ€™ next move. And as if that wasnâ€™t enough to digest, Gov. Mark Carney and other senior officials will host a press conference to explain their latest thinking on policy and the economic outlook. The packed itinerary–economists have dubbed it â€œSuper Thursdayâ€?–follows a December 2014 review by former Federal Reserve board governor Kevin Warsh into the BOEâ€™s disclosure practices. Previously, the rate decision, the minutes and–once a quarter–the inflation report were published on different days. Mr. Warsh recommended narrowing the gap to make the thinking behind policy decisions clearer. The changes foreshadow a move in 2016 to eight policy meetings a year for the MPC instead of the current 12. That new schedule will bring the BOE into line with rate-setters at the Fed and the European Central Bank. The BOE isnâ€™t expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Super Thursday. Yet amid all the noise, investors will be watching out for two critical things. First, whether one or two officials on the nine-person panel break ranks and push for rate increases to begin. And second, whether changes to the BOEâ€™s forecasts for growth and inflation imply an earlier or later timing for liftoff. Fedâ€™s Lockhart: Economy is Ready for a Rate Hike. Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told the Journal in an interview it would take a significant deterioration in the economic data to convince him not to want to raise short-term interest rates at the Fedâ€™s policy meeting in September. â€œI think there is a high bar right now to not acting,â€? he said. His comments are among the clearest signals yet that Fed officials are seriously considering a rate increase in September. The Federal Reserve Is Ready for Rate Hikes But Bond Market Is Skeptical. Federal Reserve officials have signaled they think the economy is robust enough to withstand a round of interest-rate rises starting this year. But the bond market still seems skeptical. While yields on short-term Treasury notes have started moving higher in anticipation of an interest-rate increase as early as September, yields on longer-term debt have remained stubbornly low. That is a sign that many investors are still doubtful about the health of the economy , and the ability of the Fed to keep raising rates without jeopardizing growth. Fedâ€™s Yellen Kept Up Outreach to Congressional Republicans in June. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen continued her stepped-up schedule of congressional outreach into the summer, breaking bread in June with a half-dozen Republican lawmakers . Ms. Yellen met with three senators and three House members, all Republicans, for breakfast or lunch in June, according to her calendar. The meetings came after a busy May when Ms. Yellen met or spoke with lawmakers 11 times, all but twice with Republicans. Obamaâ€™s Fed Pick Says Sheâ€™ll Take an Unpaid Leave From Michigan Job. Kathryn Dominguez, President Barack Obamaâ€™s latest nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said that if confirmed by the Senate she plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from her job as a professor at the University of Michigan during her time at the central bank. In a financial disclosure report made public by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Ms. Dominguez said she earned $273,937.75 between January 2014 and May 2015 from her job at the university, where she has worked since 1997 .

Eurozone Retail Sales Fall Sharply in June.Â Retail sales in the eurozone fell more sharply than expected in June, a fresh sign that the currency areaâ€™s economic recovery remains too weak to quickly bring down very high rates of unemployment, or raise inflation to the European Central Bankâ€™s target . U.K. Serious Fraud Office Plans More Libor Charges in the Fall. British fraud prosecutors, fresh from their conviction of former bank trader Tom Hayes, are planning to bring criminal charges against additional individuals in the coming months. David Green, the director of the U.K.â€™s Serious Fraud Office, said he plans in the fall to file criminal charges against other former bankers for allegedly manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. He declined to comment on their identities, seniority or the exact timing. Bank of Thailand Keeps Benchmark Rate Unchanged.Â The Bank of Thailand kept its benchmark one-day repurchase rate at 1.5% on Wednesday, citing the effect of recent monetary policy easing and the depreciation of the country’s currency, the baht. The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to keep the rate at 1.5% for the second month in a row. The Bank of Thailand made two consecutive rate cuts in March and April in an effort to shore up the economy–Dow Jones Newswires. British Borrowers Could Feel the Heat from Fed Rate Rise As investors increasingly expect the Federal Reserve to soon raise borrowing costs in the U.S., fresh research suggests a rate rise could have an impact on a sizable group of people across the Atlantic: British homeowners.

Moore and Brookings senior fellow Adam Looney ask whether income tax policy has increased wealth inequality. They find that, â€œalthough income tax policy tends to make the after-tax distribution of net worth less concentrated than the pre-tax distribution, the effectiveness of the tax system in reducing inequality has decreased over time.â€? Italyâ€™s Stagnant Productivity Down to Public Sector Inefficiency? Italyâ€™s public sector inefficiency could be partially responsible for the low level of productivity of Italian firms, Raffaela Giordano, Sergi Lanau, Pietro Tommasino, and Petia Topalova say in a posting on Vox.EU. Data from more than 400,000 Italian firms â€œsuggests that Italy could realize significant macroeconomic productivity gains if average public sector efficiency were to improve from its current faltering levels.â€? Doing Business in Developing Nations The World Bankâ€™s â€?Doing Businessâ€? report, an influential survey of the operating environment for companies in nearly 200 countries, doesnâ€™t accurately reflect the experience of companies actually doing business in developing nations, according to a new study. Mary Hallward-Driemeier, a World Bank economist, and Lant Pritchett, a Harvard University economist , find â€œalmost zero correlationâ€? between the Doing Business findings and those based on surveys of business enterprises that the World Bank helps conduct around the world. Borrowers, brace for interest rate pain as the Bank of England prepares to apply the brakes As the Bank of England edges towards an interest rate hike for the first time in almost a decade, Ed Conway in The Times of London says the big question is how households will cope when borrowing costs finally start to rise again. â€œBorrowing costs have been so low for so long that they now threaten to create bubbles, both in the property market and the wider economy,â€? he writes, adding â€œChances are they [the BOE] will have to lift them even further than they, or the data, predict.â€? US factory orders rose for only the second time in 11 months in June, a sign the sector may be gaining some traction after a lackluster stretch.
