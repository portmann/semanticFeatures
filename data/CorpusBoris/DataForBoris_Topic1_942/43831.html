Redacted Version Of The April 2015 FOMC Statement | Seeking Alpha Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic growth has moderated somewhat. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors. Shades GDP down. Why can't the FOMC accept that the economy is structurally weak? Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. The pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources was little changed. Household spending is rising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment is advancing while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow and export growth has weakened. Growth in household spending declined; households' real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remains high. Business fixed investment softened, the recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and exports declined. Shades down its view of household spending. Adds a comment on consumer sentiment. Also shades down business fixed investment and exports. Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. TIPS is showing lower inflation expectations since the last meeting. 5y forward 5y inflation implied from TIPS is near 2.10%, up 0.16% from January. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. No change. Any time it mentions the "statutory mandate," it is to excuse bad policy. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. No real change. It is fitting Einstein's definition of insanity - doing the same thing, and expecting a different outcome. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.

The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. CPI is at -0.0% now, yoy . No change in language. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress - both realized and expected - toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Consistent with its previous statement, the Committee judges that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. No rules, just guesswork from academics and bureaucrats with bad theories on economics. This change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. No change. Changing that would be a cheap way to effect a tightening. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

"Balanced" means it doesn't know what it will do, and want flexibility. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Jerome H. Powell; Daniel K. Tarullo; and John C. Williams.

We need some people in the Fed and in the government who realize that balance sheets matter - for households, corporations, governments, and central banks. Remove anyone who is a neoclassical economist - they missed the last crisis; they will miss the next one. With this FOMC statement, people should conclude that they have no idea of when the FOMC will tighten policy, if ever. This is the sort of statement it issues when things are "steady as you go." There is no hint of imminent policy change. The FOMC has a weaker view of GDP, labor use, household spending, business fixed investment and exports. Despite lower unemployment levels, labor market conditions are still pretty punk. Much of the unemployment rate improvement comes more from discouraged workers, and part-time workers. Wage growth is weak also. Forward inflation expectations have reversed direction and are rising, and the twitchy FOMC did not note it. Equities rise and long bonds rise. Commodity prices fall and the dollar rises. The FOMC says that any future change to policy is contingent on almost everything. Don't know it keeps an optimistic view of GDP growth, especially amid falling monetary velocity. The key variables on Fed Policy are capacity utilization, labor market indicators, inflation trends, and inflation expectations. As a result, the FOMC ain't moving rates up, absent improvement in labor market indicators, much higher inflation, or a US dollar crisis. We have a congress of doves for 2015 on the FOMC. Things will be boring as far as dissents go. We need some people in the Fed and in the government who realize that balance sheets matter - for households, corporations, governments, and central banks.
