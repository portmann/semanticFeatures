Chatty Former Chairs Turn Up Fed Policy Noise - Real Time Economics - WSJ Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman, told The Wall Street Journal Wednesday the Fed’s large balance sheet concerns him. brendan smialowski/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Paul Volcker is the latest former Federal Reserve chairman to chime in on central bank policy. Mr. Volcker on Monday lamented the Fedâ€™s large balance sheet, which grew rapidly after the 2008 financial crisis when Ben Bernanke was chairman and Janet Yellen was vice chairwoman. The Fedâ€™s portfolio of assets grew to around $4.5 trillion from less than $1 trillion in recent years through three rounds of bond-buying aimed at spurring stronger economic growth. â€œThe Federal Reserve should not be so dominant in the markets,” Mr. Volcker told The Wall Street Journal after a press conference detailing his recommendations for financial regulatory reform. His comments come less than a week after Mr. Bernanke suggested in his blog that the Fed should consider maintaining a large balance sheet. â€œI wonder if the case for keeping the balance sheet somewhat larger than before the crisis has been adequately explored,â€? he said. The Fed is maintaining the size of its balance sheet by reinvesting the payments of principal on the bonds. Ms. Yellen, now Fed chairwoman, told the Senate Banking Committee in February the central bank had no plans to reduce the portfolio through asset sales. The Fed intends at some point to let the balance sheet shrink gradually by ceasing the reinvestment process, she said. The Fedâ€™s long-run intention is to hold â€œno more securities than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy,â€? she added. “What they are doing now, I’m not commenting on,” Mr. Volcker said, but “I don’t want it as a permanent thing. If it’s necessary now, that’s their judgment and I’m not going to second guess them, but over time you don’t want” the Fed to play a dominate role in bond markets. Mr. Bernanke, in contrast, said in his blogpost there could be a number of advantages to keeping a big balance sheet. He noted, â€œMost other major central banks have permanently large balance sheets and are able to implement monetary policy without problems.â€? Mr. Volcker also repeated his view, which contrasts with current Fed policy, that low inflation should not be viewed as problematic. Inflation has been running below the Fedâ€™s 2% target for nearly three years, and officials say they wonâ€™t start raising interest rates until they are reasonably confident inflation will move up toward that goal. “I think it’s fine. We haven’t got much inflation, and people don’t expect much inflation and that’s a good thing,â€? Mr. Volcker said. â€œI’m not somebody that worries about inflation being too low.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
