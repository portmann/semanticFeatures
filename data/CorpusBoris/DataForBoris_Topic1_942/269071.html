Where the Jobless Rate Is 2.3%, Here’s What Happened to Wages - Real Time Economics - WSJ InÂ Lincoln,Â Neb., average hourlyÂ earnings were stagnant until the unemployment rate crossed below 2.5%Â in the fall of 2014. JEFFREY SPARSHOTT/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL In Lincoln, Neb., average hourly earnings were stagnant until the unemployment rate crossed below 2.5% in the fall of 2014. Then, wages took off. Since last October, they gained as much as 10.9% from a Â year earlier. The jobless rate in October: 2.3%. No one is suggesting the national unemployment rate has to get down to 2.5% before wages show signs of life. But there are some questions on what full employment looks like. While the unemployment rate is back to 2008 levels, other metrics look weak . “I continue to judge that there remains slack in the economy, margins of slack that are not reflected in the standard unemployment rate, and in particular I’ve pointed to the depressed level of labor-force participation, and also the somewhat abnormally high level of part-time employment,” Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said this week. Ms. Yellen’s comments came as Fed officials raised the central bank’sÂ benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006, citing the possibility of overshooting its employment and inflation objectives. The nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu, is the Goldilocks unemployment rate–neither too hot nor too cold. There is demand for workers but not so much that higher wages are fueling excessive inflation. The Fed, tasked by Congress with promoting maximum employment and stable prices, would like to reach that figure. Fed officials’ median projection for the normal long-run unemployment rate was 4.9% as of December. But economists don’t agree on a specific number, or even whether the economy has already reached full employment. In October and November, the unemployment rate was 5% and wages showed signs of firming. “We now know that the Nairu for the U.S. economy is 5%,” said Torsten SlÃ¸k, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “From a Fed perspective, the U.S. labor market is now showing signs of overheating.” Economists at J.P. Morgan Chase expect the unemployment rate to fall to 4.5% by the end of 2016, well below their 5% estimate for Nairu. “Where a loose labor market has put downward pressure on inflation for the last several years, we think a tight labor market will soon be a source of upward pressure,” they said. But not everyone agrees with that 5% threshold. “While most indicators have been trending in the right direction, nominal wage growth and the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remain far outside of target ranges, and provide ample evidence that the economy has a way to go before reaching full employment,” said Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaningÂ Economic Policy Institute. Morgan Stanley economists expect Nairu to fall as low as 4.6% in 2017, giving the Fed more leeway to keep rates low for longer. What does it matter? Very low unemployment rates can lead to higher wages. Higher wages can lead to higher prices and more inflation. Finally, a limited supply of labor can also limit job growth. â€œWe have seen job growth slow quite a bit throughout this region,â€? said Nathan Kauffman, the Kansas City Fed’s regional economist for Nebraska. â€œSome of that can be attributed simply to the fact that when unemployment is as low as it is, at some point a tight labor market would prevent further job growth at the level we have been. I think itâ€™s natural to expect job growth would be a bit slower, but the labor market still looks pretty good.â€? Private-sector wages across Nebraska have been growing faster than the national average. The stateÂ bumped its minimum wage to $8 an hour from $7.25 at the start of 2015 and will raise it to $9 at the start of 2016, but many firms are moving beyond that. One of the state’s biggest private employers, Bryan Health, in November moved its starting minimum wage to $11 an hour from $8.45. The hospital system also has been looking to tap underutilized corners of the labor market, for example by offering English-language courses to refugees who land in the area, said Jan Garvin, vice president for human resources at Bryan Health. The state estimates that about 400 refugees–from Myanmar, Iraq, Bhutan and elsewhere–have resettled in Lincoln in each of the last two years. But to highlightÂ the fine line between apparent full employment and signs of slack, one only need look as far as Omaha. The larger city is only about an hour away from Lincoln and, with the unemployment rate at 2.9%, many companies there also worry about finding enough workers. But wages haven’t taken off. Indeed, for the first time on record, average hourly earnings in the Lincoln metro areaÂ surpassed those of Omaha earlier this year.

Folks, even if there are not enough workers, employers are saddled with an effective 39% tax rate which has not come down with legislation, high health care premiums, and other regulations which prevent them from granting higher wages.  What we need is to evaluate the waste in government at all levels, lower taxes for all, and privatize much of what government does, even ending corporate and income taxes all together, and move to a 10% national sales tax to fund government.  And, women need to have more children!   With the birth rate falling, who will produce our goods?  Already Japan will be extinct in about 80 years, as the birth rate is exceeding the death rate! How much would we be hearing that during the GOP primaries if the economy weren't doing great!!   In fact, the only people not doing well are the under-educated....   a.k.a. Trump supporters.
