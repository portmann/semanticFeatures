Grand Central: Itâ€™s Tough on the Fed, ECB Borders - Real Time Economics - WSJ Powell: Exempt Small Banks from Dodd-Frank Compensation Rules In a recent speech,Â Â the European Central Bank’s BenoÃ®t CÅ“urÃ© talked about the implications for the global economy of divergences between his own institution’s monetary policy and that of the Federal Reserve. He briefly celebrated the fact that, contrary some recent academic speculation, the impact of the ECB’s quantitative easing program and previous loosening showed that it at least still had the critical mass to act independently of the Fed. He then concluded there was actually little evidence to suggest that what either the Fed or the ECB is doing or plans to do is having much impact on other countries. Not for the first time, a senior official at a very large central bank concluded that it wouldn’t improve matters if he and other policy makers at such institutions worried more about the global impact of their decisions. “While we need to keep an eye on international spillovers, it is not clear whether monetary policy coordination would lead to a superior outcome,” Mr. CÅ“urÃ© said . “In particular, from a theoretical perspective, it is not clear whether an optimal domestically oriented monetary actually leads to more international spillovers.” But there are other perspectives. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Thursday published new forecasts Â for the 36 countries in which it invests. One of the key drivers for some of its forecast changes is the ECB’s decision to launch QE, which it believes will lift growth in central and Southeastern Europe. And not just because a faster growing eurozone might import more stuff from its neighbors. “Interest rates in many CEB and SEE countries have consequently declined alongside interest rates in the eurozone, including in flexible exchange rate countries,” the EBRD said. “In addition, most currencies in the region have weakened against the US dollar alongside the euro.” It also warned of risks to the anticipated pickup in growth its sees for 2016, the most serious of which is a Greek default and eurozone exit. But second on its list is “a larger than-expected impact of tightening of monetary policy in the United States early next year, resulting in steeper increases in external financing costs and larger capital outflows from emerging markets.” For the EBRD–an institution backed by 64 governments, including the U.S.–spillovers are a fact of life. Indeed, it singled out Turkey as “a country caught in the cross currents of diverging monetary policies in the eurozone and the US.” It may not improve matters if the Fed and the ECB were to give more weight to the impact of their decisions elsewhere. But the EBRD’s assessment suggests there have been and will be significant consequences, and that a growing divergence between policies pursued by the central banking world’s two behemoths may be difficult for some countries to cope with. WSJ Survey: Most Economists See Fed Raising Rates in September. The Federal Reserve will wait until September to begin raising short-term interest rates, according to a growing majority of private economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. About 73% of economists in the survey, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday, said the U.S. central bank will start lifting rates in September. Thatâ€™s up from 65% in the April survey and 38% in Marchâ€™s poll. Investors, However, Have a Different Take. Federal funds futures, which price off overnight interest-rate expectations, imply the chances of a rate increase by September are less than 50% . This view of a lower rate trajectory may reflect worries that some sort of shock disrupts the Fedâ€™s plans, rather than a straight forecast of what the Fed will most likely do. But on balance, it seems as though investors have a more dovish take than the economists. Fedâ€™s Powell: Exempt Small Banks from Dodd-Frank Compensation Rules. Speaking to a conference of community bankers in New York, Fed governor Jerome Powell said banks under a certain asset level, â€œperhaps $10 billion,â€? should be exempt from Dodd-Frank compensation restrictions. The restrictions, which are being developed by the Fed and other agencies, are designed to remove encouragements for bankers to take excessive risk. ECBâ€™s Draghi: stimulus to stay in place for â€˜as long as needed.â€™ European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bankâ€™s stimulus programs will remain in place until officials are confident they will meet their inflation objective on a sustained basis and he downplayed fears the policies are widening the gap between rich and poor. Speaking at the International Monetary Fund, Draghi pushed back against worries in financial markets that the recent string of good economic data would lead the central bank to pull the plug on its bond-buying program. ECBâ€™s Weidmann Criticizes Emergency Liquidity for Greek Banks-Handelsblatt. Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank, criticized the weekly increases of emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks, saying they were not in line with the ban on monetary financing of states, German daily Handelsblatt reports, citing the central banker. “In light of the prohibition of monetary financing of states, I find that it is not okay that banks without market access are granted loans, which (in turn) finance the bonds of their state, which doesn’t have access to the market itself,” he is quoted as saying. â€“Dow Jones Newswires. Kuroda Stresses Power of Monetary Bazooka. Â Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda tried Friday to refute skepticism over the impact of his monetary easing program, saying it was as powerful as 10 interest rate cuts and was working well to reinvigorate the economy. Bank of Korea Holds Benchmark Rate Steady. Â  South Koreaâ€™s central bank on Friday kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a second straight month as widely expected. Analysts say the Bank of Korea is still gauging the effect of its surprise March policy rate cut to a record low of 1.75%. Fifteen of 18 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the bank to stand pat on rates this month, while three forecast another rate cut. Mexican Central Bank Favors Waiting for Fed Move. Mexican policymakers favor waiting for the Fedâ€™s next move before hiking rates, minutes of the latest policy meeting show. The five-member board of the Bank of Mexico voted unanimously on the April 30 decision to keep interest rates at a record low of 3%, according to the minutes released Thursday, with most members saying that a preemptive rate increase could further hurt a weak economy. â€“Dow Jones Newswires Turning the taps back on. After slashing production for months, U.S. shale-oil companies say they are ready to bring rigs back into service, setting up the first big test of their ability to quickly react to rising crude prices. An increase in U.S. production, coupled with rising output by suppliers such as Russia and Brazil, could put a cap on the 40% rally in crude prices since March and evenÂ  push them lower later in the year , some analysts say. What Seasonality? Fed economists Charles E. Gilbert, Norman J. Morin, Andrew D. Paciorek and Claudia R. Sahm conclude that seasonal trends are not behind weak first quarter GDP numbers, a finding that contradicts several other economists. â€œReal GDP growth has been weaker on average in the first quarter of recent years than growth in the other three quarters â€“ and the first quarter this year may be on track to repeat that pattern. Nevertheless, we find no firm evidence that this pattern primarily reflects residual seasonality,â€? they write. â€œInstead, the first-quarter weakness appears to be driven be a couple of outlier years and by soft readings in a varying subset of underlying components.â€? Still Lots of Slack. Kevin Cashman takes a look at age-adjusted employment to population ratios broken down by race and ethnicity for the Center for Economic and Policy Research and finds, â€œthe labor market as a whole is still far from recovering from the recession especially for African Americans and Hispanics. There will have to be considerably more growth in employment before the labor market for African Americans is as strong as it was before the recession. Furthermore, the pre-recession period was not one in which the labor market was exceptionally strong. Arguably, the economy could return to the strong labor market seen in the late 1990s with the right mixture of fiscal and monetary policies.â€? A Blueprint For Really Ending Too Big to Fail. The Fed and other U.S. financial regulators have been too shy about using new authorities gained after the 2008 financial crisis to eliminate the problem of very large Wall Street banks being perceived as too large to be allowed to fail, according to Jennifer Taub , professor at Vermont Law School, in her paper â€œStill Too Big to Fail.â€? Â â€œIn several meaningful areas, the regulators have behaved timidly,â€? she writes in the paper, presented last week at a conference sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking.Â  â€œFor some mandated reforms, the enacted rules are too mild or the effective dates delayed far into the future. For others, deadlines have passed with rules not finalized or even proposed,â€? she said. -Too Much Too Soon in Europe. Ashoka Mody argues for Bruegel that moving to a common currency â€œplaced European integration into an unmanageable overdriveâ€? evident today in the standoff between Greece and its creditors. â€œA new architecture shouldÂ scale back the corrosive power relationships of centralized economicÂ surveillance. Let nations manage their affairs according to their priorities. AndÂ put on notice private creditors that they will bear losses for reckless lending. The European fabricâ€”held together by commercial tiesâ€”is fraying asÂ European businesses seek faster growing markets elsewhere. That fabricÂ could tear if political discord and economic woes persist.â€? Father of the Euro Foresaw its Recent Troubles. Stephen Mihm writes an appreciation of Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, the first president of the European Monetary Institute, for Bloomberg View, drawing attention to the late economistâ€™s fears that creating a European monetary union without a similar fiscal union would lead to trouble. â€œAs the euro zone lurches toward another reckoning withÂ  Greece , his candid assessment points to the radical reforms that may be needed to ensure the survival of the euro,â€? Mr. Mihm writes. â€œThe unpleasant consequences he feared would ensure without a fiscal union — an overreliance on monetary policy to deal with problems; divergence, not convergence, in the fiscal health of member nations; and a deep vulnerability to the dysfunctions of individual member states — have all become clear and present dangers.â€? -The U.S. Economy Posts Worst Month Since the Recession, according to the research firm Macroeconomic Advisers. The firm estimates that GDP fell an inflation-adjusted 1% in March, the largest drop since December 2008 . -Producer Prices Fall. The index for final demand, which measures prices that businesses receive for their goods and services, dropped a seasonally-adjusted 0.4% last month from March in the latest sign of persistently low inflation . -The Bank of Russia bought $181 million on Wednesday to replenish the country’s depleted foreign exchange reserves, the bank said Friday.
