Bank of England Official Says Oil Price Fall May Have Bigger Effect Than Forecast  - Real Time Economics - WSJ LONDONâ€”The recent slump in the oil price may have a bigger short-term effect on the U.K. economy than the Bank of England expects, one of the central bank’s nine policy makers said Thursday. In a speech in London, Martin Weale said his calculations suggest that the 40% slide in the price of crude oil since last year’s peak may give a bigger boost to growth over the next two years than the BOE’s forecasts suggest. It may also drive annual inflation lower than officials predict, at least in the short term, he said. Mr. Weale stressed that his analysis indicates only that there is a risk growth turns out higher than forecast and inflation lower, not that he necessarily expects those outcomes. More importantly, he said that any extra impact on inflation from the fall in the oil price is likely to prove fleeting and so shouldn’t much alter the outlook for interest rates. Investors expect the BOE to begin raising short-term interest rates in the U.K. in mid-2016. “By early 2017 I believe the effect will have faded,” he said. “So the best response is not to worry about this risk should it materialize.” Consumer prices in the U.K. fell on the year for the first time in more than half a century in April but the BOE’s latest forecasts show officials expect the current weakness in inflation in the U.K. to swiftly pass. Officials expect annual inflation to return to its 2% target by 2017. Mr. Weale was one of two BOE officials who pushed to raise the BOE’s benchmark rate in the latter half of 2014. He hasn’t voted for an increase in borrowing costs this year, although recent minutes of officials’ deliberations show that for two officials the decision not to raise rates has been a close call. Analysts believe Mr. Weale was one of them. Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
