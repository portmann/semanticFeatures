New U.S. Bank Formation Weakest in 50 Years - Real Time Economics - WSJ New U.S. banks are being created at the slowest pace in half a century, according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond who say this could reduce the availability Â of credit to small businesses. The rate of new-bank formation has slipped from an average of around 100 per year since 1990 to an average of only about three per year since 2010, write Roisin McCord, Edward Simpson Prescott and Tim Sablik. â€œThis collapse in new bank entry has no precedent during the past 50 years, and it could have significant economic repercussions,â€? the report says. â€œIn particular, the decline in new bank entry disproportionately decreases the number of community banks because most new banks start small,â€? the authors say. â€œSince small banks have a comparative advantage in lending to small businesses, their declining number could affect the allocation of credit to different sectors in the economy.â€? Why is this happening? The authors offer two competing theories, but donâ€™t settle on a single conclusion. On the one hand, weak bank formation could be the product of weak economic activity and low interest rates, which is making it harder for banks to turn a profit. Another possibility is increased costs and regulatory burdens for starting a bank and maintaining compliance. Time will tell which of the two is the best explanation. If new entrants â€œare absent due to the low interest rate environment and weak economic recovery, then entry should increase as the economy improves and the Fed raises interest rates,â€? the authors conclude. â€œIf regulatory costs are the driving force behind low entry rates, then future entry will depend on how those costs change over time.â€?
