Fed Will Tighten Before Rate Hike: S&P 500 Risk - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha The Fed specifically cites their high reserves as a risk to inflation. The Fed said their inflation mandate is in plain site. Opinions are great but markets need a catalyst. Houston we have a catalyst. The Fed led by near mandate inflation will likely begin lowering reserves which will hit markets. We show here that the Fed's plan is to reduce reserves BEFORE they NEED to raise rates, which is why we expect that now. (Picture: We love the Fed's official crest.) Summary: We expect Fed reserve balances (which correlate to market prices) to start moving lower which will hit markets. We believe the Fed is currently near their inflation mandate, which will be the catalyst. "The Committee has the tools it needs to tighten monetary policy at the appropriate time." We will now show the Fed will likely use other tools besides rates to tighten first (we expect that to hit markets (NYSEARCA: SPY )). What are the "tools it needs?" Rates, yes. But they have other tools too like the reserve balances themselves that ballooned after the 2008 crash. For this understanding, we have to agree on an assumption. Our assumption is we listen very carefully to what the Fed says, how it's said and the order it is said. Fair? Especially from the Fed and especially on a planned public website with huge swaths of time to decide each word and their order. Okay, please let's look at the order (See for yourself here or we'll put the entire message at the end of this report.) What's their first tool from sentence one? Sentence two. Sentence Two: "The FOMC issued its principles and plans for normalization in September 2014." That's their first tool. Regardless of a strengthening economy or inflation off the charts, the Fed wants to "normalize" anyway (That is the process moving from the ABnormal amount of high reserves that are inflationary as you can see they know by their question.). We think that is now. Why? It needs to be before inflation gets worse. These are the tools to AVOID inflation. These are the tools to answer their first question of why "the size of its balance sheet won't lead to excessive inflation." Fed Governor Tarullo recently showed how they may meet their inflation mandate within the next year. So the "before" inflation is now. Sentence Three: Again, this comes before ANY rate moves. The process of "normalization" (the process from moving from the ABnormal, which we are in) is BEFORE rate moves. That means tightening will precede the rate moves that EVERYONE IS WATCHING FOR. That tightening will likely come in the form of lower reserves. Those reserve moves, as we have shown and will show have predicted market moves (Dare we say, we think people are focused on the wrong monetary tools). Here's the third sentence (we already agreed sequence matters.) "In that document, the Committee indicated that during normalization it intends to continue to set a range for the federal funds rate and to use its policy tools to keep the funds rate in the target range." They will cut reserves, which is the process of normalization, but leave rates the same. The rate moves will not be the first shoe to drop. If we hear about rate moves reserves likely already started going down to precede it (The order of these sentences). PS reserves dropped last week and are now near the year's lows. This may be happening right now. We need to continue to monitor the numbers. "When economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative monetary policy, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate." We're going to Elazarize that statement for you. They said, "when." We want to remind you about "before" which we think is right now. Before the economy warrants a less accommodative policy, the Fed will have lowered reserves. They will have tightened according to this plan before "the economic outlook warrant[s] a less accommodative monetary policy." (Elazar groupies will like this next sentence.) "When" is too late because "before" will already have happened. When "when" happens, the fed will have already tightened with lower reserves "before." Fed Governor Powell said in a speech last week that we are not far from the Fed's mandate of 2% inflation. We cited that he gave math that if oil and the dollar stay where they are, we will be there soon. (We think oil is going higher though and dollar lower so we expect it even sooner.) We're crazy for saying so but Wall Street is overly fixated on rate moves. We just showed you the Fed has other priorities before rates. Please focus on reserves, which we think, will go down before rates rise. Those reserves have gone lockstep with the markets as we've shown countless times. Reserves ticked down recently. We need to watch if it's a trend. We have no problem to expect, based on the above, that a drop in reserve balances will precede when "the economic outlook warrants" because of their policy to move from the ABnormal to "normalization." This will hit markets as we've shown many times but we'll give you the nifty grid again. This grid shows how the change in Fed reserves precisely correlated with market moves. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has undertaken a highly accommodative monetary policy. In addition to maintaining an exceptionally low level for the federal funds rate, the Committee expanded the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities as a means to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative. These actions have helped to support a stronger economic recovery and ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Committee's mandate to maintain maximum employment and stable prices. The FOMC monitors the stance of monetary policy, the economic outlook, and financial developments closely. The Committee has the tools it needs to tighten monetary policy at the appropriate time. The FOMC issued its principles and plans for normalization in September 2014. In that document, the Committee indicated that during normalization it intends to continue to set a range for the federal funds rate and to use its policy tools to keep the funds rate in the target range. When economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative monetary policy, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate. During normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the FOMC primarily by adjusting the interest rate it pays on excess reserve balances. In addition, the Federal Reserve intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. The Committee will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate. The Committee is prepared to adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial developments."
