5 Things to Watch at This Week’s Fed Meeting - WSJ Donâ€™t expect any clear signals out of this meeting about the timing of the Federal Reserveâ€™s first interest rate increase. The central bank has made clear it wonâ€™t start moving rates Â at its two-day policy meeting this week. Chairwoman Janet Yellen is not holding a press conference afterward and central bank officials are not releasing new economic projections. So investorsâ€™ only new clues from the meeting about the Fedâ€™s thinking will lie in its statement, to be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT. The Fed will probably repeat that it wonâ€™t start lifting borrowing costs until it sees more improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident inflation will move toward its 2% target. Beyond that, any changes could be very subtle. How will Fed officials describe the winter slowdown in U.S. economic growth? Will they attribute it primarily or only partially to temporary factors such as the weather? Some Fed officials in recent comments Â have been upbeat about the likelihood of a strong rebound, while others sound more wary. How will they characterize the recent slowdown in hiring? The Labor Department reported that payroll growth lost momentum in March Â and was weaker than earlier estimated in January and February. Will Fed officials sound sanguine or concerned? Will they see it as a mild soft patch or something more ominous? U.S. inflation has been running below the Fedâ€™s target for nearly three years, but in March officials said they still expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2% over time. They are likely to stick to that line Wednesday. However, they could note that both inflation and oil prices have stabilized recently after several months of decline. Fed officials could note that a dip in market indicators of inflation expectations earlier in the year has since reversed course. This probably brings some relief to Fed officials uncomfortable with persistent below-target readings on consumer price inflation. What will they say, if anything, about the strong U.S. dollar, which has become a significant factor in their economic outlook? The greenbackâ€™s rise in past months hurts economic growth by curbing exports and damps inflation by lowering prices on imports. Fed officials did not mention the dollar explicitly Â in their March statement, but appeared to refer to it implicitly by mentioning the â€œtransitory effects of energy price declines and other factorsâ€? on inflation. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
