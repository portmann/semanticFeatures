Raising Definition of Price Stability ‘Misguided’, Says ECB’s Mersch - Real Time Economics - WSJ General view of the new headquaters of the European Central Bank pictured Dec. 4, 2014 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. (Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images) The European Central Bank can’t change the fundamental goal of its monetary policy, even in times that call for extraordinary measures, said European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch in remarks published Monday. “What anchors trust in the central bank is that our objective and strategy stay, constant–and this is even more important when monetary policy becomes more unconventional,” he said. “For this reason, innovative ideas to change our strategy, such as targeting a price level, would in fact be counterproductive in the current environment.” “Out goes also the misguided idea to increase our definition of price stability,” he said. Broadly speaking, price level targeting refers to the idea that instead of targeting the inflation rate over a certain period of time, the central bank aims to have prices at a particular level. This means that if inflation were too high one year, the central bank could be forced to engineer deflation in the following year to bring prices back to target. The ECB defines price stability as inflation at just below 2% over the medium term. Mr. Mersch said that despite the success of ECB actions thus far, “it is important that we do not get carried away. Unconventional monetary policy must remain exceptional and time-bound.” He said that “the longer such measures persist, the greater the risks that can come with it.” He suggested also that the ECB should keep up the pace of its bond buys as announced. “We need to maintain the pace and volume of our interventions, as we have communicated, so that inflation rises back towards 2% as quickly as possible and that monetary policy can begin once more to normalize.” The ECB said in January that it would buy â‚¬60 billion ($68.7 billion) per month in mostly government bonds between March this year and September 2016. Mr. Mersch defended the ECB’s decision to buy government bonds, saying that it helped send “a strong signal that we will safeguard price stability no matter what.” He also forcefully defended the ECB’s mission saying that while “some might wish that we use our armory for other purposes…we will not be moved.” “We are an independent institution. Our rules are non-negotiable and we do not act for the benefit of interest groups or individual countries. Nor can financial stability considerations override our primary objective,” he said.
