Fed Seeks Comment on Technical Details of Interest on Reserves Power - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal ReserveÂ said Monday it is seeking feedback on the details of a program it plans to use to help control short-term interest rates. In a press release, the Fed said it was seeking comment on how it will calculate the interest it will pay banks to park reserves on the Fedâ€™s books. This power to pay interest on excess reserves, currently set at near-zero levels, will be the Fedâ€™s chief way of setting short-term interest rates when central bankers decide to begin boosting costs. The Fed says it would like to change how it pays interest to program participants in a manner that would help better align any potential change in rates with existing reporting requirements faced by the deposit-taking banks. It now pays interest based on average rate and reserve balance levels over a two-week period, but it would like to be able to pay the rate based on a daily calculation. The Fed wants the change to â€œenhance the effectivenessâ€? of the interest on reserve rate when changes in it do not line with with the so-called â€œmaintenance periodâ€? banks are operating under. The central bank expects that changes in the interest on reserves rate will help it control the massive level of liquidity banks have parked on its books after multiple Fed stimulus campaigns. It will supplement this rate with other tools to help control liquidity and influence borrowing costs. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates this year, and for some time now, it has been fine tuning how it will go about this process. It said in its press release that in seeking comment, the announcement had no implications for the â€œnear-termâ€? conduct of monetary policy.
