Grand Central: Time for the Red Queen to Stop? - Real Time Economics - WSJ And so it continues. Seven years on from the financial crisis, and six years on from the Great Recession, central banks around the world continue to cut their benchmark interest rates or otherwise ease monetary policy. Romania’s central bank was the latest of these, lowering its key rate Tuesday, following Australia by a few hours. Norway’s central bank declined to make it a trifecta Wednesday, but hinted that it may cut at its next meeting. Another potential easer is New Zealand. In the first half of last year, its central bank hiked four times, and was seen as a pathfinder for others on the way towards normalizing rates. But as most of the rest of Asia has eased policy-a strengthening New Zealand dollar has contributed to a sharp decline in inflation. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China continue to provide fresh stimulus. There seems to be a Red Queen effect in some of this, with central banks having to act just to stay in the same place. As inflation rates fall, real interest rates rise, and more stimulus is needed to maintain the status quo. The same principle applies to currency movements–as New Zealand’s predicament shows, leaving policy unchanged while the national currency appreciates sharply is the same as tightening. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are rare examples of institutions that seem comfortable with that course in 2015. But the persistence of abnormally stimulative monetary policy raises some fundamental questions. The early months of 2015 suggest the global economy won’t grow much more quickly this year than it did in 2014, and may even slow. Inflation rates seem to have stopped falling, but they are still very low. What central banks have been doing for the past seven years doesn’t seem to have removed the need for more of what central banks have been doing. It seems increasingly possible that central banks should have been doing something different, and that what they’ve been doing is part of the problem. An Important Jobs Report for Fed Officials Eyeing Rate Increases. Federal Reserve officials are counting on an economic rebound in the weeks ahead after a disappointing first quarter. Friday morning theyâ€™ll get their first concrete evidence of whether such a bounce back is materializing. By now youâ€™ve likely read lots about the effects of cold weather, snow and labor disruptions at ports on growth and hiring in the first quarter. Well, the sun shined in April and Fed officials want to see confirmation that gave some heat back to the economy. Here is an overview of the details theyâ€™ll be watching closely. Fed’s Evans: No Reason to Rush Rate Increase â€“CNBC. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Thursday he expects a “bounce back” in the U.S. economy in the second quarter consistent with 2.5% to 3% growth but still sees no reason to rush an interest rate increase. “I think optimal monetary policy would push it into 2016,â€? he said during an interview on CNBC. â€“Dow Jones Newswires Warren and Vitter Introduce Fed Legislation. Massachusetts liberal Elizabeth Warren and Louisiana conservative David Vitter introduced legislation to force the seven-member Fed board to formally vote on all enforcement actions against banks that result in fines of $1 million or more. The bill, introduced by the two senators Thursday, also would give each Fed governor his or her own staff. Currently, Fed board staff largely serves the Fed chairwoman or chairman. Yellen Meetings with Lawmakers Jumped in March, Following February Grillings. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen stepped up her outreach on Capitol Hill in March after coming under fire from lawmakers who want to subject the central bank to greater scrutiny. Ms. Yellen met with lawmakers six times in March, the most meetings sheâ€™s held with members of Congress in a single month since June 2014. The March meetings came shortly after Ms. Yellenâ€™s semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill Feb. 24-25, when she was grilled over whether the Fed is tough enough on the big banks its regulates and whether Congress should revamp its structure. Borrowing Ramps Up. Total U.S. debt balances increased by a seasonally adjusted $20.52 billion to $3.36 trillion in March, the Fed said Thursday. The expansion showed both increased credit-card balances and more borrowing for cars and education. This could bode well for GDP . For growth to rebound this spring, consumers will likely need to step up their spending. But Consumers Banked Gas Savings Anticipating Price Spikes. U.S. consumers thought last yearâ€™s drop in gas prices was temporary, which made them reluctant to spend the windfall , said Visaâ€™s chief economic Wayne Best. A Visa survey found about 70 percent of respondents believe gas prices will continue to increase, which would lead them to spend less in anticipation. ECBâ€™s Liikanen: Bond-Buying Program Has Stimulated Inflation Expectations. The European Central Bankâ€™s government bond-buying program has stimulated inflation expectations , ECB policymaker Erkki Liikanen said on Friday. â€œWeâ€™re not at the levels where we should be, but the direction is right,â€? he said. Mersch: QE is Temporary.â€? ECB executive board member Yves Mersch Thursday called the ECB’s “forceful monetary accommodation” currently in place “unconventional and temporary.” He also said eurozone governments need to step up to improve their economies. â€œContinuous reform is needed to… develop a strategy for dealing with increased private and public risk sharing,” he said.â€”Dow Jones Newswires. Deal in Sight for Greece. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis sees an agreement between the country and its lenders is â€œin the offing in the next few days or weeks.â€? Greece is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European Commission over the next slice of its EUR245 billion rescue package. Greece owes a EUR750 million loan repayment to the IMF by May 12. BOJ Minutes Show Bow Board Spurned Calls for Tapering. The Bank of Japanâ€™s toughest inside critic of aggressive easing measures met with stiff resistance from other policy setters when he proposed slashing the central bankâ€™s asset purchases at a policy meeting in early April, according to minutes of the meeting released Friday. The summary of discussions at the April 7-8 gathering signaled the resolve of the majority of the BOJâ€™s board members to continue their aggressive asset-purchase program aimed at spurring inflation higher.â€”Dow Jones Newswires. Brazil Central Bank Hints at Higher Rates. Inflation is high because of the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the dollar and increase in government-controlled prices for gasoline and electricity, the central bank said in minutes of its most recent meeting. Last week, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 13.25% from 12.75%. Brazilâ€™s consumer-price index is now at 8.2%, well above the central bankâ€™s 4.5% target with a two-percentage point tolerance range up or down. Czech Central Bank Leaves Policy Unchanged. The central bank’s benchmark interest rate is at an all-time low of 0.05% and Thursdayâ€™s decision, which was widely expected, maintains the bank’s commitment to prevent the koruna from appreciating beyond 27 to the euro. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires Select Your Major Wisely. Thatâ€™s the lesson to be gleaned from a new Georgetown University study comparing lifetime earnings of students based on their majors. As you might expect, those with degrees in field such as petroleum engineering earn much more than those who major in early-childhood education (median annual earnings of $136,000 vs. $39,000). Regardless of major, going to college pays off. Median annual earnings for college graduates are more than $20,000 higher than for high school graduates . -1230 GMT (8:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s ConstÃ¢ncio speaks on financial regulation in London -9:45 a.m. EDT: New York Fed President William Dudley delivers a speech to the 17th Annual Bronx Bankers Breakfast in New York. RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gender Discrimination Hurts Growth. â€œLess legal discrimination against women is strongly associated with higher female labor force participation,â€? according to an IMF report . â€œThe policy implication of these findings is clear: countries that want to increase female labor force participation would do well to review and reform legal rules and institutions with a view to creating a level playing field.â€? Bonds are overvalued, not stocks, and here’s why, writes Greg Ip in the Journal.Â  â€œ Janet Yellen , the Federal Reserve chairwoman, shook up markets yesterday by noting that stock market valuations were â€˜quite high.â€™ She also acknowledged stocks arenâ€™t quite so pricey when compared to bonds. And thatâ€™s an important caveat, because itâ€™s bonds, not stocks, whose valuations are extreme; so extreme they make stocks positively cheap.â€? Fed â€˜Liftoffâ€™ Wonâ€™t Send Banks Into Orbit. The Journalâ€™s Justin Lahart and John Carney caution against thinking that interest income will take off once the Fed raises interest rates. â€œThe pace of further increases may be slower than many investors anticipate, leaving banks with a trickle of additional interest income where they are hoping for a steady flow.â€? Why We Should Not Blame the ECB for Low Returns on German Savings. The real culprit behind low interest rates? Bruegelâ€™s Guntram B. Wolff points the finger at secular stagnation. â€œI would argue that an appropriate set of structural reforms is urgently needed to allow for proper business opportunities and innovation in the industrialized world. This is also particularly important in Germany. German corporations tend to invest abroad rather than in Germany, a development that is shown by the huge current account surplus, and is actually a concern which reflects the weakness of investment opportunities and the lack of demand in Germany.â€? Financial Stress Index Up. At -1.208, the index, produced by the St. Louis Fed, is still below its historical average. But last weekâ€™s rise was the first in seven weeks. The regional reserve bank said corporate bond market forces drove the increase.â€”Dow Jones Newswires -Chinaâ€™s economy suffers another blow as exports unexpectedly fall . -The First IPO Scramble.
