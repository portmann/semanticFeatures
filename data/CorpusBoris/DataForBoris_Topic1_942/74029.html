5 Points to Watch in the ECB’s June Presser - WSJ The European Central Bank meets Wednesday against a backdrop of a slowly improving economy and rising consumer prices, as the bank’s quantitative easing program gains traction. That doesn’t mean ECB President Mario Draghi will be in for an easy time at his post-meeting press conference, where he will likely face questions about the ECB’s willingness to keep propping up Greek banks, the inflation outlook in Europe and the recent disclosure of market-sensitive information by a top ECB board member to an audience that included hedge funds and investors. As Greece’s talks with its international creditors drag on, the country’s banks have become increasingly dependent on ECB funds amid deposit outflows. If Athens starts missing payments to the International Monetary Fund this month, the ECB’s support of Greece — and the ECBâ€™s collateral rules for the loans — would look untenable. Mr. Draghi was part of a crisis summit Monday night in Berlin. Expect him to be pressed on how much patience the ECB has left, and whether Athens faces a last-chance ultimatum to strike a deal. Last month, ECB executive board memberÂ BenoÃ®t CÅ“urÃ© said the ECB would frontload bond purchases in May and June under the â‚¬60 billion monthly bond buying program–due to run at least until September 2016–to take into account an expected summer lull in market liquidity. There was a bit of frontloading last month, but not much with purchases of â‚¬63 billion. Mr. Draghi will likely be asked for additional details, and look for him to reaffirm the ECB’s intention to run the program at least through September 2016. Eurozone inflation was 0.3% in May, well below the ECB’s target near 2%. But it’s come a long way from January, when consumer prices contracted 0.6% annually, and core inflation increased last month as well. The ECB has tied its QE program to inflation, but has given itself some wiggle room too by saying it wants to see a “sustained” move in inflation toward the 2% goal. Mr. Draghi will probably emphasize that inflation still has a long way to go to meet that threshold and that any talk of tapering QE is premature. Gross domestic product in the eurozone expanded moderately in the first quarter , but so far the blocâ€™s recovery from a pair of recessions has been quite weak. A more pronounced upswing seems unlikely anytime soon, which gives Mr. Draghi an opportunity to press governments again for more economic reforms aimed at raising the economyâ€™s growth potential. Mr. CÅ“urÃ©’s speech stirred a lot of controversy after he delivered market-sensitive remarks on QE frontloading last month to an audience that included hedge funds and other investors, about 12 hours before the ECB made them public . The European Union has asked the ECB for “a more detailed account of the incident” as well as its plans for keeping this from happening again. Wednesday’s press conference will give Mr. Draghi a chance to offer his perspective on all this. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
