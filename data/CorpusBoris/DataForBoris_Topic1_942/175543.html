Economists React to the Federal Reserve’s Interest Rate Decision: ‘Relief’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged on Thursday after weeks of market-churning debate at the central bank about whether it was time to end an era of near-zero rates. Officials noted concerns about recent turbulence in financial markets and in economies abroad. Hereâ€™s what some economists are saying: “The Federal Reserveâ€™s third mandate appears to be global financial stability. The U.S. central bank has backed away from its first rate rise in over nine years, saying that international economic and financial weakness could dampen activity in the U.S….The reluctance of Fed officials to hike now can be linked to market conditions and their eagerness to avoid a premature move that risks stifling growth.” –Mark Haefele, UBS “Strong data on job creation in the U.S. continue to suggest strongly that the current stance of Fed policy is too loose, but global considerations apparently are weighing on the Committee. Indeed, the question is less ‘When will the Fed initiate normalization?’ and more ‘Will the Fed tighten this year?’ We do not believe that Fed officials are worried at this point about being behind the curve on inflation. But issues of financial stability probably still are a concern, with the prospect of future asset bubbles rising the longer policy remains geared toward ‘emergency’ conditions.” –Dana Saporta, Credit Suisse “This is now the most cautious, overly risk management oriented Federal Reserve in history. They arenâ€™t done yet.Â  They just wonâ€™t stop easing.Â  The Greenspan and even the Bernanke Feds wouldnâ€™t stop fighting inflation, and the Yellen Fed wonâ€™t stop fighting unemployment.Â  The domestic labor market isnâ€™t good enough for them yet either….Fed policy is held hostage by events outside our borders.” –Chris Rupkey, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi “There is no change in rates in this statement, we see a cautious tone, suggesting–contrary to expectationsâ€”that a rate hike by the end of the year is no sure thing. The FOMC notes that global economic and financial developments may restrain growth here and put downward pressure on inflation.” –Scott Brown, Raymond James “Not only did the Fed leave rates unchanged, but the statement did not have a whiff of a Hawkish tone. The Fed appears to be increasingly concerned on the inflation front with still-sluggishly low prices, and declining expectations as measured by market-based indices.Â  In other words, the Fed was willing to raise rates sooner than later if Committee members were confident that inflation was at least heading back towards the long-run target of 2%.Â  The data, however, suggests the exact opposite: inflation may continue to retreat further from the Fedâ€™s preferred level of 2% for some time.” –Lindsey Piegza, Stifel Economics “The rise in the euro against the dollar in response to the Fed’s decision to leave interest rates on hold highlights our view that quantitative easing in the eurozone cannot guarantee a weak euro. If the Fed were to becomeÂ  more dovish in response to emerging market concerns, the shield that the weak euro has provided the eurozone economy and its exporters could crumble and force the European Central Bank to either increase monthly bond purchases or signal an extension of the QE program beyond the initial planned end date of September 2016. Nonetheless, it still only seems a matter of time before the Fed starts to raise interest rates and the diverging monetary policy stance between the Fed and the ECB should prompt future renewed falls in the euro.â€? –Ben May, Oxford Economics “The mention of ‘monitoring developments abroad’ hints at a concern with global conditions such as the Chinese stock market selloff played a significant part in the central bank holding rates….The U.S. dollar is losing ground across the board as the timing of the rate hike is being pushed back. The dollar was boosted by potential interest rate divergence and the more the Fed delays the first rate hike, the market will punish the dollar.” â€”Alfonso Esparza, Oanda “While the labor market has made sufficient progress to raise the federal funds rate from rock bottom, inflation is still running below target, convincing the Fed that it can afford to wait a little longer without fear that the economy is close to overheating….The delay will come as a relief at a time when concerns about the health of the global economy are mounting, particularly given the recent softening in China and the recessions in Brazil and Russia….Instead the Fed will wait, until December at the earliest, and the path of monetary tightening will be slow and measured.â€? –Joseph Lake, Economist Intelligence Unit “The Federal Reserve has said that it is data-dependent, and while there is positive data out there, itâ€™s clear more time is needed to evaluate incoming data in order to ensure sufficient progress….All eyes will now turn to the Dec. 15-16 meeting of the FOMC. Conventional wisdom continues to hold that short-term rates will increase by yearâ€™s end, with the December meeting being the most likely option. The other possibility would be the Oct. 27-28 meeting, but that seems less likely.” –Chad Moutray, chief economist, National Association of Manufacturers â€œU.S. growth is acknowledged to be tied to global eventsâ€¦. Looking forward, the China story is not likely to get better before it gets worse. As this slo-mo implosion reverberates through the global economy, the last the thing the Fed wants to be doing is being the only central bank raising rates and therefore boosting the dollar.”Â –Steve Blitz, ITG Investment Research, Inc. “The uptick in 2015 growth is offset by a downward revision to 2016 and the jobless rate projections were also lowered. This will be interpreted by the Street as signaling that the Committee now believes the noninflationary jobless rate continues to drift lower. Perhaps this is the beginning of the Fed taking on board the idea that excess global capacity is playing a bigger role in determining domestic wages and prices than the trade number themselves imply.” –Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities “All the will-they-wonâ€™t-they speculation aside, there was no urgency for the Fed to act today. Metrics from wages to capacity utilization show a US economy that is far from overheating. Given this lack of urgency, the Committeeâ€™s decision to keep its powder dry for another day is logical and prudent. Noting in its communique the disruptive potential of recent global developments, the Fed gave itself plenty of room to reassess conditions between now and December with an eye towards a plausible lift-off then.” –Katrina Lamb, MV Financial “While the Fed is focused on the health of the U.S. economy, as it should be, weaknesses outside the U.S. appear to be driving caution with regards to a monetary policy move. Recent inflation numbers offered no sign of urgency to ratchet down aggregate demand through higher interest rates. The balancing act of the Fed, whether to raise rates or not, continues.” –Perc Pineda, Credit Union National Association We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

"I am pleased the Federal Reserve under the leadership of Chair Yellen has chosen to exercise a prudent and cautious approach to safeguarding our economy by carefully weighing the full range of economic data in assessing whether to raise interest rates.  Moving to prematurely raise rates will endanger the critical economic progress we have made, and threaten any gains minorities have only begun to make on the tail end of this recovery. " Zero Hedge, as usual, had the most succinct summary: Fed Credibility Crushed (not that they had any to begin with). As long as the Fed is allowed to redefine what constitutes inflation, the rate will always be where it is most convenient. The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged on Thursday after weeks of market-churning debate at the central bank about whether it was time to end an era of near-zero rates. Since there was never any possibility of a rate rise, despite all the contrived jawboning of the Fed's mouthpieces, the "market-churning debate" looks more like currency manipulation scheme on behalf of the Fed's financier accomplices and cronies rather than a genuine debate.  Janet and her ilk know that if they raise rates, they crush these Ponzi markets, so they will never raise of their own accord no matter what the falsified "data" tells them.
