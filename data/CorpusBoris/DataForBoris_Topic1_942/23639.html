Fed’s Dudley: Timing of First Interest-Rate Hike Might Be a Bit Later - Real Time Economics - WSJ William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said a June rate hike faces a bigger hurdle following weak economic data. The string of disappointing U.S. economic data recently is setting the bar higher for the Federal Reserve to begin raising rates this June, a top Fed official said Wednesday. â€œIf you look at the broad set of data that we’ve gotten in recent months, data has very much surprised to the downside,â€? said William Dudley , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event. â€œItâ€™d be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fed’s first rate hike might be a little further off in time. I can imagine a situation where a June rate could still be in playâ€¦.but obviously itâ€™s a bigger hurdle because weâ€™ve had a lot of weak data.Â  Now you have to see sufficient data on the other side. Now the bar is a little higher.â€? Mr. Dudley, a voter on the Fedâ€™s policy-setting board, pointed to still-subdued inflation and disappointing factory data, in addition to the weak March payrolls report that has painted a downbeat picture of the U.S. economy lately. In a speech on Monday, the official estimated the economy expanded at an annual rate of just 1% in theÂ  first quarter . While the official didnâ€™t take the possibility of a June interest-rate increase off the table, he noted that there are reasons the Fed would rather risk tightening policy too late than risk acting too early. â€œThere are reasons to err on the side of being late than being early,â€? Mr. Dudley said. â€œIf you have to reverse course, you’re back at zero bound [for interest rates], and you will have lost some credibility.â€? The central banker added a gradual tightening process is warranted in the aftermath of such a severe financial crisis, as it is important to get Americans who have been long out of a job back to work before skills atrophy. Still, Mr. Dudley said itâ€™s reasonable to believe the Fedâ€™s lift-off process will begin some time in 2015. While consumer spending, business investing and the housing market are recovering more slowly than he would like, Mr. Dudley said he is seeing a small uptick in wages and that temporary factors like winter weather likely play a large role in impacting first-quarter activity. The official reiterated that the Fedâ€™s policy decision will depend on trends in incoming economic data, while not putting too much weight on any one specific data point, such as last Fridayâ€™s employment report. That release showed the U.S. adding just 126,000 jobs in March.
