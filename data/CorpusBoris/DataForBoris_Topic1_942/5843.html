Federal Reserve officials are likely this week to clear the way for raising short-term interest rates from near zero later this year. This would appear to represent another step on the path back to a more “normal” monetary policy, coming after their decision last year to end their latest bond-buying program. But looking at central bank policies around the world, it’s clear that seven years after the financial crisis, a return to normal looks further and further away. The ECB will be easing at least through September 2016 through its new bond-buying program. The Bank of Japan is still buying assets and could decide by the autumn that it needs to inject still more cash into the economy. Economists expect the People’s Bank of China to make one or two cuts to interest rates, starting as early as the second quarter, and totaling up to a half-percentage point this year. The Fed is still the dominant influence on global monetary policy, but it now finds itself operating in a more multi-polar world. Many other central banks adjust their policies in reaction to their most influential neighbor. Three European central banks, for instance, have responded to the ECBâ€™s latest stimulus effort by pushing their own interest rates into negative territory.Â  In Asia, the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Thailand cut their policy rates last week, inspired in part by a weaker yen and intense competition from Chinese manufacturers. These cross currents reflect the fact that economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. of late than in many other parts of the world. The strengthening of the dollar in anticipation of a Fed move, and the related weakening of other currencies, may help boost growth in Europe and Asia. The big question is whether the price will be a softening of U.S. growth and inflation, which could restrain the Fedâ€™s willingness to raise rates. In other words, is it possible for one central bank, however powerful, to go it alone? The Bank of England is facing somewhat similar challenges. Gov. Mark Carney last week signaled a reluctance to go against the flow , saying in a speech that U.K. interest rates may rise more slowly than expected if global inflation remains low. The U.S. economy, of course, is less susceptible to external forces than that of the U.K. But as 2015 rolls on, it looks more and more likely that the Fed will be on its own for quite a while if it moves this year. Broadest Unemployment Measure â€˜Less Rosy.’ The U.S. unemployment rate is near levels usually consistent with a healthy labor market. Federal Reserve officials this week will assess whether this time is different. Their conclusion about the labor marketâ€™s true health could shape the central bankâ€™s signals to the public Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting. Itâ€™s also likely to become a focal point for investors in the coming months as the Fed weighs when to start raising interest ratesâ€”perhaps as early as June. Fed Forward Guidance: A Look Back.Â After years of promising interest rates will stay low for a while, the Federal Reserve is likely to become a bit less predictable . Since late 2008, the Fed has used a variety of verbal expressionsâ€”a policy approach known as â€œ forward guidance â€œâ€“ to assure investors its benchmark short-term rate would probably stay near zero for some time. ECBâ€™s Draghi Sees Eurozone Recovery.Â  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Monday that an economic recovery is taking hold in the eurozone thanks in part to the bankâ€™s stimulus moves, and he urged governments to use the brighter outlook to advance reforms that would improve the regionâ€™s long-term growth prospects. â€œThe current upturn in economic conditions, which the ECB has helped to generate, must be used,â€? Mr. Draghi said in a speech in Frankfurt. Bank of Japan Sees â€˜Zero Percentâ€™ Inflation Ahead. The Bank of Japan left its monetary policy unchanged Tuesday, despite a sinking inflation rate that it said would be â€œabout zero percentâ€? in the months ahead, indicating that it saw at least a chance of a brief return to deflation . Â Indonesia Opts Out of Rate-Cut Rush.Â Bank Indonesia kept interest rates unchanged Tuesday, as the rupiahâ€™s recent volatility kept the central bank from joining other Asian nations in cutting interest rates further. Economists Welcome New BOE Decision-Making Procedures.Â Britainâ€™s top economists have broadly welcomed a suite of reforms proposed by the Bank of England last year aimed at making its decision-making processes more transparent . Russian Central Bank Considers Halting Currency Trade for Volatility. The Bank of Russia is considering halting currency trade if the ruble shows excessive volatility , the central bank’s first deputy chairman said Monday. Dmitry Tulin said the central bank would like to avoid a situation when strong ruble fluctuations are driven by very low trading volumes. Norway to Consider Tighter Lending Rules Amid High Household Debts.Â Norway’s Financial Supervisory Authority proposed Tuesday tighter bank lending regulation, in a move to curb surging housing prices and household debts and reduce the risk of financial instability. Â The recommendations would restrict banks’ freedom to make exceptions from established lending norms, and could contribute to tighter lending practices, the FSA said in a statement–Dow Jones Newswires. Australia Central Bank To Move Cautiously On Rate Cuts.Â Australia’s central bank indicated Tuesday that while further interest rate cuts are likely over time to support growth and lower unemployment, it will likely move cautiously to see how the economy responds to earlier cuts–Dow Jones Newswires. Working Minority Families Are Twice As Likely To Be Low-Income As Whites. Among Americaâ€™s working poor, a significant divide is growing between white families and most minority groups. Working minority families are twice as likely to be low-income â€” meaning their total income fell below 200% of the poverty level â€” as white working families, according to a new report from the Working Poor Families Project analyzing U.S. Census data. And the gap has only increased since the start of the last recession, the studyâ€™s authors said . -Join the Journalâ€™s Jon Hilsenrath and Sudeep Reddy for a live video Spreecast chat at 11 a.m. EDT at this site .

Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s economic policies could reduce income inequality, helping younger people especially, if he fully implements a planned labor market overhaul, according to economists at the International Monetary Fund. But achieving the Bank of Japan’s 2% inflation target through quantitative easing without accomplishing those changes will increase income inequality even as it broadly raises incomes, they said in a working paper. COMMENTARYÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The End of ‘Patient’ and Questions for Yellen. “By dropping ‘patient’ the Fed will be taking another step toward the first rate hike of this cycle,” Tim Duy writes on his blog. “But how long do we need to wait until that first hike? That depends on the data, and we will be listening for signals as to how, or how not, the Fed is being impacted by recent data aside from the positive readings on the labor market.” Go Ahead, Bash the Fed. “That the central bank generally works well is now conventional wisdom in much of the press corps,” Ramesh Ponnuru writes in a Bloomberg View column. “But the Fed doesn’t deserve all the praise it gets.” -U.S. industrial production rose slightly in February, but a decline in manufacturing output offered the latest evidence the economy softened in the current quarter, the Fed said Monday. -Consumer prices across the European Union fell again in February, but at a slower rate, a sign that the threat of a slide into deflation is easing as central banks rush to launch new stimulus measures.
