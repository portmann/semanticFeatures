Fed’s Fischer Says U.S. Inflation Still Too Low - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Friday U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target. During a question-and-answer session at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Fischer said he never thought he would encounter this problem as a policy maker, since for much of the last few decades any worries about inflation tended to be about prices picking up too quickly. â€œInflation is too low, we need to get it back up to 2%,â€? Mr. Fischer said in response to questions from Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue. â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™re keeping interest rates low, to encourage investmentâ€? and growth, he said. Mr. Fischer pushed back against Wall Street criticisms of financial regulation, saying the financial crisis proved the rules of the road were too lax and banks were far too reliant on debt, making them fragile and vulnerable to shocks. He said bank stress tests are a key innovation in bank supervision that has helped policy makers get a grip on a complex and highly interconnected financial system. Asked about the Fedâ€™s emergency lending powers, which are currently under attack by some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mr. Fischer said the lender of last resort function is a basic tenet of central banking.
