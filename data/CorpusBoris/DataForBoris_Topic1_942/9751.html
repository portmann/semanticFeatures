The Coming Wave of Fed Speakers - Real Time Economics - WSJ Over the next week, speakers from the U.S. Federal Reserve will be fanning out across the globe to speak on monetary-policy matters. Just days after an important policy meeting , Federal Reserve officials are fanning out around the world to share their individual views on a variety of issues. First up, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer is scheduled to speak on “monetary-policy lessons and the way ahead” at 12:20 p.m. EDT on Monday in New York. When Mr. Fischer last spoke publicly, in February, he wasn’t sure when the Fed would raise rates . On Monday, he could update that view, or build on his belief that the inherent uncertainty of the outlook means that it’s not possible for the Fed to give firm guidance about future actions. He also speaks publicly on Friday in Frankfurt at 6:30 a.m. EDT on regulatory issues. Also on Friday, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen travels back to her old haunt of the San Francisco Fedâ€”which she lead between 2004 and 2010â€”to speak on monetary policy issues. She is scheduled to speak at 3:45 p.m. EDT. Ms. Yellen extensively discussed the outlook for monetary policy and the economy in a press conference after the conclusion of the Fed meeting Wednesday. The central bank’s policy statement and Ms. Yellen’s remarks opened the door for officials to consider raising short-term interest rates as soon as their June policy meeting. Her speech Friday offers her a chance to expand on the topics. In between the two top officials are speeches by a slew of regional Fed bank officials overseas. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks in Paris at 4:40 a.m. EDT on Monday, followed by remarks by San Francisco President John Williams in Sydney, delivered at 10 p.m. EDT that same day. Tuesday morning brings a speech in London by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , scheduled for 5 a.m. EDT. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans appears in London on Wednesday at 6:30 a.m. EDT, and then Mr. Bullard is back at bat in Frankfurt at 3:30 a.m. EDT on Thursday. Together, the remarks could provide greater clarity about Fed officials’ differing views on the economy and policy in the months ahead.
