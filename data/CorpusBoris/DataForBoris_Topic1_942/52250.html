Grand Central: This Is Not An Irrational Exuberance Moment  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a long recitation Wednesday of risks she was watching in the financial system. Among those risks, she noted valuations on stocks were â€œquite highâ€? and that there were â€œpotential dangers there.â€? Some investors likened Ms. Yellenâ€™s comments about stock valuations to former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspanâ€™s famous 1996 warning of â€œirrational exuberanceâ€? in equity markets. But this is a far different time and her words had a far different meaning. The Fed leader â€“ speaking in a question-and-answer session with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde â€“ went on at length about various financial dangers officials are watching. Many of them should be familiar by now. Low interest rates give investors an incentive to search out high returns in risky investments, something Fed officials call the â€œreach for yield.â€? Low rates also give financial institutions and investors incentives to build up debt that they might have to quickly unwind. She also referred to the risk of a sudden rise in compensation investors demand for holding long-term debt that could unsettle bond markets. Ms. Yellen clearly doesnâ€™t want markets to be stretched and caught off guard when the Fed starts raising short-term interest rates, presumably later this year. Fed officials regularly worry about keeping market expectations aligned with their own. They want to avoid a repeat of the bond marketâ€™s â€œtaper tantrumâ€? of 2013, when long-term rates shot up as the Fed considered ending a bond-buying program. Still, the Fed leader doesnâ€™t sound like somebody firing intentional warning shots at exuberant stock investors or like somebody who is broadly worried about financial risk right now. Her conclusion: â€œMy assessment at this point would be that risks to financial stability are moderated, not elevated at this point. And I say that because we’re not seeing any broad-based pickup in leverage. We’re not seeing rapid credit growth. We’re not seeing an increase in maturity transformation. And I would call those things kind of the hallmark of a financial bubble or the precursors of a financial crisis, but these are things we of course are focusing on very carefully.â€? Mr. Greenspanâ€™s words back in 1996 were carefully calculated and ultimately ineffective at deflating a market that truly was exuberant and getting more so by the day. Stock valuations look stretched by a number of measures now, but it is hard to call investors truly exuberant about much of anything these days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.11% year-to-date. Ms. Yellenâ€™s main focus remains on deflating unemployment and ensuring she doesnâ€™t act too late to prevent an upturn in inflation. Fedâ€™s Yellen: Stock Valuations â€˜Generally Are Quite High.â€™Â Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen weighed in on a growing debate among investors and market economists, suggesting the yearslong stock rally may have driven prices too high and raising concerns that debt-market investors are taking excessive risks . Stern: Interest Rate Hikes Carry More Weight Than Words. One former Fed official said Ms. Yellenâ€™s warnings about stock valuations will be useless unless the Fed raises interest rates . â€œTalk by itself isnâ€™t going to turn out to be effective,â€? said Gary Stern, former president of the Minneapolis Fed. Raising rates, though, â€œwould be a clear way to follow through.â€? Lockhart: Rate Rise on Track, Data Permitting. Â Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said he remains hopeful the Fed will raise interest rates in the next few months , assuming the economyâ€™s weak start this year proves temporary. â€œAll meetings are in play â€¦ including June,â€? he said. He called market predictions of a September rate increase â€œa reasonable alignment with what I think to be the likely policy outlookâ€? for short-term rates. Mr. Lockhart said Fed officials will closely monitor coming economic data releases for signs that the first quarterâ€™s slump was transitory, particularly the April employment numbers, which come out Friday. U.S. Productivity Down for the Second Straight Quarter. First quarter productivity was down 1.9% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from the previous quarter, following a 2.1% drop in the fourth quarter. This is the first time since 2006 that productivity has been down for two consecutive quarters . Australian Rate Cut Falls Flat. Â A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia earlier this week hasnâ€™t panned out as expected, as bond yields have risen and the Australian dollar gotten stronger, stymying efforts to give a boost to the economy. Malaysia Central Bank Holds Benchmark Rate Steady at 3.25%.Â Malaysia’s central bank Thursday kept its overnight policy rate unchanged at 3.25% , as resilient domestic demand continued to power economic growth while inflation remained contained. Norwayâ€™s Central Bank Holds Rates. Â Norwayâ€™s central bank on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged at 1.25%, sending the krone to heights not seen since last October.Â Though Norges Bank signaled a rate cut is still possible next month , it disappointed those who had hoped a slowing economy would prompt monetary easing sooner. Hungary Central Bank Not Done Cutting Rates. Most of the nine-member rate panel said cuts â€œmay continue as long as it supports reaching the medium-term inflation target,â€? according to minutes from the bankâ€™s April meeting. On April 21, the committee unanimously cut the main rate to a record-low 1.80%, down from 1.95% and is expected to cut it further to 1.50% by June.â€“ Dow Jones Newswires Growth in the European Union on the Upswing. EU economists say the European Central Bankâ€™s monetary stimulus and cheaper oil will boost GDP growth by 1.5% in the Eurozone and by 1.8% in the broader EU, up from earlier predictions of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. Growth in Spain and Ireland, previously among the most troubled of Europeâ€™s economies, will be especially strong. By contrast, analysts slashed the forecast for Greece as the countryâ€™s standoff with its lenders continues. The long-term outlook is less rosy, however . - 1645 GMT (12:45 p.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Mersch speaks in Barcelona - Czech National Bank releases a policy statement RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Labor contribution to Potential GDP Slows: Labor input accounts for only about 0.6 percentage points of potential economic growth, down from at least 2.5 percentage points in the 1960â€™s and 1970â€™s because of the ageing of the population. Over time, as baby boomers retire in ever-growing numbers, labor productivity is going to have to increase to sustain the pace of growth in the U.S., write the New York Fedâ€™s Samuel Kapon and Joseph Tracy A Comparison of Greece and Germany: Lessons for the Eurozone? The European Central Bank’s bond-buying program, launched earlier this year, “will encourage recovery and, if sustained, return inflation to the 2% target. Those events will encourage the demand for Greek exports and lessen the need for deflation,” Robert L. Hetzel wrote in a Richmond Fed working paper . “However, the Greek economy is effectively ‘euroized.’ It is likely that it will have to continue deflation for many years.” Long Hours for US Minimum Wage Workers to Beat Poverty. A single, minimum-wage earning parent of two children in the U.S. needs to work at least 50 hours a week to each 50% of the nationâ€™s median income, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . Of 25 OECD countries for which data is available, U.S. minimum-wage workers tied for the seventh-longest week needed to get out of poverty. In U.K. Election, Itâ€™s Jobs Boom vs. Stagnant Wages. â€œBritain has enjoyed one of the rich worldâ€™s best records on job creation in recent years. It could teach other countries, including the U.S., a thing or two about encouraging work and hiring. And yet, Britain also has one of the worst records on productivity, as measured by output per worker, which explains why wage gains are badly lagging behind the cost of living,â€? Greg Ip writes for the Journal. â€œIf productivity doesnâ€™t recover, whoever forms the next government will have to live with the consequences: stagnant wages, an unmanageable deficitâ€”and unhappy voters at the next election.â€? Europeâ€™s Radical Banking Union. â€œBanking Union, even in its current incomplete form, is the single biggest structural policy success of the EU since the start of the financial crisis,â€? argues Nicolas VÃ©ron for Bruegel. –Greek banks will be able to increase their borrowing under new ECB rules announced Wednesday. The Greek central bank can lend its banks EUR78.9 billion ($88.25 billion) through an emergency lending program, up from EUR76.9 billion the previous week. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. –The State Bank of Vietnam devalued the dong against the U.S. dollar by 1% Thursday, the second dong devaluation this year–Dow Jones Newswires. –Private payrolls posted a disappointing month in April, growing by just 169,000 jobs , according to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. –National Bank of Poland President Marek Belka said he was optimistic about the economyâ€™s future, which is increasingly driven by consumption, investment and exports. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires.
