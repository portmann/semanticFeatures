The event starts at 3 p.m. and will be live streamed . Keeping Yuan Stable Hits Chinaâ€™s Currency Reserves For much of the past year, the Federal Reserve Chairwoman has been mapping out a complex strategy for the mechanics of raising short-term interest rates. The effort has consumed large portions of Fed policy meetings and resulted in stacks of staff memos. On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke suggested she adopt a new strategy . As part of her strategy, Ms. Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed have decided to stick with the central bankâ€™s longstanding tradition of targeting a short-term interbank lending rate called the fed funds rate. Mr. Bernanke said they ought to drop it. â€œThe fed funds market is small and idiosyncratic. Monetary control might be more, rather than less, effective if the Fed changed its operating instrument to the repo rate or another money market rate,â€? he said. Ms. Yellenâ€™s strategy also depends upon substantially shrinking the Fedâ€™s portfolio of securities by 2020, Â allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting the proceeds. Mr. Bernanke suggested the Fed keep the portfolio large. â€œI wonder if the case for keeping the balance sheet somewhat larger than before the crisis has been adequately explored,â€? he said. Mr. Bernanke also weighed in on an evolving Fed debate about a new instrument being tested by the New York Fed called overnight reverse repos. These are in effect like a deposit facility for money market funds and other financial institutions. They give the Fed their overnight cash and the Fed uses overnight reverse repos to pay them interest in return. As the head of the New York Fedâ€™s market group, Simon Potter, said in a speech Wednesday , they appear to be a powerful instrument for controlling short-term interest rates. Fed officials, in fact, worry they might be too powerful; so attractive that investors might flock to them in a crisis and drain money out of the banking system, Â or money market funds might build a whole new industry out of their use. Fed officials have decided they want to limit the use of overnight reverse repos.Â  Mr. Bernanke suggested the Fedâ€™s concerns about the program were misplaced, noting there were actions the Fed could take to mitigate problems associated with its use. His views appear to be broadly aligned with Brian Sack, the former head of the New York Fedâ€™s marketâ€™s desk and Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist. Mr. Bernanke said his broader aim was to contribute to discussions about the Fedâ€™s exit strategy and to â€œencourage further public debate.â€? For Ms. Yellen, however, the comments potentially raise doubts about her exit strategy after a year of trying to get divided officials to agree on one, and just as she is getting ready to put it to work. Bullard: Now May Be Good Time to Start Raising Rates. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Wednesday â€œnowâ€? may be the appropriate time to begin raising short-term interest rates from near zero, with the U.S. economy poised for a boom and unemployment headed below 5%. â€œThereâ€™s a mismatch between the monetary policy side, which is still at emergency settings, and the economy itself, which is arguably reasonably close to normal,â€? Mr. Bullard said at a conference in Washington. Fedâ€™s Lacker Says a Strong Case Can Be Made for Higher Rates. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said Wednesday a good argument can still be made to raise rates at the U.S. central bankâ€™s mid-June policy meeting . NY Fedâ€™s Potter: Confident Fed Tools Will Effectively Control Rates. The man responsible for implementing Fed monetary policy said Wednesday uncertainties about how markets will react to rate rises mean the central bank will have to be nimble with its programs. â€œFlexibility is a critical element of the Federal Reserveâ€™s approach to policy normalization,â€? Simon Potter, head of the New York Fedâ€™s markets group, said in a speech in New York. Sen. Warren Blasts Financial Regulators.Â  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) on Wednesday dished out harsh criticism for the Fed, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for not being tougher on big financial institutions in the years since the 2008 crisis. She revived a critique she has made in the past that the Fed governors defer too much of their enforcement decision-making to staff. Bernanke: Fed May Want to Abandon Fed Funds Rate. The Fed may want to change the way it controls short-term interest rates, former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday.Â  He said control of monetary policy â€œmight be more, rather than less, effectiveâ€? if the Fed managed a money market rate instead of its benchmark federal funds rate, the overnight rate on interbank loans. Beige Book: U.S. Economy Powers Through Headwinds. The U.S. economy continued to expand across most of the country in February and March, though a strong dollar, falling oil prices and harsh winter weather slowed activity in some sectors , according to the Fedâ€™s latest survey of regional economic conditions. Â IMF Sees Danger in Surprise Fed Rate Move. Â The Federal Reserve could spark widespread volatility in global financial markets if its move to raise interest rates surprises markets, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday. ECBâ€™s Mario Draghi Says Stimulus Is Working. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bankâ€™s stimulus efforts are beginning to take hold in the European economy and batted away concerns in financial markets that the bank may have to end its more than â‚¬1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) asset-purchase program early. - ECB Shrugs Off Protests to Stick With QE . -ICYMI: Hereâ€™s the video of a protestor interrupting the press conference: QE Must Be Backed by Reforms to Avoid Damaging Side Effects, Says IMF. Asset-purchase programs being undertaken by the ECB and Bank of Japan could have destabilizing side effects on the economy and financial markets unless they are backed by structural reforms and efforts to address problem loans, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday. Eurozone Inflation Seen Lower This Year.Â Economic analysts expect eurozone inflation to reach even lower levels this year than previously forecast, before gradually picking up in coming years in response to European Central Bank policy measures and exchange rate moves, a report published Thursday showed . German Yields Tumble Toward Zero.

Threats to Global Financial Stability Are Rising, the IMF Says.

Keeping Yuan Stable Hits Chinaâ€™s Currency Reserves.Â Chinaâ€™s foreign-exchange reserves fell the most on record in the last three months. A big reason for the drop: Chinaâ€™s central bank sold its dollar holdings to bolster the yuanâ€™s value . Get a Job? Most Welfare Recipients Already Have One. Itâ€™s poor-paying jobs, not unemployment, that strains the welfare system. Thatâ€™s one key finding from a study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, that showed most households receiving government assistance are headed by a working adult. The study found that 56% of federal and state dollars spent between 2009 and 2011 on welfare programs â€” including Medicaid, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit â€” flowed to working families and individuals with jobs. In some industries, about half the workforce relies on welfare . -9 a.m. EDT: ECBâ€™s ConstÃ¢ncio speaks on â€œFinancial Regulation and Economic Recoveryâ€? in Washington -10:25 a.m. EDT: RBIâ€™s Rajan speaks on a panel in Washington -1 p.m. EDT: Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy in West Palm Beach, Fla. -1:10 p.m. EDT: Cleveland Fedâ€™s Mester speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy in New York -1735 GMT (1:35 p.m. EDT): Boston Fedâ€™s Rosengren speaks on the U.S. economic outlook and monetary policy in London -3 p.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Fischer, ECBâ€™s Praet speak on an IMF/Wall Street Journal panel moderated by the Journalâ€™s Â Jon Hilsenrath about â€œThe Elusive Pursuit of Inflationâ€? in Washington.

In this paper, I try to capture some of the salient features of this alternative banking system that played a significant role in the recent crisis,” Francesco Ferrante wrote in a Finance and Economics Discussion Series working paper from the Federal Reserve Board . “In particular, I show how financial innovation and higher diversification, which were at the heart of the ‘originate-to-distribute’ model, can make the real economy more fragile in different ways.” U.S. Influence Hinges on Future of Dollar, Yuan. “Chinaâ€™s success at signing up so many countries as founders of the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite American concerns, has fueled a popular narrative of waning U.S. economic influence,” Greg Ip writes in The Wall Street Journal. “In the big picture, this is a sideshow. The real contest for global economic sway doesnâ€™t hinge on the infrastructure bank, the International Monetary Fund or even international trade. It focuses instead on the financial world, where China is seeking to turn its currency, the yuan, into a rival to the dollar, by far the worldâ€™s most important currency.” The Fedâ€™s Faulty 1937 Excuse. Writing in The Journal, Christian Broda and Stanley Druckenmiller ofÂ Duquesne Capital argue that the risks of the Fed tightening too late outweigh the risks of it tightening too early, and that the conditions confronting policy makers in 2014 don’t resemble those they faced in 1937. “The U.S. economy is no longer under emergency conditions or facing the perils of 1937,” they write. “Why then does it require emergency monetary policy?” Can We Blame the Fed for Asset Bubbles? “It is received wisdom among many Wall Street professionals — and the majority of conservatives of my acquaintance — that the Fedâ€™s monetary policy is capable of producing massive asset price bubbles,” Megan McArdle writes in a Bloomberg View column. “And it did so in the late 1990s in the stock market, then again in the housing market. Many charts have been made juxtaposing the Fed funds rate and the S&P 500 or the Case-Shiller index. I expect many more will be produced in the years to come. But I am not sold on the value of these charts, because they donâ€™t give me a mechanism. How does mispricing a single short-term interest rate cause investors to go mad and start wildly speculating on stocks and housing loans?” South Africa’s Central Bank Should Not Stand Above the Fray.Â  The South African Reserve Bank “is arguably the least culpable, most professional and most capable among [South Africa]‘s public-sector economic actors,” Shawn Hagedorn writes in Business Day. “Yet, contrary to fairness considerations, its competencies dictate that it should not be allowed to stand above the fray. While central banking being politicised is a universal fear, in [South Africa] such risks are minor relative to policy lapses provoking one lost generation after another.” How Much More Dollar Appreciation? “By the long-swing metric, there seems to be some more appreciation in store. The same is true using a threshold approach,” Menzie Chinn writes on Econbrowser . “However, these conclusions are based upon historical patterns, for which there are not many independent observations â€“ two and a half dollar cycles essentially. In addition, there is no guarantee that these patterns will persist.” -Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will become an adviser to Citadel, providingÂ analysis of global economic and financial issues andÂ meeting with the hedge fund’s investors around the globe, the New York Times reports . -The Central Bank of Solomon Islands introduced a new $100 banknote last week, and Gov. Denton Rarawa urged citizens to â€œUSE the notes and not store them in containers and under mattresses .â€? Correction: Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has signed on as a senior advisor to Citadel. An earlier version of todayâ€™s newsletter cited a New York Times story that incorrectly referred to the firm Â as Citadel Investment Group. SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
