U.S. Economy May Reach Job Market Nirvana in Next Six Months - Real Time Economics - WSJ If U.S. employers continue to add jobs at a pace near what was seen in April, the economy could reach what central bankers view as full employment within six months. According to the Atlanta Fedâ€™s online jobs calculator , if employers add an average of around 270,000 jobs per month for the next six months, all else being equal, the jobless rate should drop to 5% from 5.4% in April. Last month, the economy added 223,000 jobs after a weak 85,000 rise the prior month and a 266,000 increase in February, so the gains suggested by the Atlanta Fed tool is entirely doable. Why is a 5% jobless rate significant? That number rests at the bottom of Fed officialsâ€™ projected range for the long-run unemployment rate. (In March, their so-called central tendency, which excludes the three highest and three lowest forecasts, was 5.0% to 5.2%). Many economists and policy makers believe that this rate indicates that the economy is at â€œfull employment,â€? meaning that if unemployment dips lower, rising wages bubbling out of a hot job market should spur higher inflation. Thatâ€™s significant for thinking about what to do with short-term interest rates, which have been near zero since late 2008. Many Fed officials agree that short-term interest rates should begin to rise before unemployment falls to its long-term level. If they wait too long, these officials believe, inflation could rise more quickly over the longer-haul. The Atlanta Fed measure suggests that if officials want to prevent that from happening, they likely need to start lifting rates within the next six months. The expectation squares with market expectations, which see the Fed starting to raise interest rates somewhere around its September policy meeting. But other Fed officials, including New York Fed President William Dudley, have suggested there may be value in letting unemployment fall below the long-term rate to encourage stronger wage gains and push weak inflation higher. In a speech last month, Mr. Dudley, worried by recent soft economic growth, said â€œhopefullyâ€? conditions would improve enough to justify raising interest rates later this year.
