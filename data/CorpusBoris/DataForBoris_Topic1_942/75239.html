Grand Central: Readers Sound Off About Consumer Spending Sluggishness  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Readers reacted strongly to Tuesdayâ€™s Grand Central commentary, a tongue-in-cheek and ironic letter to American consumers asking why their spending had slowed in recent months. Household spending is a real puzzle at this moment. After growing slowly for much of the recovery, consumer spending appeared to be picking up early this year. It rose 3.4% in January from a year earlier, after adjusting for inflation, the fastest pace of the expansion. It seemed to be set to rise at a quicker clip in the coming months, thanks in large part to the recent decline in gasoline prices. Instead, spending slowed through April, a development that is puzzling economists. Why did spending slow early this year when households appeared, finally, to have some wind at their backs? We asked readers to respond. Here is a summation of what they said: A number commented on the tone of the commentary. While a small number found the tone to be clever, many found it offensive. Some said the item showed this reporter is arrogant, elitist and out of touch with the challenges faced by many Americans. That spoke to a broader mistrust that many respondents expressed toward a wide array of American institutions, including the Federal Reserve, banks, the media, corporations and the Obama Administration. Moreover many expressed a lack of conviction that the U.S. expansion would last, or that it was spreading prosperity beyond Americaâ€™s elites. Â Others described serious continuing financial burdens related to high debts, a rising cost of living, health care costs, and a lack of wage growth. The item was signed The Wall Street Journalâ€™s Central Banks team. It was conceived and written only by this reporter. â€œInterest rates may be zero,â€? said reader Thomas Eckenrode, â€œbut I know many people with credit card debt of $10,000 paying 15%.â€? He added student debt is an even bigger burden for his family. â€œSimply put the middle class is debt ridden and struggling,â€? said reader Nate York. â€œMany people are hunkering down instead of casually spending.â€? In a twist, car dealers Tuesday reported sales in May hit a 10-year high. That might be the first concrete sign of an actual pickup in spending this year. Judging solely from the responses of Wall Street Journal readers, however, you should not expect a big spending rebound. They say a deep undercurrent of mistrust and economic strain still holds back many Americans, regardless of what the numbers say. Fedâ€™s Brainard: More Economic Progress Needed Before Rates Rise. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday she was concerned that some of theÂ recent economic weaknessÂ  might not be transitory , as many economists had hoped. Ms. Brainard said she would need to see more improvement before she is comfortable raising the Fedâ€™s benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero. â€œIf continued labor market strengthening is confirmed and inflation readings continue to improve, liftoff could come before the end of the year,â€? she said. Stress Test Deadline Coming for Midsize Banks. A first-of-its-kind deadline is approaching for midsize U.S. banks to disclose results of their internal â€œstress testsâ€? later this month, though the findings are unlikely to pack the kind of market-moving punch as those released by the biggest Wall Street banks. Greeceâ€™s Creditors Reach Consensus Deal. Officials representing European institutions and the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday morning completed a draft agreement to unlock bailout aid for Greece. Eurozone governments and the IMF have agreed to press Greece for far-reaching economic overhauls, while the IMF has softened its insistence that Europe offer explicit commitments to relieve some of Greeceâ€™s debt burden, the people said. ECB Raises Emergency Liquidity for Greek Banks. The European Central Bank on Tuesday increased the amount of money Greek banks can borrow under an emergency lending program , according to a Greek bank official, extending a lifeline for the countryâ€™s banks as tense negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors continue. The ECB raised the amount the Greek central bank can lend banks to â‚¬80.7 billion ($89 billion) from â‚¬80.2 billion previously, according to the official. Five Key Points to Watch in the ECBâ€™s June Presser. Expect ECB President Mario Draghi to be pressed on how much patience the ECB has left for Greece, and whether Athens faces a last-chance ultimatum to strike a deal. Mr. Draghi will also likely be asked for additional details about the ECB quantitative easing program. He will probably emphasize that inflation still has a long way to go and that any talk of tapering QE is premature . A more pronounced upswing in growth seems unlikely anytime soon, which gives Mr. Draghi an opportunity to press governments again for more economic reforms aimed atÂ raising the economyâ€™s growth potential . Eurozone Jobless Rate Lowest in Over Three Years.Â The eurozoneâ€™s unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in more than three years during April, while retail sales rose more rapidly than expected, developments that if sustained should fuel further gains in consumer prices . BOJ Shirai: Probability of Considering Extra Easing Is Low for Now.Â A member of the Bank of Japanâ€™s policy board Wednesday reiterated her view that the central bank should make its 2.0% inflation target flexible, saying that it should stick with the current pace of easing without extra action . IMF Economists: Stop Obsessing Over Debt. Rather than being obsessed by debt, someÂ countries should spur growth by not paying down their debt , argue top economists from the IMF, the institution largely tasked with helping countries cut their debt burdens. The researchers say that many policy makers have a â€œdebt obsessionâ€? and arenâ€™t fully factoring in the cost of insuring against future crises by paying down the debt. Because paying down debt levels requires either higher taxes or spending cuts, it can constrain growth, the IMF economists argue. Thatâ€™s why leaving the debt alone will allow the economy to expand at a faster rate. That will reduce the debt organically as revenues increase, they say. Riksbank Sees Increased Risks to Swedish Financial System.Â Risks to the health of the Swedish economy and financial system have increased as a result of householdsâ€™ continued debt buildup , and authorities urgently need to implement reforms to reverse the trend, the Swedish central bank said in its twice yearly financial stability report. Hungary’s Central Bank Forces Lenders to Fund Government. Hungary’s central bank is forcing retail banks to extend more funding to the government in an effort to make its national credit ratings investment-grade again. Starting in September , the National Bank of Hungary will replace its short-term, main monetary policy instrument with a longer-term facility to discourage banks from holding excess funds at the central bank and instead buy more government bonds. The move is aimed at increasing the country’s financing using the local currency and reducing its dependence on foreign-currency denominated debt. Workersâ€™ Drug Use Appears to Rise. The share of U.S. workers testing positive for drugs appears to be on the rise, according to data from millions of workplace drug tests administered by one of the nationâ€™s largest medical-screening laboratories . -1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT): European Central Bank releases a policy statement -1230 GMT (8:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Draghi speaks at a press conference in Frankfurt -2 p.m. EDT: Fed releases its Beige Book report -2:15 p.m. EDT: Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans speaks in Chicago -5 p.m. EDT: St. Louis Fedâ€™s Bullard speaks in St. Louis -National Bank of Poland releases a policy statement -Central Bank of Brazil releases a policy statement RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Fed Officials Should Pay Bond Market Less Mind, Stein Says.Â Fed policy may have underreacted to strong economic activity over the years because officials were too afraid to spook U.S. government bondholders, former Fed governor Jeremy Stein writes in a new paper. Mr. Stein argues the Fedâ€™s approach to interest rate increases may have been too gradual and predictable in the past. â€œSociety would be better off appointing a central banker who cares less about the bond market,â€? write Mr. Stein and co-author Adi Sunderam. Job Loss in the Great Recession and its Aftermath. Deep job losses during the Great Recession and the slow return of the unemployed back to the workforce is having a lasting impact on wage gains in the U.S., according to a new paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Economist Henry Farber writes “job losers in the Great Recession and its aftermath have been much less successful at finding new jobs (particularly full-time jobs) than in earlier periods.” Looking Back at the Payroll Tax Cut. A new Fed paper examines why the payroll tax holiday of 2011 had a difficult time kicking consumer spending into gear. â€œWe identify a sizeable segment of the populationâ€”almost one-third of all householdsâ€”who mostly used the increase in take-home pay in 2011 to rebuild their balance sheets (rather than spend more) and then, when the payroll tax cut expired in 2013, reacted by spending less (rather than drawing down their balance sheets),â€? write Claudia R. Sahm, a Fed economist and Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, both ofthe University of Michigan. Janet Yellen is No Market Sage. Burton G. Malkie l, chief investment officer of Wealthfront, writes in the Journal that Fed chairwoman may have erred when she said recently that stock market valuations were high. â€œNeither the Fed nor professional investors have any special expertise in second guessing the collective wisdom of market participants,â€? he writes. â€œStock valuations are well above their average valuation metrics of the past, and future returns are likely to be below historical averages. But even as Ms. Yellen talks of gradually ending the Fedâ€™s near-zero interest rate policy, interest rates remain well below historical norms. If there is a market bubble today, it is in the bond market and the Fed is complicit in the â€˜overvaluation.â€™â€? Bernanke, for His Part, Doesnâ€™t Think Stocks Are Overvalued. The Journalâ€™s Kristen Scholer looks at former Fed Chairman Ben Bernankeâ€™s latest blog post, in which he argues that the central bankâ€™s quantitative easing program returned stock prices to â€œnormalâ€? levels. â€œMr. Bernankeâ€™s suggestion that stocks arenâ€™t overvalued stands in contrast to Fed Chair Janet Yellen â€™sÂ assertion in early MayÂ that equity valuations are â€œquite high.â€? It also goes againstÂ comments from hedge fund titanÂ Stan Druckenmiller and economist Robert Shiller Â thatÂ stocks are expensive,â€? she writes. Eurozone Inflation Shouldnâ€™t Shift ECBâ€™s QE. The Journalâ€™s Richard Barley argues that despite rising eurozone inflation, the ECB â€œshould stand firmâ€? behind its commitment to its asset-buying program. â€œInflation remains far below the ECBâ€™s target of â€˜below, but close toâ€™ 2%. While the fear of outright and persistent deflation in the eurozone as a whole was overstated, the global backdrop remains one of extremely subdued inflation,â€? he writes. â€œ The ECB Should Tell Us What Itâ€™s Thinking. Michael Heise , chief economist at Allianz notes that volatile markets today have little guidance to rely on about the ECBâ€™s quantitative easing program. â€œThe ECB could support stability if it provided more forward guidance. In particular, it should define clearer rules for its QE program. A rules-based policy can provide direction and guidance to the markets, as the U.S. Federal Reserveâ€™s tapering process has illustrated. While the ECB has left itself the flexibility to exit QE earlyâ€”or extend itâ€”as needed, ECB PresidentÂ  Mario Draghi Â has so far been cagey about the criteria the central bank would use for such a decision.â€? The Dangers of Eurozone Macropru. In a posting on VoxEU, four German economists warn that the concentration of macroprudential powers in the European Central Bank may create a “dangerous” conflict of interest between “supervision and monetary policy.” “Given the limited and uncertain effectiveness of macroprudential instruments, monetary policy should not ignore financial stability considerations and expect macroprudential policy to do the job alone,” they write. “Rather, central banks have to take the effects of their measures on system stability into account in their decisions and have to stand ready to deal with emerging threats to financial stability.” The National Bank of Poland left its interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, in line with expectations and its earlier guidance. The central bank in March cut its main rate to 1.5%, the lowest on record, and said it was unlikely it would return to more easing any time soon-â€“Dow Jones Newswires. PBOC Lending. China’s central bank on Tuesday said it provided 262.8 billion yuan ($42.4 billion) in pledged supplementary lending to the financial system in the period between January and May-â€“Dow Jones Newswires. Mexico Growth Estimate Slips. Economists cut their estimate for Mexico’s GDP growth this year to 2.7% from 2.8%, results of the central bank’s May survey show-â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. ABA Sees Cautious Fed Path. Eleven out of 15 economists on the American Bankers Association’s Economic Advisory Committee expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year, taking the federal funds rate to a ceiling of 0.75%. Four others see just one increase to 0.5%, reflecting a view that central bank officials will wait and see how the economy reacts to their initial rate increase before moving to another. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. The global economy will strengthen slowly in the next 18 months and growth will only approach its precrisis pace at the end of 2016 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday.
