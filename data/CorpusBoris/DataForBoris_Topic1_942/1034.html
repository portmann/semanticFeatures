WSJ Survey: Most Economists See Fed Raising Rates in June or September - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve will start raising short-term interest rates in June or September, according to most economists who responded to a Wall Street Journal survey published Thursday. The central bank has held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008. Most central bank officials have indicated they expect to raise it this year, with several saying they would consider a move in June. The Journal poll of 63 economists, conducted March 6-10 , found 29 expected the Fed to make its first move in June, 23 in September and four in July. â€œThe main determinant on when the Fed will raise rates is an acceleration in wages, a process that has recently begun,â€? said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, who predicted a first rate increase in June. He added, â€œThe June meeting also offers [Fed Chairwoman Janet] Yellen an opportunity to explain the latest change in monetary policy in a press conference too.â€? David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, also forecast a June rate rise, noting data showing gross domestic product â€œand payrolls growing, inflation low but moving up.â€? Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, was among those expecting the first increase in September. â€œPersistently low inflation is expected to delay the liftoff in rates,â€? she said. The Fed since late 2008 has held its benchmark federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25%, and the rate has recently hovered around 0.10%. The economists surveyed on average estimated the rate would be 0.25% in June. That would be lower than the 0.29% they estimated in the Journalâ€™s February poll . The economistsâ€™ forecasts for where the rate will be in December were essentially stable. The median estimate among economists for December 2015 was 0.75%. Looking ahead, the median estimate for December 2016 was 2.19%. Those estimates show some disconnect with the Fed. The central bankâ€™s median estimate, released in its December summary of economic projections, was 1.125% for December 2015 and 2.5% for December 2016. Investorsâ€™ expectations in the fed funds futures market are lower, at 0.515% for December 2015 and 1.365% for December 2016. Fed officials at their meeting next week will strongly consider dropping their assurance to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to start raising short-term rates. Abandoning the phrase would formally open the door to a rate increase in June, but not guarantee such a move.
