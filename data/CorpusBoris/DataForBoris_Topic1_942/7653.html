Janet Yellen Says Strong Dollar Holding Down Exports and Inflation, But Reflects U.S. Economy’s Strength - Real Time Economics - WSJ A stronger U.S. dollar reflects the strength of the U.S. economy, but also is weighing down on the nation’s exports and inflation, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said on Wednesday. “Export growth has weakened. Probably the strong dollar is one reason for that,” Ms. Yellen said at a news conference in Washington. “On the other hand, the strength of the dollar also in part reflects the strength of the U.S. economy.” A strong dollar also â€œis holding down import prices and, at least on a transitory basis, at this point pushing inflation down,” she said. Fed officials, in updated economic projections released on Wednesday, downgraded their estimates for U.S. economic growth and inflation this year. Ms. Yellen said gross domestic product, the broadest measure of output across the economy, has seen growth slow somewhat in the first quarter, “below where it was the last several quarters of last year.” But, she said, “We do see considerable underlying strength in the U.S. economy and in spite of what looks like a weaker first quarter, we are projecting good performance for the economy.” Read the Full Text of the Fedâ€™s March Statement Greg Ip: Future Threats, Not Present Danger, Counsel Caution on Raising Rates Janet Yellen Says June Meeting Might Bring First Rate Rise Fed Officials Trim Back Estimates Of Interest Rate Rises Amid Big Forecast Changes Fed Officials See Slower Inflation Pickup Than Private Economists Do No Decisions Yet About Timing Of Fedâ€™s Reinvestment Process End Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
