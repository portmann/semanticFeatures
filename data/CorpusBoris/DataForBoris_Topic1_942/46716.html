Fedâ€™s Williams Says Summer Rate Rise Possible if Data Supports Action - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Friday itâ€™s still possible the U.S. central bank can raise interest rates this summer. Speaking to reporters Friday, Mr. Williams said that while economic activity over the start of the year was disappointing, he had not yet changed his forecast for the year. To support a rate rise in the early summer, Mr. Williams said â€œI can imagine that constellation of data coming in before June or the meetings right after that too. But it would require the data to be goodâ€? to cause officials to raise the cost of borrowing in the U.S. economy. Mr. Williams spoke in the wake of this weekâ€™s gathering of the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. Officials maintained short-term interest rates at near zero levels and gave little guidance on when they might change that policy. That said, officials acknowledged the unexpected weakness seen at the start of the year. A number of Fed officials have signaled the current state of the economy has made it harder to say when rates will rise this year, although most still expect to boost short-term borrowing costs before 2015 ends. Mr. Williams is a voting member of the FOMC. In recent comments heâ€™s said that the mid-June policy meeting might open the door to discussing a rate rise, but heâ€™s made no firm predictions about when he would like to act. Like most Fed officials, heâ€™s argued the Fed will move rates up when incoming economic data supports that change. Mr. Williams noted that now the FOMC meeting is past, â€œnow we just switch over to watching the data and how the outlook evolves and whatâ€™s happening around the world and whatâ€™s the right decisionâ€? for monetary policy. When it comes to rate rises from now into the future, â€œat every meeting it’s on the table.â€? In his formal remarks, Mr. Williams said efforts to conduct monetary policy based strictly on a rules-based regime would likely not work very well in real-world conditions. â€œThere is no question that monetary policy rules provide an invaluable tool for research and practical policy considerations at central banks,â€? and Fed officials currently consult these rules of thumb when deliberating on interest rate policy, Mr. Williams said. But the problem is that these rules generally rely, as part of their formulation, on impossible-to-measure factors like the economyâ€™s potential growth rate and natural level of interest rates, Mr. Williams said. â€œIf the mandated policy rule uses outdated or inappropriate measures of natural rates, economic performance will suffer,â€? Mr. Williams said. On the other side, â€œallowing the central bank to freely choose natural rate measures would significantly loosen the constraint on policy-makingâ€? and thwart what rule proponent generally like, which is to make monetary policy less subject to judgment, the official said. Policy rules also wouldnâ€™t have done much for the Fed in recent years with interest rates pegged at near zero levels, Mr. Williams said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery before an audience at Chapman University in Orange, Calif. These rules would have argued for something not easily done, and that would have been for the Fed to have pushed short-term rates deeply into negative territory, he said. Mr. Williams said the problem policy rules have with zero interest rates is probably not over. The use of unconventional policy stimulus like bond buying and other tools â€œare very likely to occur again in the future,â€? and rule-based policy-making will have nothing to contribute in such a scenario, he said. The policy maker was pushing back at moves in Congress to legally require the Fed to make policy based on a rules-based regime. As it now stands, the Fed is mandated to keep prices stable and promote job growth, and is granted discretion in how best to attain those goals.
