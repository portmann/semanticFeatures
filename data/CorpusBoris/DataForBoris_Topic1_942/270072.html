A Cautious First Move In The Fed's Game Plan | Seeking Alpha Dec. 20, 2015  7:00 AM ET  |  Includes: RINF by: Kristina Hooper The long awaited start of rate hikes has begun. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25% was a vote of confidence for the US economy, which is how markets clearly viewed it. Yet although though the committee raised rates, this was a relatively cautious - maybe even dovish - statement. Clearly the FOMC felt it had to boost rates, even if the economy isn't sending unequivocal signals that the time is right, and assuage the concerns of those who didn't favor a hike at all. Highlights of the Fed's Communications The "lower for longer" theme is alive and well. Even after the hike, monetary policy will remain very accommodative, which Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated in the press conference. The path of rate hikes will now become extremely important and should affect asset class performance in 2016. The Fed now says the path will be "gradual" instead of "measured," which was a signal to investors not to expect a series of similar increases. As we have said before, this is not your father's Fed rate hike cycle: we'll see hills and plateaus instead of a ladder straight up. Yellen reiterated that "it takes time for policy to affect future economic outcomes." Translation: The Fed needs to move now to prevent the economy from overheating, and to prevent inflation from overshooting its objective. Yellen is also saying that one move will not have a big, immediate impact. This was a unanimous vote, which is symbolically very important given that this was a historic decision, a critical change in policy after nearly a decade. Press Conference Highlighted Path of Hikes The press conference played an important role in clarifying the path of rate hikes. Chair Yellen reiterated that the path of rate hikes is likely to be gradual and data dependent, just as we've been saying. Yellen also spent a significant amount of time discussing inflation, and the FOMC's accompanying statement said the committee "will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal." Although the FOMC is reasonably confident that inflation will, over the medium term, rise to the 2% target, it also recognizes that the economic expansion is not yet complete. When asked why the committee would move now if everything is not strong, Yellen said that many of the headwinds are transitory. She also pointed out that labor market slack is down, so wages can increase and thereby push up inflation expectations. Most importantly, Yellen pointed out that it takes time for the full effects of monetary policy actions to take hold. Waiting any further incurs a risk that, at some future date, more aggressive policies may be necessary to head off any unacceptable economic performance, such as persistent overshooting of the inflation target. Economic Projections Raised Eyebrows Among the Fed's communications were the Summary of Economic Projections and the "dots"; together, they underscored the dovish nature of the Fed's December 16 decision, but they also raised some eyebrows. On the positive side, policymakers strongly emphasized the likely gradual path of normalization by trimming their year-end projections for the fed funds rate in 2017 and 2018 from 2.6% to 2.4% and 3.4% to 3.3%, respectively. This isn't a surprise - Fed officials have been steadily reducing their rate forecasts for some time. In fact, as recently as last December, the FOMC "dots" indicated policy rates would be above 1% by now. The new end-2016 projection of 1.4% (which is unchanged from September) suggests that policymakers believe conditions will be appropriate for four additional rate hikes between now and this time next year. This end-2016 projection could be viewed as hawkish, particularly given the market is pricing in rate increases that are half of that. But more than anything, this projection should be seen as a "placeholder" given that Yellen stressed in the press conference that the path is not predetermined and will be data-dependent. Reflecting robust expectations for near-term growth, Fed officials actually upped their projection for 2016 GDP from 2.3% to 2.4%. Given that the US economy's potential growth rate is roughly 2%, this means policymakers anticipate a further reduction in economic slack. This is firmly in line with the FOMC projections for unemployment in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which were cut from 4.8% to 4.7%. A stronger labor market should result in higher wages-and hopefully-more inflation pressure. On that front, the outlook appears less certain. While Yellen suggested that the current bout of weak inflation should prove "transitory" as dampening effects from a strong US dollar and weak commodity prices fade, policymakers reduced their forecasts for 2016 headline and core PCE inflation from 1.7% to 1.6%. In fact, according to the median FOMC projections, inflation may not reach the Fed's 2% objective until 2018. This is important: As Yellen mentioned during her press conference, a prospective failure to meet the inflation objective could result in increased monetary accommodation. We do not expect the much-anticipated 25-basis-point rate hike to have a material impact on asset classes, though the path of future rate hikes is likely to affect them. We continue to favor risk assets and believe there is downside risk for sovereign bonds if the rate hike path is less gradual. Despite the start of rate hikes, it's still hard to find enough income. In this environment, investors should keep focusing on - but be selective about - asset classes that can deliver, including emerging-market debt, high-yield bonds and dividend-paying stocks. As monetary policy normalizes, expect capital markets to begin normalizing - which is likely to mean higher volatility and lower correlations within and between asset classes.
