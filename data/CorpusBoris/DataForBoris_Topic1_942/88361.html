When Will the Fed Raise Interest Rates? A Chat With WSJâ€™s Jon Hilsenrath - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday to weigh the economic backdrop and consider a possible rate increase in the coming months. Federal Reserve policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss whether the economy is improving enough to raise interest rates this year. Their signals could set the stage for a rate increase–the Fed’s first since 2006–in the coming months, as many investors now expect. Wall Street Journal economics correspondents Jon Hilsenrath and Sudeep Reddy heldÂ a live Spreecast video chat Tuesday to discuss the Fed’s decision, its path ahead and the economic backdrop officials will face at their two-day meeting.

Relying completely on monetary policy, with no fiscal spending increases, is far more Friedman than Keynes. And yea, titus, I know you think buying bonds is fiscal, but both the intent and the impact are 100% about keeping RATES down, and that isnt fiscal policy. We are moving into a deflationary recession as all this cheap money has created too much capacity in sectors with no real demand.  The Fed can't raise rates or the entire fake recovery will go down the tubes.  The next logical steps will be to tax savings and force savers to buy bank stocks unless Paul gets elected.  If we get anyone else, the Fed will continue its path to keynsian destruction of the US.  Johnny boy is such a Fed lapdog...I honestly don't know why the WSJ doesn't fire him..then again given the neocons running the show these days at the WSJ, not surprised.  Sound money isn't a concern of theirs, only more middle eastern war for the US to project Goldman Sachs and Israel The University of Texas made headlines in 2010 by adding more than $500 million in gold to their endowment. The decision to plough half a billion dollars into gold was only the first chapter of the story. Perhaps the bigger news was the choice not to simply buy shares in a gold ETF or gold futures contracts. Custodians decided to buy physical bars instead â€“ signaling a distinct lack of faith in paper gold. Prudent people, seeing the Fed's reckless Keynesian experiments and deranged money-printing, and the failure of the Department of Justice to send a single banker to prison despite massive, systemic fraud and criminality, are putting their money into safe haven investments or tangibles that can't be stolen or expropriated from them.  Public faith and confidence in our financial system, already eroding, will deteriorate further as long as the Fed's monetary policy is formulated solely in the interests of a .1% in the financial sector, and at the expense of everyone else.  Maybe, Mr. Hilsenrath, just this once you could act like a real journalist instead of a Fed lapdog and point out the Fed's dire need to restore some much-needed credibility to our financial system before it is too late. Is this some kind of joke?  Yellen won't raise interest rates until the 10 year treasury yield goes over 4% and stays there.  Until that happens, ignore everything coming out of the Fed and its minions - Janet can't raise rates because then she'd be blamed for crashing the market. previous Forcing Workers to Save Just 3% Won’t Solve the Retirement Crisis, EBRI Says Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
