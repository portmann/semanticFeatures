U.S. budget issues loom as the Federal Reserve approaches a September debate about whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in a decade. Unless Congress resolves its current impasse overÂ federal funding levels, the government could partially shut downÂ October 1. Lawmakers will also likely later this year need to agree to raise the governmentâ€™s self-imposed debt ceiling to avoid disruptions in federal borrowing that could throw the government into chaos. Washingtonâ€™s routine budget turmoil has knocked the Fed off track before. In September 2013, officials were considering whether to begin winding down the bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. They kept it going in part because of worries about a looming shutdown and debt ceiling breach. â€œA government shutdownâ€”and perhaps, even more so, a failure to raise the debt limitâ€”could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy,â€? then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said at the time. This time, however, may be different. First, Republicans have made it clear they want to avoid a repeat of past shutdowns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky) vowed last year â€“ after the GOP won control ofÂ the Senate — there would be no more shutdowns or threats of debt market disruptions. Last week House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said Congress would likely pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government operating past September. Second, the market backdrop is different today than it was in September 2013. Back then, Fed officials were worried about a â€œtaper tantrumâ€? in bond markets thatÂ pushed interest rates higher in anticipation of a Fed move and knocked emerging markets.Â  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes have held steadily between 2% and 2.5% since mid-February. Third, the Fed is closer to its goal of full employment now and broader headwinds from tight government budgets have diminished. 5 Things to Watch at This Weekâ€™s Fed Policy Meeting. TheÂ Federal Reserveâ€™s two-day policy meeting this week may be the calm before the storm. The central bank is expected to wait until September at the earliest to begin raising short-term interest rates. But officialsÂ could drop fresh clues about the economyâ€™s trajectory and, by extension, the outlook for policy. Here are five things to watch in the Fed statement. Investors Think China Tumult Will Cause Fed to Delay Liftoff. Chinaâ€™s rout is making investors increasingly cautious, causing some to push back expectations of liftoff . â€œOur recent client meetings reveal that many investors believe economic uncertainty in China will cause the Fed to delay tightening until 2016,â€? wrote David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.in a note to clients Friday, just days before the Chinese stock market tanked 8.5% Monday. A New Guard is Forming at the Federal Reserveâ€”Washington Post. There will be a new face at the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy-setting meeting in Washington this week, the first of a string of turnovers as the central bank prepares for the next phase of the nationâ€™s economic recovery, the Washington Post reports. Many of the officials who responded during the darkest hours of the crisis have since moved on, including then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. His second-in-command, Janet Yellen, is now at the helm of the Fed, and there already has been significant turnover within the top ranks — with more still to come. Tsipras Faces Race Against Time to Secure Bailout Deal. Talks to complete a bailout program between Greece and its creditors will start Tuesday, almost a week later than planned, raising pressure on Greek Prime MinisterÂ Alexis Tsipras. The two sides are racing against time, as a new bailout program for Greece worth up to â‚¬86 billion ($95 billion) would have to be completed and approved by the Greek parliament, as well as lawmakers in Germany and elsewhere, by mid-August if Athens is to secure billions of euros to repay ECB-held bonds that mature on Aug. 20. Chinaâ€™s Yuan Pushes Deeper Into Global Financial System. Chinaâ€™s domestic stock market may be in turmoil but the countryâ€™s currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, is making a seemingly relentless push deeper into the global financial system. The latest step: the London Metal Exchange, the worldâ€™s largest venue for trading metals where $15 trillion of metals was traded last year, is set to accept yuan as collateral for banks and brokers that trade on its platform. Three-Day Selloff Knocks 11% From China Shares. Â Chinaâ€™s shares fell for a third-straight day Tuesday, in a second wave of heavy selling this month, raising questions as to whether Beijing will roll out new rescue measures to prop up the stock market. U.K. Economy Steps Up a Gear.Â The British economy stepped up a gear in the second quarter, lifting growth prospects during the rest of the year but raising questions about how much longer the Bank of England can keep interest rates pegged at record lows. Gertjan Vlieghe to Join BOE Rate-Setting Committee. Â The U.K. government Tuesday named Gertjan Vlieghe, an economist at Brevan Howard Asset Management, to sit on the Bank of Englandâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee.Â From Sept. 1, Mr. Vlieghe will serve a three-year term as one of four members of the nine-person committee who arenâ€™t full-time officers of the BOE, and are known as â€œexternals.â€? The MPC sets U.K. interest rates. Bank of Israel Keeps Interest Rate Steady at 0.1%. The Bank of Israel said Monday it would leave the interest rate for August unchanged at its record-low level of 0.1% after the consumer price index rose in June, but warned that a renewed decline in energy prices would likely interfere with Israel’s slow climb out of deflation. â€“Dow Jones Newswires Proof of a â€˜Gig Economyâ€™ Revolution Is Hard to Find. Far from turning into a nation of gig workers, Americans are becoming slightly less likely to be self-employed, and less prone to hold multiple jobs. Official government data shows around 95% of those who report having jobs are accounted for on the formal payroll of U.S. employers, little changed from a decade ago . -Federal Reserve begins two-day policy meeting in Washington Inflation Data Suggest More ECB Support. A recent ECB publication suggests that underlying inflation might not have reached a steady turnaround point. The publicationâ€™s conclusions, if accurate, could open the door for more ECB support to the eurozone economy, or at least put off any debate about tapering. The paper looks at the indication of underlying inflation known as HICPX, or inflation excluding food and energy. The publication said that six-month annualized data in the HICPX indicator shows a â€œa relatively persistent increase since the start of the year, but still reveals considerable volatility, making it difficult to conclude that the recent upturn relates to a true cyclical turning point.â€? Research Warns Against Raising Inflation Targets. A new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research says allowing inflation to run hotter than levels currently deemed acceptable would take a notable bite out of the economy. The paperâ€™ authors say targeting inflation to run in the 4% range would induce a lot of distortions into the wage-setting process that would hurt economic performance. Investment would also suffer, the authors say. Fed Staff Error Reveals ‘Potential’ Output is Mostly Nonsense. “Staff economists probably werenâ€™t trying to make it seem as if conditions are better than they really are,” Matthew C. Klein writes on FT Alphaville. “Itâ€™s more likely the absurd numbers are just the inevitable result of using an incoherent model of how the economy works.” -The eurozoneâ€™s economy will fall further behind that of the U.S. without a concerted effort to boost demand through increased government spending and lower taxes, make labor markets more flexible, and rid banks of bad loans , the International Monetary Fund said Monday. -New orders for durable goods rose a seasonally adjusted 3.4% in June from a month earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department said Monday. Excluding the transportation sector, orders rose 0.8% for the largest monthly increase since August 2014 . -The Maldives Monetary Authority announced the issuance of a commemorative note celebrating 50 years of independence for the Indian Ocean archipelago nation.
