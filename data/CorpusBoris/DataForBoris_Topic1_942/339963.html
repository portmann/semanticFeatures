Federal Reserve Watch: Is Fed Ready To Raise Interest Rate In March? | Seeking Alpha Fed has an FOMC meeting on March 15-16 and has indicated that it might raise rates at that time. In the fall of 2015, the Fed oversaw the reduction of bank reserves in preparation for its anticipated rate move in December...which it did. Since the beginning of this year the Fed has seen reserve balances increase substantially without causing interest rates to go lower. Maybe the Fed is is a better position to raise rates now than it was in December...but, then again, may not move. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the committee that votes on changes in Federal Reserve policy like changes in the target range of interest rates for the Federal Funds rate, has its next meeting scheduled for March 15 and 16. After the FOMC meeting in December 2015, a meeting where the FOMC raised its policy range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points, officials of the Federal Reserve have talked openly about the possibility that the FOMC would raise rates four times in 2016 by 25 basis points. The consensus seemed to be that the first such increase would occur at the March meeting of the FOMC. Since the first of the year, financial markets have been quite volatile with US stock markets being off slightly, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond being down about 35 basis points, concern over continued weak US economic growth, and with projections for economic growth across the globe being reduced, officials at the Fed have backed off somewhat from the "forward guidance" given in December and early January. In the weeks leading up to the December rise in interest rates, the Federal Reserve prepared for the increase by reducing the reserve balances commercial banks hold at Federal Reserve banks. These reserve balances are considered to be a proxy for "excess balances" in the banking system. In reviewing the Federal Reserve balance sheet during the fall (the H.4.1 release) it seems as if the Fed began to seriously prepare for the December rate increase by beginning to reduce these reserve balances. It did this in order to makes the banking system a little less liquid so as to facilitate the increase in the Fed's policy rate of interest. Between the banking week that ended October 7, 2015 and the banking week that ended December 16, 2015, reserve balances held at Federal Reserve banks declined by almost $220.0 billion. The Federal Reserve took this long to oversee this decline in bank reserves because it has been and continues to be very careful in facilitating such a decline because it does not want to cause any dislocations or disturbances in the balance sheets of commercial banks. Additionally, the Fed really believed that it had to raise its interest rate target in December because in its "forward guidance" through most of 2015 it had been promising that it would actually go ahead and raise the rate. By postponing such a decision several times, officials at the Fed sensed that the Fed was losing credibility by promising something and then not delivering on it. So, in the fall of 2015, Federal Reserve officials moved very intentionally to reduce reserve balances to get the banking system ready for the first rise in its policy rate since 2009. The $220 billion decline in reserve balances does not seem to be that much because the total amount of reserve balances in the banking system in early October 2015 was almost $2.7 trillion. Yet, the $220 billion looks large when one realizes that the total Federal Reserve balance sheet before the financial crisis hit was just over $900 billion. So the Fed reduced the excess reserves of the banking system in the fall and carried out its promise to raise its policy rate, which it did at the December meeting of the FOMC. This time around we are getting an entirely different picture. Since the end of December 2015, the Federal Reserve has actually overseen reserve balances increase by almost $290 billion. In the past week alone, reserve balances at Federal Reserve banks rose by just over $70 billion. Short-term interest rates have remained relatively constant during this time period. The effective Federal Funds rate rose to around 35 basis points right after the increase in the Fed's policy range in December and has remained in the 35 basis points to 40 basis points ever since. In the past three banking weeks the effective Federal Funds rate has averaged 38 basis points. The question that arises because of this performance has to do with whether or not the Fed had to oversee this rise in reserve balances to keep the effective Federal Funds rate in this 35 basis point to 40 basis point range. Would the effective Federal Funds rate have risen if the Fed had not let reserve balances grow by as much as they did? If this is the case, then the situation in the banking system is just the opposite of what it was in the fall of 2015. Then the Fed had to oversee the reduction in reserve balances in order to observe the rise in the effective Federal Funds rate. If the Fed has allowed reserve balances to increase so that the effective Fed Funds rate stayed as low as it did, then it would seem that all the Fed would need to do to raise the target range at the March FOMC meeting is cut back on the quantity of reserve balances that flowed into the banking system since the first of the year. In other words, it seems as if the financial markets wanted the Federal Funds rate to increase this year, but the Fed kept the rate down by allowing funds to flow back into the banking system. If these demand pressures still exist, then the Fed is in a pretty good position to change its policy range at the March meeting and allow market forces to move rates up. The problem here is that, as mentioned above, officials at the Federal Reserve may not want to raise its policy rate at this time because of the changes in the world economy and changes in financial markets. If Fed officials decide not to raise the policy rate at the March meeting, then the Fed needs to see that the effective Federal Funds rate does not rise any more. Right now, I believe that Federal Reserve officials will not move rates in March. We'll see where the market pressures go if rates are left alone.
