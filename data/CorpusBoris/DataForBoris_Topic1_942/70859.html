Grand Central: GDP Revisions Show Economy Exposed to Shocks - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Commerce Department is widely expected to report this morning that U.S. economic output contracted in the first quarter, the third time in this expansion that the economy, in fact, failed to expand. What are we to make of this? My colleague Greg Ip provided the most useful analysis Iâ€™ve seen earlier this week. â€œGermany and Japan have shown over the past decade how a countryâ€™s growth can easily slip into negative territory when the underlying trend is so close to zero. The U.S. is fitter than either country but, like them, is grappling with cyclical and structural headwinds that could make negative quartersâ€”and recessions, too, if policy makers arenâ€™t carefulâ€”more commonplace.â€? Greg points to this illuminating set of facts: U.S. growth has averaged just 2.2% since the recession. For comparison, between 1983 and 2007, the economy grew at 3.2% on average.Â  The economy experienced just four negative quarters during the 1983-2007 stretch. If the underlying trend had instead been 2% while quarter-to-quarter swings remained the same, there would have been 13 negative quarters. The slow underlying trend of U.S. growth appears to be held down by slow growth in worker productivity and the labor force. These are developments that Fed interest rate policies canâ€™t easily change. Their roots lie in factors like worker education, entrepreneurial innovation, regulatory policy, the quality of national infrastructure, business investment and the age and willingness to work of the labor force. These factors reside on the supply side of the economy â€“ they influence the economyâ€™s productive capacity. Fed policies more directly influence the demand side of the economy â€“ our willingness to spend and invest today. If policy makers want to bolster the economy, wise choices will need to start coming from somewhere other than inside the central bank. Bullard: Look for New Ways to Counter Weak Growth. The Federal Reserve should consider new policy options, including directly targeting a non-inflation-adjusted level of economic growth , after more than six years of sustained monetary easing failed to spur a boom, St. Louis Fed President James BullardÂ said Thursday. Mr. Bullard was presentingÂ  new research conducted with three other economists that he says shows â€œthe monetary authority may credibly promise to increase the price levelâ€¦to maintain a smoothly functioning credit market.â€? The model could be â€œbroadly viewed as a version of nominal GDP targeting,â€? the paper says, referring to a policy in which a central bank would set a target for gross domestic product growth without an inflation adjustment. Williams: Rate Increase Likely This Year. The Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates sometime this year as the economy rebounds from a weak first quarter, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Thursday. Still, recent economic softness appears to have taken its toll on Mr. Williams optimism, since he now sees the U.S. economy growing just 2.0% this year, down from a Â forecast of 3% Â as recently as March. A Fed interest rate decision â€œis on the table in every meeting,â€? Mr. Williams told reporters in Singapore. Kocherlakota: â€˜Mistakeâ€™ for Fed to Raise Rates in 2015. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota reiterated Thursday that he thinks it would be a mistake for the Fed to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate this year. He has pointed to still-subdued inflation, which has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target for three years, as one reason for patience . Earlier this month, he also called the economyâ€™s first-quarter slowdown a â€œmatter for concern.â€? House Committee Expands Its Fed Probe â€“ Bloomberg. The House Financial Services Committee has expanded its investigation into the Fedâ€™s 2012 disclosure of sensitive information to ask whether Fed officials followed their own policies, why officials did not contact law enforcement agencies sooner and why the Fed allowed its internal investigations to lapse, Bloomberg reported. ECB Says Long Greek Talks May Hurt Other Eurozone Borrowers. The European Central Bank warned that the Greek debt crisis could spread to other at-risk eurozone countries if Athens fails to reach a financing deal with its international creditors quickly, underscoring the high stakes involved in the negotiations. Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde said in a German newspaper interview that a Greek exit from the euro is a possibility, contradicting comments earlier Thursday by ECB Vice President VÃ­tor ConstÃ¢ncio that effectively ruled out such a scenario. Greek Banks Relying on ECB Funding. Two of Greeceâ€™s largest lenders on Thursday reported they increasingly relied on funding from the European Central Bank amid continuing deposit outflows stemming from the countryâ€™s political and economic uncertainty. EU official Looks Into ECB Early Disclosures. Remarks made by a top ECB policymaker to a private audience last week drew fresh scrutiny when a senior European Union official requested more information about the incident. The European ombudsman, Emily Oâ€™Reilly, asked the ECB to provide further details into an incident in which potentially market sensitive information was disclosed to a limited audience. Investors at a select dinner at a five-star London hotel on May 18 were handed a roughly 12-hour head start over the rest of the market when ECB executive board member BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ© presented them with fresh details of the bankâ€™s bond-buying stimulus plan that werenâ€™t published until the next morning. Alternate Inflation Gauge Eases Fears of Deflation in U.K. For the Bank of England, Britainâ€™s slip into negative inflation hasnâ€™t been a cause for much concern. Fresh figures for U.K. gross domestic product, released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics, supported the BOEâ€™s position. Although price growth as measured by the Consumer Price Index was close to zero during the first quarter of the year, inflation according to a different indicator, called the GDP deflator, was 1.8% . Japan Consumption Disappoints as Inflation Slips to Zero.Â Japanese data released Friday showed the paradox hampering Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s economic revival plan â€”while the labor market and manufacturing output are improving, consumer spending remains stubbornly weak.Â The annual inflation rate also registered zero in April on falling prices of energy and television sets. The zero reading, while better than expected, was the second time in three months that prices have stayed flat, another indication that anemic demand is undermining efforts by the Bank of Japan spearheading Mr. Abeâ€™s campaign to squash a long bout of deflation and generate 2% inflation . China to Ease Limits on Overseas Investments. Chinaâ€™s campaign to turn the tightly controlled yuan into a global currency is crossing a new threshold, as the government plans to make it easier for individuals and companies to invest overseas . The latest initiative, expected to be announced in the next few weeks by the State Council, Chinaâ€™s cabinet, will allow individual Chinese and businesses to directly purchase stocks, bonds and real estate in foreign markets, removing limits on such transactions. Analysts Expect India Rate Cut. The Reserve Bank of India will cut the main interest rate at its policy meeting Tuesday, analysts predict , in an attempt to kick-start an economy that has been showing signs of decelerating. RBI GovernorÂ Raghuram RajanÂ will lower the repurchase rate by 0.25 percentage point to 7.25%, according to eight out of 11 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Turkish Central Bank May Take Additional Measures to Support Economy.Â Turkeyâ€™s central bank said Friday the measures taken to support foreign exchange liquidity and long-term borrowing help to buffer the countryâ€™s economy against the global shocks and said it may take additional measures if deemed necessary . Switzerlandâ€™s Economy Shrinks, Squeezed by Strong Swiss Franc.Â Switzerlandâ€™s economy contracted for the first time in 4Â½ years in the first quarter as the strength of the Swiss franc hit foreign demand for the countryâ€™s pharmaceuticals and machinery products.Â Economists had expected the Swiss economy to shrink after the Swiss National Bank Â Â in January ended a 3Â½-year policy of capping the franc at 1.20 a euro. The eurozone is the Alpine countryâ€™s main trading partner. Venezuelaâ€™s Reluctant Embrace of the Dollar. As Venezuelaâ€™s economy crumbles and its currency plummets amid triple-digit inflation, the country is in effect dollarizing. Coded messages increasingly let buyers know that greenbacks are welcomed. From real estate to cars to even some cheaper goods like health-care products, an increasing number of vendors demand dollarsâ€”or its black market equivalent in bolivars, now about 350, several times the official rate . RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Strong Fundamentals Can Protect Emerging Economies from Spillovers. Emerging economies may be better positioned to weather spillovers from the Federal Reserveâ€™s actions if they start out on a strong foundation , according to a recent analysis by Federal Reserve economists. Spillovers, when policy decisions in one country affect other nations, have been the subject of study and debate in recent years as big central banks including the Fed have taken aggressive action to shore up their domestic economies. Raghuram Rajan, governor of India’s central bank, has criticized the Fed for not expressing public concern about the effects of its easy-money policies on emerging market economies and recently said the world needs “much clearer rules of the game” as to what is and isnâ€™t allowed. Markets Are Still Spooked. Barry Ritholtz writes on Bloomberg View that markets tend to look backwards towards the last crash, which can make them discount good news in the present. â€œThere were very few bears in 2007. But today, you can find all manner of ursine company, from gold bugs and end-of-worlders to Fed haters andÂ  Hindenburg Omen Â devotees,â€? he writes. â€œHence, the psychological parallels I see now are to 1962, and the collective memory of the crash of 1929, rather than 2007 and the legacy of the dot-com bubble burst. There is a deep reluctance today to believe that the recession is over; to recognize that inflation is nowhere in sight; to admit that the market rally is more than just the result of Fed actions; to ignore positive economic data; and to disregard the huge recovery in corporate profits.â€? -The U.S. economy likely contracted in the first quarter. The Commerce Department will release updated growth data Friday. An earlier estimate last month showed 0.2% growth but a batch of data since then suggests output was far weaker . -Jobless Claims Up.
