A Troubling Lack Of Discipline - PowerShares 1-30 Laddered Treasury Portfolio ETF (NYSEARCA:PLW) | Seeking Alpha The Fed is showing a troubling lack of discipline in their decision-making process. The Fed's reactivity is only adding to the uncertainty for capital markets. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen took to the podium in Philadelphia this week to provide her latest thoughts on the economic outlook. It was a closely watched speech given the implications for the course of monetary policy in the coming months, particularly in the wake of Friday's poor employment report. The conclusions that can be drawn from the speech suggest a troubling lack of discipline in terms of how monetary policy is being carried out in the U.S. today. Navigating the risks associated with monetary policy in the post crisis period is a multilayered process. The first is the underlying economic and market environment itself. Next is what the Fed might say about the economy and markets at any given point in time. Then, there is the initial market and media interpretation of what the Fed has said. Finally, there is the eventual realization of what the Fed really intends to do. These risks have been increasingly relevant for investors in recent years given the importance of monetary policy in driving stock market (NYSEARCA: SPY ) recovery during the post-crisis period. For all of these reasons, Chair Yellen's speech on Monday was particularly important for markets. During her previous speech just a few days ago in late May, Ms. Yellen had indicated that a rate hike was probable "in the coming months", which implied a rate hike at their upcoming meetings in June or July (being realistic, June has not really been on the table, with Brexit risk looming later in the month, but July was a distinct possibility). But since her last speech, the Bureau of Labor Statistics dropped a dud on the markets with its May employment report that came in well below consensus expectations and implied that the economy might be weaker than previously believed. Would Chair Yellen maintain her conviction to raise interest rates in her Monday speech following this jobs report letdown? Or would she stand down and soften her position on the potential for further rate hikes in the near term? Strong Initial Reactions Leading Up To The Speech It seemed that the Fed was immediately swayed by the employment report for May. On Friday, not long after the report was released, Fed Governor Lael Brainard took to the podium at a scheduled speech to state that "the labor market had slowed" and suggested that the Fed would need to wait for more data before making the decision to move on rates. An article by Jon Hilsenrath at the Wall Street Journal further reinforced the notion of a dovish turn at the Fed coming out of Friday's disappointing job report. Known for his close contacts at the Fed, Hilsenrath along with Kate Davidson stated the following in the article: "The Federal Reserve's plans for raising short-term interest rates went on hold after Friday's dismal jobs report, with officials now wanting to wait and see whether the economy remains on track before they make a move. A rate increase at the Fed's June 14-15 meeting is almost surely off the table. A move at their July meeting six weeks later is still possible though less likely, because officials won't have that much more economic data to reassure themselves about the course of the economy's expansion, according to their remarks." St. Louis Fed President James Bullard followed with more on-the-record dovishness on Monday in an interview with the Wall Street Journal by proclaiming that it was a fair assessment that the chances for a June rate hike were now much lower. Thus, it was essentially a foregone conclusion when the leader of the Fed pack stepped to the podium on Monday. The Fed was standing down on raising rates in July. But was it really just the May employment report that changed everybody's mind at the Fed? It is worth emphasizing that Fed Chair Yellen sounded a number of positive notes during her speech. This included the following: "The economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under way for seven years. The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have been impressive. In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession." This is a fairly upbeat summary. In fact, it is such a positive assessment that it leaves one scratching their head a bit. We have an economic expansion that has been "under way for seven years". Knowing that the business cycle has historically averaged roughly four years, on average, over the long term, one can understandably be left to wonder exactly why we are still engaged in extraordinary monetary policy measures today with an expansion that is now running nearly twice as long as the typical complete business cycle with "impressive" gains, a job market that has "strengthened substantially" and with labor market slack that is now close to being eliminated. By this read, it sounds like we should have been off of the zero bound and well on the way to normalized interest rates many years ago by now. But perhaps it is the lingering risks that has kept the Fed so dovish. Chair Yellen then goes on to list the various risks in the current environment. These included concerns about slowing growth in China (NYSEARCA: ASHR ), the recently stronger U.S. dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ), lower oil prices (NYSEARCA: OIL ) and recently weak business spending. All of these issues are legitimate concerns, but nothing here screams the need for emergency measures to prevent the onset of the next major crisis. Particularly since she effectively explains all of these risks away in reaching the conclusion that "the positive economic forces have outweighed the negative", and that progress should continue toward employment and inflation objectives. Thus, none of these are sufficient reason to explain why we are just one recent rate hike removed from effectively zero interest rates. She then goes on to list some important uncertainties to the outlook. Perhaps it is here where we can find our explanation. These include the resilience of domestic demand, the economic situation abroad, the outlook for already weak productivity growth and the pace at which inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target. Now, I completely agree that all of these uncertainties are legitimate. But once again, do they justify continued extraordinary monetary policy? After all, the resilience of domestic demand, weak productivity growth and the inflation rate are parts of the ongoing challenge that a freely functioning economy will encounter at any given point in time. I will grant that the economic situation abroad does warrant a degree of caution given the threat of a potential Brexit (NYSEARCA: EWU ) at the end of the month, but the reality is that these geopolitical and economic risks have, and will continue, to exist. More significantly, all of these uncertainties were absolutely well known only a few days ago on May 27, when the Fed Chair was last at the podium pushing for a rate hike "in the coming months". And while she stuck to her late May guns about the Fed's intent to gradually raise interest rates, the phrase "in the coming months" was glaringly absent from the speech. It all comes down to this. The Fed was ready to raise interest rates in July. Then, the May employment report came out on Friday, and they immediately reacted by pushing back their plans to hike rates. If the Fed is so reactive to one single data point, it is unacceptable. What was ironic in Chair Yellen's speech on Monday was that she made the following statement: "let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report." It is ironic because absolutely too much significance has been attached to this single monthly report in the May jobs data. Why is this problematic? Because it is one thing when mercurial stock investors swing the market around to the upside and downside in reaction to every news item that crosses the headlines. It's just what stock investors do, whether it is well reasoned or not. But what we should hope and expect from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the supposedly wise overseers of the global reserve currency and the appointed group charged with carrying out monetary policy that has profound effects on the global economy and its financial markets, is to have the level-headed discipline to not be so affected by a single economic data point like the monthly employment report, which is widely known to be subject to heavy revision over time. While I respect the fact - whether I agree with their policy course or not - that the Fed has a flexible plan that is supposedly data-driven, I find it worrisome if their models are so highly sensitive that the release of a single economic data point can so meaningfully influence their decision-making at any given point in time. Sure, the May employment data was lousy. But how much emphasis should we really put on this just-released single data point? Let's look at recent history for guidance and an example. On September 2, 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report for August 2011. The report was notable because it came in at a goose egg of +0 new jobs created for the month, which was disappointingly well short of expectations for +75,000 new jobs created that August (notably, a Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) strike was also going on at the time that included roughly 45,000 workers). Moreover, employment numbers for the prior months were also revised lower, just as they were in the May 2016 report. Then as they are now, economist and policymakers began chirping in August 2011 about the potential unwinding of the economic recovery and the need for more monetary policy support. And strong action was eventually taken. But by the time all of the revisions were completed on the August 2011 report several months later, it turned out that the U.S. economy had actually created +107,000 jobs that month, which was not only much better than the initial report of +0 new jobs created, but also ended up exceeding economist initial expectations for the month by +32,000 new jobs. In other words, so much initial fuss over a single "disappointing" data point that ended up being nothing other than better than expected in the end. This is just one example of how unreliable the initial data from these employment reports - or any other economic release, for that matter - can be. And the latest release for May is just a single data point, not an extended time series. As a result, even the most elementary economic forecast models should not be so swayed by their release or the information of any single economic data point, as it should be a more well-defined picture, with such individual pieces of information influencing the course of policy at the margins at most. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tremendous influence on financial markets. This has been particularly true during the post-financial crisis period. And if their degree of heavy market micromanagement is not enough, the course that this policy follows is seemingly at risk of being shifted at the whim of each and every economic data release. This is unacceptable, for instead of being reassuring, it only adds uncertainty to an already wildly overly inflated capital market place. What the markets could benefit from more than anything at this point, more than seven years after the calming of the financial crisis for Pete's sake, is for the Fed to finally get out of the way and let the markets get back to functioning on their own. Get away from the speaking circuit and stop dropping insinuations about monetary policy following every tick of the S&P 500 Index. Will asset prices including stocks fall a bit at points along the way? Absolutely, but that's why they call them "risk markets". If the Fed feels compelled to stay involved in actively trying to direct the markets, at least get a dedicated plan in place and stick with it. Make it smooth to fill the market background and make gradual changes at the margins. Don't go from four rate hikes in 2016 down to zero rate hikes and back up to two rate hikes over the course of a few months to start the year. And if the Fed can't help but watch what the stock market is doing on any given trading day, at least try not to be so blatant about it. Consistency and discipline. This, more than anything else, is what can benefit the economy and help reduce uncertainty going forward.
