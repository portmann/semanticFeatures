Inflation Misses Fed’s 2% Target for 36th Straight Month - Real Time Economics - WSJ It’s been three years since U.S. inflation hit the Federal Reserve‘s 2% target, according to new data from the Commerce Department. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fedâ€™s preferred inflation gauge, rose just 0.1% in April from a year earlier, the lowest level since October 2009 and a little softer than the 0.3% reading in February and March. April 2012 was the last time the inflation rate was on target. That’s the longest such stretch of sub-2% inflation since the 1960s. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices climbed 1.2% in April from a year earlier, a slight downshift from the 1.3% reading the prior four months. Such low inflation complicates the Fed’s plans to start raising interest rates. The central bank’s dual mandate calls for price stability–in this case 2% inflation–and maximum employment. While the labor market appears healthy, low oil prices, a strong dollar and tepid global demand are all holding down prices. “It won’t be current inflation that prompts the first Fed hikes, it will be the tightness of the labor market and the signal it sends about future inflation risk, given the extraordinarily easy stance of policy,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.
