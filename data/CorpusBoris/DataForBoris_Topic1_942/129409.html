Help us get started by sending them here:Â  askcentralbanking@wsj.com Liftoff appears to be approaching, first for the Federal Reserve, followed by the Bank of England. Both central banks are convinced the inflation rates they target are set to rise, and that a first tightening of policy in almost a decade is needed to prevent too rapid an increase in consumer prices over coming years. Both interpret a recent pickup in wages as an indication the gap is closing between what the economy is producing and what it could produce if it operated at full capacity. And the narrower that gap, the stronger the upward pressure on prices. So now is the time to tap the brakes on what the economy is producing. The officials who will decide when to raise interest rates have a lot of information at their disposal, and they have a great deal of experience analyzing developments in the U.S. and U.K. economies, respectively. But after three decades of breakneck globalization, inflation may no longer be a national phenomenon, even if the national economy in question is very large. That possibility was acknowledged as far back as 2006, in a paper co-authored by Claudio Borio , who is currently head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard considered the evidence in 2012 and concluded that “there are good reasons to think that…the global output gap is a relevant indicator for domestic inflation.” Back then, Mr. Bullard was trying to explain why inflation rates were moving higher than seemed justified by the U.S. output gap alone. Back then, emerging markets economies were running hot. Now, of course, many aren’t. China’s State Council Friday promised more policies to bolster its embattled trade sector as a gauge of manufacturing activity showed new sluggishness in the economy. Other large developing economies aren’t doing much better, the main exception being India. So it’s quite likely that the hard-to-measure global output gap is pretty wide, and that is reflected in falling commodity prices and inflation rates that are very subdued in most major economies. If it is the global output gap that matters, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England may have little to fear from inflation should they decide to hold off raising rates until 2016, or even later. They may want to go earlier for other reasons–for example, a concern that risks to financial stability are mounting–but that is a different argument. Fed Officials May Offer More Clarity on RatesÂ . Federal Reserve officials are likely to emerge from their policy meeting Wednesday with short-term interest rates still pinned near zero, though they could send fresh hints about when rates are likely heading up. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen emphasized in congressional testimony earlier this month she expects the central bank to start lifting its benchmark federal-funds rate before year end. Her comments and other recent public statements by Fed officials have made clear that July is too soon. FedSpeak Cheat Sheet: Fed officials are going into their policy meeting this week essentially on the same page : Most favor raising short-term rates from near zero this year, though there is disagreement and uncertainty about when to start the process. Hereâ€™s a sample of their most recent key comments on the rate outlook since their June meeting. Fed Economic Forecasts Released Five Years Early. Internal Fed staff economic forecasts have been available on the Federal Reserveâ€™s website for nearly a month , the central bank said Friday in an embarrassing disclosure that drew harsh criticism from lawmakers. Normally, staff projections are released to the public after a five-year lag. Fed staff last month predicted a lower path for short-term interest rates over the next few years than did the officials who set the rates. The incident is the latest in a series of high-profile problems involving the Fedâ€™s handling of sensitive internal information. Fed Staffers Slightly Pessimistic About Economy. In June, Fed staffers saw economic growth dropping from 2.38% in 2016 to 1.74% in 2020, a bleaker assessment than the officialsâ€™ projections, which pegged growth at between 2.0% and 2.3% after 2017. They also saw inflation rising to 1.94% by 2020, lower than the central bankâ€™s target of 2%. Fed officials, on the other hand, project longer run inflation at 2%. The staff projected an average federal-funds rate of 0.35% in the fourth quarter of 2015, rising to 1.26% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2.12% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fed Exit-Tools Discussion No Longer â€˜Medium-Term.â€™ The Fedâ€™s Board of Governors meets Tuesday for a â€œdiscussion of monetary policy issues,â€? the Fed announced Friday. The last 10 Federal Open Market Committee meetings were accompanied by a board meeting on â€œmedium-term monetary policy issues,â€? as officials discussed and tweaked the tools they’ll use to tighten policy when the time comes. Dropping the â€œmedium-termâ€? reference could be another sign the Fed is getting closer to raising interest ratesâ€”Dow Jones Newswires. BOJ Deputy Gov Sees 1 Pct Point Rise in CPI Once Energy Price Impact Wears Off.Â Japan’s inflation rate could rise by one percentage point once the impact of lower oil prices fades, one of the Bank of Japan’s deputy governors said Monday. In the latest attempt by senior officials at the central bank to counter skepticism over the central bank’s ambitious price forecasts, Hiroshi Nakaso said that downward pressure on Japan’s consumer prices resulting from lower oil prices would start dissipating later this year–Dow Jones Newswires. ECB Coeure: Urgent to Overhaul Eurozone Governance.Â The Greek crisis has shown that it is urgent to change how the eurozone is governed, the European Central Bank’s Benoit Coeure said in an interview with French daily Le Monde . “If this question is not tackled today, the monetary union will repeatedly be hit by the same kind of crisis,” he said–Dow Jones Newswires. China Stocks Suffer Sharpest Daily Fall Since 2007.Â China stocks suffered their sharpest daily percentage decline since 2007, as worries mount that authorities are pulling back on measures to prop up the market . In Australia and New Zealand, Bankers Try New Tactic to Rein In Property. Â Far from Washington and Frankfurt, central banks are poised to try something that their peers have hotly debated for decades: pricking a bubble .Â Top regulators and monetary officials around the world are far from settled on whether it is wiser to halt what looks like excessive exuberance in the price of assets like stocks or housing, or instead prepare to clean up the aftermath. Central bankers in New Zealand and Australia are attempting to do the former. Nigerian Central Bank Keep Key Rate at Record High. Central Bank GovernorÂ Godwin EmefieleÂ said he was holding the countryâ€™s benchmark rate at 13%, in part on expectations that graft will lessen under the presidency of Muhammadu Buhari, an anticorruption campaigner inaugurated in May. That would help replenish the central bankâ€™s depleted reserves, Mr. Emefiele said. India Seeks to Weaken Central Bankâ€™s Power. Indiaâ€™s Ministry of Finance released late Thursday a draft regulation aimed at revamping decision-making processes at the countryâ€™s central bank, as the two institutions negotiate changes in the way the Reserve Bank of India sets monetary policy. In a draft of the Indian Financial Code circulated for public discussion, the finance ministry proposed the setting up of a seven-member Monetary Policy Committee, a body that would set interest rates. Now, Indiaâ€™s central bank governor is advised by a technical committee, but is the one to make the final decision on rates .Â  Africa Makes Leap in Cross-Border Mobile Payment. Africaâ€™s biggest telecommunications companies are striking deals allowing their customers to make payments across networks and borders, the latest stride in the continentâ€™s ascent as a leader in mobile financial technology . -8:30 a.m. EDT: Commerce Department releases U.S. durable-goods data for June -0830 GMT (430 a.m. EDT) UK second quarter GDP -Federal Reserve begins two-day policy meeting in Washington -2 p.m. EDT: Federal Reserve releases a policy statement -BOJâ€™s Ishida speaks in Kyoto, Japan -0700 GMT (3 a.m. EDT) Â Spain second quarter GDP -0900 GMT (5 a.m. EDT) Eurozone economic sentiment -1200 GMT (8 a.m. EDT) Germany July inflation -8:30 a.m. EDT: Commerce Department releases U.S. GDP data for the second quarter, plus historical revisions -Central Bank of Egypt releases a policy statement -1000 GMT (6 a.m. EDT) Eurozone July inflation -1030 GMT (6:30 a.m. EDT): Bank of Russia releases a policy statement Why the Fed Needs to Get Off the Dime. Â Writing in the Journal, Richard W. Nelson argues the Fed should ensure that it has finished normalizing monetary policy by the time unemployment falls to its natural rate. “There seems to be an assumption among many policy makers, analysts and market participants that the Fed should wait until the natural rate of unemployment is reached before it begins to raise interest rates,” he writes. “That would be a huge mistake, greatly increasing the chances of significant inflation beginning sometime next year.” Depressionâ€™s Advocates. Brad DeLong argues that European policymakers have misjudged the importance of government spending, which has led them to offer overly optimistic growth projections, repeating the mistakes of the 1930â€™s. â€œThe clear failure of austerity to restart the economy in Greece or the rest of the eurozone has not caused policymakers to rethink their approach. Instead, they seem to be doubling down, on the theory that the deeper the crisis, the more successful the push for structural reforms will be. Such reforms are needed to boost long-term growth, the thinking goes, and if that growth does not rapidly emerge, it is because the need for them was even greater than originally thought.â€? Cheap Money is Here to Stay. William Pesek argues that central banks in New Zealand and Australia have let themselves be bullied by the markets to lower rates. â€œJust one year ago, it seemed unthinkable that officials in Wellington and Sydney would join the global race toward zero.Â But with commodity prices sliding, China slowing and governments reluctant to adopt bold reforms, jittery markets are demanding ever-bigger gestures from central banks. Even those presiding over stable growthÂ feel the need to placate hedge funds, lest asset markets falter.Â When this dynamic overtakes countries such as New Zealand (growing 2.6 percent) and Australia (2.3 percent), it’s hard not to conclude that ultralow rates will be the global norm for a long, long time.â€? New-Home Sales Fall. New-home sales fell 6.8% in JuneÂ from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000, the lowest reading since November 2014 , the Commerce Department said Friday.
