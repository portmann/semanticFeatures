Fed Officials Finally See U.S. Housing Sector on the Upswing - Real Time Economics - WSJ â€œSigns of stronger housing activity were encouraging,â€? said minutesÂ of the Fedâ€™s June 16-17 policy meeting . The central bank signaled a shift in its view of the housing market three weeks ago in its postmeeting policy statement , replacing a long-standing reference to a â€œslowâ€? recovery with a mention that â€œthe housing sector has shown some improvement.â€? The change followed a string of solid readings in recent months on U.S. home sales and residential construction . The minutes, released Wednesday , still offered a somewhat cautious assessment of recent data. â€œA number of participants noted that housing starts and permits rose considerably in recent months, and indicators of sales activity turned more positive,â€? they said. â€œNonetheless, home construction was still below the trend that would appear consistent with population growth, sales remained at low levels, and credit availability was still relatively tight.â€? The Fedâ€™s view of the housing market has remained more or less downbeat since mid-2013, when a jump in mortgage rates threw the sector off-balance. In the June 2013 policy statement , the Fed confidently said the housing market â€œhas strengthened further.â€? But that July, it added a reference to rising mortgage rates, and by October it saw a slowdown in progress. From March 2014 to April 2015, it said in 10 consecutive policy statements that the recovery either â€œremained slowâ€? or â€œremains slow.â€?
