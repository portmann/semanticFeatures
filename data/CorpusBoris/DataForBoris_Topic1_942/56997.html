Grand Central: Fed Dodges Bullets in Shelby Reform Proposals  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Sen. Shelby to Unveil Legislation Heightening Fed Scrutiny It looks increasingly as though the Federal Reserve will escape the current Congress with its powers largely unchallenged. A bill prepared by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby doesnâ€™t include many of the provisions floating around Capitol Hill which Fed officials find most distasteful. My colleagues Victoria McGrane and Ryan Tracy have the scoop Â on the bank revamp bill in todayâ€™s Wall Street Journal, and a deeper dive Â on the Fed provisions on our Real Time Economics website. Mr. Shelby is a key player. Any effort to alter the Fedâ€™s powers needs to go through his committee. What is most striking is whatâ€™s not included in the Shelby draft, which Republicans describe as a starting point for further negotiation. There are no â€œAudit the Fedâ€? provisions opening Fed monetary policy decisions to scrutiny from the Government Accountability Office; no provisions requiring the Fed to adhere to a mathematical rule to guide interest rate decisions, suchÂ  as the â€œTaylor Rule,â€? which prescribes an interest rate based on the performances of inflation and economic output; no new restrictions on emergency lending powers prescribed in section 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act;Â  no major revamp of the Fedâ€™s 12 regional banks. All of those provisions have been proposed or advanced in various forms in Congress, and Fed officials have resisted each, arguing the ideas would make the central bank either less independent or less effective. The Fed-related provisions in the Shelby proposal look mild at first glance: A requirement that the Fed submit a monetary policy report to Congress four times a year rather than twice, with a discussion of policy rules but not formal adherence to them; a commission to study the structure of the Fed system; faster release of transcripts of Fed policy meetings; additional staff members for Fed governors; Senate confirmation of the New York Fed president. The Fed is still a lightning rod for criticism on Capitol Hill. But it looks like this storm will pass without striking very hard. Sen. Shelby to Unveil Legislation Heightening Fed Scrutiny. Â Senate Banking Chairman Richard Shelby plans to unveil on Tuesday a wide-ranging bill that would heighten congressional scrutiny of the Federal Reserve and revamp numerous rules faced by small - and medium-size banks, according to Republican committee aides. Hereâ€™s How the Shelby Draft Bill Would Affect the Fed. Â Â Among the most closely watched elements of the financial-regulation legislation being crafted by Senate Banking Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) are the provisions that would affect the Federal Reserve. Here is a detailed run-down of what is in a discussion draft Mr. Shelby intends to unveil Tuesday, as described to the Journal by GOP committee aides. Fedâ€™s Dudley: Markets Shouldnâ€™t Be Surprised When Fed Hikes Rates. Â Â Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Tuesday markets shouldnâ€™t be surprised when the U.S. central bank gets around to raising short-term interest rates . Labor Market Momentum Flagging. A Federal Reserve index on labor market conditions fell to -1.9 in April down from -1.8 in March, the first time the measure has been negative for two consecutive months since 2012. The index is closely watched by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen to gauge the health of the U.S. labor market. Despite a hopeful employment number in April, the pace of job creation has slowed to an average 194,000 in the first few months of the year, down from 324,000 in the fourth quarter. Thatâ€™s largely due to the strong dollar and layoffs in the oil and gas industries. NY Fed Survey of Consumers Finds Inflation Expectations Slipping. Consumersâ€™ expectations of inflation one year out ticked down to 2.7% in April from 2.9% the month before, while the three-year view moved from 2.9% to 3%.

Officials can take some solace in the fact that a deflationary mindset hasnâ€™t taken hold. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires Williams: Donâ€™t Expect Warnings About Rate Hikes–CNBC. San Francisco Fed President John Williams told CNBC Monday that the Fed will not give any hint about coming rate hikes, adding that a rate increase is â€œon the tableâ€? whenever the Fed meets.

PBOC Tries to Steer Loans to Small Firms. Fresh off its latest rate cut, Chinaâ€™s central bank is now working to get more lending into the hands of private businesses by using â€œtargetedâ€? measures , according to one bank official. Borrowing costs have risen for businesses despite the bankâ€™s efforts to get more credit flowing. Now the bank could try Pledged Supplementary Lending, which would let the central bank make low-cost loans to banks if they lend to the PBOCâ€™s chosen. SchÃ¤ubleÂ Backs referendum on Greece Deal. Germanyâ€™s Finance Minister said the Greek government should be free to hold a referendum on a future deal between Greece and its European creditors, including the European Central Bank.

On the other hand, a yes vote would strengthen the governmentâ€™s hand in imposing more austerity. The Greek government said it is not currently planning a referendum. New Zealand May Join Region Cutting Rates. Â New Zealandâ€™s central bank is now set to cut interest rates due to weak inflation and tough times for dairy farmers, with some economists calling for a reduction as early as June . Unemployment Falls in the Midwest but for the Wrong Reasons. The sharp drop in the unemployment rate in Midwestern communities such as Decatur, Ill., is due more to workers moving away, retiring or dropping out of the labor force than actually finding a job. Among the 20 metropolitan areas where unemployment fell by at least 2.7 percentage points in the past year, 16 also saw their workforces shrink over the same period, according to Labor Department data. Half of those were in Michigan or Illinois . -12:45 p.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on the economic outlook in New York -9:15 a.m. CEST (3:15 a.m. EDT): New York Fedâ€™s Dudley speaks on the global implications of diverging monetary policy settings in advanced economists in Zurich, Switzerland. RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Full Employment Still a Long Way Away. Chicago Fed economists estimate the economyâ€™s so-called natural unemployment rate likely lies at or below 5%, and it will go even lower over time, according to a note published Monday. The analysis contrasts with the collective view of Fed officials, who estimate the long-run unemployment rate ranges between 5% and 5.2%. The national jobless rate was 5.4% in April. A lower natural rate of unemployment would mean policy makers could wait longer before raising interest rates without worrying that a tight labor market could drive inflation too high. The Chicago Fed note also estimates that the ageing of the population will push the full employment rate down further, to between 4.4% and 4.8% by 2020. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans has said the central bank should hold off on a rate increase until 2016. Rising German Bond Yields Anticipate Market Reactions to Higher Rates. Gavyn Davies argues in the Financial Times that the market for German Bunds is now vulnerable to broader economic forces. The recent spike in yields â€œis a salutary reminder of the much bigger shock that might occur when the central banks finally abandon their zero interest rate policies, though this still does not seem imminent,â€? he writes. â€œThe latest bond tantrum reinforces concerns that changes in financial market structure since 2008 have left even the more liquid asset markets vulnerable to bouts of severe instability.â€? That, he argues, â€œis another very worrying sign for international regulators.â€? Whatâ€™s Behind the Low Levels of Capital Investment? Tho mas J. Duesterberg and Donald A. Norman write in the Journal that high corporate taxes, onerous regulations and weak infrastructure and R&D spending have depressed capital investment, even as corporate profits are up and businesses are flush with cash. They also blame the rise of global competitors and overall political uncertainty. -Economic growth may be set to slow in the U.S., although the eurozone remains on course for a pickup, according to leading indicators released Tuesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. -Oil prices could stay below $100 a barrel for the next decade, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries estimates. Continued weak oil prices could hold down inflation . -Serbiaâ€™s central bank on Monday cut its policy interest rate to 6.5% from 7%, saying in a statement that â€œinflation is moving below the lower bound of the target tolerance band andâ€¦inflationary pressures are persistently subdued.â€? -Alexandre Lamfalussy, a founding president of the European Monetary Institute has died, the European Central Bank announced Monday .
