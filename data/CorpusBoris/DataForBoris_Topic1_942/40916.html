Norges Bank Governor Says Tighter Banking Rules May Not Avert Crises - Real Time Economics - WSJ Tighter banking rules may not be enough to avert financial crises, the head of Norwayâ€™s central bank said Monday. Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen said in a speech in London that central banks should be prepared to raise interest rates to safeguard financial stability and shouldnâ€™t rely solely on newer â€œmacroprudentialâ€? policies aimed at curbing credit growth. â€œWe cannot proceed under the assumption that new regulations alone will eliminate the risk of financial instability. A robust monetary policy should therefore take into account the risk of a build-up of financial imbalances,â€? Mr. Olsen told the London School of Economics, according to a text of his remarks. His remarks underscore an ongoing debate central bank circles about how best to respond when financial-sector excesses threaten to hurt the economy. Some policy makers believe interest-rate policy should stay focused on meeting inflation and employment goals, and favor using separate tools to manage financial stability risks. Others, notably former Federal Reserve governor Jeremy Stein, argue monetary policy â€œgets in all the cracksâ€? of the economy and should be used if needed. In Norway, the central bank is grappling with the twin challenges of an oil-led slowdown and a buoyant housing market. Mr. Olsen said Monday the central bankâ€™s policy rate has been kept higher than it should be to mitigate risks to financial stability. He reiterated that officials are prepared to cut their benchmark interest rate from its current level of 1.25% if the economy slows as expected. But he added theyâ€™re also prepared to ratchet up bank capital requirements to manage the risks in the housing market.
