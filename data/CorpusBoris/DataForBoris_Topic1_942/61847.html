Grand Central: The Phrase of the Day is ‘Residual Seasonality’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hilsenrathâ€™s Take: The Phrase of the Day is â€œResidual Seasonalityâ€? We at The Wall Street Journal are reading about residual seasonality so you donâ€™t have to. At issue is whether government statistics are adequately capturing normal seasonal variation in measures of economic output. Economic activity slows down in the first quarter, after the holidays and when weather turns unaccommodating for commerce. Seasonal adjustments used by statisticians are meant to smooth this out so the data donâ€™t make the first quarter of the year look like the beginning of a broader downtrend in economic output. It is a live issue now because the Commerce Department has reported the economy grew at a meager rate of 0.2% in the first quarter. Was this normal seasonal variation or a lasting slowdown? Economists were asking similar questions in 2014 and in 2011, when recorded output contracted. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco re-estimated first quarter output using additional statistical adjustments Â and found the economy expanded at a 1.8% annual rate when adjusted for predictable seasonal patterns, not 0.2%. Â Macroeconomic Advisers, a private research firm, found that flawed seasonal adjustments tends to reduce recorded first quarter output by 1.6 percentage points. Actual bad weather subtracted an additional 1.6 percentage points from output, Macroeconomic Advisers found. However a study by Federal Reserve Board economists in Washington found no convincing evidence of residual seasonality in recent years. The analysts in these competing studies took different approaches. The Fed board economists focused on the 2010 to 2014 period and found that 2011 and 2014 were simply outlier quarters. The San Francisco Fed and Macroeconomic Advisers found evidence of seasonal adjustment distortions going back two decades. Analysts at Nomura Securities and other research firms have weighed in and also found evidence of seasonal distortions that tend to deflate first quarter growth estimates. Let us accept for a moment that there might be some distortion in the seasonal adjustments. Two broader points seem especially salient at the moment: 1) This wouldnâ€™t matter so much if the economy were growing faster in the first place. Because the trend is so slow, the growth rate is never very far from zero and seasonal scares get close attention; 2) What matters right now is not the first quarter but the second. If the first quarter was distorted by weather patterns, then measures of second quarter output should be bouncing back by now. The employment side of the economy looks like it is doing so. But much of the rest does not. That is the real worry. ECBâ€™s Coeure: Speed of Reversal in Bond Prices Is Cause for Concern. The recent reversal in bond prices is worrisome more for the speed at which it happened , a European Central Bank Executive Board member said in remarks delivered Monday. BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ© also said that the central bank would moderately frontload its purchases in its QE program due to less market liquidity in the summer and that this move wasnâ€™t due to market conditions. ECB Ready to Go Further if Inflation Target Not Met.Â The European Central Bank is ready to take additional steps to boost inflation if its current quantitative easing program proves insufficient, the head of Franceâ€™s central bank Christian Noyer said Tuesday. Greece Talks Making Progress but Deadline Looms. The European Unionâ€™s economics commission Pierre Moscovici said Monday that Greece and its international lenders are moving closer toward a deal but time is running out for Greece to get the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($8.24 billion) in bailout aid. Greek officials have said they will not be able to pay their bills in June without help from creditors, which include the European Central Bank. Euroâ€™s Surge Tramples Parity Predictions. Â Investors are scaling back bets against the euro just several weeks after the common currency seemed headed toward parity with the dollar.Â Behind the rebound in the euro is a reversal in economic fortunes. The U.S. economy has slowed, pushing back expectations for when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Meanwhile, the eurozone has accelerated out of its recent slump, helped by the European Central Bankâ€™s bond-buying program. U.K. Consumer Prices Fall in April. Â Consumer prices in the U.K. fell in April compared with a year earlier for the first time in more than half a century , underscoring the weakness of inflation throughout much of the developed world. Australiaâ€™s Central Bank Hints Rates Can Drop. More interest rate cuts remain on the table in Australia after the countryâ€™s central bank clearly articulated an easing bias on Tuesday, sweeping aside recent speculation that it was done lowering rates. Bank Indonesia Holds Benchmark Rate at 7.50%.Â Bank Indonesia kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 7.50% Tuesday, highlighting “abundant” external risks but also saying it would ease some lending rules to promote consumption. Â Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo told reporters that the bank will ease regulations on loans for home and vehicle purchases. In 2013, seeking to curb consumption as the current-account deficit widened, the bank raised down-payment requirements for purchases. Political Pressures Test Bank Indonesia. Â Bank Indonesia is under increasing political pressure from a young administration to cut its benchmark rate amid sluggish growth . Vice President Jusuf Kalla, a businessman and longtime fixture on the Indonesian political scene, said at a recent business event it would be difficult to revive the economy with high interest rates. If the current account improves and inflation falls, Bank Indonesia could start with another quarter-percentage-point cut, he said. The central bank already cut rates earlier this year . Brazil Expected to Slow Drop in Rates as Inflation Rises. Economists surveyed by the Brazilian central bank raised their forecast for the countryâ€™s inflation to 8.31% from 8.29% in 2015, driven by the rise in government-controlled prices for electricity and fuel. Economists also anticipate that the central bank will slow the drop in the benchmark Selic interest rate. They still foresee a 13.50% rate by the end of 2015, but increased their forecast for the end of next year to 11.75% from 11.63%. The rate is currently 13.25%. Civil Sanctions Complicate Outlook for Former Inmates. Over the past 40 years, as the U.S. prison population grew from fewer than 400,000 inmates to about 1.5 million, states and the federal government enacted thousands of civil sanctions that are triggered by a criminal conviction. Now, as state and federal officials explore ways of reducing the prison population, many are questioning the wisdom of limiting the job prospects of so many past offenders. In 2013, one in 35 adults was under some sort of correctional supervision, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. -11:45 a.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Poloz speaks in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island -12:30 p.m. EDT: RBIâ€™s Rajan speaks in New York -1 p.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Poloz speaks at press conference in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island -2:30 p.m. EDT: Financial Stability Oversight Council meets in Washington -Central Bank of Nigeria releases a policy statement.

Economists at theÂ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Â argue in a new paper that issues with seasonal adjustments in the official growth statistics Â are depressing winter figures. The San Francisco findings contrast with those of Fed board economists in a research note last week finding â€œno firm evidenceâ€? that seasonal adjustments were to blame for weak economic growth in the first quarter. If the San Francisco economists are right, it would suggest that the disappointing first quarter growth numbers could simply be a temporary dip. If the Fed boardâ€™s economists are right, it could signal a more troubling slowdown. NY Fed Growth Forecast Up, Inflation Forecast Down. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York now estimate the economy will grow 1.9% in the fourth quarter of this year from the same quarter last year. In 2016, they peg growth at 2.1% and at 2.2% in 2017. But they lowered their expectations of inflation, which is now expected to remain below 1.5% through the end of 2017. More Detailed Roadmaps, Please. Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, senior vice president and research director for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , writes that Federal Reserve officials should offer a clearer picture of their inflation and employment targets. â€œIn what year do they intend to bring inflation back to the FOMCâ€™s 2% target? What labor market conditions do they expect will prevail at that time?â€? Schulhofer-Wohl compares Fed communications to a Minneapolis to Chicago bus schedule. â€œWhat passengers really want to know, though, is that the bus is heading to Chicago and will arrive there at roughly such-and-such a time. And although this, too, is something the company canâ€™t forecast perfectly, it can say something simple that answers the passengersâ€™ question: We aim to get this bus to Chicago by 9 p.m.â€? Forget Yellen, Look at China. William Pesek argues in Bloomberg View that China is starting to matter more to the bond market than the Federal Reserve. Using research from Oxford Economics he argues that the course that China takes over the next few years will have a greater impact on Treasury rates than any action the Fed and its chairman Janet Yellen might take. â€œBond traders arenâ€™t the only ones keeping a closer eye on Chinaâ€™s $9.2 trillion economy â€“ Yellen is, too,â€? he writes. â€œYellen is aware that she doesnâ€™t have nearly as much control of the fate of the U.S. economy â€“ and the fate of global bond markets â€“ as her reputation might suggest.â€? Secular Stagnation: The History of a Heretical Economic Idea. In a posting on VoxEU, the University of Birmingham’s Roger Backhouse and theÂ Universidade de Brasilia’sÂ Mauro Boianovsky chart the fortunes ofÂ Alvin Hansen’s secular stagnation hypothesis, which has recently been revived by Lawrence Summers. “The concept of secular stagnation evolved and never completely disappeared from view but it went out of fashion for a combination of reasons,” they write. “And secular stagnation was never far from politics for it was closely connected to politically contentious arguments for allowing the level of government debt to rise. That is still true today.” -The National Association of Home Buildersâ€™ confidence index fell in May for the fourth time in five months, although it still indicates a favorable view of the market for single-family newly-built homes. -A survey by the personal finance website Bankrate.com finds that 30% of U.S. consumers think their overall financial situation is better now than a year ago, up from 26% who thought so in April. Only 16% of consumers said their situation had worsened, compared to 21 % last month. The results are the most upbeat since the site began holding the surveys in 2010. -A weaker euro helped boost exports of goods from the eurozone to the rest of the world in March, pushing the currency areaâ€™s trade surplus higher and aiding its economic recovery . Chileâ€™s gross domestic product expanded by 2.4% in the first quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, showing signs of a recovery after several quarters of anemic growth, the central bank said Monday.
