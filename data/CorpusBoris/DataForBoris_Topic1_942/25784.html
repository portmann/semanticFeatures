U.S. data gets ropey, investors get Fed-happy: James Saft April 7 (Reuters) – U.S. employment growth is slowing, the That’s right: Friday’s underwhelming U.S. jobs report, showing just 126,000 positions created in March, led not to the expected Easter Monday selloff in risk assets but to a rally. Strikingly, this is in a context in which a relatively new statistic from the Atlanta Fed, which attempts to measure growth just 0.1 percent, much below most forecasts. ( here ) or are they looking through the data from frigid days to a As so often, the driver may not be the fundamentals but how they affect the turning of the monetary spigots, now gushing Reserve begins to raise interest rates. New York Fed President Bill Dudley in a Monday speech was careful not only to say that the timing of the first hike was tied to the strength of upcoming data, a bit of boiler plate which is always true, but went on to hedge about the more important rate of ascent at which rates may travel. “For financial markets, the likely path of short-term rates “Here, I anticipate that the path will be relatively shallow. Headwinds in the aftermath of the financial crisis are tougher terms for residential mortgage credit.” That’s the sort of dog-whistle which gets them drooling on Wall Street, and markets duly, and obligingly, went up after Dudley spoke. Dudley’s words imply, though they do not promise, that the future path of rate rises will be closer to what the markets expect, slow and gradual, rather than what the Fed itself has forecast. Indeed financial markets are betting that rates are only about 1 percent by the end of 2016, as against the Fed’s median forecast of 1.875 percent, much less its Lower rates for longer are attractive to investors even if, if you follow the logic of Yellen and Dudley’s arguments, they These are possibilities not to be dismissed, but perhaps the more interesting question is what happens if, as the passing of Remember, the Fed has shown itself to be very sensitive to the animal spirits of financial markets. As it moves towards a rate hike, even a delayed and singular one, it will want to make sure that it reassures investors. Sounding optimistic about being able to normalize rates, in anything other than a Still, the overall picture on the labor market, March’s disappointments aside, is not too bad. Unemployment claims continue to be low and payroll taxes collected by the government Unemployment held steady at 5.5 percent, as compared to the 5 to 5.2 percent rate the Fed thinks the economy can have without sparking unwanted inflation. There isn’t too much room for many more good months like we’ve seen previous to March And, even in a weak month, wage growth was respectable, which argues for strong general conditions outside of areas The central thesis for a strong remainder of the year rests on the idea that consumers will begin to spend their energy savings, as may be implied by decent recent sales and lease figures for automobiles, and that the series of wage increases at the bottom end of the employment scale (Wal-Mart, McDonald’s) will prove a trend rather than a public relations effort. If that happens the Fed will have a different problem. Its own estimates of where rates will be in future won’t look so unreasonable to the market any more, which will react by selling As that description covers pretty much everything, the reaction to good news, if it comes, may be strong.
