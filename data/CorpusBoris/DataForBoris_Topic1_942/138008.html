5 Keys To The FOMC Announcement | Seeking Alpha By Kristina Hooper, Steve Malin and Greg Meier The Federal Open Market Committee's announcement on July 29 contained no earth-shattering revelations and offered no discernible clues as to the timing of the first policy rate hike. But market-watchers may want to focus on five key points: The FOMC has gotten more positive on the economy, given that any mention of slow growth in statements from earlier in the year has been excised from the July statement. This is somewhat surprising given that the accidental release of FOMC staff projections of potential GDP for 2015 were 1.61%, below consensus expectations, and 2016 projections anticipate real growth of just 1.72%, far below consensus estimates. The FOMC expects the economy to expand at a moderate pace, but sees the risks to the economy and to labor markets as "nearly" balanced, though it does not say which of the two risks is greater. The FOMC continues to believe that the impacts of lower oil prices and the stronger US dollar, especially on inflation, have been transitory. While inflation has not risen to its target level, the FOMC maintains confidence that it will. In particular, the FOMC expects to adjust the federal funds rate target range upward after the committee has seen "some further improvement in the labor market." This seems to imply that the labor market improvement is getting very close to a level at which the FOMC will be comfortable raising rates. No committee members dissented, so there's no way to know whether they agreed that consensus is now more important than statements of individual viewpoints, or that all voting members were content with putting off any firm decision-making until September, when more data will be on hand. Nothing in this announcement alters our base-case scenario, which is that the US Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points in September, placing it in the 0.25% to 0.50% range. However, we can't stress enough that the pace of rate hikes is far more important than when liftoff begins - and that the pace will be very different, and monetary conditions far more accommodative this time around than during past tightening cycles. As noted in the latest announcement, The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Importantly, we think there may be a mismatch between market expectations and when the Fed will actually raise rates. A recent Bloomberg survey of economists suggests a 50/50 chance of a September rate hike. However, some communication channels suggest far lower odds, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is where federal funds futures are traded. As of July 29, the CME quotes that the odds are zero for September liftoff. The discrepancy between the economists' views and the CME's odds is likely tied to calculation challenges relating to the shift from the previous federal funds rate regime (which was a target rate) to the current regime (which is a target range), which occurred in December 2008. The switch has been irrelevant since then, because rates haven't changed. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
