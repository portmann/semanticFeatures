Â I hope you’ll circulate this article widely. It explains why the Fed’s effort to depict interest rate increases as necessary given the state of the “recovery” and the prospects for inflation are obviously false. The rate rises are all about bolstering financial firm profits, as if banks have a right to them. In other words, this is a continuation of the process set forth in Simon Johnson’s landmark 2009 article, The Quiet Coup. From the overview : The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our governmentâ€”a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets…recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. One could imagine a more honest case for rate increasesL that sustained negative real yields promotes speculation (witness the proliferation of Silicon Valley unicorns), hurts retirees and savers, and puts the viability of long-term investors like life insurers and pension funds at risk. But given how weak this recovery is, and that deflationary pressures are strong, any rate increases should be accompanies by more fiscal spending. Yet the Fed has not said a peep on that front and instead hope the confidence fiary will come to the rescue. The fact that the Fed is embarking on a policy that will perpetuate the financial system being outsized relative to the real economy, particularly when more and more academic studies confirm that that is negative for growth, confirms that the Fed needs fundamental governance changes to reduce bank influence and increase democratic accountability.  A place to start might be having all the regional Fed presidents be nominated by the President and subject to Congressional approval. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday (December 16) that it would raise policy interest rates by Â¼ to Â½ of 1 percent end the seven year policy of keeping Fed interest rates near zero, and would embark on a path of “gradual” interest rate increases in order to “normalize” interest rates. This announcement had been long expected by pundits, economists and the financial markets, and, more to the point, had long been pushed by Wall Street and their supporters. It was telling that the first question asked by a reporter in Fed Chair’s Janet Yellen’s press conference following the announcement was not a question at all. The reporter blurted out a sigh of relief: “Finally!” he exalted. The Financial Timesâ€™ Lex Column headline: â€œU.S. Monetary Policy At Lastâ€?. In fact the financial media have been huge cheerleaders for a rate hike. In the months leading up to this announcement, much of the business press had been pushing for an increase. In September, when the Fed did not raise rates, much of the financial press ran headlines like the this Wall Street Journal headline: “The FED Blinks”. The Journal was not alone with phrases like: â€œthe open market committee sat on its hands.â€? . Blinking and hands sitting: these suggest lack of courage, weakness and worse. Neil Irwin of the New York Times, personalized it to Janet Yellen with a headline on September 17: â€œ Why Yellen Blinked on Interest Ratesâ€? Well, yesterday, Yellen did not blink and the financial press and many economists and pundits were clearly pleased. Yet, as the thoughtful members of the press and economists pointed out, economic conditions are not much better, and in some ways are worse, in December, than they had been in September. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) wrote almost immediately after the decision multiple reasons why data do not support a decision to raise rates: He points out that while the official unemployment of 5% is not particularly high, â€œmost other measures of the labor market are near recession levelsâ€?. The percentage of the workforce working part time but who really want full time jobs is near the highs reached after the 2001 recession. The percentage of workers willing to quit their jobs to look for a better job is also at near recession highs. â€œIf we look at employment rates, the percentage of prime-age workers (ages 25-54) with jobs is still down by almost three full percentage points from the pre-recession peak.â€? Finally, wages stagnation is still significant, even despite some recent low gains. The signs of weakness and uncertainty globally are also still strong. John Authers of the Financial Times shows in a series of graphs that market participants expect inflation to fall further, NOT rise to the 2% level expected by the Fed; oil prices continue tumbling which could be a source of demand for consumers, but, like other aspects of deflation, put a downward pressure on important sectors and, if they interact with excessive debt, can contribute to pressures for a debt deflation spiral; global equities have fallen along with oil and other commodity prices, perhaps a sign of weakening profit expectations; and importantly, the value of dollar continues to rise, which might help foreign exporters, but serves a drag on US economic production by making it less competitive. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the European Central Bank is moving in the opposite direction by lowering interest rates — even into negative territory . All of this raises the obvious question of how did Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve justify their rate increase now, despite strong signs that there is little economic basis for doing so? Call this the Fedâ€™s â€œNew Operation Twistâ€?: an exercise, not in twisting the term structure of interest rates to lower long rates and raise short rates as in earlier times, but an exercise in twisted logic, plain and simple. This was apparent in the Federal Reserveâ€™s press release, and even more in Janet Yellenâ€™s press conference following the Federal Open Market Operations (FMOC) meeting. Her justification for raising rates rested on several questionable, and even strange, twists of logic. The first, and most important, is the confidence the Fed has that inflation will continue to rise toward its 2% target, even though, by raising rates, the Fed will be putting downward pressure on the economy. They are thus creating an additional â€œheadwindâ€? to join the other global forces in the domestic and global economies â€“ weak demand in China, commodity market gluts and uncertainty over terrorism and global security â€“that all suggest that inflation will remain weak. Part of the reason they believe inflation will rise despite the increase in interest rates and other negative forces, is that they believe with lower unemployment, workers will achieve the bargaining power to raise their real wages. But in the current context of weak bargaining rights, globalization by US multinational corporations, and the continued weakness in the labor market domestically, worker real wages are likely to continue doing what they have done for decades now: remain relatively stagnant. These odd examples of twisted logic seem minor, though, compared to some of the more bizarre arguments made by Yellen and the Fed. In her statement and answers to questions after her remarks, Yellen said several times that the increase in interest rates is a strong sign of the Federal Reserveâ€™s confidence in the strength of the American Economy. Because, after all, if the US economy were not doing well, then of course, the Fed would not be raising rates, right? Here is an example of the Fed trying to play the classic game of the â€œconfidence fairyâ€? â€“ we will raise your confidence by pretending we are confident. But it is rather more like â€œwhistling past the graveyardâ€?: with the data out there for everyone to see, most are unlikely to be fooled. It is also a little like saying: we are going to get in our truck and run you over because we are confident that you are strong enough to take it. And here is, perhaps the strangest twisted logic of all: Yellen said that they want to raise rates now, because they are worried that if there is a downward shock to the economy, with interest rates at the zero bound they will have fewer tools (less ammunition) to counteract the shock. Doesnâ€™t this sound like she is saying: we are going to create a downward shock, so later it is easier to counteract it? The final example is the argument that they want to raise rates pre-emptively now, before there is any clear sign of excessive inflation, because lags in monetary policy mean that if they wait they might be too late and then they will have to raise rates more abruptly and this will be even more disruptive. We must ask the question: who does more rapid increases disrupt? The answer is likely to be the speculative financial markets, and the banks who might find that the speculative positions they take have been mistaken. So here, in paying excessive concern for the financial speculative markets, the Fed is willing to raise interest rates before the labor market is really ready. This also begs the question: where does this 2% inflation target come from? It is completely arbitrary, which even Bernanke, the architect of the new inflation targeting at the Fed, admits. Would it be better to allow a shallow rate increase trajectory at the appropriate time, and let inflation over-shoot its arbitrary 2% target, then risk prematurely nipping the recovery in the budd? To be sure, Yellen repeatedly said that the increase in rates will be gradual. ButÂ  projections by the Fed Policy Makers suggest anything but a gradual rate increase. These projections of the expectations of the policy makers (not their plans, to be clear) show interest rates rising to between 2 and 3% by the time the new President is inaugurated. Why is it that Janet Yellen, clearly a very smart economist who is committed like, perhaps, no Fed Chair before her, to try to achieve full employment and reduce inequality would engage in such questionable arguments and problematic actions? The most likely answer is probably that Yellen faces enormous pressure from her own committee and outside forces to raise rates sooner rather than later. These outside forces are the banks. A series of papers have shown that in general, bank profits increase with higher interest rates. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have done empirical work that suggests that higher interest rates improve bank profits; and others at the IMF have done careful empirical work suggesting that in the US higher interest rates raise income inequality. But in the time of the Great Financial crisis and quantitative easing, the relationship between monetary policy, bank profits and inequality is actually more complicated than this. In a series of papers at the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), Juan Montecino and I show that Quantitative Easing by the Fed initially improved bank profitability and helped corporate profits in other sectors as well, such as automobiles and construction. It did also raise employment and helped workers and the middle class, but, at the same time, though, QE worsened income inequality , by delivering large asset price gains to the wealthiest Americans. By the later phases of QE, though, most banks in the US did not continue benefiting from loose monetary policy and then the attitude of Wall Street toward expansionary policy likely faded. As Tom Ferguson and I showed in the case of prematurely aborted expansionary monetary policy in the 1930â€™s, the banks began to lose more from lower interest rates than they gained in asset price appreciation and expanded demand. The result is that the more standard pattern identified by the IMF and BIS economists of lower interest rates hurting bank profits has likely returned. And with it has been the blistering pressure to raise rates. Facing this pressure, Janet Yellen has most likely decided play a strategic game: give in to the demands from her colleagues for a move toward higher rates, while expecting to be able to drag her feet in the future on raising too rapidly, in the hope of keeping monetary policy â€œaccommodativeâ€? along the way. Will this gambit — which has caused her to twist her logic like a pretzel — work? It seems like a long shot. Finance has its long knives drawn and it has plenty of allies on its side. At the same time, though, the fragility of the global economy will weigh in on her side. The tragedy, of course, is that this is not the game she should be playing. First, fiscal policy needs to be much more aggressive in promoting needed investment. Moreover, rather than beating a strategic retreat, Yellen and allies should be engaging in much more creative, direct job promotion and direct promotion of local infrastructure investment, as proposed by groups like QE for the People in the UK associated with Jeremy Corbyn and the Fedup Campaign , here in the US. To make that happen, we need to keep pushing. And fast.

If you look at what they do instead of what they say, it’s clear that the Fed sees their mandate as: Although the terms bank supervision and bank regulation are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to distinct, but complementary, activities. Bank supervision involves the monitoring, inspecting, and examining of banking organizations to assess their condition and their compliance with relevant laws and regulations. When a banking organization within the Federal Reserve’s supervisory jurisdiction is found to be non-compliant or to have other problems, the Federal Reserve may use its supervisory authority to Its hard not to conclude that either the FED didn’t know what the banks were/are doing, or refused to take any action that the banks did not want.  To me, the FED is very much like the cops who don’t actually commit police abuse, but can never figure out if it occurs, never actually sees it, and can’t stop it. But as much as I enjoy FED bashing, the bigger problem is that the entire world buys the notion that all “economic” problems (I don’t buy that inequality is an economic problem – it is a POLITICAL problem, and the very idea that one uses the FED to address it IS the problem) can be tuned to perfection by fiddling with the interest rates.  Fiscal policy, tax policy, addressing inequality, etcetera are simply not subjects for polite discussion, because it is all FED all the time.  The FED is a big McGuffin… Yes.  That’s why I say that the Fed is complicit in, the prime enabler of, Congress’s dereliction of duty:  by their ‘heroic’ and unconventional efforts, the Fed fosters the belief that that monetary policy can solve all economic problems — a belief that makes only upward redistribution of wealth possible. The rate increase is a declaration of victory by bureaucrats for taking extraordinary measures that made a lot of things worse and a few things better.  Getting off zero and making it stick, if only temporarily, means what they did was right because now we are back to “normal.” For musty-smelling fed bureaucrats, this is a gold metal win.  All the debt on the balance sheet, all the giveaways to the big banks, and all the inequality they created can now be judged as worth it.  High fives and chest bumps rule the day around the Fed table.  Their legacy is now secure.  Be happy for them.  They needed this win and now they have it.  Sore losers who grumble about their flat wages, unsustainable debt, deflation and their stripped-mined economy will never get a good sportsmanship award. Interesting points.  One point that I’m mostly not gonna buy is this below; I think the level on the 2yr, and 10yr, respectively, are instructive here. “…projections of the expectations of the policy makers (not their plans, to be clear) show interest rates rising to between 2 and 3% by the time the new President…” “Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) wrote almost immediately after the decision multiple reasons why DATA DO NOT SUPPORT A DECISION to raise rates…..” Then what does support a decision?  Answer, again from the post: “Facing this pressure, Janet Yellen has most likely decided play a strategic game: give in to the demands from her colleagues for a move toward higher rates…. …….   It seems like a long shot. Finance has its long knives drawn and it has plenty of allies on its side.” It is a political tactic in response to  the organized political opposition to  job growth and potential wage growth and lobbyists biased for bank profits.  Understanding the charts and graphs data sets will not yield a clear understanding of the economic decision made here and in other instances where there is a political consequence for every basis point, no matter what up or down direction rates go.  Economics can not escape the gravitational pull of greed to endlessly seek profits under capitalism.  Magnetar, good name, even better tell.  And the power calculus of Harold Laswell: “Politics is who gets what, when and how.” Janet Yellen’s opposition, the Fed inflation hawks and their Wall St allies, will be back for more basis points.  Can she mount a defense and gain allies from the NC community to restrain any more rate hikes for a prolonged basis, maybe after the next president is sworn in?  I think it makes sense to support such a position. TG on Latinos Live Longest Despite Poverty. Hereâ€™s Their Secret Um, really?
