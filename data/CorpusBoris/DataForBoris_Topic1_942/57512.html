Fed’s Williams Says Central Bank Faces No Pressure on Rate Question - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Tuesday the U.S. central bank still has ample time to decide what it will be doing with short-term interest rates. Repeating his view that a rise in interest rates is “on the table” at all Fed meetings now, Mr. Williams said “there’s no pressure to decide on the future path of policy today, so I am in ‘wait and see mode,’ with a keen eye on the data.” He noted the Fed will get two more months’ worth of economic data before meeting in June, which will “paint a more complete” picture of the economy than currently exists. Mr. Williams made the comments in a speech delivered before an economists’ group in New York. He has been arguing for some time that a truly data-dependent monetary policy stance means officials can’t offer firm guidance about when they will move rates higher. Most central bankers have looked toward this year as a time to act, but weak data during the start of the year has made that outlook less certain. Fed officials by and large are offering less guidance about the interest-rate outlook. In a speech earlier Tuesday, New York Fed leader William Dudley Â told an audience in Zurich that when it comes to rate increases, “the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves. Since the economic outlook is uncertain, this means the timing of liftoff must also be uncertain.” Mr. Williams, speaking to reporters after his speech, said that at a time when officials are providing less guidance, he expects to see a bit more volatility return to markets. He said market participants would do well to take stock of the Fed’s quarterly economic projections to help work out where monetary policy might be heading, even though he cautioned that these projections are not commitments. “We have to accept the fact that market participants will come to their own conclusions” about the outlook, Mr. Williams said. “If it’s just a difference in probabilities” about the interest-rate outlook, “I’m not so worried about that,” he said in reference to a question of whether he was worried about the Fed and market outlook on rates not being on the same page. Mr. Williams said in response to an audience question that short-term interest rates will likely settle at lower levels in the future relative to the past due to changes in the economy. Mr. Williams said in his speech he’s very upbeat about the outlook, but he wants to be sure that the weakness seen in the first quarter will not last. He suspects factors like bad winter weather and other things likely depressed activity then. “The fundamentals are sound. The underlying momentum in job growth remains solid,” Mr. Williams said. “What I see when I look at the data that strip out the short-term volatility is an economy with good momentum, that’s nearing full employment, with an inflation trend that’s running about 1 1/2%,” he said. He said 2015 is likely to match a pattern seen in recent years where growth starts out weak and gives way to better numbers as the year advances. Mr. Williams said he expects the economy to make gradual progress back to the Fed’s 2% inflation goal, and said he wasn’t entirely surprised price pressures have been so weak. Mr. Williams repeated that he expects what is now a 5.4% jobless rate to go below 5% by year’s end, although he added the low levels of the jobless rate probably overstate how much the economy has improved. Mr. Williams said one benefit of starting rate rises sooner rather than later is that it will allow a more gradual path of increases over time as the Fed seeks to get interest rate policy back to more historically normal levels. At the same time, he said boosting rates off of near zero levels will still leave central bank policy at levels very supportive to continued growth.
