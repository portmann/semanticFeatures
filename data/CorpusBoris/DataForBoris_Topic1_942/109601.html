5 Things to Watch in the Fedâ€™s June Meeting Minutes - WSJ TheÂ Federal ReserveÂ last monthÂ  signaled it was on track Â to start raising short-term interest rates later this year. But to get there, officials must navigate muddled signals on the economy at home and potential turmoil overseas. Important new details about the Fed’s outlook for rates emerge Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, when the Fed releases minutes of its June 16-17 policy meeting. Here are five things to watch. The Fed kept its benchmark federal-funds rate pinned near zero in June, but continued to inch toward its first rate increase since mid-2006 thanks to an apparent pickup in growth and hiring. Its next policy meeting is July 28-29 but more attention has focused on the possibility of a rate increase at its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Fed governor Jerome Powell recently said his forecast Â â€œcalls for liftoff in September and for an additional increase in December.â€? The June minutes could offer additional clues about the probable timing of liftoffâ€”as did the April minutes , which revealed many officials “thought it unlikely that the data available in June would provide sufficient confirmation that the conditions for raising” rates “had been satisfied.” Trouble spots overseas were a likely topic of conversation last month, though Fed officials gathered before the latest twists and turns in China and Greece . In April, policy makers â€œpointed to a number of risks to the international economic outlook, including the slowdown in growth in China and fiscal and financial problems in Greece,â€? according to the minutes . Following the June meeting, Chairwoman Janet Yellen told reporters the U.S. â€œhas very limited direct exposure to Greeceâ€? but â€œto the extent that there are impacts on the euro-area economy or on global financial markets, there would undoubtedly be spillovers to the United States that would affect our outlook as well.â€? The Fed’s word of the summer is â€œgradual.â€? Fed officials keep emphasizing that once rates begin to rise, the pace of tightening will likely be slowâ€”a prediction reinforced by theirÂ  latest economic projections . â€œThe assessment that participants have of the economy suggest to them that the appropriate pace of normalization to keep the economy on track to meet our objectives will be gradual,â€? Ms. YellenÂ said . Wednesdayâ€™s minutes offer a chance to drive that message home, and perhaps offer more detail on policy makers’ postliftoff plans. Policy makersÂ  have said Â they want to be â€œreasonably confidentâ€? annual inflation will move back toward their 2% target by the time they raise interest rates. Wednesdayâ€™s minutes could offer clues on where they stood on this issue last month. Oil prices had stopped plunging, though they’veÂ  moved lower in recent days . TheÂ  strong dollar Â may continue to weigh on prices. And overall inflationÂ  remains subdued . There are signs that a tightening labor market is generating a pickup in wage growthâ€”or not,Â  depending on the data source . The Fed last month made a significant shift in its description of the U.S. housing sector. Back in mid-2013, Fed policy statements went from noting strength in the housing sector to flagging a rise in mortgage rates and then describing a slowdown. For more than a year, the Fed said the housing recovery remained slowâ€”until June, when it instead said the sector â€œhas shown some improvement.â€? The minutes could reveal why officials suddenly seem more optimistic.
