WSJ/IMF Panel Discussion: The Elusive Pursuit of Inflation - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet and IMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton appear on a International Monetary Fund panel alongside Takatoshi Ito, Professor at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs, and moderated by The Wall Street Journalâ€™s chief economics correspondent, Jon Hilsenrath. After years of working toward low and stable inflation, the worldâ€™s central banks are now faced with the opposite challenge: getting inflation to rise. Despite years of super low interest rates and asset-purchase programs aimed at spurring economic activity, inflation remains below the goals of the worldâ€™s major central banks. Watch a panel discussion Â at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 16, hosted by the International Monetary Fund and The Wall Street Journal, and moderated by Jon Hilsenrath, the Journalâ€™s chief economics correspondent.

With inflation in Europe, Japan, and the United States below their goals, central banks are confronting the question of whether monetary policy is becoming incapable of creating inflation? The panelists will discuss tools to achieve inflation targets and the implications for movements in global currencies.
