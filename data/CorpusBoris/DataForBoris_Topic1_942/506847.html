Federal Reserve Decision: Same Old Thing, Once More | Seeking Alpha The Fed, once again, did not move its policy interest rate. The only thing that was different this time is that there is a presidential election coming in several weeks, otherwise the data are not really that much different than earlier. The problem: it seems as if the Fed will continue to waffle over the next several weeks before the next FOMC meeting so that the uncertainty and volatility will continue. The Federal Reserve decided not to raise its policy rate at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But, now listen to this, as the headlines on the front page of the paper Wall Street Journal blare: " Fed Makes Case for Year-End Hike ." Where have I heard something like this before? Let's see…first I go back until the December 2014, just after the third round of quantitative easy ended. Then, I heard it again in the Spring of 2015…then the summer of 2015…then the fall… Oh my gosh, the Fed actually raised its policy rate in December of 2015. But, then in January we heard more about rate increases…and in the spring…and in the summer…and now in the fall of 2016. We hear, once again, that the "data driven" Fed officials are seeing information that leads them to think that in December they might move to see another rate increase. After showing no increase around noon yesterday, the Dow-Jones Industrial average rose by about 160 points. And today, the Dow has been up, at one time, around 160 points. The Fed asset bubble continues for another month or two. But, remember, Federal Reserve officials are data driven…. To me, the information that was really driving Federal Reserve officials at this September meeting was the upcoming election. A basic rule of the Federal Reserve is that it never makes moves just before political events, moves that might impact elections one way or another. Think what might have happened if the Federal Reserve had raise its policy rate yesterday. Given that the market has been so sensitive and volatile , a rate increase after the market place had been signaling that traders believed that there was only a 20 percent probability that the Fed would move would have caused a substantial drop! A significant drop in the stock market only 46 days before the presidential election would have, I believe a major impact on the vote. Of course, having all the various FOMC member speeches before the meeting and then having a 7-3 split on the vote indicates that there are mixed feelings in the Fed and that because of all the mixed feelings they can be exempted from being accused of having favorites in the election. And, with the movement up in the stock market and relatively optimistic data releases in hand, the Fed can claim that there is a case for raising rates in December, even though the rate increase is not justified at the current time. But, now we are right back where we were at the close of the previous FOMC meeting. Will the Federal Reserve raise its policy rate in December…or, won't it? This is no kind of "forward guidance." It is no wonder, in my mind, why the Federal Reserve is getting such dismal ratings these days. Again, in my mind, officials at the Federal Reserve have botched their responsibility. I have never seen confidence in the Fed at such a low level. I don't know, right now, how the Fed is going to earn back the respect it once had. Perhaps it needs some new leadership. The financial markets do not need to go through another several months with the Fed dangling a rate increase in from of them…and then backing off once again. However, this is exactly what it looks like is going to happen. Toward the end of October this year, quantitative easing will have ended two year ago. The only thing that has increased at the Fed during this time is confusion. I don't see that changing in the near term.
