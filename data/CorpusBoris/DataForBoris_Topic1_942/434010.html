Economists React to the Fed Decision: â€˜Too Many Uncertaintiesâ€™ Fed Decision Makers Wrestle With So-Called Natural Rate Â (June 12) Itâ€™s a Good Thing the Fed Has Missed its Chance to Raise Rates. Hereâ€™s Why. Â (June 10) HAPPY FED DAY:Â Welcome to another fun-filled Fed fest. Your central bank is wrapping up a two-day meeting with lots of hand-wringing about the economic outlook, the job market and the state of the world. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s economics team is here to bring you all the action, the context and commentary live here throughout the afternoon. PROGRAMMING NOTES: In case you donâ€™t know the drill, weâ€™re now warming up for the Fed action. The statement from the Federal Open Market Committe will come at 2 p.m. ET. The Fedâ€™s latest economic projections come at the same time. Weâ€™ll be parsing both releases for clues about the Fedâ€™s plans for the coming months. Janet Yellen will come out from behind the curtain at 2:30 p.m. ET, reading her own statement and then taking questions from the Fed press corpsÂ for an hour. As of now, fed-fund futures tracked by CME Group peg the odds of a June rate increase at 1.9%. Among private economists surveyed this month by the Journal, just 6% predicted a June rate hike , and the average probability of an increase was pegged at 12%. And most importantly, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues have backed off their earlier signals that an imminent rate increase was on the table. In her June 6 speech , Ms. Yellen avoided a phrase she had used in late May, suggesting that a rate increase would happen in the â€œcoming months.â€?Â  WHAT TO WATCH TODAY: If youâ€™ve been reading the Journalâ€™s vast central banking coverage , you know the Fed is not going to be raising interest rates at this meeting. What you donâ€™t know is how willing the Fed will be to raise its rate target at the July or September meetings. That depends largely on whether the economy follows Fed officialsâ€™ economic outlook, whether the latest jobs report was an aberration or the start of a more serious downturn, whether the British people vote to leave the European Union, whether that decision (if they leave) triggers a global market panic and whether the rest of the world (including China) stays calm along the way. NUMBER TWENTY-TWO: In case you lost count, today will be the 22nd Fed press conference since this glorious ritual began in 2011. Feeling nostalgic about the good times when the Fed could pull off a quarter-point rate hike without the world immediately falling apart? Then you can relive the December 2015 meeting. Remember when a rate increase seemed increasingly likely for June? That was the March 2016 meeting. Weâ€™ve followed all 22 here on Real Time Economics. Relive the good old days of near-zero interest rates with a tour: INFLATION WATCH: For four years and counting, U.S. inflation has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target. Back in December, policy makers said they were â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that inflation would rise to 2% soon. In her speech last week , Ms. Yellen saw hope in rising oil prices and the dollarâ€™s stabilization against other currencies. â€œAs the downward pressure on prices from these two forces dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to 2%,â€? she said. But in the same speech, Ms. Yellen took note of recent slippage in market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations, saying that they had â€œmoved enough to get my close attention. If inflation expectations really are moving lower, that could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2% as quickly as I expect.â€? Just a few days later, the University of Michigan reported U.S. consumersâ€™ long-term inflation expectations declined in June to their lowest level on record . Weâ€™ll find out at 2 p.m. EDT how the Fed navigates these mixed inflation signals. Here are some of the key sentences from the April 27 policy statement : â€œInflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2% longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.â€? â€œInflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.â€? â€œIn light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.â€? THE TWO HANDS OFÂ JANET YELLEN:Â  In her latest speech last week , Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen made it clear this would not be the day for a rateÂ increase.Â Sheâ€™s a cautious policy maker and certainly wasnâ€™t going to go forward after a surprisinglyÂ weak jobs report .Â  How quickly inflation will move back to 2% On each of those, thereâ€™s not a whole lot to get excited about. Still,Â sheâ€™s also notÂ entirely downbeat. Again, in her own words: But speaking for myself, although the economy recently has been affected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones. As a result, I expect the economic expansion to continue, with the labor market improving further and GDP growing moderately Even Ms. Yellen herself acknowledged she was doing a bit of two-handed economist speak.Â Where does that leave us? Expect both hands to speak at todayâ€™s press conference, leaving all options open forÂ July and September. THE JOBS BACKDROP: The stage for todayâ€™s FOMC meeting was set, in large part, by the disappointing jobs report for the month of May. According to the Labor Department, only 38,000 jobs were added last month. That means job growth in 2016 is off to the weakest start since 2009 â€” not the sort of backdrop the Fed wants to see for rate increases. DOT DRIFT: In whatâ€™s likely to be a status-quo Fed meeting, the drift of the dot plot raises questions, especially how the market would react to further reductions in policy makersâ€™ forecasts on the pace of rate increases. The Fed and traders have been locked in a struggle wherein central bankers have been more hawkish and frequently critical of investorsâ€™ doubts about rate increases. But the marketâ€™s recent dovishness has proved more accurate to policy the central bank is actually delivering. MARKET CHECK: U.S. stocks are up slightly in quiet trading ahead of the Fed’s rate decision. “What we’re seeing today is a bounce more than anything else. Most people are kind of watching” ahead of the Fed, said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 25 points, or 0.1%, to 17700. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2%. If stocks end Wednesday higher, they would snap a four-session losing streak. With the Fed widely expected to keep rates on hold, investors will be looking for any hints in the Fed’s statement about what the central bank may do later this year. TWO TO WATCH:Â Two often overlooked numbers inÂ the Fedâ€™s economic projections should get special attention today. First: the â€œlonger runâ€? GDP growth rate. In March, it was 2% but Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan predicts it will drop to 1.9%, reflecting officialsâ€™ growing belief that productivity growth is in a lasting slump. Second, the longer run Federal funds rate, a proxy for the â€œequilibriumâ€? or â€œneutralâ€? rate. It dropped from 3.5% in December to 3.3% in March and officials have hinted they think it may be even lower. WATCHING CAREFULLY: Caterpillar Inc. Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said global businesses canâ€™t overlook even a small move by the Fed . â€œWe have to be very careful with rising interest rates and where they go,â€? he said on Wednesday morning. â€œA quarter of a point? Yeah, you can say it isnâ€™t a lot, but look at the ramifications of the last time it was raised a quarter of a pointâ€”it rumbled around the world pretty good.â€? A TALE OF TWO JOBLESS RATES: If you were only looking at the headline unemployment rate â€” which fell to 4.7% last month â€” you might think the Fed has accomplished about as much as it can possibly do. The rate is now pretty close to its lowest levels of recent decades. But thatâ€™s not the case with a broader measure of unemployment and underemployment. Close followers of economic data will know this broader rate as U-6 â€” it includes people who are unemployed and looking for work, people who have given up looking for work because theyâ€™re discouraged or marginally attached to the labor force, and even people with part-time jobs who would like more hours. Add all these people together and you get a rate of 9.7% â€” higher than the readings of 7% that we saw in the late-1990s or in the middle part of the last decade. As Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials often point out, by this measure thereâ€™s still quite a bit of room for improvement. SHEâ€™LL BE BACK: If this afternoonâ€™s news conference isnâ€™t enough for you, Ms. Yellen will speakÂ again next week â€“ twice, in fact . Sheâ€™ll head up to Capitol Hill for her semiannual congressional testimony, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, June 21 and making an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, June 22. Her second day of testimony will come a day before the hotly anticipated U.K. referendum on whether to leave the European Union, which some Fed officials have identified as a potential risk . Itâ€™s all happening a little earlier than usual â€“ the second round of so-called Humphrey-Hawkins testimony typicallyÂ happens in July. But schedulingÂ hearings around the July 4 holiday, the Republican and Democratic national conventions and the blackout period ahead of the Fedâ€™s July 26-27 policy meeting might have proven tricky. Ms. Yellen also has at least one public appearanceÂ on her calendar forÂ late summer â€“ an Aug. 26 speech during the Kansas City Fedâ€™s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. She skipped last yearâ€™s symposium. IF AND ONLY IF: In comments since the April meeting, Fed officials primed markets for a rate rise at either the June or July meetings. Good thing almost all of those projections were shrouded in the language of “if the economy permits,” given what the grim May jobs data did to the outlook for rate increases. The problem for officials: Their completely valid “data dependent” language makes just about any rate guidance highly speculative. How much stock should one put in the recent guidance if one bad jobs report can affect the monetary policy outlook so starkly? SAYING NO TO THE STATUS QUO: The prospect of an FOMC dissent remains decent simply because Kansas City Fed president Esther George has a vote. Hawk or dove, the Fed officials who’ve spoken recently have all done so in a hedged way that suggests no super-strong appetite to boost rates now. Ms. George, speaking last month, again warned very low rates create financial risks. The official has only voted with the FOMC consensus twice in 11 votes, so it would be no surprise that a status-quo vote would push her to dissent yet again. STATEMENTÂ TIME: The magical moment (2 p.m.) is almost upon us. This is a Fed that does not like sudden moves, soÂ you’ll have to squintÂ a little extra today while scrutinizing the FOMC statement. The press conference is where the real fun comes,Â where you get to predict the future of global monetary policy based on how often the Fed chief smiles or clears her throat. NO CHANGE: No surprise, the Fed kept its interest-rate target unchanged.Â  And it offered no real clues about whatâ€™s to come in July. The statement was exactly what you’d say if you wanted to avoid making waves. THE RATE OUTLOOK: The voting Fed policy makers were unanimous in not moving today. No dissents, even from the Kansas City Fed chief. We did see a wing of the Fed getting antsy about a lot of tightening. Six officials now see just one rate increase in 2016 (up from one official in March). Overall, the group still sees two rate increases. But now only two officials see more than two rate increases this year (down from seven in March). A SLOWER PATH:Â Fed officials brought down their interest-rate projections for 2017, 2018 and beyond in the economic projections released alongside their statement Wednesday. Officials now see rates rising to a median 1.6% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018, down from 1.9% and 3.0% in their March projections. For the longer term, Fed officials see rates rising only to 3%, down from 3.3% in their March projections. The 2016 projections remain unchanged at 0.9%, implying two rate increases this year.Â  SLIGHTLY WEAKER GROWTH:Â Fed officials see a slightly lower rate of economic growth for this year and next than in their March projection. The new estimates show Fed officials’ median expectation for economic growth in 2016 is 2%, down from the 2.2% forecast in the March release. For 2017, the median expected growth rate fell slightly to 2.0% compared to March’s 2.1%. In the longer run, Fed officials still see the economy’s growth rate at 2%. STRONGER INFLATION AHEAD? With oil prices rising, policy makers expect inflation to increase at a slightly faster pace this year. The median expectation for inflation this year is now 1.4%, versus the median 1.2% seen in the March projections. Officials still expect inflation to reach the Fed’s 2% target in 2018. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is also expected to pick up slightly faster than previously expected, rising 1.7% this year and 1.9% in 2017. Inflation has now undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% goal for four years. STOCKS EXTEND GAINS: U.S. stocks add to their gains after the Fed held rates steady and Fed officials lowered their projections for how much they expect to raise short-term rates in the coming years. The Dow hit its high of the day in the wake of the decision before giving some of it up, recently up 0.4% vs. a 0.3% gain just before the release. WHEN HAWKS DON’T CRY: Kansas City Fed chief Esther George has been in almost constant opposition toÂ her voting colleagues this year. Not today.That’s the first dissent-free meeting since January. The fact that Ms. George didn’t push for a rate rise is telling, and suggests the outlook for rate rise has grown more challenging. PARSE AWAY: Want to see every change and tweak in the latest policy statement? The Fed Statement Tracker is live. AN UNUSUAL FORECAST: This is one of the more unusual Fed interest-rate forecasts that we’ve ever seen. There’s one official who would like to raise rates once more by the end of 2016 — to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. Then, this official wants to leave rates unchanged for the entirety of 2017 and 2018. â€” Josh Zumbrun (@JoshZumbrun) June 15, 2016 It’s unclear what’s behind this forecast — if it’s likely to be inappropriate to raise rates in 2017 and 2018, what’s the rationale for raising them once more this year? If things aren’t good enough for further rate increases over the next two years, shouldn’t the Fed probably consider lowering interest rates back down? No Fed official had a forecast like this in March. This will be a mystery in coming weeks to see if any official steps forward to claim this forecast. YELLEN’S OPEN:Â In her opening remarks Ms. Yellen reiterated that “gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time are likely to be consistent with achieving and maintaining our objectives” and that “recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.” She said that despite disappointments in the first quarter, consumer spending appears to be rebounding and that economic activity is likely to expand in coming years. Regarding the job market, Ms. Yellen said that “more recently, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed markedly.” Â While the job market hasÂ “on balance been disappointing,” Ms. Yellen said that “it’s important not to over-react to one or two monthly readings. The committee continues to expect the labor market will strengthen further” in coming years. GOLD SURGES: Gold prices jumped after the Fed left benchmark interest rates unchanged. In recent trading, gold futures were up 0.4% on the day to $1,293.10 a troy ounce, according to FactSet data, after showing a loss of 0.1% just before the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m. Lower rates are typically positive for gold because it makes the metal more attractive compared to yield-bearing instruments like U.S. Treasurys. Gold is up some 22% so far this year. BREXIT WOULD BE BAD: The first question goes to the issueÂ across the Atlantic, how the U.K. referendum to exit the EU played into the decision. Short answer: It did. Ms. Yellen saidÂ it was â€œone of the factors that factored into todayâ€™s decision.â€? She said it could have consequences for economic and financial conditions, and for the U.S. outlook.Â  AN UNUSUAL UNEMPLOYMENT FORECAST:Â Ms. Yellen didnâ€™t address this in her remarks, but hereâ€™s another unusual forecast from a Fed official. As recently as March, one official thought that the unemployment rate, over the longer run, would converge to about 5.8%. This was a somewhat unusual forcecast because the unemployment rate was already down to about 5%. â€” Josh Zumbrun (@JoshZumbrun) June 15, 2016 That official (who is not identified) has finally backed away from that view, and now thinks the longer-run unemployment rate is 5% or lower â€” thatâ€™s a remarkably abrupt adjustment, but seems to be driven by the simple fact that unemployment is well below 5.8% and shows no signs of trending back upward. FED DECISION UNLIKELY TO CHANGE MARKET DIRECTION:Â The Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged is unlikely to mean big short-term swings in the financial markets, which are more vulnerable to disruption from the pending U.K. vote on whether to remain in the European Union, says David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers. “It’s unlikely that markets take today’s figures and draw a completely different direction from them,” said Mr. Page, who still expects a rate increase in July. “This sets a signpost, really, for how markets will progress for the next couple of weeks.” FEDâ€™S DECISION COULD BOLSTER HIGH-DIVIDEND STOCKS: The Fedâ€™s statement and economic projections suggest that rates will remain lower for longer, which helps boost the case for stocks that pay out high dividends like utilities or real estate investment trusts over the next few months. The S&P 500â€²s utilities sector has notched the biggest gain so far in 2016 as investors scrambled for higher yielding assets in a low interest-rate world. â€œAny damage they might suffer from rising rates is a bit further off,â€? says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, adding that he now believes a rate rise in July is off the table. â€œThereâ€™s no longer any suggestion of imminent rate increases,â€? he adds. On Wednesday, however, the S&Pâ€™s utilities sector slips 0.4%, though it was down more before the Fed decision. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%. LOWER FOR LONGER: Why do Fed officials keep lowering their projections for the future path of short-term interest rates? Ms. Yellen suggested that a big factor is the â€œso-called neutral rate,â€? which she said is â€œquite depressed by historical standardsâ€? and may not rise very quickly in the coming years. â€œI think all of us are involved in a process of constantly reevaluating, whereâ€™s that neutral rate going?â€? she said. â€œAnd I think what you see is a downward shift in that assessment over time, the sense that maybe more of whatâ€™s causing this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not going to be rapidly disappearing but may be part of the new normal.â€? HOW MANY INCREASES PER YEAR?Â This might come as a surprise if youâ€™ve followed the wide-ranging debate over how many times the Fed will raise interest rates this year or next, but Ms. Yellen says the committee never really explicitly discusses the number of rate increases per year. â€œThe committee never discusses how many increases should we have this year or next year,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œThatâ€™s not a decision weâ€™re making as a committee. Weâ€™re making decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.â€? (This is quite a departure from rate increases in 2004, when the committee adopted a strategy of raising rates by 0.25%, eightÂ times per year at each FOMC meeting, and stuck with that exact plan throughÂ 2006.)Â  Ms. Yellen said that this means every meeting is a live meeting. Most FOMC members currently expect the economy will be strong enough that at several of their gatherings theyâ€™ll be able to raise rates, but thereâ€™s no explicit plans to raise rates, say, twice this year and three times next. Ms. Yellen anticipates this will continue to be taken one meeting at a time. ANY SECOND THOUGHTS? Ms. Yellen is essentially asked whether the Fed’s decision to raise rates is responsible for the slowdown in job growth. “The state of the labor market is still healthy,” she says, though it has lost some momentum. Also, time for a reminder about volatile economic data: “We should not overblow the significance of one data point, especially when other indicators of the labor market are still flashing green.” Ms. Yellen says she does not think a single rate increase of 0.25 percentage point carries much significance for the economic outlook. TWO-YEAR YIELD HITS LOWEST SINCE FEBRUARY: The policy sensitive two-year Treasury yield falls to 0.67%, the lowest intraday level since 0.649% on Feb 12. On Feb 11, the yield hit this yearâ€™s intraday low of 0.582%. Reflecting fading expectations of a summer rate hike, the odds for the Fed to hike by July were recently 12%, down from 21% before the FOMC statement, according to CME. â€œRight now we think that it is highly probable that there is again one rate hike in 2016, with December again being the most likely date,â€? economists at Jefferies say. A JULY RATE INCREASE?Â Itâ€™s on the table. Or at least itâ€™s a possibility. Many Fed watchers are skeptical the Fed will raise rates for what would be only their second rate increase in a decade, when thereâ€™s a Fed meeting that doesnâ€™t have an accompanying press conference (the Fed meets eightÂ times a year, but only its end-of-quarter meetings have a press conference scheduled). But Ms. Yellen thinks the Fed’s July meeting is a possibility, despite that lack of a press conference.Â  â€œNo meeting is out in terms of a possible rate increase, but we really need to look at the data and I canâ€™t pre-specify a timetable,â€? she said. â€œItâ€™s not impossible that by July we would see data that weâ€™re on a perfectly fine course.â€? Still, many observersÂ are going to likely wait toÂ see the Fed move without a press conference before they really believe this. ELECTION IMPACT: Will the election influence the Fedâ€™s time table? Are you concerned the Fedâ€™s decisions could impact the election? This is a question that comes up a lot. Itâ€™s funny because any answer that suggests the Fed is taking politics into account wouldÂ be an admission by the Fed that itâ€™s not independent. And the Fed is supposed to be independent of politics. But weâ€™ll give you Ms. Yellenâ€™sÂ answer anyway: â€œWe are very focused on assessing the economic outlook and making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account.â€? If incoming data in coming months were to justify â€œgradual increasesâ€? in light of the outlook, Ms. Yellen says, â€œI think markets should not be surprised by such a decision if we make it.â€? WAITING FOR MORE JOBS: Asked what sheâ€™d like to see in upcoming jobs reports, Ms. Yellen said she â€œcanâ€™t give you a formula.â€? But, she added, â€œclearly we will be looking at the next job reportâ€? for â€œa healthy pace of job growth, above that needed to maintain the status quo in the labor market.â€? Ms. Yellen cautioned, though, that job growth willÂ slow on its own as the job market gains strength. â€œOver time, we should expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job gains is probably going to slow down somewhat,â€? she said. â€œAnd we have seen some slowing, but the recent couple of months was very low and arguably not even at the pace we need to see to maintain stable labor-market conditions.â€? (Back in December, Ms. Yellen told lawmakers the economy needs â€œunder 100,000 jobs per monthâ€? to absorb new workforce entrants.) FOMC Minutes:Â Three weeks after each FOMC meeting, the Fed will release the minutes of the meeting. There’s often a debate about what message the Fed intends to send with these minutes. Ms. Yellen said too much is made of these speculations. The minutes are “not changed after the fact to correct possible misconceptions,” Ms. Yellen said. The minutes merely accurately reflect the substance of FOMC meetings, according to Ms. Yellen. She said she was surprised by the reaction of financial markets to the April FOMC minutes (which contained a discussion about possibly raising rates in June.) Ms. Yellen said this wasn’t designed to correct confusion about Fed policy — merely: “the minutes of the April meeting were an accurate summary of what happened.” HELICOPTER JANET? Ben Bernanke has suggestedÂ putting helicopter money into the tool kits for central banks (including the Fed). What does Ms. Yellen think? â€œIn normal timesâ€? there should be a separation between monetary and fiscal policy, she says. Central bank independence â€” keeping politicians from printing money â€” keeps inflation stable.Â  While academics are debating the idea of helicopter money, she says,Â it would take anÂ â€œabnormalâ€? and â€œextremeâ€? situation for it to make sense. MINIMUM WAGE HIKE: Asked whether raising the federal minimum wage would help boost long-sluggish U.S. wage growth and inflation, Ms. Yellen said that â€œa generally healthy labor marketâ€? is producing â€œhints, perhaps preliminary indications, that wage growth is picking up.â€? She said estimates related toÂ â€œthe minimum wage increases that have gone into effectâ€? suggest theyâ€™ve had a â€œrelatively minor influence on the aggregate level of wage inflation.â€? GOING NEGATIVE: Ms. Yellen says negative interest rates in other economies can influence the U.S. dollar and inflation. But it’s not a constraint on U.S> monetary policy. COULD THE FED LOSE MONEY?Â Â A few years ago there was a lot of concern that the Federal Reserve could lose a lot of money, because the central bank owns a huge amount of low-earning bonds but, if interest rates were too high, would have to pay out a large amountÂ of interest that would wipe out all its income. This is a somewhat abstract and confusing issue â€” since central banks like the Fed print money out of nothing, they canâ€™t actually go bankrupt, but they can get into politically difficult situations if theyâ€™re incurring losses. Concern about this has died down in recent years, because with low interest rates, the Fed is less likely to get into this situation. Ms. Yellen said that while itâ€™s conceivable the Fed one day loses money, â€œthis does require an extreme scenario with very rapid increases in short-term interest rates.â€? She noted that the main reason rates would go much higher would be a better economy â€œthat would be doing very well. This is probably an economy that everyone would feel very pleased was performing well.â€? While losing money would be an interesting problem for the Fed, for now theÂ likelier issue is that interest rates will remain far lower than most people would like to see â€” not that theyâ€™re so high that the Fed could lose money. OIL EFFECTS FADING: Ms. Yellen said she sees the depressing effect of falling oil prices on U.S. inflation starting to fade as energy prices stabilize and move higher. â€œTheir impact on inflation is waning over time,â€? she said. When it comes to the rest of the economy, she acknowledged the negative effects of low prices on the U.S. energy and manufacturing sectors. On the other hand, she said, itâ€™s been a boon to households in the form of substantial savings. YELLEN OUT: We got Ms. Yellen for about 55 minutes this time, perhaps because she doesn’t have a whole lot to say until she knows what happens with the job market, Brexit and all the other risks on the horizon. “COME BACK, JANET!”Â Investors were calm while they were anticipating the Fed decision. Investors were happy while digesting the Fedâ€™s dovishness. But now investors are showing how much they need the Fed: Stocks sold off a bit (moving into negative territory) once Ms. Yellen walked away. MARKET REACTION:Â Ms. Yellen struck a balanced tone in her comments after the central bank left interest rates unchanged, leaving stocks little changed in a sign investors and traders were â€œproperly expecting what the Fed would do,â€? he said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially climbed after the announcement , but was up 66 points, or 0.3%, at 17740 during Ms. Yellenâ€™s press conference, a increase from 58 points just before. Equities fell in the closing hour. The Dow closed down 35 points heading to the closing bell, and the S&P 500 was down 4 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 9 points. â€œShe hit the key words, â€˜gradualâ€™ and â€˜cautious,â€™â€? Mr. Jacobsen said. â€œTheyâ€™re clearly concerned about creating volatility in the markets. They donâ€™t want to tighten financial conditions either here or abroad.â€? â€œItâ€™s going to be a long and slow path back to normal for the Fed,â€? he said. Other markets responded by selling risk and buying safety. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.58%. Nymex crude oil dropped 2.1%, to $47.47. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,295, at one point crossing the $1,300 mark. In the forex market, traders sold the dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index was down 0.3% at 86.53. The euro was up 0.4% against the dollar, at 1.125, as both currencies deal with a plethora of headwinds in the short-term. THE END:Â That’s all from Fed land today. Thanks for joining us. While you think about the July and September Fed meetings, catch up on our coverage of today’s action:Â  No surprises here on rates, but the interesting thing I am noticing locally is the crazy number of job postings. Right now we have over 900 job postings at the local job service which is the highest number its ever been. A couple of fast-food joints are offering starting wages of $13-13.50/hour (when our minimum wage is $8.15/hr) and still can't get enough people according to an article in the paper yesterday. Local unemployment is around 4.8%. Construction is booming both in business and residential, labor costs are up as construction commodity prices are down. Home prices continue to rise steadily and have been for the last couple of years. Inflation is going to show up momentarily much to the Fed's liking.Â  The economy SEEMS to be humming along nicely. The only thing I can make of this is we simply don't have enough workers here, because it's certainly not a lack of jobs issue.Â  @Brian Knapp Â  @Alan Gregory Montana. Despite where I live our full time population is growing nicely and includes a lot of younger families and entrepreneurs. We've had several small-medium tech firms open up in the last couple of years. Boeing just awarded a $200M contract to another local firm. The regional healthcare center is located here and expands constantly. It's one of the best facilities in the nation. The good news is all over the place in the papers. I think we are just lacking both in qualified people and numbers.Â  A recovery ought to be showing 4 and 5% GDP, not less than 2%. Problem is simple:Â  the Left does everything it can to burden the economy instead of allow it to generate wealth and grow. Fed has lost the credibility long time ago with wishy-washy, may be- may be not, with never ending Â pontifications! I have been telling y'all for YEARS (mostly on CNBC, just started here recently) that the USA has BECOME Japan. The EXCESSIVE government debt FORCES the "Central Bank" - read the "FED" here. "BOJ" in Japan - to SUPPRESS interest rates to keep the government budgets from TOTALLY crushing the economies. But meanwhile, the interest suppression does the SAME thing - NO GROWTH. In Japan, it has now been 26 years - after the BOJ killed interest the once vibrant Japanese economy has totally stagnated. Just look at the GDP numbers the past 50 years. Now, here in the USA, the past 8 years have been nothing but the doldrums - the same reason, suppressed interest. Without this suppression, the debt service on the US Debt would be $1.4 trillion - not the $400 billion which compares so favorably with $360 billion in 2000 - when the US owed "only" $5 trillion compared to today's near $20 trillion. Translation:Â  The poor and middle class are just going to have to suck it up a while longer, while the top end of the investor class protects its hegemony. To do otherwise would mean the end of the financial world as we know it. .Â  Until we have sustained growth of over 4% for several quarters with organic growth of tax receipts from successful business expansion, raising rates the slightest will put the economy into a death spiral. Â The only way to accomplish this growth is to purge the nation's leadership of any vestige of Socialism. Â That means Mrs. Clinton must be defeated and all the Obama related executive diktats, regulations and laws must be rolled back. Otherwise we are stuck and dead in the water.
