Jobless Rate for Black Americans Finally Dips Into Single Digits - Real Time Economics - WSJ Natalie Parker, director of human resources at the Doubletree Grand, left, talks with job applicants during a job fair this year at the Hospitality Institute. For the first time in nearly seven years, the unemployment rate for African-Americans is in single digitsâ€“though it remains more than twice as high as the jobless rate for whites. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for black workers was 9.6% in April, the Labor Department said Friday. That was down from 10.1% in March and the lowest reading since June 2008, when it was 9.4%. For whites, the unemployment rate was steady in April at 4.7%. The Hispanic jobless rate was 6.9%, ticking up from 6.8% in March. The Asian unemployment rate was 4.4% last month, up from 3.2% in March. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in April from 5.5% in March. Black unemployment peaked at 16.8% in March 2010, while white unemployment crested at 9.2% in late 2009. Despite recent declines in joblessness, the racial unemployment gap has remained stubbornly large.
