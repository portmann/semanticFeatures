Economists React to the Fedâ€™s March Statement: â€˜No Longer Patient, But Definitely Not Impatient, Yetâ€™ - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve dropped a pledge to remain â€œpatientâ€? Â before starting to raise interest rates, but trimmed its outlook for growth, inflation and unemployment. Hereâ€™s how some economists reacted to the statement and Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s press conference. “No longer patient, but definitely not impatient, yet.Â  June still on, but the bar has been raised….This is a defensive Fed. They’ve made the minimum change expected, but then backpedalled furiously, as if to say, â€˜we’ve done it, but we didn’t really mean it, and we’re now very keen to avoid giving the impression that we might take the next step soon.â€™ The statement says growth has â€˜moderatedâ€™ somewhat, but makes no mention of the obvious cause, the severe weather. The drop in inflation, however, is still â€˜transitory.â€™â€? –Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics â€œThe Fed lowered their 2015 rate forecast by nearly 50 basis points in the Summary of Economic Projections but removed the â€˜patientâ€™ language from the statement. Can the Fed be patient without the â€˜patientâ€™ language? Given the downward revision to the Fedâ€™s forecast for rates and inflation over the next 1-2 years, we suspect there is more than enough concern among Committee members regarding lingering, low inflation to keep the Fed on hold. After all, weâ€™ve seen this wordsmithery before. Recall the Fed replaced â€˜considerable timeâ€™ with â€˜patient,â€™ two phrases which arguably mean the exact same thing. This time the Fed has replaced â€˜patientâ€™ with a lower assessment of inflation and rates which will similarly act as more than enough of a barrier for Committee members to exercise patience in initiating liftoff.â€? –LindseyÂ  Piegza, Sterne Agee â€œThe statement largely ruled out a rate hike at the April Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is consistent with the â€˜patientâ€™ wording in the January statement, and suggests no haste to begin hiking rates.Â  The June meeting remains in play but we have to acknowledge that the median assessment contains a hint that the Committee might be leaning toward September rather than June since a move in June would mean only one more increase at the next four meetings.Â  However, the decision on timing will be dependent on the dataâ€”particularly, in our view, in signs that core inflation and other indicators remain consistent with an increase in inflation back towards 2% over the medium term.Â  For now, we are still projecting that the first move will take place at the June FOMC meeting but we think the odds of a delay to September have increased.â€? –John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, RDQ Economics â€œMarkets and the FOMC are now squarely in a data-watching mode. If inflation stabilizes and then begins to drift higher while the labor market maintains its momentum and other economic indicators firm up after a very difficult winter, then June liftoff could well be in the cards. However, stable to lower inflation, lack of follow-through on the wage front, and/or disappointing aggregate growth could easily convince the Fed to remain on hold for longer than that. Whenever it begins, we think that the tightening cycle is going to be a very gradual one, and that the pace indicated by the FOMCâ€™s â€˜dotsâ€™ is a reasonable one given a need to balance underlying economic and financial fragility with a need to wean markets and economies off of unsustainably low interest rates and to give monetary policy scope for easing at some stage in the future.â€? –Joshua Shapiro, MFR â€œOfficials continue to anticipate the start of the policy normalization process fairly soon. With an expected funds rate of 0.625% by year-end and 1.875% by end-2016, officials are still suggesting more tightening than markets are pricing in, but the differential has dropped, along with the estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate –those changes were more dovish than expected.Â  Of course, the projections are contingent on economic and financial conditions.Â  We suspect they are still too high on their projections for the actual unemployment rate given the recent one-point-per-year downtrend.â€? –Jim O’Sullivan, High Frequency Economics Read the Full Text of the Fedâ€™s March Statement Janet Yellen Says June Meeting Might Bring First Rate Rise Fed Officials Trim Back Estimates Of Interest Rate Rises Amid Big Forecast Changes Fed Officials See Slower Inflation Pickup Than Private Economists Do No Decisions Yet About Timing Of Fedâ€™s Reinvestment Process End Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
