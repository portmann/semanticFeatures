Here We Go Again: Stock Market Is Focusing On December Fed Move - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha All reports explaining the decline in the stock market yesterday cite the possibility of a Fed move of interest rates in December as the cause. The stock market is dominated by investor expectations of what the Fed will do in the future and every little whiff of a move seems to depend on these expectations. That is, current investment strategy, including the downside protection of the market, is in the hands of Federal Reserve officials. Last week I wrote a post titled, " The Stock Market is the Child of the Federal Reserve ." We read in the New York Times : "Investors are nervous about the timing and the pace of any increase in the extremely low interest rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, and any comments from central bank officials recently have added to the jitters." On Monday, "the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Loretta Mester, a 'hawk' who thinks the central bank should be raising rates, reiterated her position in a Bloomberg interview." In the Wall Street Journal : "U.S. stocks, bonds and gold prices had dropped on Tuesday while the dollar strengthened as investors sold shares of steady dividend-payers on signals the Fed expects to raise rates by the end of the year. Fed-fund futures, used by investors to bet on central bank policy showed a 63% chance of a U.S. interest rate rise by the end of the year, according to data from CME Group." And, in the Financial Times : Gold's price 'has started to stall" along with stock prices "as investors take profits and eye a second rise in US interest rates in December… Expectations for a rise have also boosted the dollar, which hit a 13-day high against a basket of currencies." This little game has been going on for two years now. It began when the Federal Reserve ended its third round of quantitative easing toward the end of October in 2014. Before the end of the year, Fed officials began to provide markets with "forward guidance" as to what its movement in interest rates might be. At the time, the "forward guidance" indicated that the Fed would raise its target rate of interest by 25 basis points, four times in the year 2015. All year financial markets were whipsawed by sentiments that "yes" the rate increases were on… and, "no" the data do not support a rate increase at this time. Finally, in December, the Fed raised its policy rate by 25 basis points, almost as an effort to save any kind of credibility it might have left. But, then Fed officials, providing "forward guidance", indicated that the Fed would raise interest rates at least twice in 2016, each move being 25 basis points. The battle about raising rates continued into September… and no move was made at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But, more "forward guidance" was forthcoming. The move would, in all likelihood, take place at the December meeting of the FOMC. Never have I ever seen monetary policy conducted in this way. I have not ever read anything about monetary policy being conducted in this way. If anything, the way Federal Reserve officials are conducting monetary policy these days has resulted in a major decline in the Fed's credibility accompanied by a decline in the confidence the financial markets have in the Fed's ability to lead us through the current difficulties. Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, was a major proponent of "forward guidance" and used it to show the Fed's commitment to continue a currently existing policy stance. Somehow, this use of "forward guidance" was transformed into a tool to indicate what the Federal Reserve was going to do in the future, which is different than saying that the Fed will continue its current policy. It was the height of arrogance on the part of Federal Reserve officials to think that they could predict the future that well. Econometric forecasting models, in the best of times, are not that good at predicting the future. Econometric models built during an earlier, more stable time, cannot hope to provide good predictions in the uncertain times like we have experienced during the current economic recovery. But, now the stock market is tied very closely to the Federal Reserve's largesse. The three rounds of quantitative easing has brought the stock market to higher and higher levels and is dependent upon the Federal Reserve supporting its current level. As I have written earlier, the stock market is the child of the Federal Reserve. Now, with "forward guidance" being tossed about here and there as the egos of the Board of Governors and the Regional Bank Presidents need to be served, the investors in the stock market are buffeted one way and then another depending upon how "hawkish" or how "dovish" the latest speech is. In my view, this is certainly not the way to conduct monetary policy. And, it is also my view, that this way of conducting monetary policy is not good for the economy, for employment, and for corporate profits. However, that is the way things are right now and we have to adapt to it. The stock market stays strong on the basis of the Federal Reserve's underwriting of current levels. The stock market remains volatile as officials at the Fed voice their opinions about the future course of monetary policy. And, then there is the downside protection of the "Greenspan put." This is the belief that the Federal Reserve will not let the stock market decline substantially and will do what is necessary to keep the market from falling too far at any time. This seems to be the rules of the game right now. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
