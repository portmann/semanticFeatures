Fed’s Yellen, Japan, and the Highly Imperfect World of ‘Expected’ Inflation  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday offered a peek into just how uncertain policy makers are about the future path of U.S. inflationâ€”despite their hopes that it will gradually return to the central bank’s 2% target after several years of falling short. She did so during her news conference in response to a question about the importance of inflation expectations to the Fed’s thinking about interest-rate policy. Policy makers see expectations as a window into future inflation, because they believe they can be self-fulfillingâ€”that businesses set prices and workers bargain for wages based on their expectations of where prices will be in the future. Yet Fed officials acknowledge problems with the theory and in the way both consumer and market measures are derived. Ms. Yellen cited the experience in Japan’s experience, where she said inflation expectations kept moving higher and yet never gave way to stronger price growth. “The fact that survey measures are stable, even if they are stable at levels consistent with inflation objectives that the central bank wants to achieve, that’s not a guarantee that inflation will over time move to be consistent with those expectations,” she said. “An example is Japan, I would give you, where for many years the households and businesses expected positive inflation but there was a consistent undershoot.” The Fed in its policy statement said it would start raising short-term interest rates from near zero when, among other things, it becomes “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.” U.S. consumer prices were up 0.2% in January from a year earlier, according to the Fedâ€™s preferred measure. A University of Michigan survey earlier this month found consumers expected annual inflation to be 3% in one year and 2.8% over the next five to 10 years. The survey has found respondentsâ€™ expectations of future inflation to be fairly steady through the recovery, though they fell slightly in the autumn in response to falling gasoline prices. “Survey-based measures aren’t perfect,” Ms. Yellen said. “Nevertheless, they do seem to be useful in predicting actual movements in inflation. And because we think inflation expectations are a determinant of price setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, even if it’s imperfect in trying to gauge inflation expectations.” Market-based measures of inflation expectations also have their issues, she noted. The Fed watches, for instance, the gap in yields between regular U.S. government bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. In this case, however, liquidity, international capital flows and other technical concerns have caused some officials to question its usefulness as a gauge of investorsâ€™ inflation expectations. “They are not a pure read, either,” Ms. Yellen said of market-based measures. “And we want to look at both things and not take away any simple morals.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
