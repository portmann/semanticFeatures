Grand Central: ECB Turns Up Heat on Governments - Real Time Economics - WSJ ECBâ€™s Mario Draghi Urges Economic Overhaul in Europe Itâ€™s hard to be a pessimist in Sintra this weekend. The sun is out and the temperatures warm at the site of the European Central Bankâ€™s annual economic conferenceâ€”now in its second yearâ€”near Portugalâ€™s western coast. Itâ€™s essentially the ECBâ€™s version of the Kansas City Federal Reserveâ€™s more famous Jackson Hole conference that occurs in the late summer. Mario Draghi set Fridayâ€™s sessionsâ€”dedicated to unemployment and inflation–off on a guardedly upbeat tone, saying things are better in the eurozone today than they have been since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. â€œThe economic outlook for the euro area is brighter today than it has been for seven long years. Monetary policy is working its way through the economy. Growth is picking up. And inflation expectations have recovered from their trough,â€? he said . But he used his speech to again press a case European central bankers have been making for years: that the regionâ€™s governments must step up their efforts to boost the economyâ€™s growth potential. â€œStructural reforms that reverse the downward drift in potential growth are now vital for the euro area, which is why I believe, as the guardian of the currency, we have a legitimate interest in talking about them,â€? he said. If all the talk about structural reform sounds familiar from a European policymaker like Mr. Draghi, well it should. As Mr. Draghi noted at the start of his speech, the words â€œstructural reformsâ€? have been mentioned in about one-third of the speeches of ECB executive board members. â€œBy comparison, it features in only about 2% of speeches by governors of the Federal Reserve,â€? he said. Thereâ€™s good reason for this. In a monetary union in which each country runs its own fiscal and economic policiesâ€”albeit subject to some European rulesâ€”the ECB canâ€™t tailor its policies for problems that may arise in particular European countries. Itâ€™s dealing with the eurozone as a whole, not France or Italy. That means countries must make their economies more flexible to respond to shocks. In his speech to the 150 or so central bankers, academic and private sector economists and journalists in Sintra, Mr. Draghi delivered a pep talk of sorts. â€œA great deal has been achievedâ€? on structural reforms, he said, â€œand we have praised progress where it has taken place, including here in Portugal.â€? And to the extent the ECB has created the conditions for a cyclical recovery, governments must seize the moment to redouble their efforts to create the conditions for lasting growth, he added. Expect Mr. Draghi and his colleagues to keep pounding this point in coming months after their weekend fun in the sun. Fed Proposes Relaxing Rules Impacting Municipal Bonds. Large U.S. banks will be able to use some municipal bonds to meet new post-crisis rules aimed at ensuring they have enough cash during a financial-market meltdown under relaxed rules proposed by the Federal Reserve.Â The long-awaited move on Thursday reflects a change of heart by the central bank, which had previously excluded debt sold by cities and states when approving new post-crisis rules last fall aimedÂ at fortifying banks against market turmoil.Â The Fedâ€™s decision is only a partial victory for banks, state officials and lawmakers who had pushed for the change, because many banks may not benefit from the policy shift. Fedâ€™s Fischer Calls for Greater European Fiscal Integration. Europeâ€™s economic and monetary union will â€œvery likelyâ€? survive its current crisis, but greater fiscal integration is needed for the eurozoneâ€™s future, the U.S. central bankâ€™s No. 2 official said Thursday. â€œThe decision to use the single currency to drive the European project forward was a risky one, and at some stage or probably in several stages, it will be necessary to put the missing fiscal framework into place,â€? Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said at a conference hosted by the European Central Bank in Portugal. Fedâ€™s Williams Sees Value in Policy Rules, Albeit With Caveats. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Thursday monetary policy rules could have benefits for central bank policy making. But in order for these rules to be truly effective, they have to be able to say something about what the Fed would do when short-term rates need to be lowered to zero in the event of new economic stress. Mr. Williams also said inflation targets are important in creating effective monetary policy . Speaking at a conference held by Stanford Universityâ€™s Hoover Institution, Mr. Williams observed briefly that such as the Fedâ€™s 2% inflation goal make the Fed â€œformally and in fact accountable for the one thing a central bank can do: Control inflation.â€? Before April Fed Meeting, Big Banks Expected First Rate Rise in September. According to a surveyÂ  of so-called primary dealer banks conducted ahead of the Fedâ€™s April 28-29 policy meeting, the median expectation of these banks was for a September rate rise , the same as what they told the Fed ahead of its March meeting. Senate Banking Committee Approves Financial-Regulation Bill.Â  The bill would ease some rules affecting small banks, increase congressional scrutiny of the Fed , give regional banks a shot at cutting regulatory costs, and allow insurance companies and asset managers the chance to revamp their businesses before being designated â€œsystemically important.â€? The Republican-backed measure represents the biggest swing at altering rules for the financial sector since the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.Â  The party-line vote Thursday cleared the way for months of partisan negotiations that will determine the legislationâ€™s fate. Rep. Hensarling Sends Fed Subpoena Seeking Leak Probe Documents. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) sent a subpoena Thursday to the Federal Reserve asking for documents related to the publication of details of market-sensitive policy deliberations in October 2012. The subpoena comes almost three weeks after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen sent Mr. Hensarling the names of staffers who had contact with the policy information service firm that published the information. Former Fed Governor Warsh Laments Lack Of True Fed Debate. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh told a conference Thursday little real debate happens at the central bankâ€™s monetary policy gatherings. He described the meetings as stylized affairs that end up approving whatever the Fed chair wants. ECBâ€™s Mario Draghi Urges Economic Overhaul in Europe. Â European governments must step up efforts to overhaul their economies, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Friday, calling on political leaders to use the recovery brought on by the ECBâ€™s stimulus to reform labor markets and make economic flexibility â€œpart of our common DNA.â€? ECB Affirms its Resolve on QE. The published account of the ECBâ€™s April meeting released Thursday said it was imperative the ECBâ€™s expanded asset-purchase program be firmly implemented as it was announced â€œto reap its full effects in terms of euro area output and inflation developments.â€? This suggests the eurozoneâ€™s central bank intends to carry out its quantitative easing program at least until September 2016,Â  as announced at the start of the year. BOJ Kuroda Strikes Positive Note on Econ, Sees No Need for Easing.Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda hit a more upbeat note about the nationâ€™s economy Friday, saying the central bank has effectively raised its view of the economy, while rejecting a view that more additional easing is necessary to achieve 2% inflation. BOEâ€™s Shafik: UKâ€™s Prospects Not As Gloomy As Interest Rates Imply. A top Bank of England official on Friday painted an upbeat picture of the U.K. economyâ€™s prospects , saying the outlook isnâ€™t as gloomy as some financial market signals imply. Minouche Shafik, in her first major speech on monetary policy since joining the BOE as deputy governor for markets and banking in August, said that low long-term interest rates in the U.K. shouldnâ€™t be taken as evidence that Britainâ€™s future prospects have dramatically deteriorated. BOEâ€™s Weale: Oil Price Fall Could Have Bigger Effect Than Anticipated. The recent slump in the oil price may have a bigger short-term effect on the U.K. economy than the Bank of England expects, one of the central bankâ€™s nine policy makers said Thursday. Martin Weale said in a speech the 40% slide in the price of crude oil since last yearâ€™s peak may give a bigger boost to growth over the next two years than the BOEâ€™s forecasts suggest. It may also drive annual inflation lower than officials predict, at least in the short term, he said. PBOC Embraces Foreign Bond Investors. The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China has allowed a further 32 foreign institutional investors this year to trade in the $6.1 trillion interbank bond market, which is used by a wide range of investors in addition to banks. That compares with 34 approvals in all of 2014 and brings the total number of approved foreign investors to 152 as of April, not counting sovereign-wealth funds and central banks. SARB Keeps Key Interest Rate at 5.75%.Â South Africa’s central bank kept its main interest rate on hold Thursday, reflecting a reluctance to rush through increases that could hamper slack economic growth. The South African Reserve Bank kept its key interest rate at 5.75%. The bank raised rates twice last year: by 50 basis points in January and by 25 basis points in July. South Africa’s persistently slow economic growth has held the bank back from continuing to hike rates as high and as rapidly as Governor Lesetja Kganyago said he would like–Dow Jones Newswires. OECD:Â  Rising Inequality Will Harm Growth. Two-fifths of the population of developed countries have gained little over recent decades, driving a rise in income inequality that is damaging economic growth and that can only be reversed through a wide range of government measures, including higher taxes on the rich, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Thursday . -1100 GMT (7 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Carney, Bank of Mexicoâ€™s Carstens speak on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s ConstÃ¢ncio chairs session on employment, productivity and growth at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -1030 GMT (6:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Honohan speaks on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -1330 GMT (9:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Draghi, Fedâ€™s Fischer, BOJâ€™s Kuroda speak on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -U.S. markets closed for Memorial Day holiday -1300 GMT (9 a.m. EDT): Bank of Israel releases a policy statement -1310 GMT (9:10 a.m. EDT): Cleveland Fedâ€™s Mester speaks about the influence of research on financial stability policy in ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland -11:30 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on global economic developments in Herzliya, Israel RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Responses at Higher and Lower Rates Differ. â€œWhen interest rates are away from the zeroâ€?lower bound, a perception of higher future interest rates leads to a significant rise in current measures of inflation and a rise in economic activity,â€? write economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Claremont McKenna College in a paper that could serve as a warning for Fed policymakers. â€œHowever, when interest rates approach zero, the effect on economic activity is the opposite, with significant but lagged decreases in economic activity following an upward revision to expected future interest ratesâ€¦This evidence points to the importance of managing monetary policy expectations (forward guidance) as a crucial policy tool for stimulating economic activity at the zeroâ€?lower bound.â€?Â Â Â  Baily and Swagel to Warren & Vitter: Donâ€™t tie the Fedâ€™s hands more to lend in emergencies, loosen them. â€œIt would be better to repeal the provisions of Dodd-Frank that restrict emergency action by regulators, rather than doubling down on those restrictions,â€? as planned in a bill recently introduced by Sens. David Vitter (R., La.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), write Martin Neil Baily and Phillip L. Swage l in a post for the Bipartisan Policy Center. â€œThe Fed must have significant authority to act in case of emergency to minimize the potential for an event to have a catastrophic effect on the lives of ordinary Americans. The availability of this authority is compatible with holding individuals or institutions accountable for misdeeds, and with avoiding inappropriate risk to taxpayers.â€? Solving the Crisis in Greece is a Crucial Test for Europe. The Eiffel Group , an investment firm, and the Glienicker Group, a group of 11 German economists, lawyers and political scientists, say Europe must find a way to keep Greece in the union. â€œThe failure to solve the Greek crisis would have significant costs for Europe. Banking union, financial backstops such as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), closer cooperation on fiscal policy and other firewalls have reduced the likelihood of contagion from Greece to other euro area countries. However, we should not underestimate the potential of spillovers from a switch in the mind-set of market participants which would no longer consider euro membership as an indefinite, irrevocable commitment,â€? they write in a joint post on Bruegel. â€œSolving the Greek question is ultimately a test of Europeâ€™s ability and willingness to work towards a cooperative, functioning monetary union.â€? - The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits rose last week to a seasonally adjusted 274,000 but remained at a historically low leve l consistent with an improving labor market, the Labor Department said Thursday. - One of the main contenders in this weekendâ€™s local elections in Barcelona, Spainâ€™s second-largest city, pledged to create a new currency for the metropolitan area with the goal of boosting small and medium-sized businesses. -German economic growth slowed in the first quarter and companies scaled back their business expectations in May, according to data published Friday, clouding the outlook for Europeâ€™s largest economy. -Guatemalaâ€™s central bank chief was arrested on Thursday, the latest high-profile casualty of a Â corruption scandal that has already forced the resignation of the bankâ€™s vice-president and the energy and mines minister and the arrest of the countryâ€™s tax chief. - Brazil’s economy sank 0.8% in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of 2014, the central bank said Thursday. Meanwhile, Brazil’s unemployment in April climbed to a four-year high of 6.4%. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
