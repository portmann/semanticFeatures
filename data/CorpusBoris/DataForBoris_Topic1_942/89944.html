The strong dollar will continue to be a drag on U.S. exports, inflation and the broader economy for some time to come, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday. â€œI think we have seen that itâ€™s had a negative effect on net exports and so served as a something of a drag on the economy, and probably that drag is going to continue for some time to come,â€?

Eventually I expect that impact to ebb, but it is a factor affecting the outlook.â€?
