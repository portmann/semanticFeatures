Grand Central: Look For Signs of a U.S. Consumer Spending Rebound in Retail Data - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed Seeks Comment on Technical Details of Interest on Reserves Power As Interest Benchmarks Go Negative, Banks May Have to Pay Tuesday could be a green shoots day for the U.S. economic outlook. Analysts are looking for a rebound in March retail sales data, a sign of a consumer revival after another frigid winter that weighed on U.S. economic output. U.S. retail sales dropped for three straight months from December through February. An important part of that decline was sales at gasoline stations, thanks to lower prices. Gas station sales were off 23% in February from a year earlier, good news for households who got to pocket the drop in costs. But even excluding gas, retailers still stumbled this winter. Their sales slipped 1% between November and February. Now, signs of improvement are emerging. Car sales turned up in March to a 17.2 million unit pace. Meantime, Bank of America Merrill Lynch reports its tracking of its customersâ€™ use of credit cards and debit cards turned up last month.Â  Analysts are expecting the Commerce Department to report a March retail sales gain of 1.1%. If they get it that will be the best month since February 2014. That February 2014 retail sales gain, followed by a rise in March, was an early signal of a U.S. growth rebound in the second and third quarters and kept the Federal Reserve on track to ends its bond buying program by the fall. A sales rebound now, if it occurs, will keep rate increase discussions alive, though the bar has risen to a move by midyear. Fed Seeks Comment on Proposal on Interest on Excess Reserves.Â The Federal Reserve said Monday it is seeking comment on a proposal to change the way it pays interest on excess bank reserves parked at the central bank. It now pays that interest based on average rate and reserve balance levels over a two-week period, but it would like to be able to pay the rate based on a daily calculation . The rate it pays on excess reserves, currently near zero, will be the Fedâ€™s chief tool to raise short-term interest rates when the time comes to lift borrowing costs through the economy. Fed Taking Applications for Community Advisory Council. The Fed is taking â€œstatements of interestâ€? from people who would like to serve on its new Community Advisory Council, which it announced in January. The Fed wants to fill the councilâ€™s 15 seats with â€œa diverse group of experts and representatives of consumer and community development organizations and interests, including affordable housing, community and economic development, small business and asset and wealth building,â€? it said. New York Fed Still Searching for Cause of Oct. 15â€²s Wild Treasury Volatility. The head of the New York Fedâ€™s markets group, Simon Potter, said Monday the cause of extreme bond market volatility on Oct. 15 remains hard to pin down. Speaking before a bond market group, Mr. Potter said events that day have a number of possible causes . Fed’s Williams Sees Less Risk of Rate Retreat After Liftoff â€“Reuters. With the labor market continuing to improve, San Francisco Fed President John Williams sees less risk that the Fed will raise rates and then be rapidly forced to reverse course , he told Reuters in an interview. As Interest Benchmarks Go Negative, Banks May Have to Pay Borrowers. Negative interest rates in Europe have created a previously inconceivable problem for some banks: They may soon have to pay interest to customers who borrow from them . In countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy the base interest rate used for many loans, especially mortgages, is Euribor, which stands for the euro interbank offered rate. Euribor is based on how much it costs European banks to borrow from each other. This benchmark and others like it have been falling sharply, in some cases into negative territory, since the European Central Bank introduced measures to boost the eurozone economy. 5 Points to Watch in the ECBâ€™s April Press Conference.Â The European Central Bank is set for one of its most drama-free policy meetings in years on Wednesday against a backdrop of economic improvement and the successful launch of its quantitative easing program.Â Still, ECB President Mario Draghi will likely face questions at his post-meeting press conference on how long he expects QE to last and whether his views on the economy have changed since the ECBâ€™s last meeting, when the bank released upbeat forecasts.Â  Here are five things to look for Wednesday . Moodyâ€™s Adds to Doubts Over Sourcing Bonds for Eurozone QE.Â Moodyâ€™s Investors Services has added to the chorus of voices warning the European Central Bank could run out of bonds to buy under its one trillion euro-plus quantitative easing program â€œbyÂ the turn of the year.â€? In Surprise Move, Singapore Holds Fire on Easing.Â The Monetary Authority of Singapore on Tuesday surprised markets by keeping its currency policy unchanged, saying that it expects the economy to grow at a moderate pace and that inflation is likely to remain subdued this year. Bank Indonesia Keeps Benchmark Rate Unchanged at 7.50%. Bank Indonesia kept interest rates unchanged for the second month in a row Tuesday to protect the rupiah from capital outflows ahead of an expected U.S. Federal Reserve rate increase later this year. The Indonesian central bank left its policy interest rate at 7.5% to guide the country’s current-account deficit–which Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo on Friday said was one of the economy’s structural weaknesses–to a more sustainable level of between 2.5% and 3% of gross domestic product — Dow Jones Newswires. Finally Right? Economists Raise the Bar for March Retail Report. Economists look back at March and see a spending spree. But they have expected too much from U.S. shoppers in recent months. The Commerce Department will release its tally of March retail sales Tuesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast total sales jumped 1.1% last month, and were up 0.7% excluding autos. The control group of salesâ€”which excludes vehicles, building materials and gasoline and which figures into gross domestic productâ€”is expected to post a strong 0.5% increase. Such high expectations risk a big miss. In fact, economists as a group have been too optimistic in each of the last three months. The biggest error was for February when the median forecast expected a 0.2% gain but sales dropped 0.6%.Â  -8 p.m. EDT: Minneapolis Fedâ€™s Kocherlakota speaks in Winona, Minn.

Abel and Richard Deitz wrote on the New York Fed’s Liberty Street Economics blog . “A smaller population translates into a shrinking tax base, which in turn strains government finances. In addition, because Puerto Rico is losing a disproportionate share of its younger citizens, the aging of its population has accelerated. This demographic shift adds to the burden of supporting the Islandâ€™s elderly population, who tend to be poorer and more intensive users of the health care system, and puts stress on already fragile pension systems. Together, these pressures can create a cycle of economic decay and further population losses that can be difficult to break.” COMMENTARYÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Macroeconomists Need New Tools to Challenge Consensus. The “enlightened debate” between Lawrence Summers and Ben Bernanke about the causes of slow U.S. economic growth â€œmasks a much deeper problem within macroeconomics,” Wolfgang MÃ¼nchau writes in the Financial Times. “Secular stagnation â€” a sharp fall in growth rates lasting a very long time â€” is not something that you can easily square with the current generation of macroeconomic theories and models.” Ahead of IMF Meetings, a Look at Shifting Economic Risks. “It is the season, in Washington, to warn about risks,” David Wessel writes for Capital Journal’s Think Tank. “In her curtain-raiser for the International Monetary Fundâ€™s spring meetings, Managing Director Christine Lagarde used the word a dozen times. But the threats to the world economy are shifting.” -Eurozone banks expect to be slightly more generous in lending to eurozone firms in the current quarter, a survey of lenders showed Tuesday . -Industrial production in the eurozone rose sharply in February after experiencing a dip at the start of the year, an indication that the weakening euro is starting to aid exporters and the currency areaâ€™s modest economic recovery. -Plunging oil prices, sluggish growth in the developed world and a slowdown in Chinaâ€™s pace of industrialization will bring down sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s growth rate this year to its lowest in two decades , the World Bank said Monday. -Indiaâ€™s consumer inflation rate slowed in March as food prices rose at a lower-than-expected rate . -Capacity utilization in the U.S. oil and gas extraction sector topped 100% in June 2014, according to Federal Reserve data, which the St. Louis Fedâ€™s FRED Blog on Monday described as â€œan impossibility caused by the imprecision of the estimation procedure for bothâ€? production and capacity. -Study the Fed!
