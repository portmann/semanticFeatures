Grand Central: New Signs of an Inflation Cycle Turning - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed’s Evans: Central Bank Shouldn’t Raise Rates This Year My colleague Greg Ip, connecting dots, says the global inflation cycle might be turning . The U.S. consumer price index excluding food and energy was up 1.7% in February from a year earlier. Thatâ€™s up from 1.6% the month before and not all that far from the Fedâ€™s definition of price stability. (The Fed targets 2% annual increases in the personal consumption expenditures price index, which tends to run a bit lower than the consumer price index.) In the eurozone, meanwhile, the 12-month inflation rate rose from minus 0.6% in January to minus 0.3% in February , while core inflation ticked up ever so slightly to 0.7% from 0.6% and growth indicators are perking up. Fed’s Evans: Central Bank Shouldn’t Raise Rates This Year. Â Overly weak inflation and a lack of evidence suggesting price pressures are about to heat up means the Fed shouldn’t raise interest rates this year, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said in a speech Wednesday . “I think economic conditions are likely to evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to hold off on raising short-term rates until 2016,” Mr. Evans said. While the economy is growing and adding jobs at a very healthy clip, inflation remains well under the 2% level targeted by the Fed, and that argues for caution, he said. Fedâ€™s Bullard Warns of Market Disruption. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Tuesday that interest-rate expectations in financial markets need to be better aligned with those of Fed officials, warning that reconciling those views could cause â€œpotentially violentâ€? market disruption. He told reporters in London that investors are penciling in a later move in interest rates than he expects and a slower pace of tightening in the months and years ahead. Retired Fed Official Fisher Concerned About Emerging-Market Debt.Â A recently retired Federal Reserve official said Wednesday financial markets would see a correction when it is least expected and that he was worried about emerging-market debt. ECB Tells Greek Banks Not to Boost Exposure to Athens Governmentâ€™s Debt. The European Central Bank has instructed Greeceâ€™s biggest banks to refrain from increasing their exposure to Greek government debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The move raises pressure on the cash-strapped government in Athens to find an agreement with its international creditors to unlock billions of euros in bailout funds. Hungary Cuts Key Interest Rate to New Low. Hungary lowered its main interest rate Tuesday for the first time since July in a bid to induce price growth and economic expansion. The National Bank of Hungary cut its main monetary policy rate by 0.15 of a percentage point to a fresh record low of 1.95%. Brazil Central Bank Expects Inflation to Ease in April. Brazilâ€™s inflation rate in April should be much lower than in the first three months of the year, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said on Tuesday. The 12-month inflation rate rose to 7.9% in mid-March, well above the 6.5% ceiling of the central bankâ€™s target range. In congressional testimony, Mr. Tombini said prices have risen quickly in the first few months of the year because of an increase in government-set prices , such as electric and gasoline prices, and the weaker real. Brazil’s Central Bank to Reduce Forex Intervention.Â Brazil’s central bank said Tuesday night that it won’t renew its foreign-exchange swap auction program, a decision that lessens the monetary authority’s intervention in the currency market.

RBA Warns Some Banks Will Face Attitude Adjustment.Â Some Australian banks will soon require “behavioural adjustment” to tighten loose mortgage lending, which is overheating house prices and stoking the threat of instability within the economy.

Where Construction Continues to Struggle Years After the Bust. A new state-by-state breakdown by the Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group, finds both pockets of strength and continued weakness the construction industry. The energy boomâ€”from fracking to refineries and portsâ€”has helped lift Mississippi, Louisiana, North Dakota and Montanaâ€™s construction sectors. Those four states and Hawaii â€“which has benefited from a resurgence in tourism and defense spending â€“are the top five for construction as a percentage of GDP . -ECBâ€™s Praet speaks in London at 1125 GMT Strong Dollarâ€™s Drag on Prices Will Not Cause Deflation, Cleveland Fed Economists Say. Fed officials have flagged the possibility a stronger dollar will put downward pressure on U.S. inflation through import prices, but a new paper from the Cleveland Fed finds the impact should be fairly minor. â€œSome worry that the price impacts of the dollarâ€™s appreciation will push an already soft U.S. inflation rate deeper into negative territory. The threat is real, but certainly overblown,â€? write Owen Humpage and Timothy Stehulak, respectively economic adviser and research analyst at the Cleveland Fed, in a briefing. ECB Paper Largely Backs Europeâ€™s Austerity Strategy. Fiscal belt tightening tends to weaken confidence in the private sector, according to a paper published Tuesday by the European Central Bank , although those effects can be mitigated by focusing consolidation on spending rather than taxes. The study addresses an issue at the heart of Europeâ€™s response to its debt crisis: whether deficit reduction is a good idea during times of economic weakness. The Inflation Cycle May Have Turned. “Central banks around the world have been alarmed at how inflation has plummeted in the last year, in many cases into negative territory,” Greg Ip writes in the Wall Street Journal. “Though much of that is due to oil prices, core inflation, which excludes energy and food, has also been disturbingly low. But there are tantalizing signs that the cycle has turned. In February, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% from January, which pulled the annual inflation rate out of negative territory; itâ€™s now zero. More important, core prices rose 0.16%, which nudged the annual rate up to 1.7% from 1.6%. It was the second upside surprise to core inflation in a row.” -Portugalâ€™s central bank has set up an independent committee to evaluate its supervision over the period leading up to Banco EspÃ­rito Santo SAâ€™s collapse amid criticism that the regulator moved too slowly to detect and tackle the problem at one of the countryâ€™s largest lenders. - A pickup in consumer prices and higher demand for new homes point to a firming in two areas of recent concern for the economy, potentially reassuring the Fed as it considers raising interest rates later this year. - The Central Bank of Nigeria left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting Tuesday, despite a weakening of the naira linked to falling oil prices. Policy makers expressed concern about the “partial dollarization in the economy” and “reiterated that the naira remained the currency of transaction in the economy.” SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
