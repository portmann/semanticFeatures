Kocherlakota Reiterates Fed Shouldn’t Raise Rates in 2015 - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve shouldn’t raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in 2015, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota reiterated Tuesday. The U.S. central bank “can best achieve its objectives by keeping the fed funds rate target at its current level during this calendar year,” Mr. Kocherlakota said in remarks prepared for delivery at a public forum in Marshall, Minn. Most Fed officials expect to begin raising the fed funds rate, which has been pinned near zero since December 2008, sometime this year. The central bank last month kept the door open to a rate increase as soon as this summer , though a recent stretch of soft U.S. economic data has made a move in June less likely . Mr. Kocherlakota has repeatedly opposed raising rates this year , citing too-low inflation and the need to continue supporting economic growth. In April, he said the Fed should instead begin to raise rates in the second half of 2016. The Minneapolis Fed president isn’t a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee. “The data on inflation and employment show that we could produce and consume more as a country by utilizing more of our available human resources,” Mr. Kocherlakota said Tuesday. “Monetary policy can–and should–be used to help make that desirable outcome happen.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
