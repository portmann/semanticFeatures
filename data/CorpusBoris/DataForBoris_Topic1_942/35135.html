Rosengren Says Fed Could Delay Rate Increases if Weakness Continues - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve may need to delay interest-rate increases if economic data don’t pick up in the months ahead, Eric Rosengren, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Rosengren said he was expecting such a pickup in growth, but pointed to several worries, including the outlook in Europe and China and the impacts of a strong U.S. dollar. The interview took place Monday, before the Fed, which meets April 28-29, began its regular self-imposed blackout on public comments about the economy or policy ahead of a meeting. WSJ: How much of an impact can you say at this point the strong dollar is having on growth and inflation? ROSENGREN: These kinds of impacts take quite a few quarters to be fully realized, but I think we are seeing some of the initial impact from exchange-rate movements. I think it is being reflected in import prices as well. We are definitely finding some of the effects. You wouldnâ€™t expect the full effect to be felt this quickly. WSJ: Can you give me some examples of how and where you are seeing these effects? ROSENGREN: You can see it in the [Fedâ€™s economic] forecasts. GDP expectations have come down, and the main thing that changed between December and March was how rapidly the exchange rate had moved. Part of the explanation for why people are downgrading their forecasts, which takes into account some of those lags, is they are expecting net exports to be more of a drag than they otherwise were expecting. You are seeing some softness in import prices at a time when we are trying to get back to our 2% inflation target. Things like apparel and other areas where price increases are not what they would be if we didnâ€™t have the movement that we had in the exchange rate. WSJ: Are these developments counterproductive? ROSENGREN: These developments are a natural outgrowth of in part diverging monetary policy and the U.S. economy being in a somewhat better place than much of the rest of the world. The reason the exchange rate has appreciated is people are anticipating that we are going to be raising rates and that U.S. growth is going to be stronger than in many other parts of the world. The underlying reason is a good reason from the U.S. perspective. Weâ€™re in a better place than many other areas. It is not such good news in terms of globally. It would be much easier for us to reach full employment and get our 2% inflation target if the rest of the world were growing more rapidly. WSJ: We have now had a taper tantrum when the Fed talked about ending quantitative easing and a big dollar rally when the Fed talked about the prospect of raising interest rates. Are you at all worried the Fed is bringing forward the effects of an exit merely by talking about an exit? ROSENGREN: Communication, and how financial markets are going to respond to any communication, is always tricky. The appropriate response is to be clear what weâ€™re trying to achieve. Data dependence means we should see more market movements tied to economic data and less market movements tied to Federal Reserve announcements and Federal Reserve speeches. I donâ€™t think weâ€™re all the way there yet. There are going to be market reactions whenever youâ€™re shifting from an economy that has had very low interest rates for a long period of time to an economy that has more normalized interest rates. While that is a positive story overall, there is the possibility that will be a bumpy ride. We have a 10-year Treasury rate that is below 2%. If you are convinced we are going to hit our 2% inflation target, at some point the 10-year rate has to be higher than it currently is, to reflect we hit our 2% inflation target and there is a positive risk premium. Whether that occurs slowly or more quickly is not something we can actually control. WSJ: Maybe the Fed shouldnâ€™t be talking about an exit, because it is making it harder to achieve one. ROSENGREN: Our goal is not to surprise anyone. We shouldnâ€™t be specific about timing. We should be specific about what we need in order to actually be doing something. The last statement highlighted that we needed further improvement in labor markets and we need to be reasonably confident that inflation is moving back to 2%. If we start getting economic data consistent with those conditions then I would expect market conditions to move. We donâ€™t want to surprise people. We want to make it pretty clear that we are getting closer to the conditions where it makes sense to do that. Economic data have come in much weaker in the first quarter than we might have expected. The employment report was weak. Most private-sector forecasts for first quarter [gross domestic product] indicate that it will be even slower than the 2.2% [growth] we saw in the previous quarter. That wasnâ€™t anticipated in most forecasts. Economic data has a tendency to sometimes surprise us. Weâ€™ll have to see if these factors are temporary or whether it is a broader reflection of what is happening globally. That is why we canâ€™t be specific on dates. We can only be specific about the kinds of economic conditions where a tighter policy would be appropriate. WSJ: Can you describe to me how your own forecast is evolving since the March meeting, in light of the reports weâ€™ve gotten since then? ROSENGREN: There has definitely been a weakness to the tone of the data. The employment report was weak. That was little bit of a surprise. It is pretty hard to disentangle weather conditions from underlying effects. Certainly what is happening globally with Greece and China would indicate that there may be more softness elsewhere in the world than we might have anticipated a few months ago. That is not a particularly positive development. The evidence is that it is a little bit weaker than I would have anticipated, and it is going to take a little while to know whether that is reflecting slower underlying growth or whether a lot of it is because the first quarter was once again impacted by weather conditions. Given what happened in New England, I can certainly understand why weather might have made a difference. There are some positive developments. I donâ€™t want to be all negative. Consumers should be better off. They have benefitted from low oil prices. You wouldnâ€™t expect them to save all that improvement in oil prices. Stock prices and financial conditions remain pretty accommodative. While the last employment report was weaker than I anticipated, overall the unemployment rate is much lower than it was a year ago. You would expect consumption to be picking up. On the housing side, financial conditions are pretty accommodative. You might start seeing more residential investment. But we have to start seeing it in the actual data. WSJ: Given the developments that weâ€™ve been talking about, the slowdown in the first quarter, the jobs numbers, the risk of slow growth overseas, has the probability of the first interest-rate move occurring in 2016 rather than 2015 increased in your view? ROSENGREN: If we get an outcome that is consistent with the forecast of a pickup in the next three quarters, that would be an environment where it may be consistent with raising rates later this year. It is in the forecast. It is not in the data. If we continue to have data that look like less than 2% growth, that would not be an environment that you would expect to produce a tightening in labor markets. That wouldnâ€™t be an environment where you would necessarily see inflation moving to 2%. Then that would be the condition that we would have to defer any monetary-policy tightening. That is a different outcome than most baseline forecasts, including my own. WSJ: So it would take more forecast revisions? ROSENGREN: Most of the economic forecasts that you see from the private sector are expecting inflation to move towards 2% and the labor market to continue to tighten. We actually have to see those forecasts being realized. Those forecasts by and large, the last several years, have had that same component, and they havenâ€™t actually been realized. WSJ: Are there long-term issues that the Fed needs to be looking at now? ROSENGREN: Right up until we get normalized interest rates, there is going to be broader discussion of how the mechanisms are going to work around the time of liftoff. Thinking about scenarios from the global side will continue to be pretty important and may be something we need to continue to focus on. WSJ: How does the global side interact with the exit strategy? ROSENGREN: It can have an impact on both the timing and how steep the tightening would be depending on how much of a headwind the global situation actually becomes. That is certainly an important aspect of it. The fact that we are at very different points in the world economyâ€”the United States and to some degree the U.K. are in a very different place than Japan and Europeâ€”means we are going to be in an environment where exchange rates and interest rates may be more volatile than if everybody was moving more synchronously. We do have to be concerned. Not only is it unusual for us to be moving off the zero bound, but the whole world is in a different monetary stance than we usually experience. We are going to learn as we continue down this road. If the U.S. does lift off before other nations, we are going to just have to see what that means for the dynamics of interest rates and exchange ratesâ€”it is not something that we have a lot of historical experience with.
