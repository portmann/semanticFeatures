Fedâ€™s Dudley Eyes 2015 Rate Rise, in Remarks Welcoming Job Market Gains - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Friday he continues to believe the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year , in comments that welcomed the release of what he saw as a report showing respectable job gains in May . â€œIf the labor market continues to improve and inflation expectations remain well-anchored, then I would expectâ€“in the absence of some dark cloud gathering over the growth outlookâ€“to support a decision to begin normalizing monetary policy later this year,â€? Mr. Dudley said in a speech before the Economic Club of Minneapolis. But he declined to say exactly when the central bank would act. â€œThe likelihood and timing will depend on the economic outlook, and that will be largely shaped by the incoming economic data.â€? Speaking to reporters, Mr. Dudley said â€œwhen I talk to market participants, I think the general view is that the Federal Reserve is likely to lift off some time later this year. I think thatâ€™s pretty much what you are hearing from most [Federal Open Market Committee] speakers, so it doesnâ€™t seem to me like thereâ€™s a big gapâ€? between the views of investors and traders, and that of policymakers. Mr. Dudley also said â€œIâ€™d be surprised if we end up in a situation where we have a big surprise for the marketsâ€? with an entirely unexpected change in rates. In his speech, Mr. Dudley explained that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding his outlook. While he expects growth to accelerate over the remainder of the year, he isnâ€™t entirely confident that will happen. Meanwhile, he said he was becoming â€œmore confidentâ€? the Fed will get inflation back to the 2% target it has failed to meet over the past three years. Mr. Dudleyâ€™s outlook on the economy and monetary policy is critical given that he serves as vice chairman of the monetary-policy-setting FOMC. He spoke in the wake of the release of the May jobs report. The government reported a robust rate of hiring , with payrolls expanding by 280,000 jobs. The jobless rate ticked up to 5.5% from 5.4% in April, while wage gains picked up. â€œTodayâ€™s payroll and household employment reports indicate that this progress continued into May,â€? Mr. Dudley said. But he added, â€œthere is still some ways to goâ€? in a job market that probably looks stronger than it actually is. The strength of hiring came as significant questions have arisen about the state of growth after activity stalled out over the start of the year. Many economists and policymakers are uncertain how much of that weakness is due to extreme winter weather or something more enduring. The vigor seen in hiring suggests the economy may have picked up after its first-quarter swoon. Mr. Dudley sounded a pessimistic note, saying â€œrecent solid job gains and a further decline in the unemployment rate have occurred only because productivity growth has slowed markedly.â€? But he added, â€œit seems unlikely that productivity growth will remain as weak as it has been over the past year,â€? which will likely affect the future pace of hiring. The FOMC next meets on June 16 and 17 and it is very unlikely to raise its short-term interest-rate target off of what are currently near-zero levels. Most officials have hoped to do that this year. That said, if the economyâ€™s growth rate doesnâ€™t accelerate from what was seen at the start of the year, it could call into question the timing of rate rises. Mr. Dudley reiterated his belief that the central bank has described its economic objectives clearly enough that officials donâ€™t have to provide extensive guidance. â€œIf you pay attentionâ€? to the data and what Fed officials have said they want to see â€œyou will be able to judge for yourself when lift-off is likely,â€? he said. Mr. Dudley repeated his view that how markets react to Fed policy changes will be very important to how future rate rises happen. He believes future rate rises will happen on a â€œshallowâ€? path, but if markets donâ€™t react to the Fedâ€™s desire to raise borrowing costs, that could make the Fed more aggressive with subsequent rate rises. Meanwhile, if markets get too far ahead of the Fed, that could slow the pace of rate rises, he said. Mr. Dudley also said that he expects some â€œturbulenceâ€? in markets when the Fed begins raising rates given how long rates have been pinned at rock-bottom levels. He said that means the Fed needs to provide as much clarity as it can about the outlook. On the economy, Mr. Dudley said weakness over the start of the year was driven by weather, cuts in energy investment, a rising trade deficit, sluggish foreign demand and a strong dollar. So far, the rebound from the first quarter has been â€œmuted,â€? but he said â€œmy view is that growth will likely pick up further during the remainder of this year.â€?
