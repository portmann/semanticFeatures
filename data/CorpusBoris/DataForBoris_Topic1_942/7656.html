Recap: Fed Decision and Janet Yellenâ€™s Press Conference - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank Chairwoman Janet Yellen arrives for a news conference after a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the Fed headquarters in Washington on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve took a step toward raising short-term rates later this year by dropping its promise to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to start. Thatâ€™s what today is all about. Will the Federal Reserve drop its â€œpatientâ€? stance from its statement? All signs suggest it will, opening the door to a rate increase as early as June. Whatâ€™s perhaps more important out of today is how the Fed frames its change in posture.Â  Weâ€™ll have a statement at 2 p.m. ET and then a press conference with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen that should shed more light on the Fedâ€™s plans. Since pushing its interest-rate target to near zero in December 2008, the Fed has done three rounds of bond-buying, offered thousands of words of speeches and agonized over wording changes in dozens of policy statements. None of it is as easy to understand as a simple change in interest rates. By moving toward a rate increase, the Fed â€” in theory â€” would be returning to a simpler pre-crisis playbook for policy and communications. Fewer unconventional tools and cleaner policy decisions should make life easier. But none of it will really be all that simple. The crisis changed how Fed officials, and the public, think about their policy approach. Thereâ€™s also a deepening mess around the world weighing on U.S. central bankers. A misstep in using a blunt tool like interest rates could force the Fed back into a corner. Today will mark Janet Yellenâ€™s fifth press conference since taking over the top spot at the Fed. It will be the 17th press conference overall since Ben Bernanke started the tradition in 2011 after a Yellen-led committee helped shape the format of this ritual. Weâ€™ve followed all 16 here on Real Time Economics. So while youâ€™re demonstrating your patience for the Fedâ€™ decision, you can take a tour through QE ups and downs and all sorts of other excitement in Fed land over the past four years.Â  The big question over todayâ€™s meeting is about â€œpatienceâ€? but thereâ€™s also going to be a lot to learn from the Fedâ€™s Summary of Economic Projections. Â Thereâ€™s two key pieces of information in this document:Â  First, this is where Fed policy makers reveal their estimates of how quickly interest rates will rise. Currently the median estimate from the Fed calls for the target interest rate to rise a bit above 1 percent by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of 2016. Thatâ€™s a pretty slow pace of increases compared to 2004-05 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% at every meeting, or by 2 percentage points a year. Second, weâ€™ll see the Fedâ€™s forecasts for GDP, unemployment and inflation. The Fed currently sees pretty strong economic growth, unemployment falling below 5% in the next couple years, and inflation returning to their target, or just underneath it. If those forecasts mostly hold in place, then the likelihood of the first rate increase coming in June could increase. For more on the forecasts, check out the 5 Things to Watch from todayâ€™s meeting. Chief economics commentator Greg Ip takes a look at the Fedâ€™s conundrum on rate-hike timing in todayâ€™s Capital Account column. On one hand, low inflation argues for the Fed to continue moving slowly and â€” dare one say it?Â  â€” patiently. On the other hand, a return to a normal level of interest rates would be helpful for the Fed to have as a tool to fight the next recession, whenever it comes. Itâ€™s a Catch-22 of sorts. In todayâ€™s paper we took a look at some of the recent economic reports that have been disappointing. Industrial production, retail sales and housing starts all have had recent disappointments. The strong dollar, in particular, could pinch U.S. exporters and cause inflation â€” already lower than the Fed prefers â€” to sink ever lower. But thereâ€™s also a chance this will mostly prove transitory. The economy goes through these sorts of wiggles all the time. More often than not the economy snaps out of these brief periods of funk. But sometimes these signs of weakness spread. Weâ€™ll get some idea today of what the Fed thinks. One reason to believe the Fed wonâ€™t be too concerned? The labor market has continued performing well. The unemployment rate is near its lowest in seven years, and job growth is near a 15-year high. Before Chairwoman Janet Yellen was a Fed governor, Fed president or the top official, she was a labor market economist â€” thereâ€™s little that she spends more time thinking about.Â  Six decades ago, then-Fed chairman William McChesney Martin helped popularize the “punch bowl” metaphor about the central bank. The Fed, he said at the time, “is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.” As we highlighted today on Real Time Economics , former Fed vice chairwoman Alice Rivlin has some thoughts about that punch bowl metaphor:Â â€œThe proverbial punch bowl is still there and the party-goers never want it taken away. It is a different punch bowl at a different party than it used to beâ€” now related to systemic risk-taking rather than runaway inflation.â€? Ms. Rivlin offers this inflation factoid that’s worth remembering whenever your neighbor screams about runaway prices: Underlying inflation–measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy–has not hit 3% since 1992. That’s a long time to have mild inflation. And it’s also why the Fed, at least behind closed doors, may be worrying about a lot more than inflation these days. Investors have been relatively calm heading into the big Fed decision. Stocks are down a bit and so are bond yields . Maybe theyâ€™re patiently waiting for the Fed to keep the party going longer than most markets now expect. We have the decision: The Fed has removed â€œpatientâ€? from its statement.Â  This opens the door to a June rate increase, but not before. But the Fed wants to see more job gains and inflation closer to its target before moving ahead. Central bankers also downgraded their outlook for growth and inflation, again. Itâ€™s the Fed pulling another dove out of the hat. Thatâ€™s been the playbook for years, so it should be no surprise today. The Fedâ€™s downgraded economic forecasts are particularly important out of todayâ€™s meeting. The central bank could conceivably do a June rate increase, but it will need to feel confident inflation will actually move closer to its target. Who actually thinks that will happen? Certainly not bond investors. The Fed now projects inflation of 0.6% to 0.8% in 2015 and just 1.7% to 1.9% in 2016. The big question, which Janet Yellen may answer shortly, is how close the economy needs to be to 2% inflation before the Fed starts raising interest rates. For 2015, they lowered growth forecasts to 2.3%-2.7% from 2.6%-3%. For 2016, they lowered growth to 2.3%-2.7% from 2.5%-3%. For 20017, they lowered growth to 2%-2.4% from 2.3%-2.5%. A downgrade in all three years. But in the longer-run, they believe growth will settle into a trend around 2-2.3%, unchanged from their last forecasting round. That means the downgrade of 2015-17 isnâ€™t going to be made up sometime in the future. They see that growth as lost. Most Fed officials expect rates to rise this year, but theyâ€™re currently expecting rates to rise slowly. The median estimate from Fed officials now calls for rates between 0.5% and 0.75% by the end of the year, and between 1.75% and 2% at the end of 2016. Rates are currently in a range of 0 to 0.25%. If the Fed sticks with its old patterns of raising rates 0.25 percentage point at a time, that means it will only raise rates twice this year and only five times next year. Thatâ€™s seven rate increases over the course of the next 14 meetings. If that proves to be the case, it would mean interest rate increases at half the speed as 2004-06. During that period, the Fed raised rates 0.25 percentage point at every single meeting, taking its target rate from 1 percent to 5.25% with increases at 17 consecutive meetings. The latest jobs report put the nation’s unemployment rate at 5.5%. That was within the 5.2% to 5.5% range most Fed officials had considered full employment. Er, scratch that. The Fed today moved the target. It now sees the long-run rate at 5% to 5.2%. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen arrives to address a news conference following the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Janet Yellen is here, and her message is clear: Â Just because the Fed removed the word â€œpatientâ€? doesnâ€™t mean the Fed decided a rate increase is coming. In her opening statement discussing the U.S. economy, Janet Yellen is dancing around a subject the Fed doesnâ€™t like to talk about: the value of the dollar. The Fed sticks to the talking point that the strength of the dollar is a matter for the U.S. Treasury Secretary to discuss. But the dollar can have big impacts on the U.S. economy and Ms. Yellen indirectly addressed some of them. â€œInflation has declined further below our longer-run objective,â€? she said. â€œDeclining import prices have also restrained inflation,â€? she said. Thatâ€™s an acknowledgment that the strong dollar has pushed the Fed away from its goals.Â  She also noted that most officials have downgraded their growth forecasts, in part because of â€œa weaker outlook for net exports.â€? The strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and may worsen the export outlook. Again, Ms. Yellen thinks the strong dollar is pushing the Fed away from its goals, though she doesnâ€™t come out and say so. â€œTodayâ€™s modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the Federal funds rate. In particular, this change does not mean that an increase will necessarily occur in June, although we canâ€™t rule that out.â€? The Fedâ€™s decision will be made on the economyâ€™s progress in reaching the Fedâ€™s goals on employment and inflation. â€œWe continue to base that assessment on a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments.â€? By marking down both near-term growth and unemployment, the Fed has implicitly also marked down potential growth for those years. This suggests Fed officials are treating a lot of the lost output since the recession as gone forever. However, they have not marked down long-term potential growth, which they have left at 2% to 2.3%. In other words, they see much of the damage of the crisis and recession as a one-time only hit, and the drivers of long-term growth â€“labor, capital and technology â€“ as unchanged. That seems a bit too optimistic. Their potential growth rate is higher than the CBOâ€™s at 2.1% and some recent private forecasts that are below 2%. Expect that to come down further in coming years.Â  In her first answer at the press conference, Ms. Yellen goes out of her way to emphasize the upbeat pat of the Fedâ€™s forecasts: â€œIt is important to recognize that this is not a weak forecast,â€? she said.â€? Taking everything into account, w continue to project above trend growth, continue to project improvement in the labor market. By the end of 2015, the central tendency is theyâ€™re looking for an unemployment rate thatâ€™s down to 5 to 5.2% which is consistent with their estimates of its longer run normal value.â€? â€œWe do see considerable underlying strength in the US economy,â€? she said. â€œIn spite of what looks like a weaker first quarter, we are projecting good performance for the economy.â€? This viewpoint underscores why the Fed wants to have the option of possibly increasing its target interest rate as early as June.Â  â€œI donâ€™t have a mechanical answer for you,â€? Yellen says. â€œThere is no single thing where I would say we must see such-and-such in order to achieve that level of confidence. We will be looking at a wide array of data.â€? Yellen says a stronger labor market would increase her confidence that inflation will move up over time. But Fed officials still expect inflation to remain low because of downward pressure from energy prices and the dollar.Â  Â The Fed is also watching wage growth, but that’s not a precondition to raising rates. It’s watching inflation expectations; survey measures have been stable but market-based measures are low. “If they were to move up over time, that would probably serve to increase my confidence.” As we noted earlier, the Fedâ€™s forecasts today contained a shallower path for interest rates going forward. Instead of increasing rates at 0.25% at every meeting, the median interest rate estimate from the Fed calls for only 7 increases over the course of the next 14 meetings. Asked why, Ms. Yellen cited two factors underlying the slow rise of rates: 1) Inflation has come in further below the Fedâ€™s target than they expected, and that calls for lower rates to bring it back. 2) The Fed Â has lowered its estimates of the normal rate for the unemployment rate. That means, the unemployment goal is a little bit further away than previously estimated. That too calls for somewhat lower interest rates, she said. There are “asymmetric risks,” as Yellen has explained before. “If there are adverse shocks to demand that tend to push inflation and economic performance in an adverse direction, it’s not possible to lower rates,” she said. â€œCan we provide certainty?â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œOf course we canâ€™t provide certainty what the data will look like and how the economy will evolve. To achieve our objectives we need to watch the data and continually reformulateâ€? our estimates, she said. Fed officials have marked down considerably their view of the â€œNonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment,â€? or Nairu. The new central tendency of the long run unemployment rate is 5 to 5.2%, down from 5.2% to 5.5%. Ms.Â Yellen told WSJâ€™s Jon Hilsenrath this may explain why so many FOMC members have marked down their path of interest rate increases: it implies more slack in the economy, less inflation pressure and a need for easy policy for longer. But it also has the feel of throwing in the towel. The old range seemed inconsistent both with history, and the present: Unemployment is already down to 5.5% and there is scant sign of the wage acceleration one would anticipate if the U.S. were really at Nairu. And inflation got well below 5% in both of the prior expansions with no notable pickup in inflation. The best argument for a higher NairuÂ now was the notion that the recession had created a lot of structural unemployment, but there has been little empirical proof of that. Those who can no longer find work because their skills are out of date seem to have simply left the labor force. Yellen declines to comment on the Fedâ€™s prior warnings about bubbles in the biotech and social media sectors. But she is willing to repeat some of the Fedâ€™s earlier assessments about the overall market: â€œOverall measures of equity valuations are on the high side but not outside of historical ranges,â€? she says. â€œIn some corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually low spreads.â€? Congress wants to make all sorts of changes to the Federal Reserve. They want the GAO to audit it, they want the Fed to follow a monetary policy rule and they want to reconfigure the way Fed presidents vote or are confirmed.Â  Is there any room for compromise from the Fed, or any ideas that the Fed thinks are a good idea? “I donâ€™t think the system is broken, I think itâ€™s working well,” Ms. Yellen said. “So I donâ€™t see a need for changes but of course itâ€™s up to Congress to review that.”Â  “I don’t have a quantitative estimate to offer you,” she says. “But I certainly expect net exports to serve as a notable drag this year on the outlook.” Still, she’s insisting on some context: While the strong dollar is serving as a drag, the FOMC still expects above-trend growth.Â  And for everyone overseas, she has a message: “We realize that our own policies affect performance in the rest of the world. And that performance in other countries has an influence on us…. I think a strong U.S. economy certainly is something that is good for other countries, as well.” The Federal Reserve has been facing pressure to reveal the results of an internal investigation into a 2012 leak of market-sensitive policy deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee. Ms. Yellen declined to go into any details of what happened with this leak or the status of a Congressional review of what happened. “Iâ€™m not going to get into details, but let me just say that we welcome that review and weâ€™re looking forward to its conclusions,” Ms. Yellen said. Asked subsequently if an FOMC member was behind the decision to discontinue the initial investigation into the leak, Ms. Yellen issued a categorical denial: “That is an allegation that I donâ€™t believe has any basis in fact.” Yellen notes that studies for decades have shown lags in monetary policy moving through the economy. The Fedâ€™s forecasts are designed to be forward-looking, and thatâ€™s why most officials expect to tighten policy â€œsometime this year,â€? she says. â€œSo just as we donâ€™t want to be premature in tightening policy and aborting a recovery that we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also donâ€™t want to be behind the curve and beginning to tighten given those lags,â€? Yellen says. Productivity is simply the amount of output per labor. If the same number of workers produce more goods, then productivity rises. Over the past couple years, however, this productivity growth has slowed. “The unemployment rate has come down more rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected,” Ms. Yellen said. “In the long-run it is a disappointing factor about the ultimate prospects for the US economy if it continues,” she said, but she’s not forecasting that: “I would expect it to pickup and as you can see from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants think it will pickup above current levels.” How did the chairwoman feel about testifying in what â€œdidnâ€™t look like a very pleasant experienceâ€? before the House?Â  That question drew a broad smile from Janet Yellen. So has the relationship between the Fed and Congress deteriorated? Yellen is unbothered. “It’s very important for the Federal Reserve to be accountable to Congress,” she says. “We have a wide range of responsibilities. And it’s entirely appropriate for me to testify and be quizzed on a range of topics by members of Congress. I think I need to be ready to answer questions on any aspect of Federal Reserve behavior. And that’s an important principle.” Itâ€™s a lesson weâ€™ve seen over and over from Ben Bernanke and now Janet Yellen: When investors are nervous about a change, whether itâ€™s the end of a bond-buying program or near-zero rates, the Fed chief finds a way to calm them.Â  But what does that say about the state of the U.S. economy? Â Growth is slower than expected, inflation is lower than expected and the unemployment rate will need to drop even more than expected earlier. The Federal Reserve dropped a pledge to remain â€œpatientâ€?Â before starting to raise interest rates, but trimmed its outlook for growth, inflation and unemployment. Hereâ€™s how some economists reacted to the statement and Ms. Yellenâ€™s press conference. Mortgages and other loans will stay cheap for borrowers.Â  Government bond prices surged and the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled back below 2% . The dollar fell sharply . Your move, Mr. Draghi. Buy buy buy! Â  Stocks rallied back to near-record levels, unperturbed by stock valuations being ( as Yellen said ) on the high side. The fact that the Fed backed itself out of a linguistic corner without any market damage means some Fed officials are patting themselves on the back today. previous Housing Waits–and Waits–on Millennials We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.
