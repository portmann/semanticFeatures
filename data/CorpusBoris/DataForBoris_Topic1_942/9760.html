Grand Central: Lending Spurt Backs ECB Optimism - Real Time Economics - WSJ There has been a notable shift in European Central Bank rhetoric on the eurozoneâ€™s economy since the bank last week launched its quantitative easing program. Whereas officials spent much of late 2014 warning about the economic dangers posed by too-low inflation, thereby justifying their decision in January to buy more than EUR1 trillion in public and private bonds between this month and September 2016, they have recently been signaling that the blocâ€™s $13.5 trillion economy has turned the corner. Thursday brought some more good news . European banks tapped an ECB lending facility, at four-year maturities, to the tune of EUR97.8 billion ($104 billion).Â That was well above analyst expectations of something closer to EUR50 billion. Because banks must increase lending to the private sector as a condition for the cheap funds, the high demand signaled that banks finally see more opportunities to lend to businesses. Thereâ€™s another upshot: the ECBâ€™s balance sheet. Officials have said they want to restore the balance sheetâ€”the value of assets on the ECBâ€™s booksâ€”to early 2012 levels, when it peaked just above EUR3 trillion. That implies a rise from current levels of around EUR900 billion. Thatâ€™s a lot of numbers, but the bottom line is that if future four-year loan installments see strong demand, Â on top of the EUR60 billion per month in assets the ECB has pledged to buy, the balance sheet could exceed levels from three years ago and even approach EUR3.5 trillion. That means more central bank money in the financial system, with two possible effects: further strengthening the economy, and maintaining downward pressure on the euro, which would boost exports. But itâ€™s too soon to sound the all clear for the eurozone economy. It suffered through a pair of recessions in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and barely escaped a third last year. The ECBâ€™s staff forecast s, released earlier this month, were widely seen as optimistic,but Â only see growth returning to above 2% in 2017. That would be considered weak in many other developed economies, such as the U.S. Such growth would be unlikely to put a major dent in the blocâ€™s jobless rate, which is above 11%, and should thus leave Â inflation under well below the ECBâ€™s target of just below 2%. So while reports such as Thursdayâ€™s on bank lending will be welcomed, they are unlikely to take any pressure off the ECB to see its stimulus programs to their conclusion well into next year. Fedâ€™s Tarullo Supports Raising ‘Systemically Important’ Threshold. Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo on Thursday reiterated his support for reducing the regulatory burden on certain banks, saying he supports raising the asset-size threshold for banks to qualify for tougher regulation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Fedâ€™s Yellen, Japan, and the Highly Imperfect World of â€˜Expectedâ€™ Inflation. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday offered a peek into just how uncertain policy makers are about the future path of U.S. inflationâ€”despite their hopes that it will gradually return to the central bankâ€™s 2% target after several years of falling short. Top BOE Official Sees Possibility of Rate Cut. Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, said in a speech that the current spell of low inflation in the U.K. may prove more persistent than the central bankâ€™s forecasts imply if wage growth remains subdued or global price pressures continue to wane. Beijing Helps to Drive Yuan Higher Against U.S. Dollar.Â Chinaâ€™s yuan scored its best week in over seven years, as Beijing steps in to the markets to drive the currency higher and kick out speculators betting on losses as the economy deteriorates. BOJ Says Investors Won’t Draw ‘Unwarranted’ Conclusions. Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Friday that investors wouldn’t draw any “unwarranted conclusions” over the central bank’s monetary policy if a drop in energy prices is the main reason behind a slowdown in inflation. The remark could be interpreted as a fresh signal that the BOJ is unwilling to add to its stimulus measures soon, unless there is clear evidence that falling global oil prices are weakening Japanese inflation expectations- -Dow Jones Newswires. BOJ Feb Minutes:Some Board Members Questioned Sustainability of JGB Purchases.Â Japan’s increasingly volatile government debt market became a key debate topic at the Bank of Japan’sÂ February policy meeting, with some policy-makers questioning the sustainability of the central bank’s aggressive bond purchases, according to the meeting minutes released Friday.

Mexican Central Bank Remains on the Defensive. Â Bank of Mexico Gov. Agustin Carstens said the central bank could adjust its monetary policy if it perceives that expectations regarding an eventual U.S. Federal Reserve rate increase are pushing inflation farther from Mexico’s annual 3% target. Â The Bank of Mexico’s next policy meeting is scheduled for March 26. Some economists are wagering the bank may opt to hike preemptively ahead of a potential move by the U.S., Mexico’s top trade partner–Dow Jones Newswires.

The central bank minutes also indicated the rate cut concluded its easing cycle. â€“Dow Jones Newswires Banks Struggle to Unload Oil Loans. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, UBS and other large banks face tens of millions of dollars in losses on loans they made to energy companies last year, a sign of investor jitters in a sector battered by the oil slump. The banks intended to sell the loans to investors but have struggled to unload them even after cutting prices, thanks to a nine-month-long plunge that has taken Nymex crude futures to their lowest level since 2009 . -Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart speaks on banking and prudential regulation in Athens, Ga., at 10:20 a.m. EDT -Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans speaks on â€œRisk Management for Monetary Policy Near the Zero Lower Boundâ€? in Washington at 11:30 a.m. EDT Fed Should Wait Longer to Raise Rates When Theyâ€™re Near Zeroâ€”Chicago Fed Paper. The Fed should delay raising interest rates from near zero for quite a bit longer given high economic uncertainty and the risk that moving too soon could threaten the recovery and force the central bank to slash borrowing costs again. Thatâ€™s according to Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and three of his staffers, in a paper released Thursday at the Brookings Institution. Two New Research Papers That Could Upend Our Understanding of Economic Inequality. Two new pieces of economics research released by the Brookings Institution could upend a big piece of our understanding about economic inequality. One paper suggests the rising share of capital income can be explained entirely by housing. The second shows that political support for redistribution is not increasing in the U.S., even as inequality rises. Eurozone May Have to Boost Immigration to Avoid Growth Collapse.Â The eurozone may have little choice but to encourage higher levels of immigration if it is to avoid decades of very low economic growth that will leave it with high levels of debt, according to a paper published Friday by two Irish economists. In Fed Versus Markets, the Markets Win Big. “One of the financial marketâ€™s great puzzles is why fixed-income investors predicted short-term interest rates would rise much more slowly than the Federal Open Market Committee itself expected,” Greg Ip writes for the Journal. “Fed officials scratched their heads and speculated the market thinks that Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s forecast is lower than that of her colleagues; the market price incorporates some unlikely but really bad scenarios for the economy; or that inflows of foreign capital were artificially depressing medium-term interest rates. A simpler explanation may be the right one: The market has a different, and clearer, view of where the world is going than the Fed does.” The Fed Turns Gloomier on the Supply Side. “The Fed has revised down its growth outlook so often that it seems hardly noteworthy it did so again Wednesday,” Greg Ip writes for the Journal. “Yet the downgrade is telling in a little-noticed way: the Fed is getting gloomier about the supply side of the economy, and thatâ€™s one reason why interest rates may be low for longer.” Rules for the Fed to Live By. “To some, the proposal to establish a [monetary policy] rule is an attack on Fed independence, or a narrow-minded attempt to impose a straight jacket on monetary policy, but that is a caricature,” Charles Calomiris and Peter Ireland write for U.S. News & World Report. “Advocates of rules are not proposing rigid restrictions on Fed actions, but rather are insisting that the Fed spell out an empirically defensible framework that guides it, and explain deviations from that framework.” - Labor Costs Up Modestly. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recorded a 0.5% increase in unit labor costs across its 34 members during the final quarter of last year, a pickup from 0.3% in the three months through September. However, that rise was modest compared with the start of 2014 , when costs increased by 0.9%. Confidence in China’s economy among bankers and entrepreneurs is declining as the world’s second-largest economy faces more headwinds in 2015, according to a People’s Bank of China survey released Friday.

Thailand’s central bank is taking a less optimistic view of the country’s economic outlook in 2015, as the recovery has been slower than expected. The Bank of Thailand on Friday revised down its gross domestic product growth estimate for the year to 3.8% from a previous projection of 4.0%, due to expected slower growth in China and the rest of Asia, as well as a government budget disbursement that hasn’t been as fast as hoped.
