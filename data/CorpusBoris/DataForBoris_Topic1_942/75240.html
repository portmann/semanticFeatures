BOJ’s Shirai: Probability of Considering Extra Easing Is Low for Now - Real Time Economics - WSJ A member of the Bank of Japan’s policy board Wednesday reiterated her view that the central bank should make its 2.0% inflation target flexible, saying that it should stick with the current pace of easing without extra action. “If downside risks materialize and are likely to significantly weaken the underlying trend in inflation, I would not hesitate to consider some monetary policy action,” Sayuri Shirai told business leaders in the city of Tsu, Mie Prefecture, western Japan. But she added such a possibility is “low” for now. Ms. Shirai supported the central bank’s decision by a close 5-4 vote to expand its easing program in late October. The former university professor underscored that the central bank should make all efforts to achieve its 2.0% inflation target at the earliest possible time “without imposing an excessive burden on households and firms.” Those comments signal her concern that generating inflation too quickly could eat into the real incomes of households and sap consumption, ultimately making it tougher for the BOJ to meet its price goal. Ms. Shirai is one of the three board members who expressed opposition to the BOJ’s view in its outlook report issued in late April that the long-held 2% inflation target will likely be achieved “around in the first half of fiscal 2016,” and that the inflation rate is expected to stay around there on average. The period was pushed back about six months from the previous forecast. She had proposed the wording be changed to say the 2.0% target would be achieved “in or around fiscal 2016.? In her speech, Ms. Shirai went into details on her own views, saying that she expected the consumer inflation rate to rise close to around 2.0% at the end of the fiscal year ending March 2017, after hovering around 0.5% in the current year through March 2016. That’s lower than policy board’s median forecast of a 0.8% gain. Her views about the economy and prices have been more cautious than other board members, including Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda. “In particular, if a deviation of the actual inflation rate from the 2 percent target is sustained over a long period, the public and the market may begin to believe that achieving the target will be difficult,” she added. The nationwide consumer price index has been close to flat recently, far below the BOJ’s ambitious 2.0% inflation target. Economists predict the CPI could sink into negative territory in the coming months, with some of them expecting further action later in the year.
