Grand Central: Lockhart Explains How He Became Fed’s ‘Bellwether’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fedâ€™s Fischer Urges Vigilance on Shadow Bank Risks Japanâ€™s Zero Inflation a Setback for Abenomics Bob Dylan may have sung â€œyou donâ€™t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,â€? but itâ€™s a good thing the Federal Reserve has Dennis Lockhart. Fed watchers routinely describe the Atlanta Fed president as the central bankâ€™s â€œbellwether.â€? While Fed hawks and doves may offer conflicting views about the future of interest rates, Mr. Lockhart cuts through the noise and provides a reliable account of the most likely path for Fed policy. At an event in Detroit Thursday, Mr. Lockhart explained why he thinks he occupies his current perch. As he sees it, the key difference is that in an institution dominated by economists, Fed careerists and academics, he has real-world experience drawn from a long career in international banking, serving what would become Citigroup from 1971 to 1988 with work in the Middle East and Latin America. â€œI have a business backgroundâ€? which influences how to think about central bank policy in the real world, he said. â€œI understand banking, therefore I understand the principle channel through which monetary policy has its influence.â€? Mr. Lockhart removes himself from economistsâ€™ intellectual battles. â€œI try to be pragmatic. Iâ€™m not so invested in theory or in a school of economic thought. So when I come to table, I try to bring kind of a practical common sense perspective.â€? Whatever the reason, he has become a good guide about what to expect from the Fed. So itâ€™s important to listen when Mr. Lockhart says â€œthe economy is sufficiently strong and resilient that we can begin to cycle out of what was clearly an extraordinary set of measures to something more normal.â€? (Translation: The economy is improving enough that we can stop promising to hold short-term interest rates at abnormally low levels and talk about when to start raising them.) In eight years at the Fed, â€œIâ€™ve never had a chance to vote on rising interest rates,â€? Mr. Lockhart said. That streak likely ends this year. Lockhart Says Dollar Rise Becoming Bigger Issue for Fed. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said heâ€™s paying increased attention to the dollarâ€™s climb to see if itâ€™s weighing on the economy at a time where the central bank is getting closer to raising interest rates. The dollarâ€™s value is â€œpart of that pictureâ€? the Fed will consider as it decides what to do, Mr. Lockhart said. Fedâ€™s Fischer Urges Vigilance on Shadow Bank Risks. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer urged regulators to be vigilant in monitoring risks outside the banking system even though the so-called shadow banking sector is less vulnerable than it was before the recent global financial crisis. â€œMany reforms have been adopted for both banks and nonbank financial institutions. But regulation is a cat and mouse game,â€? he said in remarks prepared for delivery in Frankfurt, Germany on Friday. â€œRegulators need to respond to existing regulatory gaps and to keep pace with further changes.â€?

The Fed should be very cautious about raising interest rates just because the unemployment rate is falling, according to new research from two former central bank officials who are concerned the often-cited figure vastly overstates improvements in the job market. David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth College economics professor and former member of the Bank of Englandâ€™s monetary policy committee, teams up with Andrew Levin, an ex-Fed board economist now at the International Monetary Fund, to argue that the U.S. employment outlook is much weaker than indicated by the 5.5% jobless rate registered in February.
