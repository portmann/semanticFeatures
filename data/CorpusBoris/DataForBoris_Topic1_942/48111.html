Grand Central: Bernanke Missive Fires at Taylor Rule, Misses Financial Stability  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hilsenrathâ€™s Take: Bernanke Missive Fires At Taylor Rule, Misses Financial Stability Fedâ€™s Mester: â€˜All Meetings Are on the Tableâ€™ For Rate Rises Ben Bernanke is much feistier as a public commentator than he was as Federal Reserve chairman. One knock on Mr. Bernanke during his tenure as Fed chief was that he was too deferential to dissenting views, which sometimes slowed or muted the Fedâ€™s responses to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and its after-effects. In his few weeks as a blogger at the Brookings Institution, he has challenged Harvard University professor Lawrence Summers , German economic policy makers , The Wall Street Journal editorial page , Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s long-run balance sheet strategy , and Stanford University professor John Taylor . The mild-mannered former Fed chairman seems to have some scores to settle. It also doesnâ€™t hurt the prospects for his forthcoming book that he is staying in the public spotlight ahead of the bookâ€™s release. Mr. Taylor takes up Mr. Bernankeâ€™s bait in todayâ€™s The Wall Street Journal. The debate revolves around the merits of following a policy rule, such as the one Mr. Taylor designed in the 1990s, to guide Fed decisions. The rule prescribes an interest rate based on the level of inflation and the amount of slack in the economy as measured by the output gap â€“ or the difference between actual output and the economyâ€™s potential output in a stable state. Mr. Bernanke argues the Fed canâ€™t be pinned down a simple rule, especially when officials disagree about the details that go into it, such as how much weight to put on the output gap or whether to modify their estimate of the real interest rate. Mr. Taylor argues that the Fedâ€™s record is dismal when it deviates from the rule he long ago prescribed. There is something about this particular debate which seems a bit disconnected from events of the past decade. The central problem of this time was financial excess and collapse. Yet financial stability appears only peripherally in the Taylor Rule discussion. There is no coefficient for financial excess in Mr. Taylorâ€™s rule. Mr. Bernanke doesnâ€™t see financial stability as a central concern of monetary policy. After the events of 2007-2009, it seems economists need to figure out more clearly how this fits in before they come up with any kind of workable guidelines for future monetary policy. Fedâ€™s Mester: â€˜All Meetings Are on the Tableâ€™ For Rate Rises. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she is wonâ€™t rule out supporting a rise in interest rates at the central bankâ€™s June policy meeting despite data showing the economy got off to a very weak start this year. â€œAll meetings are on the tableâ€? as opportunities to raise rates, she said. Fedâ€™s Williams: Policy Rules Donâ€™t Work Well in Real World. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said efforts to conduct monetary policy based strictly on a rules-based regime would likely not work very well in real-world conditions. The problem, he said, is that rules generally rely, as part of their formulation, on impossible-to-measure factors like the economyâ€™s potential growth rate and natural level of interest rates. IMF to Brighten View of Chinaâ€™s Yuan. The International Monetary Fund is close to declaring Chinaâ€™s yuan fairly valued for the first time in more than a decade, a milestone in the countryâ€™s efforts to open its economy that would blunt U.S. criticism of Beijingâ€™s currency policy. The IMFâ€™s latest view undermines the Obama administrationâ€™s pressure on China over its management of the currency and could undercut congressional efforts to inject yuan concerns into pending trade legislation. Greece Back on the Brink, Five Years After First Bailout. Greece is closer than ever to the brink of a bankruptcy that could destabilize not only the eurozone, but the global economy as well. Although Greece has come close to financial meltdown before, the ideological divide has never been deeper. In India, a Debate Over Central Bank Independence. A debate over how to set interest rates in India is pitting the central bank against finance ministry officials, and itâ€™s showing no signs of abating. Researchers Develop â€˜Smartâ€™ Ink to Foil Counterfeiters. Take note, central-bank money-printers: Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a type of invisible ink intended to be especially tough for counterfeiters to duplicate . As with marks already used on bank notes in many currencies, this ink becomes visible only in ultraviolet light, but with a key difference: Each application of the ink can be made with a custom formula known only to the producer, which makes it especially hard to copy. Russiaâ€™s Beloved Borscht Reveals Reality of Inflation. Every other month, retired teacher Natalya Atuchina cooks up a special pot of borscht in her home city of Omsk. A year ago, she bought the ingredients at local markets for 165 rubles ($3.20). In April, they cost nearly 247 rubles. Ms. Atuchinaâ€™s soup is the benchmark for the â€œBorscht Index,â€? a metric her husband Sergei Komarovskikh devised a little over a year ago to track food costs in their Siberian city. Since then, the borschtâ€™s price has risen 49.5% , evidence of the real-life sting of inflation in Russia. - 9 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Tarullo delivers opening remarks at an Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act outreach meeting in Boston - 12:25 p.m. EDT: Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans speaks in Columbus, Ind. - 0930 GMT (5:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Noyer speaks at a press conference in Paris - 2:30 p.m. local time (12:30 a.m. EDT): Reserve Bank of Australia releases a policy statement - 9:15 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Yellen speaks on â€œFinance and Societyâ€? in Washington - 1:15 p.m. EDT: Kansas City Fedâ€™s George speaks on a panel about â€œCredit Markets: Booms, Busts and Distortionsâ€? in Washington - 1:30 p.m. EDT: Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy in Baton Rouge, La. - Central Bank of Kenya releases a policy statement - National Bank of Romania releases a policy statement - 0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): Norwayâ€™s Norges Bank releases a policy statement - 1645 GMT (12:45 p.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Mersch speaks in Barcelona - Central Bank of Malaysia releases a policy statement - 8:50 a.m. local time (7:50 p.m. EDT Thursday): Bank of Japan releases minutes of its April 7-8 policy meeting China Passes Mexico as the Top Source of New U.S. Immigrants.

More recently, the Great Recession also reduced illegal immigration from Mexico. Oil Prices: Is Supply or Demand Behind the Slump? Oil prices have been falling since mid-2014 primarily because of lower demand and not over-supply , Alejandro Badel and Joseph McGillicuddy wrote in a St. Louis Fed paper. Taylor on Bernanke: Monetary Rules Work Better Than â€˜Constrained Discretion.â€™ â€œIn its essence, Ben [Bernanke]â€™s critique is of rules-based strategies for the instruments of policy in general rather than of particular policy rules,â€? Stanford University professor John Taylor writes in The Wall Street Journal . â€œHe prefers â€˜constrained discretion.â€™ As I see it, the broader evidence in the United States and in many other countries that Ben does not mention is that a rules-based policy has worked and that discretionâ€”constrained or otherwiseâ€”has not.â€? None of the Fedâ€™s Business. U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter: “it was a rough winter, labor disputes closed some West Coast ports, and oil has been dirt cheap,” George Selgin writes on the Cato at Liberty blog. “But what have such things got to do with monetary policy ? Can a dose of monetary medicine make up for a winter storm, or a strike?…When one gets down to brass tacks such changes in the real economic circumstances ought in themselves to be none of the Fedâ€™s concern.” Bank of Japan Parts Ways With Reality. Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kurodaâ€™s latest press conference was “a demonstration of monetary malpractice,” William Pesek writes in a Bloomberg View column. “If Kuroda is content with where Japan’s economy is at the moment, he’s not up to the challenge of leading the country’s central bank.” - U.S. manufacturers said activity continued to expand in April at a modest pace, but employment fell. - A key indicator of the health of the U.K.â€™s manufacturing sector slid to a seven-month low in April, raising the prospect that the British economy may not quickly rebound from a surprise slowdown during the first quarter of the year. - Chinaâ€™s manufacturing sector in April turned in its weakest performance in a year , according to a private gauge of the countryâ€™s factory activity. The private-sector HSBC manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to a final reading of 48.9 in April from 49.6 in March, HSBC Holdings PLC said Monday. It was the lowest level since April 2014 when the reading came in at 48.1â€”well below the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction. SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
