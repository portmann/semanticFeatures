Fed Seeks Comment on Technical Details of Interest on Reserves Power - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve said Monday it is seeking feedback on the details of a program it plans to use to help control short-term interest rates. In a press release, the Fed said it was seeking comment on how it will calculate the interest it will pay banks to park reserves on the Fed’s books. This power to pay interest on excess reserves will be the Fed’s chief way of setting short-term interest rates when central bankers decide to begin boosting costs. The Fed says it would like to change how it pays interest to program participants in a manner that would help better align any potential change in rates with existing reporting requirement faced by the deposit taking banks. The Fed said in its press release that in seeking comment, the announcement had no implications for the “near-term” conduct of monetary policy.
