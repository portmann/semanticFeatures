Grand Central: Britons Unfazed by Low Inflation - Real Time Economics - WSJ One risk central bankers are intensely focused on during this spell of low inflation is that expectations of future inflation start to decline. They fret that if consumers come to believe price-growth is weakening and prices might even start falling, then they may put off purchases in the hope of getting a better deal later. That could hurt spending and slow the economy. There are other risks–expectations of weak price growth may persuade workers to settle for lower pay deals than they would otherwise, which could also slow spending and dent growth. With the most recent data showing consumer prices in the U.K. fell on the year in April for the first time in more than half a century, these risks are especially relevant for the Bank of England. Some officials, notably chief economist Andy Haldane, have publicly expressed concern that weak price-growth may prove harder to overcome than expected, in part because of these expectation effects. Thereâ€™s some comfort Â to be had then in the BOEâ€™s latest survey of Britonsâ€™ inflation expectations. Published Friday, the survey shows that Britons on average in May believed the annual rate of inflation was 2.2%, and that they expect inflation to stay at that level in the coming year. Longer-term expectations arenâ€™t much higher, and are within one percentage point of the BOEâ€™s 2% target. The survey suggests Britonsâ€™ expectations of future inflation havenâ€™t been overly skewed by this spell of low inflation, although itâ€™s worth noting the survey was carried out before the April data showing a fall in prices was published. Less reassuring were Britonsâ€™ responses to questions on interest rates. The BOE is expected to begin slowly raising borrowing costs from mid-2016, yet less than a quarter of respondents said higher rates would benefit them, and another quarter said it would be better for them if interest rates went down. Jobs Report Not Likely to Trigger June Rate Hike. Federal Reserve officials are in wait-and-see mode ahead of their June policy meeting, meaning the May employment report to be released Friday morning isnâ€™t likely to push them toward an interest rate increase this month. Many Fed officials began the year believing that by June they might raise their benchmark short-term interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. Instead, they were thrown when the economy contracted in the first quarter and appeared to get off to a slow start in the second. Even if the labor market report showed booming job growth in May, Fed officials arenâ€™t ready to make a move just yet. Tarullo: Economy â€œLost Some Momentum.â€? The U.S. economy appears to have â€œlost some momentumâ€? and may not recover as quickly from a rough first quarter as it did in 2014, Fed governor Daniel Tarullo said Thursday. â€œThere are more questions at this point in 2015 than there were at this point in 2014,â€? Mr. TarulloÂ said at a conference in New York. IMF to Fed: Hold Off on Rate Increases. The International Monetary Fund called for the Fed to wait until 2016 before raising short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade until 2016. In its annual review of the U.S. economy, the IMF said a series of negative shocks, including aÂ strong dollarÂ and bad weather, had sapped momentum for job creation and expansion, forcing the fund to downgrade its growth expectations to 2.5% for this year. Its last estimate in April was for a 3.1% U.S. economic expansion. Greece and Its Creditors Agree On Some Measures.Â Greece and its creditors have agreed on some aspects of a deal to unlock urgent bailout aid, but differences remain on its soaring debt and the amount of fiscal pain the country will have to swallowâ€”suggesting hard political choices are imminent for both sides. Lagarde: Debt Relief Will Be a Part of Any Greek Deal. IMF chiefÂ  Christine Lagarde Â signaled Thursday that debt relief would still be a necessary component of any bailout package for Greece to ensure the program would rescue its beleaguered economy. Led by Germany, some European creditors have opposed debt relief as part of a bailout package for Greece, instead urging tougher economic overhauls from Athens. That position has been at odds with theÂ new government in Athens, which has called for European creditors toÂ restructure their Greek debt Â  Bank of Mexico Leaves Rates Unchanged. In keeping the overnight interest rate target at 3%, as expected, the central bank said risks to inflation and economic growth were unchanged from the previous meeting in late April. Nevertheless, the bank tweaked its inflation forecas t for this year, saying it now expects inflation to remain below its target for the rest of 2015. Malaysiaâ€™s Central Bank Investigating Rules Compliance at 1MDB.Â Malaysiaâ€™s central bank Wednesday said it has started investigations into state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. to see if it secured the appropriate permission for offshore borrowings and foreign investments. New Generation of Manufacturing Robots on the Way. Robots deployed in manufacturing today tend to be large, dangerous to anyone who strays too close to their whirling arms, and limited to one task, like welding, painting or hoisting heavy parts. The latest models entering factories and being developed in labs are a different breed. They can work alongside humans without endangering them and help assemble all sorts of objects, as large as aircraft engines and as small and delicate as smartphones. Soon, some should be easy enough to program and deploy that they no longer will need expert overseers . -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Labor Department releases May jobs report -12:40 p.m. EDT: New York Fedâ€™s Dudley speaks in Minneapolis RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Stiglitz: Fedâ€™s Zero Rate Policy Boosts Inequality. The Fedâ€™s prolonged policies of near-zero interest rates and asset purchases have further widened the already large gap between the rich and poor in the United States, writes Nobel-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz in a new paper. â€œContrary to the presumption in the nineteenth century, where lower interest rates favored debtors over creditors and thus increased equality, we show that â€¦ lower interest rates may actually increase inequality,â€? Who Drives Luxury Cars (Only for a While)? The Fedâ€™s Christopher Kurz and Geng Li find that 40% of households that own a luxury car will not own one four years later, whereas 90% of those with non-luxury cars will still own a non-luxury car four years later. â€œThe findings are consistent with the notion that, relative to necessities, exposures to luxury goods leave a less pronounced imprint on household consumption habits,â€? they conclude. In many cases, people realize they canâ€™t afford to keep luxury cars. Or they want to buy them â€œdue to social status signaling motivations that might retreat after a certain image is established and no longer supports conspicuous consumption.â€? Bond-market volatility reflects reality, not regulation, Greg Ip writes in the Journal. Market participants complain the recent volatility in the bond market â€œis aggravated by illiquidity, that is the absence of many buyers and sellers willing to transact at a given yield and price, for which they blame increased regulations. Stiffer capital regulations make it expensive for banks to hold big inventories of bonds for trading with customers, and the Dodd-Frank lawâ€™s â€˜Volcker ruleâ€™ bans banks from certain types of proprietary bond-trading,â€? he writes. â€œIt is not easy to apportion all the drivers of something as complex as the bond market, but regulations do not appear to be the driving force behind higher volatility.â€? How the Fed’s East Coast Tilt Warps Monetary Policy. Â Writing in the Journal, Congressman Kevin Brady ((R., Texas) argues that regional presidents should have a permanent vote on the Federal Open Market Committee in order to reflect the shift in population and economic activity since the central bank was established. Â ”Concentrating power in New York and Washington undermines the decentralized design of the Federal Reserve,” he writes. “And it could easily politicize monetary policy, ultimately leading to higher inflation, more financial volatility and slower economic growth.” Forget the Deficit. Benedicta Marzinotto argues that European policymakers have focused too much attention on short-term deficit targets. â€œAnnual deficits are poor approximations of the likelihood that one member may have to repay anotherâ€™s debt,â€? she writes. â€œThe fact that the existence of exceptional circumstances can now be invoked to distribute the burden of any needed adjustments over more than one year is helpful. But it does not eliminate the short-term bias embedded in the EUâ€™s fiscal rules.â€?Â  Secular Stagnation: The Time for One-Armed Policy is Over. In a post on VoxEU, economists at Citigroup Â say a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus–or “Â helicopter money”– is needed to lift economies out of stagnation. “Conventional and even unconventional monetary policy (changes in the size and/or composition of the central bankâ€™s balance sheet) are not quite up to the task,” they write. Productivity Falls. The productivity of nonfarm workers, measured as the output of goods and services per hour worked,Â  decreased at a 3.1% seasonally adjusted annual rate Â in the first quarter, the Labor Department said Thursday. Jobless Claims Down. Initial claims for unemployment benefits, a measure of layoffs across the U.S., declined 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 in the week ended May 30, theÂ  Labor Department Â said Thursday. Germany received a double dose of good economic news Friday, as manufacturing orders beat expectations in April, while the Bundesbankâ€™s latest forecast indicated that the country was returning to a growth trajectory sustained by both domestic and foreign factors. The value of Switzerland’s foreign-currency reserves declined in May, data showed Friday, largely because of the weakness of the euro, said analysts. Foreign currency reserves fell to 517.5 billion Swiss francs ($554.7 billion) in May, from CHF522.2 billion in April, said the Swiss National Bank, which declined to comment on the change in value of its reserve holdings–Dow Jones Newswires.
