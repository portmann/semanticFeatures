Black Workers in Many States Haven’t Seen Much of a Recovery, Analysis Suggests - Real Time Economics - WSJ A pedestrian pulls a shopping cart by vacant buildingsÂ last year inÂ Selma, Ala.Â Black workers in Alabama may have taken the hardest hit in this recovery. The unemployment rate for African-Americans there is almost twice as highâ€”a full 5.1 percentage points higherâ€”than it was before the recession, the most elevated in the country. The lowest state jobless rate for black workers in the countryÂ matches the highest rate for white workers in a new analysis. At 6.7%, Virginiaâ€™s black unemployment rate was the lowest in the nation in the fourth quarter. That rate happens to be the same as the jobless rate for white workers in West Virginia, the worst in the country, according to a report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The report, released this month, found that while unemployment rates have fallen across much of the country andÂ  the national unemployment rate is now half of its recession-era peak , only a handful of states have seen meaningful improvement in the labor market for African-American and Latino workers. And conditions vary greatly from state to state. In January, black workers faced a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 8.8% , compared with 4.3% for whites and 4.9% overall. The worst state for black Americans looking for work? That was Illinois, where the jobless rate was 13.1% in the fourth quarter. Even in Virginia, the unemployment rate for black workers was twice as high as it was for white workers. The largest gaps in black and white unemployment were in the District of Columbia, where the black unemployment rate was 5.4 times that of white workers, and in Michigan, where the rate was 3.4 times higher, the report found. The smallest gap was in New Jersey, where the rate was 1.5 times higher. The black unemployment rate is now at or below its prerecession level in nine states. But many of those statesâ€”including Michigan, Ohio and South Carolinaâ€”had rates higher than 10% even before the recession, said economist Valerie Wilson, the director of EPIâ€™s Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy. â€œHere we are almost seven years into a recovery, thatâ€™s troubling that in a number of these states, states that have a significant African-American population, they still have really high unemployment rates,â€? Ms. Wilson said. Only four states have black unemployment rates that are now lower than the national average for black workers: Texas, New York, New Jersey and Tennessee. Those states also had rates that were lower than the national average for black workers before the recession hit. â€œI consider that a meaningful recovery,â€? Ms. Wilson said. â€œYou have now returned to an unemployment rate that was better than average, as opposed to another state where you are back to that prerecession rate, but it was above 10% in 2007.â€? CommunityÂ advocates and lawmakers have urged the Federal Reserve toÂ hold off on raising interest rates further, pointing to the disparities between black and white unemployment as evidence the economy is far from robust and still needs support from the Fed’s easy-money policies. â€œFor black Americans, weâ€™re still in the midst of a very serious depression or recession,â€? Rep.Â  Keith Ellison (D., Mich.) told Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen when she testified before Congress Feb. 10. Black workers in Alabama may have taken the hardest hit in this recovery. The unemployment rate for African-Americans there is almost twice as highâ€”a full 5.1 percentage points higherâ€”than it was before the recession, the most elevated in the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases annual estimates of black unemployment rates, but EPIâ€™s analysis looked at data from the bureau’s Current Population Survey and Local Area Unemployment Statistics, allowing it to estimate figures for each quarter. The analysis also looked at rates for Hispanic and Asian workers, but in many states the sample size of the subgroups wasnâ€™t large enough to create an accurate estimate of their unemployment rate.
