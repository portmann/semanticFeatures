Grand Central: In Search of Lost Inflation  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hannon’s Take: In Search of Lost Inflation With a few exceptions–Brazil and Russia included–central bankers around the world confront two pressing questions: why is inflation so low, and why is it proving so difficult for us to raise it? The most recent figures available show that the annual rate of inflation across 34 developed economies was just 0.6% in March, well below the 2.0% level targeted by many central banks. In less than half of those countries, consumer prices were lower than a year earlier. Lower oil prices have played their part, but don’t explain why the weakness in inflation has been so persistent and so pronounced. They also don’t explain why most central banks, and other institutions, have consistently forecast higher inflation than has come to pass over recent years. In a research note released last week, Barclays’ economist Marvin Barth tried to find the missing inflation, the inflation that should be there if you use output gaps and other, previously reliable gauges, but isn’t. Even after accounting for demographics, deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis, technological change and globalization, Mr. Barth found that 35% of the undershoot in inflation was unexplained. So some of our inflation is missing, and we don’t know why. It’s possible that some of that inflation will reappear as mysteriously as it disappeared. It’s possible that it’s out there, somewhere, and central banks just need to be even more aggressive in their efforts to set it running. Mr. Barth, who has worked for the Bank for International Settlements, the Federal Reserve Board, and the U.S. Treasury, offers another possibility: central banks aren’t able to bring the missing inflation back. “There are increasing signs that markets, and even the general public, are questioning central banksâ€™ power to generate inflation,” he wrote. It’s probably a little premature to conclude that central banks have lost their ability to generate inflation. But the fresh wave of stimulus unleashed since the end of last year–by the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the People’s Bank of China and others–must soon yield results if that slightly scary possibility is to be dismissed. Fedâ€™s Williams: Monetary Policy Should Not Be Used to Address Financial Stability Risks, Even as Last Resort. The Federal Reserve should refrain from using interest rate policy to address risks to financial stability â€œeven as a last resort,â€? San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Thursday. Thatâ€™s because the effects of monetary policy on financial markets and excess risk taking are highly uncertain and potentially detrimental to the central bankâ€™s main objectives of stable inflation and maximum employment, he said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday in Singapore. Mr. Williams also saidÂ Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates sometime this year and start the gradual process of monetary policy normalisation.Â ”It is on the table in every meeting,” he told reporters. Fed Survey: Things are Looking Up. Americans are feeling better about their household finances but many remain on shaky ground when it comes to saving for emergency expenses and retirement, according to a Fed survey. A total of 65% of respondents in the Fedâ€™s 2014 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking said they were â€œliving comfortablyâ€? or â€œdoing okay,â€? up from 62% in the 2013 survey, the central bank said Wednesday. Some 29% in 2014 said they expected their income to be higher in the next year, up from 21% a year earlier. Prosecutor: BOE Official Received Libor Manipulation Emails. A senior Bank of England official received emails that were part of an alleged campaign to rig benchmark interest rates , according to evidence presented in a London trial Wednesday. Martin Mallett,Â who at the time was the chief currencies dealer at the Bank of England, was among a couple dozen recipients of emails sent in 2007 by brokers allegedly working at the behest of former bank traderÂ Tom Hayes.Â Mr. Mallett was fired for what the central bank described as â€œserious misconduct,â€? although the bank said his departure wasnâ€™t directly related to the currencies-rigging investigation. BOE Launches Trial Run of New Communications Policy. Later this summer, the central bank moves to a brand-new timetable for releasing rate decisions, minutes and inflation reports, which are currently sent out separately. The new communication strategy means the three major monetary-policy reports will all arrive on a single day â€” tagged â€œSuper Thursdayâ€?, by some â€” rather than spread out over two weeks. The move is aimed at eliminating the speculation that arises in the gap between each publication. Launch day is August 6 , when the bankâ€™s quarterly inflation report, its rate decision for August and the voting records of the rate-setting meeting will all come out. But to make sure the launch is a smooth process, BOE Gov. Mark Carney has introduced two practice rounds, covering the June and July rate-setting meetings. ECB Says Long Greek Talks May Hurt Other Eurozone Borrowers. Â The European Central Bank upped the pressure on Greece Thursday, suggesting that if the country didnâ€™t reach a deal with its creditors quickly, it risked worsening conditions under which some of its other embattled eurozone partners can borrow. Nowotny Says ECB Canâ€™t Give Greece Interim Funding. Â  The European Central Bank canâ€™t provide interim funding to Greece under current rules, a member of the central bankâ€™s governing council said. â€œI know that there have been some ideas floating around that we [the ECB] might give some interim financing just like that. I donâ€™t see any legal possibility for that ,â€? Ewald Nowotny, who is also Austriaâ€™s central bank governor, told CNBC television in an interview broadcast Thursday. Greece, Creditors Inch Closer to a Deal. Greece and its creditors will start drafting the final list of policy overhauls and budget cuts Athens has to implement in return for fresh bailout funds, a senior Greek government official said Wednesday, though a European Union official said negotiators still have much work to do before sealing a deal. The negotiations are expected to continue to the end of the week and talks between eurozone finance ministry officials are scheduled for Thursday. U.S. Urges Greece, Creditors to Strike Deal. U.S. Treasury chiefÂ  Jacob Lew Â on Wednesday urged Greece and its creditors to â€œdouble downâ€?Â  in their efforts to reach a deal Â to solve the nationâ€™s debt crisis, saying no one should be complacent Â aboutÂ  the risks Â to the world economy from a Greek default and possible exit from the eurozone. Speaking in London , Mr. Lew said that although eurozone is in â€œa more stable placeâ€? than it was at the height of the currency unionâ€™s debt crisis in 2012, it would be wrong to assume that a disorderly Greek exit would be painless. Bank of Canada Holds Rates Steady. Canada’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.75% Wednesday and said its outlook for a return to growth by midyear is largely unchanged , even as concerns emerge about momentum in the U.S. economy. Domestic consumption has held up relatively well amid lower prices for crude oil, the country’s top export, the Bank of Canada said in its latest policy statement. Philippine Central Bank: Policy Appropriate Despite Slower First-Quarter Growth.Â The Philippine central bank doesn’t see a need to provide additional stimulus despite the economy expanding at its slowest pace in more than three years in the first quarter, senior Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas officials said Thursday–Dow Jones Newswires. Firms Spending on Buybacks and Dividends Rather Than Investments. U.S. businesses, feeling heat from activist investors, are slashing long-term spending and returning billions of dollars to shareholders, a fundamental shift in the way they are deploying capital. Data show a broad array of companies have been plowing more cash into dividends and stock buybacks, while spending less on investments such as new factories and research and development . -2:45 p.m. EDT: Minneapolis Fedâ€™s Kocherlakota speaks on monetary policy in Helena, Mont. RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Focus on the Minutes. Federal Reserve analysts Ellen E. Meade, Nicholas A. Burk and Melanie Josselyn take a look at how the minutes of Fed meetings have evolved. â€œIt is important to note that the FOMC minutes have gotten considerably longer over time. In 2005, the first year that the minutes were released on their current, expedited schedule, the average length per meeting was just under 4200 words. By 2014, the word count had risen to around 8350, with the bulk of this rise occurring between 2005 and 2009,â€? they write. They also note an increase in the number of â€œcounting words,â€? such as â€œsomeâ€? or â€œa number ofâ€? in the minutes â€œpointing either to a greater diversity of viewpoints or to more complete reporting of the diversity of views.â€? In a Slow Economy, Donâ€™t Be Surprised by Negative Quarters. â€œData this week could show the U.S. economy shrank earlier this year, something that usually happens only during recessions,â€? writes Greg Ip in the Journal. So is the U.S. economy entering a recession? â€œThe answer is very likely no, not with all the contrary evidence out there, from buoyant stock prices to strong hiring. Yet the economyâ€™s lackluster performance speaks to deeper-seated problems. Germany and Japan have shown over the past decade how a countryâ€™s growth can easily slip into negative territory when the underlying trend is so close to zero. The U.S. is fitter than either country but, like them, is grappling with cyclical and structural headwinds that could make negative quartersâ€”and recessions, too, if policy makers arenâ€™t carefulâ€”more commonplace.” New Rules Havenâ€™t Made Banks Safer or More Productive. Writing in the Journal, Holman W. Jenkins, Jr . casts a skeptical eye on Dodd-Frank and too-big-to-fail banking rules. â€œThe key factors in 2008 were: a housing correction that alone would have been a ho-hum day in the U.S. economy, followed by a global panic due to uncertainty about how the U.S. government would treat financial institutions that held vast piles of now-illiquid but hardly worthless mortgage derivatives. A sensible postcrisis response would have focused on housing reform plus bringing order to the governmentâ€™s lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Bank managements would have kicked themselves for not recognizing the risks entailed in the above-mentioned mortgage derivatives. Instead, TBTF has been the be-all of postcrisis policy making. Banks have been shaken down for billions in settlements for selling Fannie and Freddie subprime loans they demanded. Theyâ€™ve been criminalized for paperwork shortcuts in the resulting foreclosure tsunami, though the result was no material injustice to borrowers.â€? Why Finance is Too Much of a Good Thing. Is it possible to have too much finance?â€? asks the FTâ€™s Martin Wolf . â€œHarmed by the aftermath of financial crises, enraged by bailouts of financial institutions, irritated by the generous remuneration, aghast at repeated malfeasance and infuriated by the impunity of those responsible, most ordinary people would find it all too easy to answer: yes. They are not alone. Both scholars and staff of influential international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements , agree. It is possible to have too much finance. More importantly, significant economies are in this position, among them Japan and the US.â€? -Eurozone businesses grew more optimistic about their prospects in May, an indication that they may increase investment despite the continued deadlock in negotiations between Greece and its creditors that has raised fresh questions about the coherence of the currency area -Hungary Seen Cutting Rates. Hungary is expected to cut its main interest rate by 15bp in June again, for the fourth month in a row, 14 analysts unanimously say in a Wall Street Journal poll. The central bank cut the rate Tuesday to 1.65%, a fresh record low. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. -Polish Central Bank Dismisses Governor Resignation Rumors.
