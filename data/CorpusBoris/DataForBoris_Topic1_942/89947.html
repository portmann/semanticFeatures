Economists React to the Fed’s June Statement: ‘Mixed Messages’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates on Wednesday but did signal such a move is likely in the coming months. After the Fed released its statement and projections, economists focused on the so-called dot plot, which shows officials’ outlooks for interest rates–15 of 17 said they expected to start raising them before the end of the year though the exact timing and magnitude remains uncertain. “The interest rate forecast ‘dots’ for 2015 were more dovish than expectations; while the median expectation for two hikes this year was unchanged, seven participants now see fewer than two hikes this year, up from only three participants in the March forecast round. We expect some of those participants may include the leadership, and so it does raise some questions about whether September is still the most likely date of liftoff.” –Michael Feroli, J.P. Morgan Chase “The Fed thinks the economy is more or less back on track, but policymakers still want to see a bit more data confirming that the labor market recovery is continuing. We are sticking to our view that the Fed will hike in September and again in December, but we would not be at all surprised if the hawks prove correct and rates rise three times this year. Next year, we remain of the view that accelerating wages will force the Fed to raise rates faster than policymakers, and the markets, expect.” –Ian Shepherdson,Â  Pantheon Macroeconomics “The statement was dovish, but less dovish than the April version, and it served to affirm several critical pieces of their policy bias. If the April statement reflected cautious pessimism, the changes in the growth paragraph today reflect some cautious optimism…. The overall tone is what we expected and is consistent with a Fed that is slowly positioning to make a more significant step later this year.” –Eric Green, TD Securities Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated a rate hike will come once the labor market shows improvement.

The biggest developments in June all concerned the summary economic projections and dots, both of which are helping to govern market expectations around the pace, trajectory, and peak of the coming rate hikes, but there some apparent contradictions in the language and numbers.” –Guy LeBas, Janney Montgomery Scott “On balance this is a surprisingly dovish set of forecasts from the U.S. Fed and will be positive for U.S. bonds, negative for the dollar and supportive for both U.S. and global equities as fears of an over-rapid tightening of U.S. monetary policy recede.â€? –Alastair George, Edison Investment Research “While there does seem to be a large majority on the Fed that feels that a rate increase before the end of this year is sensible, there doesn’t seem to be much consensus at all in terms of how many rate increases will be sensible before the end of this year…. So if markets were hoping of a clear definition of what the Fed might do, the dot plots still leave a lot of room for speculation.” –Carl Tannenbaum, Northern Trust “Round one of FOMC communication delivered mixed messages to markets as we had expected it to: The FOMC statement was upgraded to acknowledge better data while movements in the ‘dots’ implied a slightly more accommodative fed funds rate path. The communication released thus far supports our view that September remains the most likely single month for liftoff.” –BNP Paribas economics team “If one believes, as we do, that the Fed is getting set to hike later this year, the Fedâ€™s dot plot plays right into that thesis. The statement does use ‘moderate’ or ‘moderately’ three separate times, reinforcing the Fedâ€™s hesitancy and nervousness about the outlook. But we think they want to raise rates and the projections support that idea.” –Dan Greenhaus, BTIG The dot plot “suggests September is a little bit more of a toss-up. You now have five officials looking for one hike versus one previously and five looking for two hikes compared to seven previously. That’s certainly more dovish than I expected.” –Omair Sharif, SG Americas Securities “There were no significant changes to policy or the statement today…. We do not expect significant Fed moves in 2015, although there will be a lot more action in 2016 and 2017. The flywheel of the American economy has caught, and we believe the Fed is not going to stand in its way. The risk of year-over-year deflationary pressures to overall consumer inflation was apparent in recent months.Â  As such, we do not see the Fed raising rates before Q4 2015.” –Jason Schenker, Prestige Economics Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
