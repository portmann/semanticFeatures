Grand Central: Sign of Agreement as Greek Talks Enter Final Hour  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Greece Pitches Last-Ditch Bailout Plan as Crisis Nears Endgame Greece and its creditors appear to have taken a step toward agreement in acrimonious negotiations aimed at preventing the European Central Bank and other international lenders from pulling the plug on funding that keeps the countryâ€™s financial system afloat. Ahead of an important meeting among European leaders Monday, Greeceâ€™s government proposed a plan of tax increases and spending cuts to hit budget targets set by lenders. A European Commission official â€“ in a tweet â€“ commented favorably on the proposals as â€œa good basis for progressâ€? at Mondayâ€™s leadership summit. Markets rallied in response . Greece’s creditors appear to have an upper hand in negotiations. Depositors have been pulling funds from Greek banks at a rate of roughly 1 billion euros per day. Capital controls that could enrage the Greek public loom if negotiations collapse and the ECB cuts off emergency funding to the Greek banking system. That is putting pressure on Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to reach a deal. The rest of Europe, meanwhile, is better insulated from the fallout than before. For example yields on 10-year Spanish government bonds, at 2.16%, have risen in recent weeks but remain far below levels near 7% reached in 2012, an indication Greece could get pushed to the brink without severely damaging investor confidence in other European economies. Finance officials in Europe and elsewhere all along have believed a debt agreement that prevents default was the most likely scenario between Greece and its creditors. However they saw serious risks of an accident grown out of brinksmanship that could lead to default, capital controls and possible Greek exit from the euro currency area. As a critical week of negotiations begins, it looks like an accident might yet be avoided. Fedâ€™s Williams Sees Two Rate Hikes This Year. â€œWe are getting closer and closer to the time to raise rates,â€?Â San Francisco FedÂ PresidentÂ John WilliamsÂ told reporters following a hometown speech. â€œMy own forecast would be to raise rates two times this year , if the economy performs as I expect.â€? He added he would like to see those initial increases at 25 basis points each. As he has on many occasions, Mr. Williams cautioned that whatever happens with a policy that now has short-term rates pegged at near-zero levels will be driven by how the economy performs. Fedâ€™s Mester: Economy Could Handle Rate Rise Now. Federal Reserve Bank of ClevelandÂ PresidentÂ Loretta MesterÂ said raising rates right now wouldnâ€™t be a problem for the economy as a whole. â€œI think the economy can support a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates. However, I also understand the argument that getting a little more confirming dataâ€? before taking action â€œis reasonable as well,â€? the official told reporters after a speech in Pittsburgh on Friday. Madigan Returns to Fed. TheÂ Federal ReserveÂ on Friday announced thatÂ Brian MadiganÂ will return to the U.S. central bank as deputy director of its monetary affairs division and secretary of the policy-settingÂ Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Madigan was the director of monetary affairs and FOMC secretary from 2007 to 2010 .Â Thomas Laubach in JanuaryÂ was named the new director of the monetary affairs division,Â a role that typically is paired with the job of FOMC secretary. Mr. Laubach replacedÂ William English. Coming Rate Rise to Test U.S. Housing Market.Â The housing market could be in for a bumpy ride as mortgage rates climb.Â Â Home buyers and sellers heading into the busy summer season have been eyeing mortgage rates wondering how long the good times can last.Â For five years, mortgage rates have hovered around 50-year lows , a situation most economists believe will start to reverse if the Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates later this year.

European Stocks, Bonds Rally on Hopes of Greece Deal . New Eurozone Plan Calls for Greater Economic Cohesion. Â European officials released a plan to address flaws in the eurozoneâ€™s makeup that would see its members sacrifice more of their national sovereignty for the economic good of the entire currency bloc. IMF Pledges Support to Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund on Friday sent a message of support for Ukraineâ€™s government, which is seeking to restructure its debt while facing an economic slide and military conflict in the east. â€œI strongly believe that the authoritiesâ€™ program and the determination and boldness with which it is being implemented, despite considerable headwinds, warrant the support of the international community,â€? IMF Managing DirectorÂ Christine LagardeÂ said in a statement. On Thursday, Ukraineâ€™s parliament easily passed legislation to strengthen the countryâ€™s central bank and boost its independence, one of the conditions for IMF funding. It Takes Longer to Fill Jobs. The U.S. currently has 5.4 million job openingsâ€”the most since the current record-keeping system began in 2000â€”but the number of people getting hired has yet to fully recover from the recession, according to the Labor Department. Across the economy, the time it takes to fill jobs is lengthening. The lethargic hiring process has prolonged the already-slow pace of labor-market healing that has beset the U.S. in the six years since the recession officially ended . -1300 GMT (9 a.m. EDT): Bank of Israel releases a policy statement -8:30 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Powell speaks at The Wall Street Journalâ€™s â€œFed at a Crossroadsâ€? event in Washington -Bank of Japan releases minutes of its May 21-22 policy meeting -The Philippinesâ€™ central bank releases a policy statement -0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Lautenschlaeger speaks in Frankfurt -1100 GMT (7 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Weidmann speaks in Frankfurt -8 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Tarullo speaks on the economy and financial regulation in New York -1300 GMT (9 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Praet speaks in Frankfurt -9:45 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Powell speaks on â€œBuilding a Safer Payment Systemâ€? in Kansas City, Mo. -12:10 p.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Schembri speaks in Windsor, Ontario Global Business Cycles. Economists at the St. Louis Fed finds that business cycles tend to move in tandem around the world. That should have implications for how to react to them. Â â€œIf business cycles are largely global in nature, then domestic policy within one country will have little impact on the nationâ€™s economy, unless accompanied by global economic reform. If business cycles are largely regional in response to trade agreements, one should consider coordinating macroeconomic stabilization policies as part of the formulation of a free-trade zone,â€? they write. The Benefits of European Integration. Nauro F. Campos, Fabrizio Coricelli and Luigi Moretti use the example of Norway to argue that economic and political integration into the European Union would bring more benefits to the U.K. than simply economic integration. â€œDeep integration is estimated to bring a 6% productivity gain in the first five years, compared with shallow integration,â€? they write. Let Greece Go. Barry Ritholtz suggests on Bloomberg View that Greece should simply default. â€œThere is no easy end in sight for the absurd dance Greece has found itself stuck in with its European colleagues. It needs to start fresh,â€? he concludes. SNB’s Predicament Points to Global Failures. Writing for Bloomberg View,Â  Mohamed El-Erian argues that the Swiss National’s Bank’s struggle to rein in an overvalued franc reflects weaknesses in international economic policy making. “It is difficult for small open economies to come up with optimum policy responses when the big economic powers have opted to over-rely on their central banksâ€™ use of unconventional monetary policy rather than implement comprehensive, well-balanced policy packages,” he writes. “With the effectiveness and credibility of international financial institutions such as theÂ International Monetary FundÂ hampered by the unwillingness of big shareholders — namely the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Europe — to adopt meaningful reforms, this test isn’t being answered at the multinational level, either.” Employment Up in Texas, Down in North Dakota. Texas saw a job boom in May but North Dakota, another energy-producing state, still has a way to go to recover from the drop in oil prices . City Jobs. Employment in just over half of U.S. metropolitan areas has surpassed prerecession levels. Canada Retail Sales Drop.
