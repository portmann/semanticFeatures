ECB’s Mersch Downplays Danger From European Government Bond Yields Rise - Real Time Economics - WSJ FRANKFURT–European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch on Monday downplayed the danger posed by the recent rise in government bond yields in Europe, saying they reflect desirable outcomes such as a rise in inflation expectations and increased optimism about economic growth. Speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, Mr. Mersch said it isn’t the ECB’s job to set asset prices in financial markets. “Rising rates either mean that inflation expectations rise or that growth expectations rise. We like both,” Mr. Mersch said. His comments came amid recent volatile swings in bond prices that have pushed German yields sharply higher, though still quite low by historical standards. Last week, the 10-year German bond yield hit its highest level, 0.99%, since September after ECB President Mario Draghi said financial markets would have to become accustomed to bouts of volatility given the ultra-low level of interest rates. “When markets have gotten on the wrong track we’re not in charge of stopping them. When the markets correct, it’s a correction. In that case you can’t tell the central bank that it should have prevented it,” Mr. Mersch said. “The central bank is in charge of price stability, not in charge of price formation in the markets,” he said. The rise in bond yields has come amid signs that consumer prices in the eurozone are rising after a four-month string of contractions in late 2014 and early this year. Annual inflation was 0.3% in May, and although that is well below the ECB’s target of just below 2% it was up from a 0.6% annual fall in prices in January. Meanwhile, economic activity has improved modestly in the 19-member eurozone after a pair of recessions rocked the currency zone since 2009.
