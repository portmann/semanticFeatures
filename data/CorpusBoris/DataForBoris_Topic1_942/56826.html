Fed’s Dudley: Markets Shouldn’t Be Surprised When Fed Hikes Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Tuesday markets shouldn’t be surprised when the U.S. central bank gets around to raising short-term interest rates. The conditions that will determine the timing of the Fed raising rates from their current near-zero levels are “well specified” and “market participants should be able to think right along with policymakers, adjusting their views about the prospects for normalization in response to the incoming data,” Mr. Dudley said in the text of a speech to be delivered in Zurich. “This implies that liftoff should not be a big surprise when it finally occurs, which should help mitigate the degree of market turbulence engendered by lift-off,” Mr. Dudley said. The central banker, who also serves as vice-chairman of the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, also reiterated that he can give no firm guidance about when rates will go up. In a late April speech the official said that “hopefully” that can happen this year, but on Tuesday he explained that when it comes to the boost in borrowing costs, “I don’t know when this will occur.” Mr. Dudley explained “the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves. Since the economic outlook is uncertain, this means the timing of liftoff must also be uncertain.” Mr. Dudley’s comments were made before a gathering called the 6th High Level Conference on the International Monetary System. The official spoke as policymakers have continued to drive home the point that a rate rise could happen at any Fed meeting over the course of this year. That said, there remains considerable uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy in the wake of data showing a weak start to the year. Many in markets believe the Fed could raise rates in the late summer or early fall. Speaking on CNBC Monday, San Francisco Fed leader John Williams, who also holds a voting role on the FOMC and is widely viewed as a close ally of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen , drove home the point that the Fed likely won’t be telling markets in advance about rate rises. He told the television channel the Fed “needs to get out of this business of telegraphing our decisions,” adding markets simply need to get used to the uncertainty. Mr. Williams said “it’s healthy for future actions to be uncertain because future conditions can change.” In his speech, Mr. Dudley reiterated that for the Fed to raise rates, it needs to see continued improvement in the job market and be “reasonably confident” weak inflation will move back up to its 2% price goal. If the Fed sees those things, it can raise rates, the official said. Mr. Dudley spent much of his address repeating points made in other recent speeches about the impact of Fed policy changes on the rest of the world. He reiterated that while the Fed has to make policy with the U.S. economy in mind, “we are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.” Even as Mr. Dudley expects the market to be unsurprised by a move higher in rates, “I think it would be naive not to expect some impact” in markets. “Our monetary policy actions, though, often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind,” he said. Higher borrowing costs in the U.S. ” will have implications for global capital flows, foreign exchange valuation and financial asset prices even if it is mostly anticipated when it occurs.” Mr. Dudley said now-completed Fed bond buying stimulus efforts have affected bond prices. When it comes to rate rises and their effect on markets, “we should be humble” because of the influence of these unconventional strategies, he said.
