Grand Central: Fed Confronts an Economy Plagued by Mismeasurement - Real Time Economics - WSJ Yellen: Fed on Track to Raise Rates This Year Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images A note from Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius this weekend touches on a theme that seems to be getting a lot of play of late in the world of central banking: Mismeasurement. Do we really know the world economists are trying to describe to us on a daily basis? And if we donâ€™t, are central bankers in any position to feed this world appropriate amounts of money and interest? Goldmanâ€™s note raises questions about measurement of productivity, growth and inflation. â€œStructural changes in the US economy may have resulted in a statistical understatement of real (economic) growth,â€? Mr. Hatzius argues. The data, he says, might not be picking up changes in the economy resulting from the rapid spread of advanced software and digital content. Inflation statistics, moreover, might not grasp the leaps in quality of, say, the camera on your iPhone. My camera, for instance, can capture my dog catching a ball in slow motion, which is very cool and something Iâ€™ve never been able to do before. Mr. Hatzius argues inflation, growth and productivity statistics have been understated because the data donâ€™t pick up the consequences of this technological change. â€œConfident pronouncements that the standard of living is growing much more slowly than in the past should be taken with a grain of salt,â€? he says. Mr. Hatzius, often a dove when it comes to monetary policy, adds further that overstated inflation means the Fed can keep interest rates low. In other corners right now, economists are debating whether seasonal adjustments in data tend to bias down growth estimates for the first quarter. In addition â€“ in the search for better measures of growth — San Francisco Fed President John Williams Â and economists at the Philadelphia Fed are touting a new measure of output called â€œGDP Plus,â€? which tracks not just growth in output of goods and services, but also the incomes Americans earn from that output. Given the doubts about growth and productivity statistics in particular, in can be argued â€“ and I suspect it will be among Fed officials in the months ahead â€“ that the central bank needs to be most focused right now on what is its congressionally required mandate. That is not growth. It is inflation and employment. Is inflation rising at the modest pace officials want and the job market improving? On this front, the data are not all that discouraging. The consumer price index, released by the Labor Department Friday, showed some signs of pickup. Meantime the jobless rate, at 5.4% in April, continues to fall and hiring continues. In a world where there is much they donâ€™t know, that set of facts keeps Fed officials hopeful they are getting the economy back to something theyâ€™d like to call normal. And that means they remain inclined to move interest rates away from the very abnormal level of zero. Yellen: Fed on Track to Raise Rates This Year. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Friday the central bank will likely proceed slowly and cautiously because the job market hasnâ€™t fully healed, inflation is low and growth has again disappointed. It could be â€œseveral years,â€? she said, before the federal funds rate is back at a level the Fed considers to be normal in the long-run. Fedâ€™s Fischer Sees Short-Term Rate at 3.25%-4% in Three to Four Years. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Monday the central bank expects to follow a â€œgradual and relatively slowâ€? trajectory of short-term interest rate increases over the next three to four years to bring borrowing costs back to â€œnormalâ€? levels. He said Fed economists expect the rate will reach from 3.25% to 4% in three to four years. Fedâ€™s Mester: Monetary Policy Is Second-Line Defense Against Bubbles. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Monday U.S. officials need to be aware of the impact ultra-low rates are having on the banking sector . She made her remarks in a speech at a conference in Reykjavik, Iceland, in which she did not comment on the outlook for interest rates or the economy. ECBâ€™s Draghi, Fedâ€™s Fischer Differ at ECB Conference. Top officials of the worldâ€™s two largest central banks on Saturday offered differing views regarding the role they should play in pushing for government economic overhauls, highlighting the diverging paths of major economies and the challenges central bankers face in achieving their inflation objectives. In a panel discussion, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi defended his stepped up calls for economic reforms in Europe. In contrast, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer urged a more cautious approach, though he noted that the U.S. economy would benefit from greater infrastructure spending. Speaking on the same panel, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said monetary policy can make it easier for governments to introduce reforms to make their economies more flexible. ECB Error Spurs Questions About Policy Disclosures. A European Central Bank snafu last week that meant one of its officials gave market-moving information to a private audience including major hedge funds hours before it was made public is raising broader concerns about European policy makersâ€™ behind-closed-doors meetings. ECB’s Visco Says Greece Uncertainly May Be Destabilizing.Â European Central Bank governing council member Ignazio Visco warned on Tuesday that uncertainty over the outcome of Greek debt negotiations is fuelling “serious tensions” that may prove to be “destabilizing” for the eurozone–Dow Jones Newswires. Bank of England Fesses Up to EU Exit Study. The Bank of England is drawing up plans to examine the effect on Britainâ€™s financial sector of a possible U.K. exit from the European Union, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday–citing an email accidentally sent to one of its editors by a BOE official. The newspaper said a taskforce led by BOE deputy governor Jon Cunliffe will look into the economic and financial implications for the U.K. if the nation votes to leave the EU in a referendum due to take place before 2017. BOE’s Carney expects U.K. to close its output gap in next year. The U.K. economy should close its economic output gap within the next year , Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney said Friday, adding that much of the recent weakness in inflation is due to food and energy prices. BOE Official: Banks May Need to Maintain Extra Capital. Â A top Bank of England official said Tuesday the central bank may soon need to ask banks to maintain thicker cushions of capital. Martin Taylor, a former banker who sits on the BOEâ€™s Financial Policy Committee, which safeguards financial stability, said the U.K. may be nearing that point in the economic cycle when capital requirements need to be nudged up . IMF Calls on Bank of Japan to Consider More Easing. The Bank of Japan should stand ready to implement further easing to achieve its elusive inflation goal, the International Monetary Fund said Friday, even as positive economic data and a rallying stock market have generated cautious optimism among Japanese policy makers. In a blunt message, the IMF said that the central bankâ€™s radical easing policy so far has failed to bring a â€œdesired regime shiftâ€? toward 2% inflation. Instead, it said, prices have been stuck in a 1% range in recent months. IMF Official Says Chinese Yuan No Longer Undervalued. Chinaâ€™s currency is no longer undervalued , International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said Tuesday.

Bank of Israel Leaves Policy on Hold. Israelâ€™s central bank left its benchmark interest rate for June unchanged at its record low level of 0.1%, where it has been since March. The central bank said monthly increases in inflation in march and April erased the need for further rate cuts, even though annual inflation remained negative in April.â€”Dow Jones Newswires. Presidential candidates are not talking about the lessons to be drawn from the last recession and how to avoid the next.Â  A stretch of gloomy economic news , deeper and more prolonged than the one weâ€™ve had lately, might change that. For now, most of the 2016 economicÂ chatter has focused onÂ  reviving economic mobility , reducing poverty, buttressing the middle class and combating yawning income inequality. Less attention is being paid, on the campaign trail anyway, to worries that something is askew in the U.S. economy that is keeping growth from topping 3%, as it did during each of the three previous recoveries . -1630 GMT (12:30 p.m. EDT): Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on the Federal Reserve and the global economy in Tel Aviv, Israel -7:10 p.m. EDT: Richmond Fedâ€™s Lacker speaks on financial stability in Baton Rouge, La. -ECBâ€™s Hansson speaks in the Estonian parliament -Bank of Japan releases minutes of its April 30 policy meeting -0130 GMT (9:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday): BOJâ€™s Iwata speaks in Sapporo, Japan -0900 GMT (5 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Nowotny speaks in Vienna, Austria -2:20 a.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks in Singapore -1000 GMT (6 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Mersch speaks in Sofia, Bulgaria -1045 GMT (6:45 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Weidmann and Germanyâ€™s Schaeuble speak in Dresden, Germany -ECBâ€™s Constancio and Linde speak in Barcelona, Spain RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  How does Canada Avoid Banking Panics? In a presentation this month for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Columbia University economist Charles Calomiris explained why the United States has suffered 12 financial crises since 1840 while Canada has suffered none, even though banking constitutes a larger share of Canadaâ€™s economy. He concludes that the U.S. unit banking system, which encourages smaller banks, is partly to blame, as are regulatory policies in the U.S. such as deposit insurance that have made banks and their customers â€œoverconfident.â€? So whatâ€™s behind the U.S. model? â€œThe answers lie in the political institutions and special interests that developed and gained influence in our country over history,â€? according to a summary provided by the Atlanta Fed. How does Reducing Inequality Help Growth? The Journalâ€™s Greg Ip takes a look at a new study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that suggests that governments can increase growth by implementing policies that close the income gap. â€œItâ€™s an intriguing finding, but one with a caveat. The study is better at showing that inequality hurts growth than at explaining why. That means policy makers who want to use taxes and social spending to close the income gap cannot assume theyâ€™ll help the economy in the process.â€? How Credit Ratings Agencies React. Carmen Broto and Luis Molina , both economists and the Bank of Spain, question ratings agencies in a post on Voxeu. â€œCredit ratings agencies overreact in downgrading countries credit ratings during times of economic crisis and instability and underreact when upgrading during calmer times,â€? they write. â€œThis is bad news for policymakers who think that strong economic performance will get them back the credit rating they once took for granted.â€?Â  U.S. consumer prices rose for the third straight month in April. The consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% Â in April from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices climbed 0.3%, the largest increase since January 2013 . Energy Prices and the Dollar Can Affect Core Inflation. Although excluded from core inflation, energy prices have played a role in keeping it muted by lowering manufacturing and shipping costs. Tweaks Could Make First-Quarter Growth Look Better. TheÂ Commerce DepartmentÂ said Friday said it is planning aÂ  series of steps to smooth out statistical quirks Â that may be affecting quarterly gross domestic product data. The move could make first (and fourth) quarters of the year a little less bad and the rest of the year a little less good. Former Rep.Â  Ron Paul Â is warning in television commercials of a calamitous U.S. financial crisis â€œinfinitely worse than the crisis of 2008â€? that could bring civil unrest and a stock market collapse . Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said Tuesday French banks would not be at risk if Greece exited the eurozone. Â A few years ago, the risks for French banks would have been greater because of their exposure to interbank lending and Greece’s sovereign debt, said Mr. Noyer, who is also a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council. Peru central bank president Julio Velarde says the monetary authority will maintain its expansionary monetary policy but he adds the central bank wonâ€™t hesitate to increase interest rates if inflation picks up. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. Africaâ€™s fitful and uneven economic growth will gain momentum this year and next, three prominent organizations said in a joint report released on Monday.
