Fed’s Evans: Don’t Raise Rates Until Early 2016 - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago leader Charles Evans repeated on Monday his belief that raising rates this year would be a bad idea, especially in the wake of data showing a weak start to the year amid persistently weak levels of inflation. “Economic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path, which, on its own, would support a rate hike soon,” Mr. Evans said. “However, the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation that they are indeed a transitory aberration,” the official said. That uncertain outlook, coupled with very low levels of inflation and the expectation it will only slowly rise over time, means “it likely will not be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate until sometime in early 2016.” “There is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to, and no preset script to follow, other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides,” Mr. Evans said. “I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely,” he said. Mr. Evans’ comments come from the text of a speech to be delivered in Columbus, Indiana, before the Columbus Economic Development Board. The official holds a voting role on the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Evans’ remarks Monday were his first since last week’s FOMC meeting. Then, officials held rates steady at near zero levels and continued to say a rate rise will come when the data supports such an action. The meeting came in the wake of data showing very weak levels of growth in the first quarter. While Fed officials believe the trouble will prove transitory, it’s created newfound uncertainty for the economic outlook. For many in markets, an expected rate rise is being pushed back from early summer until later in the year. On Friday, the leaders of the Cleveland and San Francisco Fed banks said they were not yet willing to change their view that growth should be solid this year. They also both said that rate rises remain on the table at all Fed meetings this year. Mr. Evans, while optimistic about the outlook, has long held one of the most dovish outlooks for rate policy. Only one other official, Narayana Kocherlakota at the Minneapolis Fed, has also argued in favor of refraining from rate rises until next year. As he has said in the past, inflation that’s fallen well short of the Fed’s 2% target joined with a labor market that still has more healing to do, underscores Mr. Evans desire to hold steady on rates longer than his colleagues. That fact that inflation has been below the Fed’s 2% target for an extended period is telling, Mr. Evans said. “One could argue that we currently do not have enough policy accommodation in place,” because “if policy truly were highly accommodative, we’d be getting to our inflation target sooner,” he said. The official believes the Fed won’t get desired levels of inflation until 2018. The strong dollar and the sharp drop in oil prices have created additional risk inflation will struggle to get back to the Fed’s target, he said. Still, Mr. Evans was generally upbeat on growth. Despite the ugly first quarter, he said he sees growth averaging 2.5% to 3% over the next several years. That should keep average monthly job gains over 200,000.
