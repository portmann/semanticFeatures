Grand Central: Memories of 2013 â€˜Taper Tantrumâ€™ Return  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have risen from below 2% in April to 2.37% of late, a movement that is sparking talk in investment circles of a repeat of the â€œtaper tantrumâ€? of 2013. Back then, yields shot up, stock prices tumbled and emerging markets convulsed when Federal Reserve officials broached publicly the idea of ending the bond buying program known as quantitative easing. The market volatility had real economic consequences â€“ slowing a fragile U.S. housing recovery. But this doesnâ€™t quite feel like a repeat of that episode just yet. Back in 2013, a fundamental problem was that the market misread the Fedâ€™s plans for its bond purchases. Fed officials were eying an exit from the program at a time when some investors were talking about â€œQE-infinity,â€? the idea that bond buying might go on forever and ever. The market move was about investors getting their expectations in line with the central bankâ€™s intentions. The latest move appears driven by stronger economic data and not a fundamental reassessment of the Fedâ€™s plans. Fridayâ€™s jobs report, which showed robust hiring in May, in addition to some good economic news on U.S. car sales and trade, have helped to wash away fears that the U.S. economy has lost momentum. This does affect market expectations for Fed policy; a Fed increase in short-term interest rates in September now looks more likely than it did a few weeks ago. But that shift in expectations is driven by economic data and not a misreading of the central bankâ€™s game plan. That ought to make this move easier for investors and the economy to digest. As pointed out in a research note by Krishna Guha, vice chairman of the research group Evercore ISI, this episode also hasnâ€™t been accompanied by the sharp stock market declines that characterized the 2013 tantrum. Itâ€™s also worth repeating that 2.37% is still an awfully low yield for a 10-year Treasury note in an economy in which the central bank wants 2% inflation. Investors walk away with a measly real return, a sign of the economyâ€™s longer-run torpor and the extent of cheap credit still in the financial system. None of this is to say that investors have an easy ride ahead of them. A rise in yields on German bunds has been even sharper of late â€“ climbing from near zero in late April to just under 1%. The move took place over a few days and reversed months of decline. With yields deeply suppressed â€“ like a coiled spring — by the combination of weak economic fundamentals and aggressive central bank action, the risk of sudden and destabilizing reversals in the U.S. or elsewhere still runs high. Kocherlakota to Join University of Rochester. Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota had previously announced he wouldÂ step down at the end of his termÂ on Feb. 29, 2016. TheÂ regional reserve bankÂ and theÂ universityÂ said Monday that he will become the Lionel W. McKenzie Professor of Economics effective Jan. 1, 2016 . He has been president of the Minneapolis Fed since October 2009. Harker Part of Panel that Appointed Him to Philly Fed Job â€“ Bloomberg. Patrick Harker, who takes over July 1 as president of Philadelphia Fed, was a member of the bankâ€™s board of directors — the group that would choose a successor to the retiring Charles Plosser — and was also part of the boardâ€™s search committee. That meant he helped interview and evaluate other finalists before agreeing to become a candidate himself. The details of Harkerâ€™s appointment were disclosed by the Philadelphia Fed in response to a Bloomberg inquiry. They come to light as the central bank faces increased scrutiny from lawmakers, policy analysts and some community activists over the Fedâ€™s structure and how its leadership is selected. Greece, Creditors Consider Extending Bailout. Greeceâ€™s international creditors have suggested extending the countryâ€™s bailout program until the end of March 2016, butÂ disagreements over the conditionsÂ attached to the continued support and what would happen afterward risk undermining that plan . The eurozoneâ€™s portion of Greeceâ€™s â‚¬245 billion ($272 billion) rescue program runs out at the end of June, which has raised questions over how Athens willÂ pay its debt beyond this month and remain in Europeâ€™s currency union. To ensure that Greece doesnâ€™t run out of money until the end of March, it would get access to some â‚¬10.9 billion that had been set aside under its old bailout for recapitalizing weak banks. Obama Warns Both Sides on the Need for Flexibility on Greece Deal . ECB’s Mersch: Government Bond Yields Not a Threat. European Central BankÂ executive board memberÂ Yves MerschÂ on Monday downplayed the danger posed by the recent rise in government bond yields in Europe, saying they reflect desirable outcomes such as a rise in inflation expectations and increased optimism about economic growth. Mr. Mersch said it isnâ€™t the ECBâ€™s job to set asset prices in financial markets. Nowotny: Too Early to Reverse Course. It is too early for the ECB to reverse its current monetary policy of providing extra liquidity through low interest rates and purchasing bonds, said Ewald Nowotny a member of the central bankâ€™s governing council. “It is something that we are definitely considering,” he said, speaking on a panel on financial market developments. “For the European region, it isn’t relevant yet,” he said. When the time comes to reverse the monetary policy, it will be important to do it carefully, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is proceeding with tapering, he said. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. U.K. to Unveil Financial Market Reforms. The U.K. will unveil a suite of reforms Wednesday aimed at cleaning up British financial markets after a series of scandals. The yearlong Fair and Effective Markets Reviewâ€”a joint effort between the Bank of England, the U.K. Treasury and Britainâ€™s Financial Conduct Authorityâ€”will zero in on practices such as â€œfront-runningâ€? and â€œlast-look,â€? controversial strategies that can be used by traders in a way that can disadvantage their clients, according to participants in the consultation and the bodiesâ€™ initial review document. China Inflation Eases Amid Weak Economy. Chinaâ€™s consumer inflation eased while factory prices sank in May under pressure from a slowing economy, renewing concerns about deflationary pressure in the worldâ€™s No. 2 economy. Analysts said the modest pressure on prices meant that authorities could continue efforts to bring down borrowing costs for the nationâ€™s corporate sector amid weak domestic and global demand. Financial Regulators Need to Coordinate, Bank of Canadaâ€™s Wilkins Says.Â Canada is pushing for coordination and consistency around the implementation of global financial rules to ensure strong capital flows, its central bankâ€™s second-in-command said Monday.Â  Global Regulators Propose Capital Rules for Interest-Rate Risk. The Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionÂ has proposed two options Â for how banks can set aside enough capital to better withstand shocks arising from changes in the level of interest rates. The first option would require the adoption of a mandatory global minimum capital requirement that banks in all jurisdictions should adopt.Â The second option, which would represent a toughening of the approach currently in place, is more discretionary and foresees capital provisions that would vary across different market conditions and risk-management practices and national jurisdictions. Iceland Moves Closer to Unwinding Capital Controls. Hoping to reclaim a spot on the international financial scene, Iceland has announced plans to gradually lift restrictions on capital flows in the small North Atlantic nation.The move is part of a bid to shed the pariah status that resulted from the countryâ€™s financial-crisis meltdown without endangering a fragile economic recovery and a convalescing currency. New Housing Headwinds Loom. Last decadeâ€™s housing crisis could give way to a new one in which many families lack the incomes or savings needed to buy homes, creating a surge of renters and a shortage of affordable housing. Urban Institute researchers predict that more than 3 in 4 new households this decade, and 7 of 8 in the next, will be formed by minorities. These new householdsâ€”nearly half of which will be Hispanicâ€”have lower incomes, less wealth and lower homeownership rates than the U.S. average. The upshot is that fewer than half of new households formed this decade and the next will own homes . Fed Involuntarily Widens Wealth Gap. Exacerbating Americaâ€™s already gaping wealth disparities was not the goal of Federal Reserve monetary policies undertaken in the face of a historic economic slump, but that may have been the result in some cases, according to new research from the Philadelphia Fed . â€œMonetary policy currently implemented by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks is not intended to benefit one segment of the population at the expense of another by redistributing income and wealth,â€? writes economist Makoto Nakajima in the second quarter edition of the regional central bankâ€™s Business Review. The â€œMythâ€? of Residual Seasonality. The New York Fedâ€™s Jan Groen and Patrick Russo weigh in on the debate over residual seasonality as a contributor to weakness in first quarter economic growth. Economists at the San Francisco Fed have earlier argued that â€œthere are problems with the seasonal adjustment of GDP data for the first quarter of the year,â€? the New York Fed researchers write. That view was challenged by economists at the Federal Reserve Board. Groen and Russo conclude that first quarter residual seasonality is a â€œmyth.â€? They write: â€œUnusually adverse winter weather, rather than imperfect seasonal adjustment by the [Bureau of Economic Analysis], was an important factor behind the weak first-quarter GDP data.â€? Involuntary Part-Time Work to Remain Elevated. High levels of part-time workers have long called into question how strong the job market recovery has been. The problem is, according to a paper published Monday by the San Francisco Federal Reserve , that question wonâ€™t be going away any time soon. In new research written by staffers Rob Valletta and Catherine Van Der List, the bank says the number of those forced to work part-time jobs â€œmay remain significantly aboveâ€? the levels seen before the Great Recession for some time to come. Misreading the Fed. Writing in the Journal, Benn Steil Â argues that legislation in 2006 amending the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gives the Fed’s board of governors more influence over interest rates than their regional Fed colleagues. He also argues that the board of governors is more dovish. “Fed watchers may be overestimating the pace of rate increases because theyâ€™re focusing on the views of the wrong committee,” he writes. “For now, at least, it is the more dovish board, and not the FOMC, that wields the real power over rate increases.” Donâ€™t Expect Syriza to Embrace Reform. Takis Michas writes for the Journal that hoping that Greeceâ€™s ruling party will fully implement its creditors reform demands is nothing more than a â€œchimera.â€? He writes: â€œEven if Greeceâ€™s governing Syriza party gives in to pressure and signs up for the demanded reforms, this doesnâ€™t mean that they are going to be implemented. The most likely outcome is that the reforms will be undermined by the ministers who are supposed to apply them. Then, after three or four months, the situation will once again reach crisis proportions, with Athens arguing that the program is not working and the creditors complaining that Syriza is not serious about implementing it.â€? How to Attack to the UKâ€™s Productivity â€œPuzzle.â€? Gavyn Davies in the Financial Times enumerates ways in which UK policymakers could boost productivity. Among his suggestions is using the corporate tax system to encourage more private investment. â€œThis would probably be far more effective if the Bank of England decided to run the economy â€˜a little hotâ€™ in order to raise capacity utilization and absorb any remaining underutilization of labor resources within companies,â€? he writes. â€œBut it is clear that the Monetary Policy Committee is currently split on this proposition, and may not be willing to take the risk.â€? Businesses Scale Back Plans for Hiring, Investment. TheÂ Business Roundtableâ€˜s measure of the economic outlook among chief executive officers s lipped to 81.3 in the current quarter from 90.8 in the first quarter. The Bank of Russia halted its intervention on currency markets last Friday, suspending purchases of foreign currencies as the ruble tumbled against the dollar and euro, according the central bank’s latest data. The central bank, which reports its currency intervention with a lag of two working days, put purchases on hold for the first time since May 13–Dow Jones Newswires. A revival in government spending, and a pickup in investment, was offset by a rise in imports to leave the eurozoneâ€™s growth rate unchanged in the first three months of the year, according to revised figures released Tuesday.
