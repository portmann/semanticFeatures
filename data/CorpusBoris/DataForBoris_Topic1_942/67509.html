BOE Official: Banks May Need to Maintain Extra Capital - Real Time Economics - WSJ A top Bank of England official said Tuesday the central bank may soon need to ask banks to maintain thicker cushions of capital. Martin Taylor, a former banker who sits on the BOEâ€™s Financial Policy Committee, which safeguards financial stability, said the U.K. may be nearing that point in the economic cycle when capital requirements need to be nudged up. â€œThe post-crisis narrative in Britain as elsewhere is that the recovery is in its very early stages. But itâ€™s been a long time since 2009, and this economic cycle, restrained though the recovery was at first, may wel be closer, measured in time, to its peak than its trough,â€? Mr. Taylor said, according to the text of a speech he delivered on May 22 and published by the BOE Tuesday. Mr. Taylor said it is possible that â€œweâ€™re reaching the point of the cycle where macroprudential policy should be tightened,â€? although he stressed it is hard to say where exactly in the cycle the U.K. is. He said also that the â€œopen questionâ€? for BOE policymakers is whether banks are building enough capital already, or whether they need extra prodding from regulators. Mr. Taylor was referring specifically to what are called countercyclical capital buffers, a slug of capital banks must maintain that can be raised in a boom to restrain excess credit growth and relaxed in a downturn to enable banks to lend more. At the moment in the U.K., the countercyclical capital buffer is set at zero. It isnâ€™t clear how far Mr. Taylorâ€™s view is shared by other members of the FPC. The panel tends to act consensually. Nor is it certain that economists agree the U.K. banking system may need tighter capital requirements, given still-weak lending growth, particularly to corporates. There have been concerns over real-estate lending, however. Mr. Taylorâ€™s remarks underscore central bankersâ€™ concern that years of ultra-loose monetary policy may be encouraging risky behavior in the financial system. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations will discuss such risks at a meeting in Germany this week, according to officials.
