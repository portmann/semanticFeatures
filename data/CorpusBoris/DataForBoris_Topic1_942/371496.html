U.S. Interest Rates, How Long Can They Really Stay Low? | Seeking Alpha Global Interest Rates have seen multi year lows in the last few months. In December 2015 the Federal Reserve finally raised their target for the Fed Funds rate, ending a seven year long run of near-zero interest rates. After such a long time of easy policy, the delicate matter or raising rates required some forward guidance and dot plots were born. 17 members of the FOMC anonymously provide their projections for fed funds rate along with the meeting statement. It is designed to provide some insight into how members feel rate cycle is going to proceed in the future. It is not an official policy tool but still has the world following. In September meeting minutes, the dots indicated a dovish path for rates moving forward. The median FOMC member saw rates between 0.25% and 0.5% at the end of 2015, consistent with the decision to raise rates. They then saw rates rising to between 1.25% and 1.5% at the end of 2016, and then rates rising to around 3.5% in the longer term. The new dot plot follows in largely the same path: The median FOMC member expects rates to be between 1.25% and 1.5% at the end of 2016, rising to about 3.5% in the long run. The decision in December 2015 read , given the economic outlook and the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic conditions, target rate has been increased and the policy still remains accommodative. Statement showed the members agreed on gradual hikes as long as data allowed. The dot plot showed all but three members expected funds rate to be 1.5% or lower by the end 2016 and 2.4% in 2017 compared to a 2.6% projection in September. 2016 started with a rout in equities, China triggered the risk aversion but global equity markets joined in. In January, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said , ''It was too difficult to gauge the impact on the U.S. economy from recent turmoil in financial markets and uncertainty over China, leaving policy makers undecided about what to do next.'' And the January meeting minutes showed that policy members are concerned about market events and their impact on the American economy. Today, we live in a globally interconnected world economically and one's macroeconomic outlook does depend on others. While the FED has been busy trying to raise rates, Japan and EU have been aggressively easing in a low inflation environment. The global outlook, has pushed US interest rates lower as a result along with global interest rates. Coming to March 2016, the recent Beige Book which relies on 12 regional districts, was published Wednesday by the Federal Reserve actually shows economic conditions have perked up in the U.S. According to the report, there is improvement in consumer spending, non-financial services activity, home sales, and loan demand and job growth across the country. Recent comments show they are generally relieved by signs the economy has held well in turmoil. The market has turned very dovish after the turbulence in January but it seems to me interest rate futures do not fully reflect the massive rally in commodities and equities in the last few weeks. Since December, market expectations for rate increases have shifted down; futures now price an average FED funds rate ( of 0.6% in December and 0.9% in 2017. These are well below FED projections of 1.375% and 2.375% and while there are technical reasons for the huge gap still chances or hike are down played. If the ECB is successful in pushing global rates lower today , I think it could be the perfect timing to get out of receivers in US rates. 10 year treasuries have bottomed out around 1.7000's and oil rallied about 30% in the last 1 month. Equities have picked up, as well as other commodities and pretty soon PPI numbers around the globe are likely to start to recover. This could lead to steepening in most curves, however with the central bank hiking US curve will most likely still stay relatively flat but might shift higher. Best was to take advantage is to use interest rate futures short ETFs and position for higher interest rates in the next 1-3 months. Daily 20 Year Plus Treasury Bear 3x Shares (TMW), Short Treasury Bond ETF (NYSEARCA: SHV ), Ultra Short Barclays 7-10 Year Treasury (NYSEARCA: PST ) are good choices for the strategy.
