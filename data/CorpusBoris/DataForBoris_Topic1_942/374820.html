This should prompt yet more volatility across asset classes as investors learn more about the current thinking and new reaction functions of central bankers. In Japan, we will learn if the BOJ is under pressure to ease further, like the ECB did last week, while the Fed may choose to delay further tightening until the US employment picture becomes clearer in the spring. Stocks had another positive week, rising modestly as they chased oil prices higher. Oil was helped by a report from the International Energy Agency, which stated that oil "prices may have bottomed out" given that supply appears to be decreasing. This rhymes with our view since last autumn that the sharp industry capital-expenditures collapse, together with peak Saudi and Russian oil production, would lead to a global balancing of demand and supply during 2016 and 2017. This rise in stocks also occurred despite increasing political uncertainty in the US and elsewhere as the US presidential race grows more rancorous. Meanwhile, Europe confronts the specter of a "Brexit," migration issues in Turkey and political uncertainty in Germany, Ireland and Spain. Also helping stock prices - and adding to the volatility - was the ECB's decision last week to expand monetary-policy accommodation. The decision, which contained multiple elements, seemed to confuse stock-market participants. Investors were whipsawed - initially reacting positively to the announcement, only to reconsider and sell off on euro strength and then show approval the next day. That reaction underscores a significant negative side of monetary policy: It can be confusing to investors because investors have to examine economic data through the lens of a central bank. Not only do investors need to try to forecast how a central bank will interpret and react to data, but once monetary policy action is announced, investors have to decide whether it will be positive or negative for a given asset class, also taking into account significant speculative positioning. This is particularly true for the current rate-hike cycle in the US, because the Fed has explicitly stated that the path of monetary policy will be data-dependent. This brings us to the most important event of this week - the FOMC meeting - coming a day after the other significant central bank meeting, that of the Bank of Japan. This week's Fed meeting will provide not only a likely "on hold" announcement but new FOMC forecasts and the widely followed "dot plot," as well as a press conference. So what data will the FOMC be reviewing? We know the FOMC has a dual mandate: to promote full employment within the context of price stability. And we know that when it comes to employment, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed leaders are very interested in the 19-point Labor Market Conditions Index (LMCI). This index is essentially a dynamic diffusion index, intended to provide a far more holistic view of the employment situation than can be provided by a singular metric such as the headline unemployment rate. A fuller picture of the US labor market The LMCI examines nine critical categories related to the job market - unemployment, employment, workweek, wage growth, job vacancies, hiring, layoffs, quits, and business and consumer sentiment surveys. While February non-farm payrolls were robust, focusing on the LMCI will likely yield a less positive view of the job market, which is improving but still far from a flawless recovery, particularly when it comes to wage growth. In fact, the most recent LMCI reading, which was released last week, showed a decline. A closer look at the LMCI confirms our view that the Fed is unlikely to act in March. Recall that US economic data was lackluster just a few months ago, which means the Fed will likely wait for more evidence of economic improvement. So while the April and June FOMC meetings are both possibilities for the next rate hike, March is almost certainly off the table. However, that doesn't mean the March FOMC meeting is unimportant. In fact, we'll get a lot to analyze from this meeting. Beyond the FOMC announcement, we'll be able to dive into the FOMC forecasts and "dots" for an updated view of the US economy as well as FOMC members' policy prescription. And we'll certainly get a good deal of insight into the Fed's outlook from Yellen's press conference. In short, this week promises to be an eventful one - with important implications for capital markets that will likely reverberate into the second quarter and beyond.
