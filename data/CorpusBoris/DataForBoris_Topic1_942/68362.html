BOJ Minutes Show Continued Rift Among Board Members - Real Time Economics - WSJ Debate heated up among the Bank of Japan’s policy board members in late April over the BOJ’s 2.0% inflation target and commitment to defeat deflation, highlighting a lingering rift among the members as the inflation rate has sagged to around 0%. Two years have passed since the BOJ’s historic attempt to generate inflation through a massive easing program. Views among board members appear to remain divergent, with some proposing changes to some of the language in the semiannual growth and inflation outlook, the minutes of April 30 meeting released Wednesday showed. Three board members — Takahide Kiuchi, Takehiro Sato, and Sayuri Shirai — expressed opposition to the view in the outlook report that the ambitious, long-held 2% inflation target will likely be achieved “around in the first half of fiscal 2016,” and that the inflation rate is expected to stay around there on average. The period was pushed back about six months from the previous forecast. Mr. Kiuchi proposed changing the price stability target to say the consumer inflation rate is likely to be about 0% for a while, and then accelerate “very moderately”. Mr. Sato agreed with the timing of hitting 2.0% inflation, but proposed dropping the wording “around 2.0% on average” in the following period. Ms. Shirai said the wording should be changed to say the 2.0% target would be achieved “in or around fiscal 2016?. Some members underscored the importance of a strong commitment to achieving the 2.0% inflation target in about two years, with one saying sticking to the time frame was necessary to keep up momentum in reversing the “deflationary mindset.” But others seemed skeptical, with Mr. Kiuchi saying 2.0% inflation should be achieved in the longer term.
