Fed’s Powell: Gradual Rate Increases Could Help Heal Lasting Damage From the Financial Crisis - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve remains on track to raise short-term interest rates this year, though the central bank should increase rates at a gradual pace to help the U.S. economy heal wounds left by the financial crisis, Fed governor Jerome Powell said Wednesday. “The financial crisis did significant damage to the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent and duration that cannot be fully known today,” Mr. Powell said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “And given this uncertainty, it’s even more difficult than usual to assess how much slack remains in the economy. It seems plausible that at least part of the supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.” Most Fed policy makers, including Mr. Powell, expect to begin raising interest rates in 2015 as the economy improves, though the precise timing of the first increase remains uncertain. The central bank has signaled it could raise rates as soon as June . Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed in 2012, added that “there have been times when I was uncomfortable with the direction of policy. This is not one of those times. I’m pretty well aligned with where the heart of the [policy-setting Federal Open Market] Committee is and where the chair has articulated the committee is.” There have been signs of a recent slowdown in U.S. economic growth, including a sharp deceleration in hiring during March. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley on Monday shrugged off the first-quarter weakness, saying it largely reflects “temporary factors” like harsh winter weather in the Northeast and Midwest “to a significant degree.” Mr. Powell on Wednesday offered a generally upbeat assessment of economic conditions: “We have already seen a great deal of progress in the labor market,” he said, “and I expect that progress to continue.” Despite March’s slowdown, he added, “job creation has been particularly strong over the last two years.” He added that, by the Fed’s June policy meeting, two additional months of hiring data will be available for officials to parse. The unemployment rate also has declined, though Mr. Powell noted it “probably understates the amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.” He also said he expects U.S. inflation will begin to rebound once “two transient shocks”â€”a plunge in global oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar, which makes imports cheaperâ€”begin to fade. Inflation has undershot the Fed’s 2% annual target for nearly three years, but Mr. Powell said he expects price gains will rise toward that goal “over time” as the economy improves. Mr. Powell said he would “absolutely” be comfortable voting to raise rates with core inflation at current levels. Prices excluding food and energy rose 1.4% in February from a year earlier, as measured by the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index . “The test is, reasonable confidence that inflation will move to that 2% objective over the medium term,” he said, adding, “You cannot wait until you see the goalposts coming, because monetary policy works with these long lags. You’ve got to start well before you actually hit the goal.” A number of top officials have signaled that the central bank, once it begins to raise interest rates, will probably move slowly on tightening policy. Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month that the Fed would likely take a “gradualist approach” in the years ahead. Mr. Powell on Wednesday said he expects rates will rise “fairly gradually” in part because of “the unusually high level of uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.” The financial crisis dealt substantial damage to the supply side of the economy, he said, and much of it may prove permanent. “Nonetheless, it seems plausible that at least part of the damage can be reversed,” he said. “As business confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with an extended spell of unemployment. A stronger job market and rising wages may encourage more potential workers to join or rejoin the labor force. Over a longer period, stronger demand will produce higher capital investment, which will drive higher productivity.” Most of the policies needed to promote that healing are outside the Fed’s responsibility, Mr. Powell said, but the central bank “has a role to play” by supporting the expansion so long as inflation remains in check. A gradual increase in rates, he said, “would, among other benefits, give our economy the best chance to make up lost ground.” Dudley: Rate-Rise Timing Data-Dependent, Uncertain in Nature For Fed, Question of Whether Jobs Weakness Will Continue or Prove an Aberration Grand Central: A Roadmap to the Fedâ€™s Thinking on the Jobs Report Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
