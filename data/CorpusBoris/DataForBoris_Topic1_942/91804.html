Grand Central: Bank of Japan–New Transparency, Old Questions - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of Japan is promising greater transparency in communicating with markets. Yet it has left considerable uncertainty over its thinking on some big questions shaping future policy. In particular: whether officials are comfortable with more yen weakness, and whether they’re worried about the central bank’s growing role underwriting the government’s massive borrowing binge. New transparency measures were the main news from Friday’s policy meeting, where officials, as expected, kept their asset-buying program intact, and maintained their fairly upbeat assessment of Japan’s economic recovery. Specifically, the central bank announced it would, starting next year, offer an economic outlook report four times a year, up from the current two. And it will illustrate those reports with a souped-up version of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s famous forecast “dot plots.” The Fed issues a graph with a dot showing the inflation forecast of each member. The BOJ dots will show not just the forecasts, but each member’s assessment of whether risks are tilted up, down, or are evenly balanced. The BOJ will also cut the number of policy meetings from the current 14 to eight — in line with the Fed, the European Central Bank, and a recent move by the Bank of England. It will start issuing meeting summaries a week after each deliberation, as well as continuing the more detailed minutes a few weeks later. The announcement followed a particularly confusing couple of weeks for BOJ market communication. Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda pushed the yen up sharply last week , then down again this week, with contradictory suggestions to parliament on whether he did or didnâ€™t want the Japanese currency to weaken further. Friday, Mr. Kuroda resumed his usual form of skillfully avoiding sending any signals on yen value. The BOJ will face more difficult questions, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next week releases a long-promised blueprint to balance the budget by 2020 and rein in Japan’s mammoth debt. The plan will go light on the tax hikes and spending cuts Mr. Kuroda favors, and rely on unrealistically rosy growth assumptions. Mr. Abe can only avoid painful fiscal discipline and keep borrowing heavily because Mr. Kuroda, with his radical stimulus, is effectively buying all government bonds being issued. What’s unclear is whether Mr. Abe’s lack of fiscal discipline will make Mr. Kuroda and his colleagues uneasy continuing — or, if needed, expanding — their easy money policy. That’s not something more frequent forecasts and complex dots will answer. Goldman Sachs: No Fed Rate Hike Until December. The investment bank now sees the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the first time in nine years at its final meeting of 2015 , a revision from its earlier prediction that the long-awaited rate liftoff would come in September. â€œIn large part this reflects the fact that seven FOMC participants are now projecting zero or one rate hike this year, a group that we believe includes Fed ChairÂ Janet Yellen,â€? said Goldman economist Jan Hatzius. That number was three at the Fedâ€™s March meeting. Former AIG Chief Asks Court to Revive Claims. FormerÂ American International GroupÂ Inc.Â Chief Executive Maurice R. â€œHankâ€? Greenberg will appeal not just the parts of a federal court ruling that didnâ€™t go in his favor, but is seeking to revive claims that had been dismissed in 2013 , his legal team said in a filing Thursday. The notice of appeal comes three days after the U.S. Court of Federal ClaimsÂ ruled in favor ofÂ Mr. Greenberg Â  and other shareholders in the class-action suit that the government had violated the law in demanding a 79.9% equity stake in AIG in its 2008 bailout of the financial-services conglomerate. Fed Tweaks Calculation Procedure for Key Interest-Rate Tool. The Fed announced on Thursday it will tweak the payments calculation for the interest on excess reserves rate, which it plans to use when the time comes to tighten credit and raise the benchmark federal-funds rate. The new rule takes effect July 23, the week before the next policy meeting, but the Fed doesnâ€™t want anyone to read too much into the timing. The change is â€œa matter of prudent planning and has no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy,â€? it said in a statement. â€“Dow Jones Newswires. Â Eurozone Summit Called After Ministers Fail to Reach Bailout Deal. Â Eurozone leaders will try to clinch a deal on Greeceâ€™s flailing bailout at a hastily called crisis summit Monday, after finance ministers failed again to bridge the gap between Athens and its lenders.Â The summitâ€”eight days before Greeceâ€™s eurozone rescue runs outâ€”will be one of the last chances to avert the specter of further economic meltdown for Greece and a messy exit from the eurozone.Â  IMF: Eurozone Risks Manageable. The consequences of a possible default by Greece on its debts, or its subsequent exit from the eurozone, appear manageable for the currency area as whole, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday. In its annual appraisal of the eurozone economy, the Fund said the European Central Bankâ€™s recently launched program of government bond purchases and the eurozoneâ€™s rescue funds would help ensure that any â€œmarket contagionâ€? is â€œmuch reduced.â€? Pimco Chief Thinks Europe Will Be â€˜Fineâ€™ BOJ Kuroda Turns Cautious About Commenting on Yen. Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda turned cautious about commenting on the foreign exchange market on Friday after recent remarks he made jolted the market, leaving his views vague and stressing that the market should move stably by reflecting economic fundamentals. BOJ to Provide Price, Growth Information More Often. The Bank of Japan said Friday it would provide more information, more often on the price and growth views of its policy-setting members to help improve public understanding of its efforts to tackle deflation. After leaving its main policy unchanged at its latest board meeting, the central bank also said it would hold fewer policy-fixing meetings, bringing it in line with other major central banks. Bank of England Staff Go Underground. The subway station underneath the Bank of England was once voted the worst in London. Hot, crowded and labyrinthine, the underground station called Bank is the final stop on the daily commute for dozens of the central bankâ€™s staff. Bank Underground is the title of a new blog launched on Friday by the BOE, where staffers can post research and share views , including those that challenge â€œprevailing policy orthodoxies,â€? according to the central bank. Timing Dilemma for Bank of Mexico. Mexican central bankers agreed early this month to leave interest rates unchangedÂ while keeping a close watch for any interest-rate action by the U.S. Federal Reserve that could cause the peso to weaken and put upward pressure on consumer prices. The five-member board of governors voted unanimously on June 4 to keep the overnight lending rate target at a record-low 3%, according to minutes of the meeting published Thursday. An Invitation. Federal Reserve officials are considering an interest rate increase for the first time in nearly a decade, but they face a complicated economic backdrop.

The flow of cash into and out of China is turning increasingly volatileâ€”a headache for Beijing as it loosens control of its vast capital markets. In the three weeks ended June 3, $7.3 billion rushed into Chinaâ€™s stock and bond markets, the largest three-week inflow in over a decade, according to EPFR Global. But over the next week nearly the same amountâ€”$6.8 billionâ€”was pulled out as global fund managers took fright at wild swings in the Shanghai benchmark index . -11:40 a.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks in San Francisco Changes in Exchange Rates. In the long run, write the Dallas Fedâ€™s Kuhu Parasrampuria and Michael Sposi, the real exchange rate of the euro and the yen will be guided by economic fundamentals. â€œRecent exchange rate movements in the euro area and Japan are consistent with a longer-run return toward levels consistent with each areaâ€™s currency fundamentals. As a result, firms in the euro area and Japan should eventually regain competitiveness on the international market,â€? they write. Why Grexit Could Help Britain. Jeremy Warner in the Daily Telegraph writes that Britain could benefit should the Greek talks fail. â€œThere are two reasons for this silver-lining view of a Greek exit. The first is that it would almost certainly make Europe more accommodating in its negotiations with Britain over the terms ofÂ  t he forthcoming in/out referendum,â€? he writes. â€œThe second reason for thinking Grexit might work in Britainâ€™s favour is that it would be a severe setback, or even fatal blow, to the EUâ€™s whole mission statement of â€œever closer union.â€? Assessing the BRICS. On Project Syndicate, Michael J. Boskin looks at the recent stumbles in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). â€œThe BRICS are â€“ and always have been â€“ subject to the same forces as other economies. But, although they have increased their dependence on market forces, their governments continue to dictate too many major economic decisions, increasing the risk of imbalances or even crises. Their ability to develop institutions that support greater economic freedom, with more reliance on market competition and less on government, will likely be the main determinant of their long-term success.â€? Consumer Prices Rise. TheÂ consumer-price index, which reflects what Americans pay for everything from cars to haircuts, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in May from a month earlier. Jobless Claims Down. I nitial claims for unemployment benefits, a measure of layoffs across the U.S., decreased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 in the week ended June 13. Dutch Banking Industry Too Large. The Dutch banking industry, dominated by just a few large banks, needs to become more diverse, more competitive and smaller than it is now, the Dutch central bank said Thursday. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. Thailand’s central bank has revised its projections for several key indicators, indicating it has become more pessimistic about the country’s economic outlook. Â The Bank of Thailand announced Friday that it has revised downward its 2015 gross domestic product growth projection to 3.0% from an earlier forecast of 3.8%, “as a result of weaker-than-expected export growth while inflation is projected to decrease on the back of lower cost and demand pressure.”–Dow Jones Newswires.
