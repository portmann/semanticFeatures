Mr Market Shifts The Dot Plots And Their Plotters | Seeking Alpha Controversy now surrounds the utility of the forward curve as an economic indicator. Many Fed governors and presidents have been traumatized by the recent market volatility. James Bullard signals a new significant Fed emphasis on undershooting the inflation target. The latest U.S. data shows the economy slowing just as inflation expectations start to pick up. The global central bank assault on the time value of money, through QE, the zero bound and recently negative interest rates has finally taken its toll on the yield curve as the fundamental economic forecasting tool. Bond traders and analysts are dropping the yield curve and implied forward curve from their list of key signals to predict future economic activity. Is this all part of the central bankers' cunning plan? Will Mr. Market fight back? The last report suggested that negative U.S. interest rates could be created by fiat as a result of global flows away from negative interest rate currency zones. This flow pattern has now been picked up in the financial media. To restore some degree of faith in the Fed at least, Bill Dudley stated that negative interest rates in America are premature at this point in time. His view is a unilateral one, looking only at the potential for the Fed to get the legal authority to coincide with the weak economic conditions required. He ignores the fact that, if other global benchmark rates are negative, U.S. interest rates may have a tendency to converge upon them through fund flows. It is currently a battle between positive U.S. benchmarks and falling negative global ones. The U.S. Dollar is taking the strain, but its recent weakening suggests that the negative global yield tractor beam may now be pulling U.S. interest rates lower. The last report observed that the psychological scars of the recent market volatility on the Fed had prompted a preference to put further tightening on hold until the dust and the markets have settled. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick T. Harker became another casualty. Harker appears to be more damaged than some of his colleagues, since he advocates waiting until the oil-price-induced deflation has totally vanished before embarking on more tightening. This could be a long wait. Harker was joined on the growing casualty list by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. Rosengren's trauma is not as extreme as Harker's, as he allegedly only sees that there may need to be a small pause in the tightening process. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan is also deeply traumatized; and is open to the Fed staying on hold for an extended period. The duration of this extended period seems to run into 2017, as he also stated that the global softness will finally balance oil supply and demand by 2017. Evidently, Kaplan is looking through the prism of the negative blowback on the Texan economy through oil prices. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester is relatively un-traumatized in comparison with Harker, Kaplan and Rosengren. She is willing to compromise with her traumatized colleagues and put rate hikes on hold, in order to contribute to the image of consensus, yet she has faith that the U.S. economy will come through this soft patch. Kansas Fed President Esther George didn't even get a scratch from the latest volatility; and is confidently looking forward to more rate hikes this year. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart is taking a practical approach to the inevitable. He is more focused on the pain to come, for the banking sector, as liquidity is tightened by the Fed. Conventional wisdom has it that banks become more profitable as interest rates rise, because their margins expand. On the contrary Lockhart sees this potential for profits being curbed by losses on existing loans made, especially in commercial real estate. Lockhart is therefore focusing on the widening of credit spreads and the negative economic impacts that they will have on borrowers. He has stopped short of saying that the Fed must remain on hold in light of this risk. however. Fed Governor Lael Brainard's trauma has inspired her to take on a new mission. She recognizes that the FOMC may be forced to stay on hold because of blowback from the global economy. In consequence, she advocates reaching out to other central banks and policy makers in order to coordinate a response to the global slowdown. Brainard's response is interesting because it comes in the wake of the IMF's call for a globally coordinated policy response. Brainard is evidently the Fed official who advocates such a response, so it can be seen that part of her job is to act as the focal point for such coordination. Bill Dudley may also be part of this global outreach. At G20 Shanghai he gave a joint press conference with PBoC Deputy Governor Chen Yulu. Because he was in the company of the putative challengers to America's global leadership, he could not really show his scars. He was however able to opine that he is "somewhat less confident" in hitting the 2% inflation target. San Francisco Fed President John Williams gave the key signal of how things will change at the March FOMC, in light of the recent trauma. According to him there "could be a tweak here or there" in the Dot Plots. The FOMC will therefore use the recent market headwinds as an opportunity to scale back their predictions for growth and inflation, so as to move more into alignment with the consensus opinion in the markets. This is a necessary precursor to putting policy justifiably on hold. The release of the minutes of the last FOMC meeting showed how deep and contagious the respective scars and trauma are for some members. The minutes suggest that the FOMC is on hold in March and for some time thereafter until global market and economic confidence returns. In the previous report entitled "FOMC Cognitive Bias: Unanimous Is Consensus Until Someone Disagrees," Janet Yellen's problem of presenting the impression of FOMC unanimity to normalize interest rates was discussed, in light of the weakening economic data. The knee jerk reactions of some Fed officials contrasts strongly with others who have reinforced their convictions to press on with rate hikes during this period of volatility. Yellen's unanimous vote is under threat. The one Fed president who can be relied upon to signal a change in consensus is James Bullard. He chose a rather arcane way of indicating this change of consensus in a recent interview. Bullard has a problem with the word "were" in the Fed's new symmetrical rhetoric on its inflation mandate. According to him , "were" is too historic especially since there have been periods in the past when the target has been missed from both sides and the FOMC has never said that it was concerned. What can therefore be inferred, from what Bullard and the FOMC are not saying, is that in fact they are extremely concerned about undershooting the inflation target. The statement should therefore be interpreted as follows in its current context: The implications of this change in rhetoric are profound. Normalization is apparently off the table and the next move is an easing of monetary policy. So profound are the implications that Bullard then felt the need to reiterate his position for the record. Bullard never opines intellectually without reference to academic collateral forensic evidence. This evidence seems to have been provided by economists Timothy Hills, Taisuke Nakata and Sebastian Schmidt, who appear eager to advance their reputations and careers by providing the smoking gun required by Bullard. According to their thesis , there is now tangible evidence that the U.S. economy has developed an innate deflationary bias at the zero bound. Inflation is therefore consistently expected to undershoot by close to 50 basis points. The compounding effect of this undershooting is the deflationary threat that the Fed and all developed central banks fear. It is therefore time for the Fed to debate and hence to nudge some new policy tools into the public domain to frame future expectations. It could also be the time for the Fed to debate if the magnitude of QE has been large enough. Whatever the case, it is clear that the Fed is starting to think that things are broke and therefore need fixing. What is interesting is that Nakata is from the Fed while Schmidt is from the ECB. Evidently the Fed and the ECB are cross-fertilizing ideas and policies. The Fed board itself does not yet agree with the conclusions. But the whole point of reports like this is to stimulate debate and move perceptions and assumptions from their current baseline positions. The debate should be interesting, especially now that U.S. core CPI, PCE and oil have all recently rallied to confound the likes of Bullard. Suddenly all the fears about deflation look misplaced. It is unlikely that the debaters will consider whether the beacon of rising U.S. interest rates has attracted global capital into the U.S. economy, and whether that is now finding its way from the capital markets into the real economy. By attracting more global capital, rising U.S. interest rates would stimulate further economic activity and inflation. Far from depressing U.S. interest rates into the negative zone, global capital flight from negative interest rate locations would have a tendency to drive interest rates up at source. This is not the script that the ECB and the BOJ would like to read from, but it remains a probability that they may have to consider. But on the other hand, as all good economists like to say, recent evidence from the U.S. service sector suggests that it has started to contract. The debate around the FOMC table is going to be lively; and Yellen's hopes for a consensus view seem to be dashed. She may however be able to extract unanimous support for staying on hold, based on the incoming data. Such a unanimous vote should not be confused with a unanimous view on the state of the economy and future direction of Fed policy though. Stanley Fischer is currently trying to re-frame the narrative of the FOMC tightening process. Having framed expectations for a "ballpark" estimate of four rate hikes this year, he now finds that the whole game may be changing. He is therefore hedging his bets. After guiding that four rate hikes this year were in his "ballpark," it would appear absurd for him to suddenly say that no further rate hikes will occur. In order to adjust market perceptions, he initially opined that it remains premature to judge that the impacts of the current capital market volatility necessitate that the Fed cancel its tightening program. Having unhinged perceptions from the "ballpark" guesstimate of four rate hikes, he then undermined market observers' confidence in their own abilities. By rhetorically questioning and then answering why markets are focused on time-based guidance, he sought to undermine the requirements for it and therefore the need to provide it. The answer that he wishes to get market observers to accept by second-guessing themselves is: "I think they like time-based because it's their way of getting as close as they can to a committee forecast of interest rates." By subtly introducing the notion of doubt, he therefore hopes to destroy faith in the current tools used to discount expectations on the direction and timing of policy actions. This successful destruction of the forward curve and other discounting mechanisms will then allow the Fed to totally ignore market-based feedback signals. To support the objective of Fischer, former Fed governor Jeremy Stein opined that the Fed places too much faith in the forward curve created by the Treasury bond market. As a former MIT alumnus, it is natural for Stein to help nudge the markets the way of MIT alumnus Stanley Fischer. Stein's qualified opinion is not objective; in fact it may be extremely subjective given his career progression. His opinion also dissociates the Fed from the mess that it has created in the bond markets by its Zero Interest Rate Policy. The Fed therefore cannot be blamed for the misallocation of capital in industries and asset classes, based on the fallacy of the capital asset pricing model at the zero bound. Relative value and the allocation of capital has become a subjective process, driven by the subjectivity of the Fed. Fed Governor Jerome Powell then issued yet another disclaimer for the Fed, allowing it to make decisions that not only surprise markets but also contradict the market discounting mechanism. According to him it is "hard to avoid" a combination of time- and data-based guidance when communicating the path of policy. He also accepted that criticism of the Fed's "Dot Plot" is acceptable, yet easily explained through significant time lags in the Fed's economic data inputs and "Dot Plot" output. Powell, like Stein, was further disconnecting the Fed's reality from the capital markets' reality, emphasizing that the Fed is right to ignore the markets. The campaign to remove all forms of accountability to any market- based oversight is underway. This action is a necessary precursor for allowing the Fed to embrace future unconventional policies in the face of a global recession and capital markets crisis. The new objective is for the Fed to be free to ignore the market impact of its policies. The Fed is becoming accountable only to itself, while retaining a very subjective view of the utility and veracity in its own process and decision making governance. This is yet another "Dot Plot" on the Fed's own trend towards systemic failure. It is fair to say that Mr. Market holds the Fed in as equal contempt as the Fed views him. The forward curve is taking on a shape which signals that the Fed is done with its rate hikes. This clearly makes a mockery of the "Dot Plots;" therefore it is no surprise that the Fed would like to dissociate itself with market-based discounting mechanisms. John Williams' signal that the FOMC is going to adjust its own "Dot Plots," presumably to be more aligned with the market consensus, further ridicules the FOMC and also strongly calls into question the assertions, made by Jeremy Stein and others, that the FOMC should ignore Mr. Market. If anything, Mr. Market has called and the Fed has belatedly started to come running towards him. Once again, the Fed is behind the curve and is now scrambling to pretend that the curve doesn't matter.
