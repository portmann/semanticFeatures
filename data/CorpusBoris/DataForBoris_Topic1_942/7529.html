The Fed Is Still A Chaperone, Worrying About A Different Punch Bowl - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ever since William McChesney Martin popularized the â€œpunch bowlâ€? metaphor to explain monetary policy six decades ago, it has been a staple of Federal Reserve tightening cycles. The central bank â€œis in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up,â€? the Fed chairman said in 1955 , citing an unidentified writer for the line. The risk of leaving the punch bowl out for too long–not raising interest rates soon enough–has generally been framed in terms of inflation risk. It increasingly needs new framing for todayâ€™s era. In a recent speech to the National Association for Business Economics , former Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice RivlinÂ put it squarely around financial-stability concerns: â€œthe proverbial punch bowl is still there and the party-goers never want it taken away. It is a different punch bowl at a different party than it used to beâ€” now related to systemic risk-taking rather than runaway inflation.â€? Ms. Rivlinâ€™s speech is a must-read for anyone following economic and monetary policy, particularly because some of her views resemble those of many other Democrats who have been traveling in these Washington circles for decades. Some lawmakers and commentators have spent years worrying about the risk of runaway inflation. But Ms. Rivlin notes that underlying inflationâ€“the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energyâ€“has not hit 3% since 1992. Thatâ€™s almost a quarter-century for a nation, still scarred by the inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, to see relatively mild price pressures. Collecting linguistic evidence of cultural lags is a minor hobby of mine. I smile when I catch myself referring to the refrigerator as the â€œice box,â€? because that was what my mother called it, although she didnâ€™t actually own one. I am amused when young people tell me their phones are â€œringing off the hook.â€? Have they ever used a phone with a receiver on a hook? When bureaucrats say they are eager to break out of their silos, I wonder if they if they have ever lived on a farm or anywhere close to a silo. So when politicians and financial journalists ask me earnestly, as they do, whether the Federal Reserve isnâ€™t risking devastating â€œrunawayâ€? inflation by buying all those bonds, I suspect cultural lag. What inflation? We should be so lucky! Central banks have amply proved that they know how to stop inflationâ€”Paul Volcker showed that. They have been much less successful in getting little inflation going. Ms. Rivlin says the Fed should be most concerned with preventing another 2008. â€œWe have to get used to the idea that the primary job of a central bank (together with other regulators) is to reduce the risk of financial collapse that could throw the country and the world into another deep and prolonged recession,â€? she said in her NABE speech. â€œFinancial instability in the advanced economies is a far greater threat to world prosperity than the risk that inflation could get out of control. Unfortunately, if central banks keep interest rates low enough for a slow-growth world, they risk creating asset price bubbles based on cheap credit that can end in financial catastrophe.â€? Raising interest rates isnâ€™t her answer on that front. But those same worries about risks tied to asset bubbles and cheap credit are high on the minds of central bankers around the table at the Fed.
