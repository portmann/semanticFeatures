Grand Central: Fed’s “Dot Plot” Becomes Window to Its Soul - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed Opens Door to Rate Increase but Remains Cautious on Growth ECB Says Banks Borrowed EUR97.8 Billion in Latest 4-Year Loan Installment To understand the outlook for short-term U.S. interest rates now, you need to pay close attention to the evolution of the Federal Reserveâ€™s economic and interest rate forecasts. The Fed is moving away from giving â€œforward guidanceâ€? on interest rates â€“ meaning no more assurances that rates will stay near zero for a â€œconsiderable timeâ€? or that it will be â€œpatientâ€? before acting, or that it will have dates or numerical thresholds for unemployment that it needs to cross before even considering acting. Instead, the Fedâ€™s decisions will be driven by how officials see the economy evolving and the confidence they have in those forecasts. Of course policy has always been closely tied to the forecast. As Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen explained, the central bank needs to be forward-looking because interest rate movements affect the economy with a lag. Still, for years since the crisis, the economy was so far from normal that a nudge up or a nudge down in an estimate of the unemployment rate wasnâ€™t going to move the Fed from near-zero interest rates. It has too much ground to make up. Why did the markets react so strongly to the Fedâ€™s policy meeting Wednesday? The forecasts tell the whole story. The Fed pushed down its inflation forecasts, its growth forecasts and, importantly, its estimate of how low the unemployment rate can go in the long-run before inflation pressures build. The estimates of officials for the outlook for interest rates also coalesced at lower levels. Ms. Yellen explained the interest rate forecasts moved down because inflation is low and because Fed officials believe the jobless rate can go even lower before the economy’s slack is eaten up and they need to act. There is some irony here. Fed officials have run hot and cold on how much attention they draw to the â€œdot plotâ€? which lays out their interest rate projections. Moreover, they are having a running debate about how to make their economic forecasts more informative. For now though, these numbers are an essential tool. The Fed says it will raise rates when officials are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that inflation is on track to return to 2%. The downward drift in inflation forecasts at this meeting showed the confidence level had diminished since December. Will the Fed move in June? The drift of its forecasts will again tell the story. Fed Opens Door to Rate Increase but Remains Cautious on Growth. The Federal Reserve opened a door to raising short-term interest rates by midyear, but offered several reasons it is still in no hurry to walk through. The Fed, in a statement issued Wednesday after its two-day meeting, dropped an assurance that it would remain â€œpatientâ€? before acting on rates. It said a rate increase was still unlikely at its April meeting, but left alive the possibility of an increase in June or later. Fed Officials Trim Back Estimates of Interest Rate Rises Amid Big Forecast Changes. Fed officials expect the path of future interest rate increases to be less aggressive than they did in December, according to updated forecasts released Wednesday. They also cut their outlook for growth in coming years,Â  see bigger declines in the jobless rate and project inflation to be weaker. They also believe the jobless rate can fall to a lower level without sparking price pressures. - Parsing the Fed : How the statement changed in March from January - Economists react to the Fedâ€™s March statement: “No longer patient, but definitely not impatient yet” - The Fed doesnâ€™t think the U.S. economy is at full employment , after all - Yellen: Strong Dollar Holding Down Exports and Inflation , But Reflects U.S. Economyâ€™s Strength - Fed officials see slower inflation pickup than private economists do - The Fed is still a chaperone , worrying about a different punch bowl. U.S. Regulators to Examine Leveraged Loans More Frequently. The Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp are planning to more frequently examine large, complex loans made by the biggest banks as part of an effort to better assess whether risks are building across the industry. Beginning next year, they will conduct their joint national examination of major loan portfolios twice a year, instead of annually, according to people familiar with the matter. The agencies are also discussing requiring banks to report portfolio data on a quarterly basis, instead of annually, one of the people said.

U.S. Housing Market Waits â€“ and Waits â€“ on Millennials. Home building â€“ especially construction of single-family stand-alone residences â€“ has not rebounded as might be expected given ultralow mortgage rates and good affordability. Even before Februaryâ€™s crash, U.S. single-family housing starts were running less than half the levels seen during the housing boom and are 37% below their average of the 1990s. One reason is the absence of younger home buyers. People ages 25 to 34 are typically the source of new household formations that drive home construction. Not only are millennials not going out on their own, those that do are not buying homes . -BOEâ€™s Haldane speaks in London at 1350 GMT -Fedâ€™s Tarullo testifies before the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing on â€œExamining the Regulatory Regime for Regional Banksâ€? in Washington at 10 a.m. EDT RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Schools and Stimulus. Federal grants to public school districts under the 2009 stimulus program “had a small impact on nonteacher employment, no effect on teacher staff levels, and a substantially less than one-for-one response of district level expenditures,” Bill Dupor and M. Saif Mehkari wrote in a St. Louis Fed working paper . “To the extent that government grants increased district expenditures, the increases largely took the form of capital outlays. The grants also stimulated district debt accumulation.” COMMENTARYÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Future Threats, Not Present Danger, Counsel Caution on Raising Rates. “The U.S. economy will be better-positioned for the next recession if interest rates are higher when the downturn starts,” writes Greg Ip in the Journal. “Paradoxically, the best way to achieve that may be to keep rates lower now.” Greece’s Euro Exit Seems Inevitable. “Greece’s money troubles resemble a game of pass the parcel,Â each successive participant rips another sheet of wrapping paper off the box — which turns out to be empty when the final recipient reaches the core,” Mark Gilbert writes in a Bloomberg View column. “With time and money running out, a successful endgame seems even less likely than it did a week or a month ago.
