The Fed Doesn’t Think the U.S. Economy Is at Full Employment, After All - Real Time Economics - WSJ Back in December, Fed policy makers pegged the economy’s normal longer-run unemployment rate somewhere between 5.2% and 5.5%. But in updated projections released on Wednesday, they lowered their estimate of the longer-run jobless rate to a range between 5% and 5.2%. It’s a significant threshold because it represents what some economists call the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu . The Fed could try to push the unemployment rate lower, but in theory that would stoke inflation. The central bank’s so-called dual mandate is to pursue stable prices and maximum employment. In February, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.5%. That was the top of the Fed’s target range for full employment — at least, at the time . But under the new projections, full employment is still a while down the road. Still, officials expect to get there soon. The projections released Wednesday see the U.S. unemployment rate hitting 5% to 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and falling a bit lower in 2016 and 2017. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , in January, said he was one of the officials thinking about lowering his estimate for the longer-run unemployment rate . â€œClearly, we havenâ€™t seen the wage and price pressure that at least some people might have expected as we start getting to 5.6% and below,â€? Mr. Rosengren said. â€œPeople particularly at the high end of the Nairu estimates are going to be in a position where they have to think through why theyâ€™re not seeing more wage and price pressure.â€?
