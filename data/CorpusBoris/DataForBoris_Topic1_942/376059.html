Confidence Continues To Decline In Federal Reserve | Seeking Alpha Confidence continues to decline in the leadership at the Federal Reserve. The use of "forward guidance" to guide investors and the market has been failing badly and continues to decline as officials provide differing scenarios and confusing positions. Market participants do not like this approach to policy guidance as it results in messy and unstable markets. As many readers know, I am not a fan of central banks giving "forward guidance." Beginning with its December increase in its short-term interest rate target range, officials at the Federal Reserve began to provide "forward guidance" about future movements in its interest rate target range. The expectation, we were told, was for four increases in 2016 of 25 basis points. We were also led to expect that the first of these increases would take place in March 2016 at the meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee on March 15 and 16. Ever since then, there has been debate about the possibility that a move will take place at the meeting starting today. Recently, the market appears to think that there is a very low probability that the Fed will raise its policy range at the current meeting. The federal funds futures market is the indicator here. Since December, various officials at the Federal Reserve have spoken out indicating a substantial split in the where these officials stand in the debate about raising rates. If anything, all this information is not helping the credibility of the Federal Reserve or the people running the Fed. For one, I used to be a big fan of Fed Vice-Chair Stanley Fischer. Over the past year or so, his reputation has fallen substantially in my eyes. From time-to-time I have written about my discontent. "Forward guidance" does not help the credibility of the Federal Reserve… or, for that matter, it does not help the credibility of any central bank. For one, if every central bank engages in "forward guidance", then we have competing messages. Who do we believe? Also, the "forward guidance" of central banks is dependent upon the forecasting ability of the economists at these central banks. Guess what? The economists at central banks are no better at forecasting the future of an economy than any other group of economists making forecasts. They are pretty poor! Furthermore, most of the economic models used by central banks are primarily built around the productive activity of the economy and do not include very robust information on financial markets and especially on world financial markets. How can forecasts be any good without these pieces of information, especially in a world that is becoming more and more global every day? Finally, "forward guidance" is impacted by political affairs, more in some countries than in others. How can "forward guidance" be accurate if the moods of the political forces behind them are subject to change during the forecast period? So, the Federal Open Market Committee has its meeting this week to discuss the monetary stance of the Federal Reserve. As mentioned above, financial market participants have given the probability of an increase in the policy range a low value. No change in rates is expected this week. The European Central Bank announced a new, unexpectedly generous, monetary policy last week . But, then, as explained by Claire Jones in the Financial Times , "The moves initially triggered a sharp selloff in the euro with the currency falling 1.3 per cent to $1.0858. But it staged a swift recovery, moving to $1.11 - up one per cent on the session - after Mr. Draghi told a press conference that while rates would stay low for "an extended period of time", the ECB did not anticipate taking them deeper into negative territory, partly because of the impact on banks." The turnaround was quite dramatic and caught a lot of attention. The value of the US dollar rises against the Euro when the Federal Reserve is seen raising rates and supporting a stronger dollar. It falls when investors feel otherwise. In late February and early March, there appeared to be a feeling that the US economy was getting stronger relative to other economies and that this was good for the US dollar. We see the value of the Euro dropping against the US dollar at $1.0839 on March 2. This strength was also reflected in value of the British pound as it fell to close at a near-term low of $1.3872 on February 24. Since this time period, officials at the Fed have questioned the timing of a rise in the policy range and so the market has retreated. My feeling is that investors would really like for the Fed to move rates at this time and would support a stronger dollar. Investors seem to rush to a stronger dollar on almost any excuse. However, officials are not showing any hurry in making the move. The latest in the "forward guidance" coming out of the Fed these days indicates that it will raise its policy range this year, but not four times… maybe two. Given the current performance of Federal Reserve officials, it is my belief that the decline in market confidence of these "leaders" posted in 2015 will be followed by another year of decline posted at the end of 2016.
