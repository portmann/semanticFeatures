Fed’s George: Economy’s Ready, ‘It’s Time’ To Raise Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said Tuesday “it’s time” for the U.S. central bank to raise short-term interest rates to reflect solid improvements in the economy. The current level of near zero short-term rates, set at emergency levels to deal with deep economic problems, “do not seem needed anymore,” Ms. George said. “We should now be beginning to think about a rise in interest rates,” the official told a gathering on agricultural matters held at her bank. Ms. George’s views largely track those made in a speech last Thursday. The official doesn’t currently hold a voting role on the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. She has advocated for some time for a shift in monetary policy. Those views have been unpersuasive to the strong majority of policy makers who have been worried about raising rates when inflation stands at levels well under the Fed’s 2% target, amid ongoing questions about the vitality of the improvement in the job market. That said, officials have signaled they are moving closer to a rise in rates this year, with some officials pointing to their September meeting as a possible time to act. “A 25-basis-point increase in the fed-funds rate should not have an adverse effect on the economy” given the growth that has happened, and is likely to happen in the future, Ms. George said. She explained that while inflation has been short of the Fed’s 2% price target it has been weak largely on temporary factors related to oil and the strength of the dollar. Ms. George said Fed officials have to be forward looking and start moving rates higher before inflation takes off, because price dynamics can change quickly and force a more aggressive and potentially disruptive response from policy makers. “You have to have some dose of courage” in your forecast and be willing to act, even when the future is uncertain, Ms. George said. The policy maker said after some weakness at the start of the year she believes the U.S. economy got back to a “solid” 2% growth rate in the second quarter. She said the current 5.3% jobless rate shows true improvement in hiring, and she said inflation should move back over time to the Fed’s price target.
