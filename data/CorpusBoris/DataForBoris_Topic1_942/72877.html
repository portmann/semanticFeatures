Grand Central: Easy Money Finds its Way into Energy - Real Time Economics - WSJ It ought to make central bankers sit up and notice when easy money causes investors, lenders or businessmen to start making odd choices. My colleague Russell Gold documents what might fall into this category in a story about the continued flow of funds into the U.S. energy belt . Banks, private-equity firms and institutional investors have poured money into the energy sector even as oil prices collapsed and oil companies slashed billions of dollars in spending from their budgets, Russell reports. Private-equity firms are on pace to invest a record $20.6 billion in startup oil and gas companies this year, according to Preqin, which tracks private-equity expenditures. Investors and lenders appear to be of the view that now is the right time to put money into the sector, because oil prices are low. Buy low, sell high. Simple as that. The flow of money is likely to keep U.S. drillers pumping. Taken together with Saudi Arabiaâ€™s plan to keep pumping, oil prices could see continued downward pressure. Thatâ€™s good news for American households. For financial regulators, however, this reach for returns in a slumping sector might be a sign that this era of super-easy money is breeding the kind of behavior that leads to excess or instability. For Fed, Dollarâ€™s Strength Complicates Rate-Hike Calculus. Many Federal Reserve officials entered 2015 thinking they likely would start raising short-term interest rates by midyear.

A Minneapolis Fed paper examines the impact of member country debt levels in a monetary union. â€œWe demonstrate that a high-debt country may be less vulnerable to crises and have higher welfare when it belongs to a union with an intermediate mix of high- and low-debt members, than one where all other members are low-debt. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that all countries should prefer a union with low-debt members, as such a union can credibly deliver low inflation. These findings shed new light on the criteria for an optimal currency area in the presence of rollover crises.â€? Adjusting the Fedâ€™s View of Growth. “If there ever was a contraction in the economy the Federal Reserve could look beyond, the drop in first-quarter gross domestic product was it,” Justin Lahart writes in the Journal’s Heard on the Street column. The Inflation Puzzle. Martin Feldstein writes in a Project Syndicate column that “the inflation risk is on the upside, especially if the Fed sticks to its plan to keep its real short-term interest rate negative until the end of 2016 and to raise it to one percentage point only by the end of 2017. If inflation does rise faster than the Fed expects, it may be forced to increase interest rates rapidly, with adverse effects on financial markets and potentially on the broader economy.” -U.S. consumers remain cautious about the economy, but a report Friday also said they are optimistic about their future financial situations. -India’s GDP grew by 7.3% for the full fiscal year ended in March, the countryâ€™s fastest annual growth since 2011 . -Brazil’s first-quarter GDP, however, contracted , Â and so did Canadian GDP . -Chinaâ€™s manufacturing sector presented a mixed picture in May, as an official gauge of factory activity recorded modest gains while a private index pointed to continuing sluggishness . -Manufacturing activity in the eurozone grew more rapidly during May, driven by pickups in Spain and Italy, according to surveys of purchasing managers. -Bank Indonesia on Monday removed the requirement for commercial banks to maintain a foreign-exchange net open position every 30 minutes, as part of efforts to deepen the country’s financial market. -Denmark’s central bank Monday said assistant governor Jens Lundager will resign from his position to become managing director at KommuneKredit, a lender to local governments.
