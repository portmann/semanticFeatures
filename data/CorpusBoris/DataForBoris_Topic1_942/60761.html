Bank of Japan Relaxing All-Out Approach to Hitting Inflation Target - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of Japan appears to be relaxing its stance of doing whatever it takes to quickly reach its 2.0% inflation target, as it opts to wait for tightening labor conditions and higher economic growth to push up prices. The central bank’s at-all-costs approach was first introduced when it launched its aggressive monetary easing campaign in April 2013. The BOJ has called its strategy of buying massive amounts of Japanese Government Bonds and other domestic financial instruments effective in reversing the deflationary mindset of the nation’s consumers, pushing up corporate prices and changing wage-setting patterns. While few private economists expect the BOJ to take extra stimulus steps when its policy board holds a regular two-day meeting later this week, a number of economists still see further action either in July or October because they don’t expect the inflation rate to resume rising later this year as the BOJ has projected. But people familiar with the BOJ’s thinking say there is a growing sense among some officials that the BOJ won’t necessarily stick to its whatever-it-takes approach, particularly after the central bank in April pushed back the timing of achieving its price growth target by about six months as inflation decelerates. The BOJ’s all-out approach should be given up, one of those people said, expressing the view that monetary policy should be steered in a way that’s supportive of the economy. For the central bank to relax its long-held stance at a time when recent readings in the core consumer price index are closer to flat than 2% growth may be a discouraging sign for some market participants betting the BOJ will take further action in the coming months. For now, the BOJ is sticking to the view tightening labor conditions and economic growth this year could lead to a rise in inflation, even though there’s uncertainty over whether households can withstand a potential jump in prices. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said further easing in the coming year is unlikely as “the tightening labor market could put more upward pressure on prices than the private sector thinks.” He added that further easing could make it harder for the BOJ to scale down its asset purchases in the future. In his latest speech , Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda underscored how comprehensive the BOJ’s easing measures are and denied the need for further immediate action. He even likened the effects of the easing steps to almost ten 0.25% cuts in short-term interest rates. Other people familiar with the BOJ’s policy highlighted the fact that Mr. Kuroda’s remarks don’t indicate that any detailed plans for fresh action are on the table, even if the BOJ is willing to consider all options after taking into account their costs and benefits.
