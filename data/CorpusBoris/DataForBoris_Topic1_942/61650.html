Australiaâ€™s Central Bank Hints Rates Can Drop - Real Time Economics - WSJ More interest rate cuts remain on the table in Australia after the countryâ€™s central bank clearly articulated an easing bias on Tuesday, sweeping aside recent speculation that it was done lowering rates. Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its cash rate to a record low 2.0% from 2.25%. But while it sought to help an economy facing slowing growth, the central bank neglected to offer guidance on what might come next. Some currency traders took this to mean the RBA was done cutting rates, happy that there are visible green shoots of recovery in household spending. That helped push the Aussie dollar to its highest levels January, tightening monetary conditions and doing much to negate the impact of the rate cut. Â That prompted some economists to say the RBA had scored an own goal . Still, in minutes if its policy meeting, published Tuesday, it seems the market may have misconstrued the signs.Â  The central bank said the absence of forward guidance on May 5, did not preclude it from acting again if required. “Members agreed that…the statement communicating the decision would not contain any guidance on the future path of monetary policy,” the minutes said. “Members did not see this as limiting the Board’s scope for action that might be appropriate at future meetings,” it added. The RBA argues itâ€™s necessary for the Australian dollar to fall in order to offset the pain of declining commodity prices, and to spur confidence among exporters. It sees this as crucial for Australia to turn away from relying on mining to a more manufacturing-based economy. Economists quickly grasped the message from the minutes. The minutes provided little new information on the economy, but they did, however, provide an explicit easing bias, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett. James McIntyre, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, Â said the Â message is clear from the RBA: Â If growth continues to falter, â€œcuts will come.â€? Some say the easing bias was already implicit in the RBAâ€™s recent downgrades of its growth and inflation forecasts . The RBA now sees real risks that inflation will fall below its 2%- to-3% target band in coming years. The retention of the easing bias still needs to register in currency markets with the Australian dollar continuing to trade at close to 80 U.S. cents after the minutes.
