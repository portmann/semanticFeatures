Fed’s Dudley: Hopeful for 2015 Rate Increase, but Action Depends on Economy - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley cast a less certain light on outlook for short-term rate increases in remarks Monday, noting that he hopes weakness over the start of the year will prove temporary and allow the Fed to boost borrowing costs. “Hopefully” the economic data will “support a decision to lift off later this year,” Mr. Dudley said, in reference to taking the first move to push interest rates off of their current near-zero levels. But, “because the economic outlook is uncertain, I can’t tell you when normalization will occur,” he said. When it comes to rate rises, “the timing is data dependent. We will have to see what unfolds,” he said. He said that raising rates off of current rock-bottom levels “does not mean that U.S. monetary policy will be tight” after a rate-increase action. Mr. Dudley’s comments came in remarks given at the Bloomberg Americas Monetary Policy Summit. His comments on the economy and monetary policy come as officials are contending with unexpectedly weak economic data over the start of the year, which includes a slowdown in what had been a very strong pace of job gains. The data has called into question central bankers’ expectations that they could begin to entertain the possibility of rate rises starting with the Fed’s mid-June policy meeting. A number of Fed officials signaled last week a more cautious view when it comes to boosting rates. Mr. Dudley said in his speech that he remains upbeat about the outlook. “Growth prospects for the U.S. economy over the remainder of 2015 will improve,” he said. “I expect that the first-quarter weakness will prove to be largely temporary.” Given how long the economy has been in a recovery, technically speaking, doesn’t have much to say about risks of a new downturn, the official said, adding “I think we could grow for many years further.” Mr. Dudley attributed some of the unexpected weakness to severe winter weather and port problems that disrupted trade. He said he expects growth to maintain the pace seen over the past two years, “supported by continued solid fundamentals and accommodative financial conditions.” Mr. Dudley said if this happens, it could push what is currently a 5.5% jobless rate down to 5% by the end of the year. As the job market picks up, Mr. Dudley expects wages to accelerate as well. He said consumer spending is also stacking up to rise, which should in turn help push inflation back to desired levels. Mr. Dudley noted there is already reason to be upbeat very weak price readings will soon turn higher. The central banker again said that how financial markets react to changes in Fed policy will affect how fast or slow rate rises happen. He said that a neutral rate for the Fed to pursue over time is likely around 3.5%. Mr. Dudley also acknowledged in his speech that the strong dollar has had an impact on the economy. Its rise “is making U.S. exports more expensive and imports more competitive.” He said New York Fed economists believe what’s been seen “would, all else equal, reduce growth of real [gross domestic product] by about 0.6 percentage point over this year.” The official also noted the Fed is mindful that changes in policy can affect emerging markets, but he believes these risks can be dealt with by way of clear communication by the Fed and preparation by foreign central banks. “I’d be very surprised that when normalization occurs, it will be a surprise to anyone,” Mr. Dudley. As for the path of rate rises, “I don’t think we know if it will predictable or unpredictable,” but that said, actions the Fed takes are unlikely to mirror the slow mechanistic campaign seen over middle years of the last decade, he added.
