Grand Central: Has Mario Draghi Lost His Touch? - Real Time Economics - WSJ The European Central Bank’s president dropped plenty of friendly hints to bond and currency markets at his press conference Wednesday : the recent rise in inflation is no surprise; economic figures have been a bit disappointing; and, most importantly, the ECB will implement its EUR1 trillion-plus quantitative easing program to completion and is even willing to add to it if needed. Yet investors reacted oppositely to what would have been expected. German bond yields soared , and the euro rose against the U.S. dollar. Easier monetary policies typically reduce yields and currency values. Judging by Wednesdayâ€™s reaction, it appears markets latched onto Mr. Draghiâ€™s comment that he wasnâ€™t concerned about recent turbulence in bond markets. â€œWe should get used to periods of higher volatility,â€? he said, suggesting the ECB wonâ€™t step in and adjust its stimulus programs to calm markets. In a sense, the recent rise in bond yieldsâ€”though Germanyâ€™s 10-year yield, at around 0.93%, is still super lowâ€”reflects a normalization in the economy and inflation. Consumer prices are up in the eurozone and returned to positive territory last month faster than many analysts had thought they would. That implies a higher bond premium to safeguard against inflation. Firmer economic growth typically has the same effect on yields. Hopes for a deal between Greece and its creditors Â have dampened demand for ultra-safe assets like German bonds. A deeper message from Wednesdayâ€™s market reaction to Mr. Draghiâ€™s press conference is that seven years after the onset of the financial crisis, the global economy and financial markets are still highly dependent on monetary policy. For investors, that means bouts of volatility that central bankers canâ€™t, or wonâ€™t, intervene to resolve. For Mr. Draghi and his peers this means their words still matter greatly whether they like it or not, and need to be chosen carefully. U.S. Workers Ask: Whereâ€™s My Raise?Â The unemployment rate here and in other thriving metropolitan regions across the U.S. is below where it was when the financial crisis blew a hole in the U.S. economy in 2008. Now, many American workers are asking: Whereâ€™s my raise?Â  Questions about the slow pace of wage growth arenâ€™t only stumping workers, but also economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserveâ€”with the answers weighing on households and the larger U.S. economy. Here Are the U.S. Cities Where Wage Growth Has Lagged Job Growth . Nine Reasons Why Fed Economists Think Americans Arenâ€™t Getting a Raise . Â Â  Beige Book Adds Rosy Hue to Outlook. The informal survey of anecdotal business contactsâ€™ views is conducted by each of the Federal Reserveâ€™s 12 regional districts, and paints a fairly rosy picture of the outlook . The latest beige book report finds â€œoverall economic activity expanded during the reporting period from early April to late May.â€? Evans: No Rate Increase Before 2016. Chicago Fed President Charles EvansÂ said Wednesday the Fed needs to focus on getting inflation to a previously-stated 2% target â€œas quickly as possibleâ€? and that he does not expect rates to move in 2015. Mr. Evans said recent â€œsoftâ€? economic data, continued slack in employment and an inability for the economy to hit the Fedâ€™s current 2% inflation target have contributed to his outlook. â€œMy view is we need to see inflation move up to 2%,â€? Mr. Evans said. â€œLetâ€™s have a â€˜whites of their eyesâ€™ attitude towards inflation,â€? he said, adding that the target must not just be hit but sustained. Â  Mr. Evans also said financial institutions should develop aggressive internal risk controls. St. Louis Fedâ€™s Bullard: Appropriate to Think Fed Will Wait to Raise Rates.Â  It is appropriate to think the Federal Reserve wonâ€™t raise interest rates at its June policy meeting following a recent run of weak economic data, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Wednesday. Bank Loans Rise, Yet Doubts Remains. In the first quarter of 2015, bank loans grew 5.9% from a year earlier. But that hasnâ€™t silenced those ringing alarm bells about credit conditions being too tight. That could be because loan growth hasnâ€™t been a very visible contributor to bank earnings growth. Persistently low interest rates haveÂ squeezed margins on loans, meaning banks have to lend more just to keep interest income steady. Plus, many have noticed that deposits have grown much faster than loans in recent years, throwing the ratio of deposits to loans far off its historical balance. Democrats Offer Own Version of Banking Regulation Bill. Â The congressional tussle over easing regulation for the banking industry continued Wednesday with House and Senate Democrats introducing their own bill that would scale back certain post-financial crisis rules for small banks and credit unions. Draghi: ECB Ready to Maintain Stimulus. The European Central Bankâ€™s June governing council meeting passed as expected without any changeÂ to either interest rates or the central bankâ€™s asset purchase program. During his press conference, ECB head Mario Draghi rejected concerns among investors that a recent rise in consumer prices could spur the bank to wind down its stimulus programs early, saying that the ECBâ€™s bond buying program will proceed full throttle and could even be increased if needed . 5 Highlights of Mario Draghiâ€™s June Presser. German Bonds, Europe Stocks Battered a Day After Draghi Comments.Â German government bonds and European stocks fell sharply a day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said that investors would have to get used to volatility in financial markets. Bank of Japanâ€™s Kuroda Channels Peter Panâ€™s Happy Thoughts. Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda on Thursday revealed a model of sorts as he navigates uncharted territory in monetary policy: Peter Pan. In his opening remarks at a conference in Tokyo, Japanâ€™s central bank chief invoked the boy who can fly to emphasize the need for global central bankers to believe in their ability to solve a range of vexing issues, whether stubbornly sluggish growth or entrenched expectations of price declines. Bank of England Holds Interest Rate Steady.Â The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate steady Thursday after data showed consumer prices in the U.K. fell on the year in April for the first time in more than half a century . The dip raised the specter of deflation in Europeâ€™s third-largest economy, a potentially harmful spell of sustained and widespread falls in prices that hurts consumer spending and makes it harder for governments, businesses and consumers to service their debts. Behind Indiaâ€™s Surprising Rate Cut Despite 7.5% Growth. â€œMonths after Indiaâ€™s government statisticians adjusted their methodology for estimating gross domestic product, policy makers still find themselves looking beyond GDP for a fuller picture of the economyâ€™s healthâ€”and concluding that despite the world-beating official growth rate, weakness abounds . Brazil Raises Key Interest Rate to 13.75% Amid Stagflation.Â Brazilâ€™s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point on Wednesday as inflation remained resilient despite strong signs of recession in Latin Americaâ€™s largest economy, a condition often referred to as stagflation. Russia Central Bank Wants to Boost Gold, FX Reserves to $500B in Few Years. The Bank of Russia plans to boost its depleted international reserves to $500 billion to hedge the crisis-struck economy against capital flight and new shocks, the central bank chairwoman said Thursday. Spain Isnâ€™t Feeling the Recovery. Spanish exporters are gaining market share within Europe and beyond. But the way they are doing so is by reducing their costs and selling for less. And the flip side of that is sagging incomes for Spanish workers, making it harder for them to escape the heavy debts that were at the root of the crisis. Spainâ€™s economy, combining private and public sectors, has one of the highest debt levels in the world, at nearly three times the countryâ€™s annual economic output. More than half of the debt is owed to foreign creditors, leaving the country vulnerable when international financial markets become volatile . -12 p.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Tarullo speaks in New York -Bank of Mexico releases a policy statement RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Special-Purpose Electronics. The rise of electronics designed for specific applications in medicine, aerospace or the military has made it more difficult to measure how high-tech innovations affect productivity, writes David Byrne in a Federal Reserve research note . â€œThe recent emergence of special-purpose electronics as the dominant component of the electronics sector heightens our uncertainty about both labor productivity and, relatedly, the rate of innovation in the domestic manufacturing sector–topics of considerable interest at the present time. Furthermore, the contribution to productivity from theÂ useÂ of special-purpose electronics, particularly in the service sector, is an important open question.â€? Whoâ€™s in Charge? Benn Steil and Dinah Walker note in a Council on Foreign Relations blog post that the Fed has said it intends to use interest rates on excess reserves to achieve its fed funds target rate. But a 2006 law gives that power to the Fed board, not the FOMC, they write. â€œFed watchers may therefore be overestimating the pace of rate increases because theyâ€™re focusing on the comments of the wrong committee.Â  For now, at least, it is the Board, and not the FOMC, that wields the real power over rate increases.â€? U.S. Oil Producers Are More like Startups Than Big Crude Producers. The Journalâ€™s Greg Ip writes : â€œShale-oil companies have more in common with the technology startups of Silicon Valley than the big, often state-controlled, integrated oil companies that dominate global oil markets. They are smaller, more nimble, take more risks and are more tied to the ebb and flow of the capital markets. This agility has enabled them to boost productivity, raise cash, and so far withstand Saudi Arabiaâ€™s campaign to claw back market share from higher-cost competitors.â€? U.S. Trade Gap Shrinks. The trade gap narrowed by 19.2% to a seasonally adjusted $40.88 billion in April as the effects of a West Coast port slowdown ended , the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The Bank of France said Thursday that economic growth will outpace the French government’s official expectations and accelerate next year and in 2017. The French economy will grow 1.2% this year–the government’s official forecast is 1%–and accelerate to 1.8% growth in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017–Dow Jones Newswires. The European Central Bank is prepared to press on with its debt-security purchase program until the eurozone’s inflation rate has convincingly recovered from its current lows, Erkki Liikanen,Â a member of the ECB’s governing council, said Thursday–Dow Jones Newswires.
