WSJ Survey: Fed Forecasts for the Economy and Interest Rates Could Edge Down - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserveâ€™s forecast for economic growth this year and for interest rates in the coming three years could be edging down, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The central bank will be updating its projections for the economy and interest rates at its policy meeting next week. To get a read on how the Fedâ€™s own forecasts might change, The Wall Street Journal examined how the outlook among private forecasters had changed since March, when the Fed last updated its Summary of Economic Projections. The biggest change was in 2015 growth forecasts. Private analysts have revised down their estimates of growth in gross domestic productâ€“a measure of the economyâ€™s output of goods and services–to 2.1% this year from 2.9% in March. That is due largely to a contraction in output in the first quarter associated with bad weather and other factors. The new 2.1% estimate is below the Fedâ€™s 2.5% projection for March and suggests Fed officials might be taking down their own numbers when they release their new Summary of Economic Projections at the June 16-17 meeting. Fed revisions got close attention from investors because they have implications for where the central bank might direct interest rates. After Fed officials move down their projections for interest rates and economic growth in March, investors responded by pushing down actual rates and the value of the dollar. Though some Fed officials have said of late that they were concerned the economy has lost some momentum, many have argued that the first-quarter contraction was a temporary blip, a view supported by strong car sales, retail sales and hiring reports released in recent days. â€œIf confirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the result of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time, including the unusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both of which likely disrupted some economic activity,â€? Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in a speech last month. Private analyst estimates for unemployment and inflation are little changed, and suggest the Fedâ€™s own forecasts will be stable on this front in its June forecasting round. It is important to Fed officials that their unemployment and inflation forecasts remain stable or improve. Officials have conditioned the timing of a first interest rate increase on their confidence that inflation will return to their 2% objective and the job market will continue to improve. If their inflation forecasts were to come down or their unemployment forecasts deteriorate, they might consider putting off a rate increase. â€œI am becoming more confident that inflation will return to our 2% objective over the medium term, as long as the labor market continues to improveâ€”an important caveat,â€? William Dudley , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week. At the same time, the Fed’s growth forecasts have implications for where rates might go in the long run. If the Fed’s longer-run growth forecasts deteriorate, it might mean officials believe the economy can’t handle rates going very much higher. Fed officials have been struck by slow U.S. productivity growth, a factor that could weigh on their outlook for growth and rates in the long run. Analysts have slightly marked down their projections for the Fedâ€™s benchmark federal funds rate. The levels they see for the rate — 0.6% at the end of 2015, 1.8% at the end of 2016 and 3% at the end of 2017 â€“ are below the Fedâ€™s projected path as of March, and suggest Fed projections might edge down modestly as well.
