WSJ Survey: Economists Think Fed Wonâ€™t Raise Rates Before September - Real Time Economics - WSJ Private economists increasingly expect the Federal Reserve to wait until September or later to begin raising interest rates, remaining on hold at the upcoming June policy meeting . Some 72% of the economists surveyed over the last week by The Wall Street Journal said the Fedâ€™s first rate increase will come in September, versus just 3% who saw liftoff coming in June and another 3% who predicted officials will raise rates in July. MoreÂ economists are even looking past September: 5% predicted an October rate increase, 9% saw the Fed raising rates in December and 8% thought the Fed would wait until sometime in 2016. The survey of 66 business and academic economists was conducted Friday through Tuesday; not every economist answered every question. The Fed has kept short-term interest rates pinned near zero since December 2008 to support the U.S. economy through a financial crisis, recession and slow recovery. Officials have signaled they expect to begin raising rates sometime this year. The central bankers say want to see continued improvement in the job market, and they want to be â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that too-low inflation will soon move back toward their 2% annual target. â€œI think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy,â€? Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month in Providence, R.I. As recently as March , economists in the Journal survey were split on whether the Fed would raise rates in June or September. But a stretch of weak economic data over the winter and into the spring stirred doubts about whether the Fed would move at mid-year. In April Â and May , economistsâ€™ predictions shifted in favor of a September liftoff for rates. â€œThe joy of being data-dependent is that you can wait until the meeting actually occurs. You donâ€™t have to say whatâ€™s going to happen before the meeting occur,â€? St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said this month . â€œBut I think the shifts that are apparent in market-based thinking are completely appropriate given the weaker data that weâ€™ve had through the spring.â€? Even so, most economists continue to think the Fed will wait too long to begin tightening policy. Some 73% in the latest survey said the greater risk is that the Fed will raise rates too late, versus 27% who said the greater danger would be raising rates too soon. Thatâ€™s up from the 61% in April who said the greater risk would be waiting too long. Last summer , though, 79% were convinced the greater risk was that the Fed would wait too long.
