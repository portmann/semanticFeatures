5 Things to Watch at the Fed Meeting - WSJ At last. The Federal Reserve, after holding its benchmarkÂ federal-funds rate near zero for seven years, is likely to raise it Â this week by a quarter-percentage point.Â The widely expected move “will be a testament…to how far ourÂ economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financialÂ crisis and the Great Recession,” Chairwoman Janet Yellen said earlier this month.Â Looking past liftoff, the U.S. central bank will seek to shapeÂ expectations for how quickly interest rates will rise in the comingÂ months and years. On Wednesday, the FedÂ will release its policy statement and updated economic projections at 2 p.m. EST, followed by Ms. Yellenâ€™s press conference starting at 2:30 p.m. EST. Here are five things to watch. Thereâ€™s little suspense at this point about whether the Fed will raise rates. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, a closely watched centrist policy maker ,Â flatly stated last week that heâ€™s â€œready for a decision to lift off.â€? Â Private economic forecasters surveyed by the Journal see theÂ probability of a rate increase this week at 87%. Futures markets suggest an 83% chance of liftoff as of Monday afternoon,Â  according toÂ CME Group .Â Itâ€™s hard to imagine a scenario in which the Fed would shock markets with a decision to hold rates steady. The Fedâ€™s mantra has been that the precise timing of liftoff mattersÂ less than the path for interest rates going forward. Many officialsÂ  including Ms. Yellen have repeatedly used the word â€œgradualâ€? toÂ describe the expected pace of rate increases,Â but policy makers also appear wary of committing themselves toÂ anything like their mechanical tightening tempo of 2004-06.Â Keep an eye on the policy statement and Ms. Yellenâ€™s press conference for guidance on what will drive the Fedâ€™s subsequent rate increases. For more clues about how quickly and how high the Fed will raiseÂ rates, check out officialsâ€™ projections for their benchmark federal-funds rate in the quarterly chart known as the â€œdot plot.â€? As of September , policy makersâ€™ median estimate saw the rate rising to 1.375% at the end of 2016, 2.625% at the end of 2017 and 3.375% at the end of 2018, just below its normal long-run level of 3.5%.Â That suggested four quarter-point rate increases next year. But with U.S. inflation still running well below the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target ,Â officials might move their dots down and predict a slower pace of rate increases. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker has dissented at the Fedâ€™s past two meetings in favor of raising rates.Â He might get his wish this time, but that doesnâ€™t mean the decision will be unanimous. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Fed governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo have all expressed reservations about raising rates and potentially could cast dissenting votes .Â A dissent by Ms. Brainard or Mr. Tarullo would raise eyebrows because the Fedâ€™s Washington-based governors typically vote with the chairwoman, and none has dissented since 2005. For her part, Ms. Yellen said she â€œ wouldnâ€™t try to stifle dissents , and I would even expect some at critical junctures.â€? If the Fed raises its target for the fed-funds rate to a range ofÂ 0.25% to 0.50% as expected, itâ€™ll use an array of tools to tighten monetary policy in a financial system awash with cash.Â The Fed has signaled that the details will be announced in anÂ â€œimplementation noteâ€? alongside the usual policy statement, andÂ officials will watch closely to make sure those tools work asÂ expected. “If adjustments to policy tools or administered ratesÂ subsequently proved necessary to implement an unchanged policy stance, the implementation note could be revised without altering the [Fed's] policy statement,” according to the central bank’s June meeting minutes .
