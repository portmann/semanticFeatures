Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. No change. TIPS are showing higher inflation expectations since the last meeting. 5-year, 5-year forward inflation implied from TIPS is near 2.10%, up 0.07% from April . Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. No change. Any time they mention the "statutory mandate," it is to excuse bad policy. The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.

The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. CPI is at +0.2% now, yoy . No change in language. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the Federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress - both realized and expected - toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the Federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market, and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.

No rules, just guesswork from academics and bureaucrats with bad theories on economics. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. No change. Changing that would be a cheap way to effect a tightening. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target Federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

"Balanced" means they don't know what they will do, and want flexibility. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Jerome H. Powell; Daniel K. Tarullo; and John C. Williams.

We need some people in the Fed and in the government who realize that balance sheets matter - for households, corporations, governments, and central banks. Remove anyone who is a neoclassical economist - they missed the last crisis; they will miss the next one. This FOMC statement was another great big nothing. No significant changes. Don't expect tightening in September. People should conclude that the FOMC has no idea of when it will tighten policy, if ever. This is the sort of statement they issue when things are "steady as you go." There is no hint of imminent policy change. Despite lower unemployment levels, labor market conditions are still pretty punk. Much of the unemployment rate improvement comes more from discouraged workers and part-time workers. Wage growth is weak also. Equities and long bonds rise. Commodity prices and the dollar are flat. The FOMC says that any future change to policy is contingent on almost everything. Don't know they keep an optimistic view of GDP growth, especially amid falling monetary velocity. The key variables on Fed Policy are capacity utilization, labor market indicators, inflation trends, and inflation expectations. As a result, the FOMC ain't moving rates up, absent improvement in labor market indicators, much higher inflation, or a US dollar crisis. We have a congress of doves for 2015 on the FOMC. Things will continue to be boring as far as dissents go.
