Will the Fed Swim Against the Global Tide on Interest Rates? - Real Time Economics - WSJ One question hangs over the global central banking community in the third quarter: Will theÂ Federal ReserveÂ really swim against the economic tide flowing from the rest of the world? Looking across the globe, central banks large and small are leaning toward easing financial conditions to address slow growth, low inflation and financial distress. The global backdrop is the Fedâ€™s central dilemma as it contemplates interest rate increases as early as September. Fed officials are split on the outlook for rates. In June rate forecasts, the center of its 17-member policy making committee was split on whether the Fed would raise rates twice this year or once.Â If foreign developments continue to intrude, officials leaning toward one increase, possibly as late as December, could win out. And if global developments unravel, they might not move at all. previous BOE Officials Held Special Meeting to Discuss Greece We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

The FED would do our country a world of good if they admitted that they don't really understand the effects of low interest rates nor do they understand the effects of raising rates. Further they should tell us that they have mathematical formulas to guide them but they were forced to make all kinds of assumptions and the models are not any better than guesses. In fact by just tweaking them a little here and a little there they can come up with any conclusion they wish.  In the end they should inform us that they use gut feelings.
