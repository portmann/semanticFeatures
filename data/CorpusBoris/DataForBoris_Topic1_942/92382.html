Fed’s Mester: Economy Could Deal With Quarter-Point Rate Rise Now - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said raising rates right now wouldn’t be a problem for the economy as a whole. “I think the economy can support a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates. However, I also understand the argument that getting a little more confirming data” before taking action “is reasonable as well,” the official told reporters after a speech in Pittsburgh on Friday. “I’m probably a little more optimistic about economic developments” relative to some, and if events play out as expected “we are going to start to move rates up this year,” she said, although she added it’s “hard to determine at this point how many rate increases” will happen in 2015. Ms. Mester also cautioned that too much emphasis is placed on the timing of the central bank’s first move, saying more attention should be paid the gradual path of rate rises most central bankers believe is likely. Ms. Mester’s comments came in response to questions after a speech on community development. The official was one of the first to speak since this week’s meeting of the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. Then, officials maintained short-term rates at near zero levels. Fed officials also continued to prepare the way for interest rate rises later this year. Most officials favor a boost in borrowing costs this year, with officials collectively expecting between one and two small increases in the Fed’s short-term interest rate target. Ms. Mester doesn’t currently have a vote on the FOMC. In comments earlier this year she suggested that she favored a rate rise during the first half of the year. In a speech earlier Friday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he expects the Fed to raise rates by the year’s end, but he wants to be confident price pressures are finally beginning to move concretely back toward the central bank’s 2% inflation target before taking action. Fed officials’ caution over raising rates is motivated by unexpectedly weak data over the start of the year. Most believe the weakness was temporary and due to weather-related factors, but they want to be confident that is true before ushering in a historic change in the stance of monetary policy. Ms. Mester said Friday “every meeting is on the table” when it comes to rate rises. She noted that financial markets, which have become more volatile of late, are thus far not having a major influence on the choices central bankers need to make about interest-rate policy.
