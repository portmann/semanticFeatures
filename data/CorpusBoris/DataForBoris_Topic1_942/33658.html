Grand Central: Mr. Dudley Hedges Himself on 2015 Rate Increase - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hilsenrathâ€™s Take: Mr. Dudley Hedges Himself on 2015 Rate Increase Q&A: Indiaâ€™s Rajan is Looking for More Room to Cut Rates William Dudleyâ€™s remarks at the Bloomberg Americas Monetary Summit Monday underscore the Federal Reserveâ€™s new trepidation about the U.S. economic outlook. In a speech, the New York Fed president acknowledged doubts about the outlook and subtly suggested the Fed might hold off on raising interest rates this year if his forecast of progress on growth, employment and inflation fails to materialize. Central to his concern are two shocks that hit the global economy in recent months â€“ steep increases in the value of the dollar and a sharp decline in the price of oil. Both developments send hopeful signals. Falling oil prices, like a tax cut, support consumer spending. A rising dollar underscores the worldâ€™s faith in the U.S. economy. But Fed officials are focused now on the short-term disruptions these developments can produce. â€œWhile I am relatively optimistic about the growth outlook for 2015, I also must acknowledge that there are some significant downside risks,â€? Mr. Dudley said. â€œIn particular, the roughly 15 percent appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar since mid-2014 is making U.S. exports more expensive and imports more competitive.Â  My staffâ€™s analysis concludes that an appreciation of this magnitude would, all else equal, reduce growth of real GDP by about 0.6 percentage point over this year. Some of the recent softness in indicators of manufacturing activity is likely a reflection of this development.â€? He continued, â€œAdditionally, the decline in energy prices, while helping to support household spending, will adversely impact business investment. The support to growth from rapidly rising U.S. oil production almost certainly will fade due to the oil price decline.Â  Now, with prices sharply lower, U.S. oil exploration and drilling activity is falling off very sharply, and this will undoubtedly exert a meaningful drag on economic activity.â€? In March, 15 of 17 Fed officials said they expected to raise short-term interest rates this year. Mr. Dudley on Monday categorized this as a hope. â€œWhen, hopefully, the data support a decision to lift off later this year, it does not mean that U.S. monetary policy will be tight,â€? Â he said. Thereâ€™s not a lot of conviction in that statement. As The Wall Street Journal reported last week, the likelihood of a June rate increase is falling. Many investors and Fed officials are looking toward September — or perhaps even later this year — for a first move. With each disappointing data point in the months ahead, those expectations will keep getting pushed out. Q&A: Indiaâ€™s Rajan is Looking for More Room to Cut Rates. In an exclusive interview, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan signaled he is keeping his options open for additional reductions in benchmark interest rates.

Could Greece End Up With Two Currencies?Â  “Some think Greece should stick with the euro, no matter what. To abandon it would cause a firestorm of economic destruction,â€? Allen Mattich writes in The Wall Street Journal.Â  â€œOthers argue that Greece would be better off with its own currency, which it could devalue at will and thus find a much less painful route to recovering competitiveness than the existing austerity/deflation path. Then again, there might be a third way: for Greece to keep the euro and have another currency besides. Indeed, the country might well be forced into just such a solution. A Wrinkle in Europeâ€™s QE Effort. Other European agencies are erecting barriers to the effective transmission of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy in an affort to bolster the stability of the financial system, writesÂ Marcello Minenna ofÂ the Bocconi University of Milan in The Wall Street Journal. “Policy makers can choose a financial system in which banks are encouraged to take risks for the sake of stimulating economic growth,” he writes. “Or they can choose a financial system in which tighter prudential regulations force banks to bolster their capital reserves and take fewer risks. At the moment, European leaders are trying to choose both, and the combination is sure to have unintended consequences.” -The ECB will monitor Hungary closely for the risk of its central bank financing the government, an action strictly prohibited under European Union regulations, the ECB said Monday. â€“Dow Jones Newswires. -The combined budget deficit of the eurozoneâ€™s member governments narrowed again in 2014, but their combined debts continued to rise as low rates of inflation and weak economic growth damped tax revenues .
