Grand Central: Stan Fischer Sure Would Like to Get Monetary Policy Back to Normal  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fedâ€™s Fischer Supports Foreign Stimulus Efforts Fedâ€™s Williams: Mid-Year Will Be Time To Start Rate Hike Debate ECB to Continue Buying Debt Until Inflation Stabilizes Sometimes you know youâ€™ve been listening to a central banker when you walk out of a room and half the audience has taken one message from his words, and the other half the opposite message from the exact same words. So it was, to a degree, with Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserveâ€™s Vice Chairman, at a speech to the Economic Club of New York Monday. Some listeners heard Mr. Fischer speak of the stronger dollar and took from its mere mention a worry about the disinflationary impact of a buff U.S. currency that could prevent the Fed from raising short-term interest rates later this year. To this listener, however, Mr. Fischer didnâ€™t sound deeply concerned about the dollarâ€™s strength. The dollar, he noted, is stronger because the U.S. economy is performing well. Moreover, he warmly welcomed a bond buying program initiated by the European Central Bank which has helped to drive the dollar higher and euro lower. The ECBâ€™s program, he said, would strengthen Europeâ€™s domestic economy and thus help the U.S. He also dismissed the idea that global central banks are engaged in currency wars meant to cheapen their currencies at the expense of othersâ€™ exports. â€œWe will be better off if they are growing faster,â€? he said of Europe and Japan. What resonated about Mr. Fischerâ€™s comments were hints of an itch in the Fedâ€™s eminent number two to get on with the process of raising short-term interest rates this year. He calls such a policy â€“ in paragraph one, sentence two — a â€œnormalization,â€? meaning where the Fed is right now is highly abnormal. â€œBeginning the normalization of policy will be a significant step toward the restoration of the economyâ€™s normal dynamics, allowing monetary policy to respond to shocks without recourse to unconventional tools,â€? he said. Got that?Â  It sure would be nice to get back to normal. In the question and answer session, Mr. Fischer reminded listeners that the path to normal is going to be a long one. â€œWhen we raise the interest rate,â€? he said, â€œwe will be moving from an ultra-expansionary monetary policy to an extremely expansionary monetary policy.â€? Got that? Even after the Fed moves, the financial system will still have plenty of punch in the punch bowl. The central bank made clear after its policy meeting last week that officials have trepidations about moving prematurely or aggressively from near-zero interest rates. Mr. Fischer offered a reminder Monday that his eyes nevertheless remain very much on a return to normalcy. Fedâ€™s Fischer Supports Foreign Stimulus Efforts. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Monday he broadly supports economic-stimulus efforts undertaken by major foreign central banks and is unworried for now about how thatâ€™s affecting the dollar. â€œOur main interest is that the European economy, and the Japanese economy and the British economy recover,â€? he said. The U.S. â€œwill be better off if they are growing faster.â€? Fedâ€™s Williams: Mid-Year Will Be Time To Start Rate Hike Debate. San Francisco Fed President John Williams reiterated on Monday his belief that the central bank should consider raising rates sometime this summer . â€œThings are looking betterâ€”in fact, theyâ€™re looking downright good,â€? the official said in a speech to be delivered to an audience in Sydney, Australia via video. â€œI think that by mid-year it will be the time to have a discussion about starting to raise rates,â€? Mr. Williams said. Fed’s Bullard: Zero Rates No Longer Appropriate for U.S. Economy.Â A top Federal Reserve official said Tuesday the U.S. central bank should begin raising short-term interest rates as soon as possible .

The Fed on Monday released the results of an internal investigation into an alleged leak of market-sensitive policy information in September 2012, saying it found no major breaches of its communications policy. The probe involved two separate reports, one published in The Wall Street Journal and another to private clients by Medley Global Advisors, a consulting firm. It found the Journal article was deeply reported and didnâ€™t constitute a leak. It found â€œnearly all of the information in the [Medley] article appeared previously in theâ€? Journal.

BOC’s Poloz to Discuss Credibility in London Speech. Bank of Canada says Governor Stephen Poloz’s speech in London on Thursday will partly focus on central-bank credibility. The topic is certain to be of interest to BOC watchers, given some commentary and criticism over Poloz’s decision to ditch forward guidance. The result, critics say, is that BOC is surprising markets and has become less transparent â€“Dow Jones Newswires Bank of Israel Holds Rate Steady at 0.10% for April.

The Energy Bust: How Much Like Tech in 2001? The drop in oil prices over the last six months has already produced the swiftest drop in the number of U.S. oil rigs in the ground, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. Given the potential for a pullback from one sector to spill into others, economists at Wells Fargo explored in a recent research note whether the collapse in oil prices might, like the collapse in technology stocks 15 years ago, prove a harbinger of a downturn in the U.S. economy later this year.

In an economic letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , Â Ã’scar JordÃ , Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor examine the consequences for policy of the explosion in real estate lending.Â ”In the six decades following World War II, bank lending measured as a ratio to GDP has quadrupled in advanced economies,” they write. “To a great extent, this unprecedented expansion of credit was driven by a dramatic growth in mortgage loans. Lending backed by real estate has allowed households to leverage up and has changed the traditional business of banking in fundamental ways. This â€˜Great Mortgagingâ€™ has had a profound influence on the dynamics of business cycles.” Central Banks Still Stoking the â€˜Insanity Trade.’ “How it works isnâ€™t quite working anymore,” writes Paul Vigna in the MoneyBeat blog. “Even though it ended its big bond-buying program in October, the so-called QE3, the Federal Reserve still has interest rates pinned to the floor, where theyâ€™ve been for more than six years now. In any other time, that would be unprecedented, and while the conventional wisdom â€“ that inflation would follow aggressive monetary policy â€“ turned out to be wrong, itâ€™s not like they were baseless claims. The whole point of a low-rates policy, after all, was to stoke economic activity, the end result of which would be inflation.” â€œThe Federal Reserve is at a crossroads, and it doesnâ€™t know where itâ€™s going,â€? writes Robert Samuelson in the Washington Post. â€œItâ€™s true that during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the Fed arguably averted another Great Depression. It supplied credit when frightened private lenders wouldnâ€™t. Since then, it has been less successfulâ€¦.Policy has been neither a glorious success nor an abject failure. Itâ€™s been a pragmatic muddle.â€? - Lyle Gramley, a Fed governor who helped battle a recession and inflation of more than 10 percent during President Ronald Reagan’s first term in the 1980s, has died.
