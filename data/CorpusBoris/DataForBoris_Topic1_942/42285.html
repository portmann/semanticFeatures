Data isn’t as objective as the Fed might have you believe economic data | Economics. macroeconomics; United States | federal reserve | GDP | interest rates | janet yellen | monetary policy | T-shirts | united states Fed officials say they will be â€œdata-dependentâ€? when it comes to making monetary policy. San Francisco Fed President John Williams feels so strongly about it, heâ€™s even printed up a T-shirt to get that message across. But truth be told, data-dependency is not as objective as it sounds. Data doesnâ€™t dictate policy; itâ€™s the interpretation of data thatâ€™s key. What is rate-hike-worthy data to one policymaker is keep-the-pedal-to-the-metal data for another. Take, for instance, U.S. GDP growth. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker says he expects GDP growth to average 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year, a pace that would justify a Fed rate hike in June. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans expects 3 percent growth this year, and does not believe even that would justify a rate hike until the first half of 2016. So what does it tell you about monetary policy if you see GDP growth of 2.5 percent? Not a whole lot, judging from these two. And the statements of other Fed officials are hardly more helpful. Indeed, as Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said recently, â€œI don’t think it is advisable to approach such a decision with rigid quantitative triggers in mind.â€? Watch the data, sure. But donâ€™t assume the data will tell you much about the exact timing of the rate hike. Monetary policy â€“ itâ€™s subjective. Maybe some policymaker will print that on a T-shirt.
