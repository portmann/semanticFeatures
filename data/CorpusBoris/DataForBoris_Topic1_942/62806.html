Grand Central: Solid Growth Gives Bank of Japan Breathing Room, Though Doubts Linger - Real Time Economics - WSJ Indiaâ€™s Rajan Wants More Central Bank Coordination After months of consistently undershooting expectations, Japan’s economy actually outperformed forecasts in the first quarter. Wednesday’s solid Gross Domestic Product report gives some fresh credibility to Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda’s relentless optimism — and his professed patience in holding off on further easing, despite an inflation rate stuck well below his 2% target. But when the central bank’s policy board meets this Thursday and Friday, their dissection of the data will offer as many reasons for concern as for celebration about the prospects for a sustainable rebound from last year’s tax-induced recession. On the positive side: GDP grew at an annualized 2.4% pace in the January-March quarter, well above the 1.5% consensus forecast, and the fastest rate in a year. The report showed signs of a pickup in exports and housing, and repair in long weak consumption and business investment. The growth came despite a drag from public works, suggesting private activity may be able to offset fiscal contraction as the government struggles to contain its mammoth debt. On the negative side: the main reason for the upside surprise was a surge in inventory buildup. That accounted for two percentage points of the expansion, or nearly all of it, and raises the risk that growth will weaken again as companies draw down stockpiles. Employee compensation was flat, the first time it didn’t increase in six quarters, feeding questions about just how much wages are really rising despite an ultra-tight labor market. A sharp rebound in worker pay is a crucial element in Mr. Kuroda’s recovery story. Meantime, fourth quarter growth was revised to 1.1% from the original 2.2% report, showing the economy’s momentum remains modest. That also offers a reminder that Japanese growth figures have over the past year repeatedly been altered significantly after the initial report, usually downward. Even before the GDP news, few BOJ watchers had been anticipating policy change at this week’s meeting. Mr. Kuroda has spent the past month tamping down expectations for any imminent moves, saying he felt underlying conditions for a growth-price rebound were in place, and explicitly pushing back his deadline deep into 2016 for hitting his inflation target. But many economists are still unsure whether the first-quarter data marks a turning point or a blip for an economy that has tended to disenchant rather than please. “We retain our outlook for further July easing,” Barclays analysts said after the GDP news, in a report titled “Nice headline, disappointing content.” U.S. Regulators Point to Risks from Rapid-fire Trading and Clearing.Â  The Federal Reserve and other U.S. financial regulators highlighted risks from electronic trading and clearinghouses in their annual report on threats to the nationâ€™s financial stability. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of senior regulatory officials, broadly found the threats are moderate and the financial system is stable. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the FSOC report â€œdocuments the continued improvement in the strength and resiliency of the U.S. financial sector,â€? but added, â€œwe are prepared to take steps to strengthen standards to promote financial stability if needed.â€? Five Things to Watch in the Fed Minutes. The Fed noted after its April policy meeting that economic growth had slowed during the winter. The minutes of the policy makersâ€™ discussions, to be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, could reveal more detail about what this could mean for interest rates. Here are five things to watch for. Fedâ€™s Evans: Natural Jobless Rate in US May Be Lower Than 5%.Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Wednesday that it was by no means certain that the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. is 5% and that it might be even be lower, suggesting that it might take even longer for inflation to get back up to the Fedâ€™s 2% target. BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ© Gives Diners Sneak Peek at ECB Move.

ECBâ€™s Praet: European Governments Must Pursue Economic Reforms. Europeâ€™s economic recovery wonâ€™t reduce unemployment much below double-digit rates unless governments step up efforts to overhaul their economies, European Central Bank executive board member Peter Praet warned. The eurozoneâ€™s recovery gives governments only a little extra time to take action, Mr. Praet said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Monday. â€œI think itâ€™s very late because after seven years this more pessimistic environment becomes more entrenched in expectations, so you need to have results now.â€? ECBâ€™s Nowotny: Stay the Course. The European Central Bankâ€™s policy of providing liquidity is showing its first signs of success, but they arenâ€™t enough for the bank to start reversing its current policy, Ewald Nowotny, a member of the ECBâ€™s governing council said Tuesday evening. â€œWe should certainly expect a longer phase of low interest rates,â€? he said. Japanâ€™s First-Quarter GDP Growth Is Fastest in a Year. Â Solid recoveries in both the household and corporate sectors helped Japan post surprisingly robust growth for the first quarter of 2015, confirming that the nation has left behind last yearâ€™s recession. BOE Sees Faster UK Growth in Second Quarter.Â Bank of England officials expect economic growth in the U.K. to accelerate in the second quarter following a soft start to the year , minutes of officialsâ€™ most recent policy meeting showed Wednesday. Indiaâ€™s Rajan Wants More Central Bank Coordination. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said conflicting policies pursued by the worldâ€™s major central banks could push the world towards a succession of crises , as countries seek to stimulate domestic demand by cutting interest rates and devaluating their currencies, pushing others to follow suit. He called on global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund to intervene. â€œThe current non-system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source of substantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector,â€? he said. â€œIt is a problem of collective action.â€? BoCâ€™s Poloz: Canadaâ€™s Economy on the Right Track. Canadaâ€™s economy is headed in the right direction, and a robust recovery, led by non-energy exports, should begin by midyear , Bank of Canada GovernorÂ Stephen PolozÂ said Tuesday. The central banker stuck to hisÂ  recent upbeat tone Â about the economy, saying positive momentum continued to build and that the Bank of Canadaâ€™s January interest rate cut was working. Turkey’s Central Bank Holds Interest Rates Steady.Â Turkey’s central bank Wednesday held interest rates steady for the third consecutive month, as the deteriorating inflation outlook and weakening currency trumped government calls for lower interest rates ahead of June parliamentary elections–Dow Jones Newswires. New homes are getting bigger, the Commerce Department said. The median size of a home built in the U.S. in the first quarter was 2,521 square feet, up 76 square feet or 3% from the fourth quarter. The big-home trend accelerated in the years since the downturn, as builders catered to better-heeled buyers who could qualify for loans to buy new homes. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers remain largely sidelined by tepid wage and job growth, mounting student debt and stringent mortgage-qualification standards . Market Expectations Trump Survey-based Signals As Best Inflation Predictor. When it comes to divining the inflation outlook, trust market-based measures over the expectations of the broader public, says an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in a recent research report. Based on their past performance as predictors of inflation, market signals about direction of prices â€œare much more accurate than survey-based measures,â€? writes Kevin Kliesen. A look at the Fedâ€™s prudential supervision responsibilities. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York takes a look at the institutionâ€™s broad role in making sure that financial institutions are playing by the rules. â€œThe broad goals of prudential supervision relate very closely to the Federal Reserveâ€™s financial stability responsibilities,â€? the authors write. Stiglitz Says Fedâ€™s Fed Inflation Focus Has Helped Beggar Lower, Middle Classes. If the Federal Reserve wants to help the lower and middle classes of America, it should pay less attention to inflation and do more to generate strong job growth, writes Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz , chief economist of the Roosevelt Institute, in a new report arguing in favor of broad reform of the nationâ€™s financial sector. â€œThe Federal Reserveâ€™s focus on controlling inflation rather than achieving full employment and managing systemic financial risk has raised unemployment and lowered wages over the past 35 years,â€? he writes in the report released by the left-leaning think tank. â€œThe only times we see broadly shared benefits of economic growth are when the economy nears full employment.â€? U.S. central bankers out of bullets. Stephen King argues in the Financial Times that policy makers in the United States are out of monetary firepower to fight the next recession, which may be closer than we think. â€œThe recovery seen so far has not enabled policymakers to replenish their ammunition; growth has returned but policy has not â€˜normalizedâ€™. Interest rates are still at rock bottom, central bank balance sheets are awash with the spoils of quantitative easing, budget deficits are still big by past standards and government debt levels are, for the most part, still heading upwards. The US economy is like a ship sailing across the ocean without lifeboats. Other nations are following in convoy behind. For all their sakes, we must hope to avoid recessionary icebergs.â€? Official Statistics Understate Real GDP Growth. Martin Feldstein writes in the Journal that income, productivity and growth data are difficult to accurately ascertain because of the difficulty inherent in sampling an entire economy. â€œThere is no way to know how much of each measured price increase reflects quality improvements and how much is a pure price increase. Yet the answers that come out of this process are reflected in the consumer-price index and in the governmentâ€™s measures of real growth,â€? he writes. â€œAmericans are enjoying faster real income growth than the official statistics indicate, but we can achieve even faster growth with more capital accumulation, increased labor-force participation, and greater innovation that leads to new products and more efficient means of production. Better tax policies can help achieve all three.â€? More Americans feel comfortable quitting. A Harris PollÂ of 1,553 unemployed individuals found thatÂ nearlyÂ one-fifth decided to quit their jobs, apparently buoyed by the improving economy and reports of a warming labor market . U.S. housing starts rose 20.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.135 million in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

Construction across the 19 countries that share the euro rose in March and in the first quarter as a whole, an indication that businesses and households are becoming more willing to invest after years of caution. Nigeria kept its key lending rate at 13%, a record high, on Tuesday, betting that Africa’s biggest oil producer was beginning to level out from months of tumbling crude prices and political turbulenceâ€“ Dow Jones Newswires.

Bank of Mexico Lowers Growth Forecast. A drop in the countryâ€™s oil production and weak growth in the U.S. economy caused the central bank to project output will grow by 2% to 3% this year, down from the 2.5%-3.5% estimate it had three months ago.
