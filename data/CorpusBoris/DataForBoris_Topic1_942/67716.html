Fed’s Fischer: Weaker-Than-Expected Foreign Growth Could Mean Slower Approach to Raising Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve could take a slower approach to raising interest rates if weaker-than-expected growth overseas affects the U.S. economy, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said. “The tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has advanced far enough — when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and when we are reasonably confident that the inflation rate will rise to our 2% goal,” Mr. Fischer said Tuesday in remarks prepared for delivery in Tel Aviv that were largely similar to an October 2014 speech in Washington . But, he said, “if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise.” Mr. Fischer took office as the Fed’s vice chairman last summer. He formerly was governor of Israel’s central bank and earlier served as first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund and chief economist at the World Bank. On Tuesday, Mr. Fischer said the Fed isn’t the world’s central bank and must first and foremost pursue its domestic objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. “The most important contribution that U.S. policymakers can make to the health of the world economy is to keep our own house in order — and the same goes for all countries,” he said. But he also said that by dint of its size, “the United States is not just any economy and, thus, the Federal Reserve not just any central bank.” In the course of raising interest rates, the Fed “will take account of how its actions affect the global economy” and will “seek to minimize adverse spillovers,” he said. Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, called this month for more coordination among central banks . The world needs “much clearer rules of the game is what is allowed and what is not allowed,” he said. Most Fed officials have said they expect to begin raising its benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero later this year, a timetable reaffirmed last week by Chairwoman Janet Yellen . On Monday, Mr. Fischer said too much attention is paid to the timing of the Fed’s initial rate increase and he expects a “gradual and relatively slow” rise in short-term rates over the next three to four years. “Our process is not date-determined. They are data-determined,” he said Monday in Herzliya, Israe l. “We will wait and see what happens. If the economy is moving slow we’ll wait. If fast, we’ll do it earlier.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
