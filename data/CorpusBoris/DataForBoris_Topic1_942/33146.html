Mexico’s Carstens Worries Recovery Too Reliant on Unsustainably Low Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ The global economic recovery, particularly among rich nations, is still very much dependent on heavy support from central banks in the form of low interest rates, making it vulnerable to an eventual reversal of such policies, Mexico central bank head Agustin Cartens said Monday. The global economic recovery “is susceptible to setbacks,” Mr. Carstens said at an event sponsored by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “What worries me the most is the fact that it still depends heavily on the monetary policy stances in main advanced economies that are not sustainable over the medium or long term .” He said unwinding unconventional monetary policies, including large-scale asset purchases conducted by the Fed and other major central banks, could lead to market turbulence. Mr. Carstens said a slump in emerging markets was already taking place, with fears of an eventual rise in Fed interest rates driving investors into dollar assets, prompting a sharp spike in the U.S. currency. “Central banks in emerging markets are currently facing significant challenges regarding the conduct of monetary policy,” he said. Mr. Carstens, who also chairs the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the policy advisory committee of the International Monetary Fund, expressed worries that a prolonged period of low rates and extensive balance sheet expansion in rich economies was leading to the wrong kind of risk-taking in markets. â€œFinancial risk taking has overwhelmed real risk taking. There are very rich valuations,â€? he said. â€œThere is the illusion of liquidity in many [financial] products.â€? Still, Mr. Carstens said the Fedâ€™s aggressive monetary policy on the whole had been beneficial to Mexico since it bolstered the U.S. expansion at a time when it needed the support. â€œFor Mexico, to have a strong U.S. economy is important. Weâ€™d rather deal with those issues than have a weak economy,â€? he said.
