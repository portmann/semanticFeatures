Minneapolis Fed’s Kocherlakota: Fed Shouldn’t Raise Rates in 2015  - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve should wait until the second half of 2016 before beginning to increase its benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been pegged near zero since December 2008, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota reiterated Friday. “Under my current outlook, I continue to believe that it would be a mistake to raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015,” Mr. Kocherlakota said in remarks prepared for delivery in Bloomington, Minn. Mr. Kocherlakota’s speech was largely identical to remarks he made Tuesday in Bismarck, N.D. Most Fed officials expect to begin raising interest rates this year as the economy improves, though the precise timing of the first increase remains uncertain. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said earlier Friday that he sees a strong case for the Fed to begin raising rates this summer. “I expect that, unless incoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will remain strong at the June meeting,” Mr. Lacker said. But after a recent run of weak economic dat a, “it’d be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fed’s first rate hike might be a little further off in time,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Wednesday. Mr. Kocherlakota, on the other hand, has argued that the Fed should hold off on raising rates for now. On Friday, he said the Fed can be “both late and slow” because it will take years for the central bank to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The initial rate increase should be delayed until the second half of 2016, he said, and the benchmark federal funds rate should rise to roughly 2% by the end of 2017. In March, the median of policy makers’ projection for the fed funds rate at the end of 2017 was 3.125%. The Fed, Mr. Kocherlakota said, “can only achieve its congressionally mandated price and employment goals by being extraordinarily patient in reducing the level of monetary accommodation.” Richmond Fedâ€™s Lacker Reiterates He Sees Strong Case to Raise Rates in June WSJ Survey: Economists Think Fed Will Wait Until September to Raise Rates Fed Divided on June Rate Increase, but Soft Data May Prove Deciding Factor Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
