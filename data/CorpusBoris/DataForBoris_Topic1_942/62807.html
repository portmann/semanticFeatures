5 Things to Watch in the Fed’s April Meeting Minutes - WSJ The Federal Reserve noted after its April policy meeting Â that economic growth had slowed during the winter. The minutes of the policy makersâ€™ discussions, to be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, could reveal more detail about what this could mean for interest rates. Here are five things to watch for. Earlier this year, several Fed officials were pointing to midyear as a possible time to start raising their benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero. However, officials have appeared to cool to the idea of moving so soon after a spate of weak economic data, including a softening of job gains . The minutes could provide more detail on policy makersâ€™ thinking on the likely time of liftoff. At their March meeting, Fed officials sharply lowered their estimates for economic growth this year and next in their quarterly forecasts. Minutes of the April meeting, which occurred six weeks later and after more bad data, could show whether they were growing more pessimistic, perhaps providing a signal of whether they were on track to lower their forecasts again in June. U.S. employment growth appeared to be picking up steam toward the end of last year, but has cooled this year. Job gains in the past three months averaged 191,000 per month, compared with a 318,000 average for the preceding three months. The April meeting occurred after a particularly disappointing March employment report . The minutes could shed more light on Fed officialsâ€™ thinking about whether the downshifting was likely to be temporary or longer-lasting. They have said they want to see further improvement in the labor market before raising interest rates. They also have said they wonâ€™t lift interest rates until they are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will move back to their 2% target. The Fedâ€™s preferred inflation measure remains well below that goal Â and is forecast to remain there for a while.Â  But another measure of inflation Â has recently shown signs of stabilizing, which could provide some comfort. The minutes could provide more detail on how they are making sense of the data. Such persistently low inflation has prompted two Fed officials, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, to call for waiting until next year Â before raising interest rates. The minutes could reveal whether the recent weak economic data is causing other policy makers to join their camp. New York Fed President William Dudley appears to have softened his resolve to raise rates this year, saying merely that he still hoped it would be possible . • You must enter the verification code below to send.
