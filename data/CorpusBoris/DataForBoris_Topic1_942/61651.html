Political Pressures Test Bank Indonesia - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank Indonesia is under increasing political pressure from a young administration to cut its benchmark rate amid sluggish growth . Vice President Jusuf Kalla, a businessman and longtime fixture on the Indonesian political scene, said at a recent business eventÂ it would be difficult to revive the economy with high interest rates. If the current account improves and inflation falls, Bank Indonesia could start with another quarter-percentage-point cut, he said. The central bank already cut rates earlier this year . While most economists expect the bank to hold rates at 7.50% in a monetary-policy decision later Tuesday, they will be watching for signs of whether the bank will bend to the pressure. Bank Indonesia ranks as one of the worldâ€™s least independent central banks. On the flip side, the central bank has to weigh the risk of a weakening rupiah , currently hovering at a 17-year low, and capital flight. Indonesia got hammered in 2013 when then-chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke first hinted at higher rates in the summer of 2013 . Southeast Asiaâ€™s largest economy posted just 4.7% growth in the first quarter, its lowest rate in more than five years. Thatâ€™s well off a high of 6.5% growth in 2011, and short of the goals of the new President Joko Widodo, who is facing early criticism for failing to turn around the economy quickly enough. Falling export prices for nickel, coal and tin and weak demand from China have led to a yawning current-account deficit. But with nearly 40% of rupiah-denominated bonds owned by foreigners, Indonesia is vulnerable to capital outflows. A rate cutâ€”as well as expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates later this yearâ€”could give foreign investors reason to yank out their cash. Another factor constraining the central bank is that inflation is still high. Though cheaper oil prices have helped, at 6.79% in April, itâ€™s still well above the governmentâ€™s 3% to 5% target range. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo reiterated at a business event last week his stance that Indonesia needs to reduce a growing current-account deficit with prudent economic policyâ€”one that fosters an economy less prone to external shocks. “I’m glad to know that the government shares our view,â€? he said. At the same event, Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said that the government â€œmust remain focusedâ€? on fixing the current-account deficit. Citigroup said it is closely monitoring statements from government officials that could impact the central bankâ€™s independence. The â€œtendency of high-ranking government officials to publicly comment about BIâ€™s interest rate policy contrasts sharplyâ€? with the previous government, economist Helmi Arman wrote in a research note this week. If that trend continues, â€œcaution is warranted,â€? he said, as it may affect capital flows and the rupiahâ€™s exchange rate. Indonesia’s growth is slowing despite high hopes for the administration of President Joko Widodo. Here, a worker paints a scaffolding for a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station in Jakarta.
