Fed Sent Nearly $97 Billion to the U.S. Treasury in 2014 - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve handed a record $96.90 billion in profit over to the Treasury Department in 2014, the U.S. central bank said Friday. In January, the Fed had tentatively estimated its Treasury remittances last year at $98.7 billion. The slightly lower number was released as part of the Fed’s audited annual financial statements . The central bank’s revenue from various sources is used to cover its operating expenses, and much of the rest goes to the Treasury to help fund the federal government. In 2013, the Fed sent $79.63 billion to the Treasury, down from $88.42 billion in 2012. The Fed earns interest income on the huge portfolio of bonds that the central bank purchased in recent years to support the U.S. economy through a financial crisis, deep recession and painfully slow recovery. It concluded its latest round of bond-buying in October. The Fed’s remittances are expected to decline in coming years as it raises short-term interest rates and allows its bond portfolio to gradually shrink. The Fed’s assets totaled $4.498 trillion at the end of 2014, up from $4.024 trillion a year earlier, according to Friday’s report.
