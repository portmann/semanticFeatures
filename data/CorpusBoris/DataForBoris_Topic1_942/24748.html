Richmond Fedâ€™s Lacker Repeats He Sees Strong Case to Lift Rates in June - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker reiterated Friday that he sees a strong case for the Fed to begin raising short-term interest rates this summer. “I expect that, unless incoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will remain strong at the June meeting,” Mr. Lacker said in Sarasota, Fla. His speech was largely identical to March 31 remarks he delivered in Richmond, Va. The Fed has held its benchmark federal funds rate near zero since December 2008 to stimulate spending and the broader economy. Most officials at the central bank expect to begin raising rates some time this year, though the precise timing of the first rate increase remains uncertain. Mr. Lacker, who is a voting member this year of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, has been a longtime skeptic of the Fed’s easy-money policies. He has repeatedly signaled that he favors raising rates at the June 16-17 policy meeting. He said Friday that he is “confident” sluggish U.S. inflation will pick up toward the Fed’s 2% annual target over time and said the labor market now is “well within the confidence bands of any reasonable estimate of ‘maximum employment’,” which is one of the Fed’s mandated goals, along with stable prices. “My own view is that, given what we know today, a strong case can be made that the federal funds rate should be higher than it is now,” he said. But the Fed already has said a rate increase is unlikely at the April 28-29 meeting, so June is “the first date at which the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate target without undermining its past communications,” he said. Several officials at the Fed’s March 17-18 policy meeting favored a June rate increase, while others thought the central bank should hold off on raising rates until later in the year and a couple wanted to wait until 2016, according to minutes released Wednesday that didn’t give names or precise numbers. After a recent stretch of weak economic data, “it’d be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fed’s first rate hike might be a little further off in time,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Wednesday. Mr. Dudley said a June rate increase “could still be in play,” but that “now the bar is a little higher.” Mr. Lacker shrugged off the recent weak data, saying that “temporary factors like unseasonable weather” may shoulder some of the blame. “It’s too soon say how much, however, and the more prudent approach, as a result, is to look through several quarters of data and see how trends…are shifting,” he said. “The biggest risk of tightening too early or too fast is that the economy may weaken more than expected, forcing the central bank to reverse course,” Fed Governor Jerome Powell said Wednesday in New York . “The record of central banks lifting off from the zero lower bound suggests caution in this regard.” “If we were to raise rates and then subsequently reduce them again, it might be unexpected,” he told reporters following his speech. “We’re setting rates where we think they ought to be. I don’t see it as problematic. …I think the risk of waiting too long needs to be taken seriously, and I base that just on historical evidence that monetary policy typically takes effect with some lag, with some substantial lag. I think that needs to be taken seriously as well.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
