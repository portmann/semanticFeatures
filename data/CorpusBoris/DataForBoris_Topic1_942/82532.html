Grand Central: The Untaper Tantrum  - Real Time Economics - WSJ One of the more puzzling aspects of a puzzling week in Europe’s financial markets is that investors have acted as if the European Central Bank had signaled it might taper its bond-purchase program, when it fact it did the opposite. To recap: last week, the ECB left policy unchanged. During his regular news conference, ECB President Mario Draghi said investors should get used to volatility. Already on the climb going into the news conference, yields on German government bonds surged , while stocks fell. Nobody is entirely sure why this happened, although my colleague Richard Barley has drawn some interesting conclusions from the episode, which we might dub the “untaper tantrum” to distinguish it from the jump in U.S. Treasury yields of 2013 that followed Fed hints it would start winding down its bond purchases. What was overlooked was a firming up of the ECB’s commitment to do whatever it takes to hit its inflation target. Mr. Draghi said the central bank had not been at all surprised by the return to inflation in May, even though some policy makers had forecast a lengthier brush with deflation. Then he signaled that policy makers had been a little underwhelmed by recent signals on growth–there were signs of “some loss of momentum.” And Mr. Draghi then said it may be necessary to increase the scale of the bond-buying program, known to many as quantitative easing, or QE. “If need be, if there were other factors which would, for example, create an unwanted tightening of monetary policy or, when we discuss growth, we said there were downside risks to growth and price stability, then we will have to review and reconsider the size, the timing, the design of the program,” he said. There are good reasons to suspect the ECB will have to double down on QE. For a start, every other central bank has had to do just that. Nobody seems quite sure how much QE is enough, but it always seems to be more than first thought. It also appears that QE isn’t having quite the impact that was hoped for. Figures released Tuesday showed imports grew at twice the rate of exports in the first quarterÂ  despite a weakened euro . In short, one of the most immediate ways in which QE was supposed to aid the recoveryâ€”a boost to exports from a cheaper currency–simply hasn’t delivered. Fedâ€™s Three-Meeting Ceasefire Could End. TheÂ Federal Reserveâ€™s longest period of public harmony in four years could come to an end next week . The last three statements from the policy-settingÂ Federal Open Market Committeeâ€“issued onÂ Jan. 28,Â March 18Â andÂ April 29â€“all were unanimous. The Fed hadnâ€™t gone more than two meetings in a row without a dissenting vote since the first four meetings of 2011. OCC: Bank Boards Responsible For Culture. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said banksâ€™ boards of directors are responsible for their firmâ€™s culture, the latest indication that regulators are expecting boardrooms to help keep Wall Street out of trouble. Mr. Curryâ€™s statement comes as the OCC and the Federal Reserve have been intensifying their oversight Â  of boards following a raft of guilty pleas and fines at large U.S. banks. The agencies have been meeting as often as monthly with individual directors and singling out boards in private critiques of banksâ€™ risk management. European Officials Dismiss Greek Offer. Greeceâ€™s creditors said the offer didnâ€™t go far enough in meeting creditorsâ€™ demands. Weeks of technical discussion and several high-level political meetings have broughtÂ the two sides together, but the back-and-forth makes clear that fundamental differences remain over how to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt and possibly leaving the eurozone. Makuch: ECB Measures Are Helping. The European Central Bank’s 1.1 trillion euro ($1.24 trillion) bond-buying program coupled with previous liquidity-boosting measures have worked in tandem to fuel an economic recovery in the eurozone, Slovak central bank governor Jozef Makuch said Tuesday. Regardless of the ECB’s stimulus program, eurozone countries, including Slovakia, still have to seek balanced finances and channel their expenditures “on growth-fueling programs,” Mr. Makuch said, referring to using tax payers’ money on infrastructure projects rather than non-investment government spending. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. Bank of Japan Governorâ€™s Remarks Jolt Markets. Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda jolted financial markets Wednesday with comments suggesting then yenâ€™s relative value may not decline further , in the latest sign of the struggle by Tokyo policy makers to send the right messages to currency markets. BOJ Board Member Sato Says Lowering Interest Rates Getting More Difficult.Â The Bank of Japan may have hit a snag in its quest to lower borrowing costs through massive debt purchases, a central bank board member said Wednesday, in a direct challenge to the sanguine observations of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda. Â Speaking to business leaders in Yamanashi prefecture, east of Tokyo, Takehiro Sato said that the central bank is starting to have difficulties pushing down interest rates partly because of falling market liquidity and decreasing demand from investors–Dow Jones Newswires. PBOC Lowers China 2015 GDP, CPI Growth Forecasts.Â Researchers with China’s central bank have revised down their forecasts for the country’s economic growth and consumer inflation for 2015, citing increased downward pressure on economic growth. They now forecast China’s economy will expand 7%, slightly lower than a projection of 7.1% made six months ago, the People’s Bank of China said in a report posted on its website Tuesday. Â The report also lowered the forecast for this year’s consumer inflation to 1.4% from 2.2% . AKPâ€™s Loss In Turkey Elections Could Help Central Bank.Â As Turkeyâ€™s politicians contemplated the first coalition since the AKP swept to power in 2002, the governmentâ€™sÂ weakening grip on the stateÂ could emerge as a boon for the countryâ€™s beleaguered central bank . Turkeyâ€™s central bank typically resists interest-rate increases to avoid angering the government andÂ President Recep Tayyip ErdoganÂ who arguesâ€“against economic orthodoxyâ€“that lowering rates will slow inflation. That stance has crimped central bank Governor Erdem Basciâ€™s ability to fight inflation, and in January 2014 forced him toÂ more than double the benchmark rateÂ to 10% to counter a massive emerging-market selloff. New Zealand Walks Rates Tightrope. New Zealandâ€™s central bank, which went harder and faster than almost any other in raising interest rates since the financial crisis, may be set to reverse course . Iceland Raises Interest Rates as Central Bank Eyes Price Stability.Â Icelandâ€™s central bank raised its key interest rates on Wednesday and said it may have to hike rates even further to ensure price stability, as the country starts to phase out strict capital controls while juggling higher than expected wage settlements. Kenya Central Bank Moves Aggressively to Defend Shilling. Kenyaâ€™s central bank surprised analysts on Tuesday by raising interest rates aggressively in a bid to control the slide of the Kenyan shilling against the dollar. The shilling had been trading at three-and-a-half year lows against the U.S. dollar before the monetary policy committee, in a meeting originally scheduled for July 9, pushed up its benchmark rate by 150 basis points to 10% . The move was 50 basis points higher than economistsâ€™ consensus had predicted. Hungary central bank to Help Convert Loans. Hungary’s central bank said Tuesday it is ready to use part of its foreign-currency reserves to help reduce the exposure of some 250,000 households to foreign-exchange risk. The National Bank of Hungary is ready to supply an additional 1.1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) from its reserves to retail banks and other financial services firms to convert households’ outstanding car, personal and other foreign-currency loans into Hungarian forints, the central bank said. â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. An Invitation. Federal Reserve officials are considering an interest rate increase for the first time in nearly a decade, but they face a complicated economic backdrop. Join Wall Street Journal Chief Economics Correspondent Jon Hilsenrath for a breakfast interview with Fed Governor Jerome Powell on June 23 at 8:30 a.m. at the St. Regis, 16th Street NW, Washington D.C. to explore how the Fed is navigating the tough decisions that loom. RSVP here . Record Job Openings. The U.S. had 5.4 million job openings in April, up from 5.1 million in March and the highest level since the department began conducting theÂ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as Jolts, in 2000 . Effects of the Fedâ€™s Inflation Objective Announcement. The Fedâ€™s Alan Detmeister, Doeus Jorento, Emily Massaro and Ekaterina Peneva take a look at expectations that followed the Fedâ€™s inflation target. â€œThe data suggest that the FOMC’s announcement of an explicit inflation objective had some effect on professional forecasters’ long-run inflation expectations, but not on households’ expectations. Admittedly, inflation expectations of professional forecasters did not immediately jump to the FOMC’s objective, so it is not clear just how much of change in professional forecasters’ expectations can be attributed to the FOMC’s announcement versus other factors, such as a general reduction in uncertainty as economic conditions improved and actual inflation remained moderate,â€? they conclude. Inflation Expectations and Consumption. On VoxEU, Francesco Dâ€™Acunto, Daniel Hoang and Michael Weber are also interested in inflation expectations and study recent data from Germany and find that â€œmonetary and fiscal policies that increase inflation expectations can therefore successfully spur aggregate consumption in the short run.â€? Bernanke: Follow the FOMC, Not the Board. On his Brookings Institution blog, former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke responds to Benn Steilâ€™s op-ed in Tuesdayâ€™s Journal arguing that the Federal Reserve Board was more important in setting rates than the Federal Open Market Committee. â€œIf you want to understand and predict Fed decisions on interest rates, you will be well advised to follow the debates among the FOMC and its leadership,â€? Bernanke writes. â€œThe views of Board members are relevant, of course, but because Board members are also voters on the FOMC, not because there is any risk that the Board will try to block implementation of an FOMC decision.â€? Volatility is a QE Bug, Not a Feature. Writing in the Journal, Marcello Minenna points to the ECBâ€™s rule that its bond-buying program cannot buy securities on the secondary market with yields of less than -0.2%. â€œApproaching the -0.2% limit becomes for traders a signal that itâ€™s time to sell, since a bondâ€™s price wonâ€™t rise any further once it becomes ineligible under QE and the central banks stop buying. Instead, suddenly banks and other investors start creating excess supply of bonds as they attempt to take profits on their holdings. The recent swings in German bund prices can be explained largely by these trading patterns,â€? he writes. QE’s Third Channel: Central Bank Reserves. In a posting on VoxEu, Jens Christensen of theÂ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Signe Krogstrup of the Swiss National Bank identify a third channel through which quantitative easing lowers long-term interest rates: the increase in central bank reserves on commercial banksâ€™ balance sheets.Â Â ”If reserve-induced effects are material, the implication is that QE programmes can be implemented through purchases of assets other than long-term bonds and still reduce long-term yields,” they write. News Coverage Smells Inflation. News coverage of the global economy was little changed in May, although inflation news signaled some price pressures are building , according to The Absolute Strategy Research/Wall Street Journal global composite newsflow indexÂ released Tuesday. Mexican Inflation Falls Below Central Bankâ€™s Target. Mexican consumer prices fell more than expected in May, due to declines in electricity costs and agricultural prices that helped push the annual inflation rate below the central bank’s 3% target–Dow Jones Newswires. The Bank of Russia resumed topping up the country’s international reserves on Monday after putting daily interventions on hold late last week when the ruble weakened to its lowest since early April–Dow Jones Newswires.
