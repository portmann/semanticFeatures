St. Louis Fed’s Bullard: Appropriate to Think Fed Will Wait to Raise Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ ST. LOUISâ€”It is appropriate to think the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates at its June policy meeting following a recent run of weak economic data, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Wednesday. “I would like to move on the back of good news, basically, and I think it’s very difficult to say that you’re trying to normalize interest rates just at the moment where the economy looks a little bit weaker,” Mr. Bullard told reporters at the regional reserve bank’s headquarters. “I think this is all transitory, but that’s where we are.” Asked about the Fed’s June 16-17 policy meeting, Mr. Bullard said, “The joy of being data-dependent is that you can wait until the meeting actually occurs. You don’t have to say what’s going to happen before the meeting occurs. But I think the shifts that are apparent in market-based thinking are completely appropriate given the weaker data that we’ve had through the spring.” Most Fed officials have said they expect to begin raising the benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal-funds rate, later this year. The Fed in March opened the door to a rate increase as soon as June. But a stretch of weak economic data have made a June rate increase appear less likely in recent months. Most private economists now believe the Fed’s first rate increase will come in September , not June. Mr. Bullard has been an advocate for raising rates sooner rather than later . “Now may be a good time to begin normalizing monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next couple of years,” he said in April. In March, he said the risks of keeping rates pinned near zero for too long “may be substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Bullard said he thinks the Fed isn’t very far from achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. He also said he thinks seasonal-adjustment issues skewed the contractionary reading on gross domestic product during the first quarter . “We should be and are appropriately talking about how to normalize monetary policy,” Mr. Bullard said. “On the other hand, you’ve got near-term concerns–the first-quarter negative GDP number and maybe some consumption numbers, including retail sales–that look weaker than we had anticipated. I think that will all be transient, and it will turn out that we’ll have stronger data later in the year and that will enable us to get going on the normalization process. But I would like to see that confirmed in the near term, so that we can get on with our normalization process.” Mr. Bullard spoke with reporters before Athanasios Orphanides, former head of the Cyprus central bank and an ex-Fed economist, delivered the St. Louis Fed’s annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. Mr. Orphanides told reporters he is “quite concerned that the Fed is way behind the curve already” in terms of tightening policy.
