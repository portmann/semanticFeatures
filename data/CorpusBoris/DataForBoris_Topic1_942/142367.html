Grand Central: A 2013 Feel to the BOE’s “Super Thursday” - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of England’s “Super Thursday” came and went, and changed little. For most of the Monetary Policy’s Committee’s nine members, early 2016 remains the most likely time for a first rate rise since 2007, and a first move in any direction since 2009. With the U.K. economy having picked up steam again in the second quarter, some BOE watchers thought a move was possible as early as November, and expected as many as three dissenting votes in the August policy meeting. That helps explain why the massive information dump was widely seen as having a “dovish” tone, underlined by the fact that Ian McCafferty was alone in voting to raise the benchmark Bank rate. There were two big developments since the May forecasts that left policy makers in no rush for liftoff. First, productivity growth has finally picked up, having disappointed over recent years. In his news conference, Governor Mark Carney welcomed that development, although he stressed that policy makers aren’t entirely convinced that it will be sustained. “We haven’t run to the other side of the boat,” Mr. Carney said. A move to the other side of the boat would mean a later start to raising rates than previously expected, since much faster productivity growth means it would take longer to use up the slack in the economy, still estimated at about half a percentage point of gross domestic product. The other big change was sterling’s strength, which exacerbated the dampening effect of lower commodity prices on inflation. Mr. Carney described the U.K. currencyâ€™s behavior as “a big move” andÂ  said there was “no question” it was having an impact on policy. Taken together, those changes led to a significant lowering of the forecast for inflation over the coming 12 months. But the underlying strength of the economic recovery seems to be little questioned by policy makers, and they also see wage growth continuing to pick up. They still expect inflation to rise to their target by mid-2017, and then move above it. Of the two ongoing changes, sterling has the greatest potential to disrupt the timing of a first move. But it would take a very sharp further appreciation to force a delay into late 2016. When Mr. Carney took the helm at the BOE in mid-2013, early 2016 was penciled in as the likely timing for a first rate increase. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then, and market expectations have shifted dramatically along the way, but that first hunch seems set to prove correct. A Bad Jobs Report Still Might Not Shake Fedâ€™s View. Federal Reserve officials lately have been pretty upbeat about the economic outlook, a key reason they are talking about raising short-term interest rates as soon as September. Economists surveyed ahead of Fridayâ€™s jobs report expected the Labor Department to report a 5.3% unemployment rate in July and payroll employment gains of 215,000. Thatâ€™s likely enough to satisfy the Fedâ€™s view that the job market is producing solid gains. Even a disappointing report might not be enough to dissuade Fed officials from their view. Inflation Expectations Fall. A measure of U.S. inflation expectation in the bond market tumbled to the lowest level in nearly five months as U.S. crude oil prices fell to near the lowest level of 2015, potentially complicating the Federal Reserveâ€™s plan to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006. The 10-year breakeven rate, or the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, was recently at 1.66 percentage point, the lowest level since March. Jobless Claims Rise but Indicate Firming Labor Market. The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for jobless benefits last weekÂ  edged up slightly Â but remained at a level consistent with a firming labor market. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs,Â rose by 3,000Â to a seasonally adjusted 270,000 in the week ended Aug. 1, the Labor Department said Thursday. BOJ Gov Kuroda Acknowledges Possible Delay in Achieving 2% Inflation.Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Friday that the central bank could fall behind its schedule to generate 2% inflation if oil prices fail to recover , acknowledging uncertainties over his bullish projections.Â ”Depending on movements in crude oil prices–particularly oil futures prices–I think it is possible that we will achieve the goal a little earlier or later” than currently planned, Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference in response to questions over sliding global petroleum costs. Brazil Expects to Keep Rates High. Brazil’s central bank gave a cautiously optimistic assessment of its monetary policy Thursday, increasing the odds that borrowing costs will remain high for a long time as policymakers attempt to tame inflation. The bank raised its benchmark Selic interest rate to 14.25% last week and said in the minutes from that meeting, published Thursday, that monetary tightening is working, but changes in fiscal policy arenâ€™t helping. Australiaâ€™s Central Bank Lowers Unemployment Forecast. Slower-than-expected population growth in Australia is playing havoc with forecasts for the resource-rich economy. The countryâ€™s central bank Friday revised lower its expected path for unemployment, saying the jobless rate is set to remain little changed for the next 18 months, instead of drifting higher as earlier predicted . Rupiah to Rebound After Fed Raises Rates, Indonesian Central Banker Says.Â The Indonesian rupiah will likely rebound after the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates, Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor Mirza Adityaswara said Friday.Â ”It will be just like last time ahead of the Fed tapering. The market was stable after the Fed started to reduce its liquidity injection,” Mr. Adityaswara said–Dow Jones Newswires. Chinese Banks Ramp up Lending to Companies for Projects Abroad. Despite a sluggish economy at home, Beijing is pushing through a new wave of credit-fueled overseas investment to stir growth. Over the past year, Chinese banks have ramped up lending to Chinese companies to head abroad and take part in infrastructure joint ventures.Â They have also lent more to overseas borrowers, from shipping companies in Greece to renewable-energy projects in Malaysia, to fund the construction of dams, power plants and railroads .Â  -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Labor Department releases jobs report for July St Louis Fed Examines Link Between Oil Prices, Inflation Expectations The correlation between oil prices and inflation expectations has become much stronger since the financial crisis, St. Louis Fed economist Alejandro Badel argues in a study spanning inflation expectations and crude oil prices. While just 0.13 when examining the period from 2003 through 2015, the correlation was 0.54 through December 2007, and it was 0.75 afterward. Retirement Makes You Healthier As Well As Happier.Â New research suggests retiring will improve both your health and your satisfaction with life. Thereâ€™s also little evidence that retirement influences health care utilization, according to authors Aspen Gorry and Devon Gorry, both professors at Utah State University, and Sita Slavov, a professor at George Mason University .Â â€œThe health improvements that occur after retirement are likely to come without added expenses,â€? they write. Fridayâ€™s Jobs Report to Offer Signals for the Fed.Â While Fridayâ€™s jobs report is unlikely to alter the U.S. labor marketâ€™s general outlook, it is likely to influence the date for the Fedâ€™s first interest rate increase inÂ more than nineÂ years, Mohamed El-Erian writes for Bloomberg View. â€œThe Fed doesn’t need a super strong jobs reportÂ in orderÂ toÂ actÂ in September,â€? he says, adding â€œjust a slight strengthening of labor market conditions (particularly on the wage front) would be enough toÂ increase the probability of a September rate hike.â€? Currency changes and contracts: Lessons for Greece. Writing for VoxEU, Sebastian Edwards argues that Greece would likely face litigation in international courts if it were to abandon the euro. Looking back toÂ Franklin D Rooseveltâ€™s devaluation of the US dollar to give an historical perspective on currency devaluations and contract litigation, Mr Edwards writes that “Roosevelt got away with it because the Supreme Court ruled that prices in old contracts were void and, importantly, because everyone trusted the Supreme Courtâ€™s rulings. Grexit would mean litigation in international courts â€“ courts that are likely to side with the plaintiffs.” Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, Debt Relief, and the Future of the Eurozone. Â Writing for the Bruegel think tank, Ashoka Mody argues that Germany’s powerful finance minister is wrong to claim debt relief can’t be granted to a eurozone member under the currency area’s rules. “If Greece creates a precedent, then either the crisis management system goes, or a transfer union is effectively in place, with Germany on the hook,” he writes. “Hence his call for Greeceâ€™s exit is accompanied by an equal vigorous effort to control the budgets the euro area sovereigns. Acrimony is bound to follow, creating deeper divisions in Europe.” -China faces hurdles to its yuan reserve currency bid, as Beijing will likely have to move ahead with market liberalization before the International Monetary Fund labels the countryâ€™s yuan a reserve currency , IMF officials said Tuesday. -Export orders for Germanyâ€™s important manufacturing industry rose sharply in June, despite a slowing Chinese economy and lingering concerns about Greek debt . Export orders surged 2% in June on weaker euro and increase in bulk orders. -The Czech Republic’s foreign-exchange reserves rose in July, as the country’s central bank made limited transactions in spot markets earlier in the month, data released Friday showed. The central bank said its end-July reserves were worth EUR51.21 billion ($56.16 billion), up from EUR51.00 billion at the end of June–Dow Jones Newswires.
