FOMC Is In Session And Banks Are Salivating | Seeking Alpha Celan Bryant , An Insider's Analysis of Banks (108 clicks) The FOMC is meeting to discuss a possible rate hike. Professor Aswath Damodaran recently published an article discussing many of the myths and fears associated with interest rate hikes in terms of their impact on the economy. While I agree that a rate hike will have little impact on the general economy, I believe it is quite significant for the banking industry. Professor Aswath Damodaran recently published an article titled, The Fed, Interest Rates And Stock Prices: Fighting The Fear Factor . The article provides a thoughtful and well-supported overview of the mythology surrounding the world of rate hikes. As always, he demystifies and clarifies, and I love him for this. I highly recommend reading his article if you haven't already. He is, quite frankly, my favorite Professor - I mean the man is brilliant. Still, his latest article left out the topic of "banks" and this lowly grasshopper felt the need to add something to the master's elegant argument. While a rate hike will have little consequence for the general economy, it will be quite meaningful for the banking industry on day 1. And, contrary to the talking heads (the Wall Street Journal just published an article titled: Even If the Fed Raises Rates, Bank Stocks Could Suffe r) bankers are awaiting the rate hike like the second coming; I assure you, bottles and cigars are already on ice. Some banks that are over-exposed to variable-rate debt will have a hard time, and I've written articles about these banks; however most will experience abnormal returns for a reason few are discussing. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying interest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently enacted Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008. FRB Press Relase So, basically the above quote from the Federal Reserve is saying that the Fed must pay banks interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve. Not just required reserves, but all reserves. The goal of this rule was to "promote banking efficiency". I don't have time to analyze the poor logic of this rationale, but I do have time to profit from it, which is why I started " An Insider's Analysis of Banks ". To date, it is the only service in the Seeking Alpha Marketplace to focus on the banking sector - everyone's interested in sexier industries like biotech. They don't know that we've entered a Golden Age for banks, a new era, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Two years after the Fed was given the ability to pay banks interest on reserves, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the Federal Reserve dominion over the nation's financial stability. It quite literally became a mandate. ..the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) expanded the mandate and authority of the Federal Reserve to allow it to consider risks to financial stability in supervising financial firms under its charge. - Janet Yellen It is this new mandate that's driving many of the changes you see in the banking industry. It is for this reason that the Fed's actions impact the banking industry more than any other; and it is through this sector that the Fed will continue to implement its policy and excerpt its control over the nation's economy. What was the first thing the Fed did? They flooded the market with capital and required banks to maintain more capital through QE or quantitative easing. And, here again, I must disagree with Dr. Damodaran. QE, though similar, was not simply a smaller version of the Treasury's program. Quantitative Easing was a program that put $80+ billion into the money supply every month through banks. Banks received reserves from the Fed, not interest. The Fed purchased bad paper from banks and banks were happy to sell it in exchange for an increase in their "reserves" account. To be clear, the Fed did not write banks a check when they purchased these "toxic securities", they simply added more zeroes to their reserve account. "Hey Fed. I got some bad, sub-par paper, you want it?" "Sure, I'll take. That's what we do. I'm all about Financial Stability. I'll just add that to your reserve account." "Thanks, Fed. Can't wait for those rates to go up." Indeed, reserve levels reached an all time high at the end of last year, which is when the QE program ended. So, when the Fed was first given the authority to pay interest to banks, this was an irrelevant discussion. Today, however, with over $2.4 trillion in reserves, a .25% rate hike can be quite significant (I'll quantify the significance a bit later). While the money supply has grown tremendously over the past seven years through QE, most of those funds are held at the Fed in the form of "excess reserves". It looks like the Fed views the $2.4 trillion - $2.8 trillion range as an appropriate level of reserves to be able to control the sector, at least at today's rates. How Is This Connected To The Fed Funds Rate? The Fed Funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend to one another through the Fed, was a useful tool for control prior to 2010. Now, banks have record reserves at the Fed -- who needs to borrow from another bank? Raising the Fed Funds rate is akin to pushing on a string. As a result, the Fed had to figure out another way to get that power back, so it began connecting the interest rate paid to banks (IOER) to the Fed Funds rate. Ben Bernanke began connecting the IOER to the Fed Funds rate in late 2013. The actual use of the IOER as a tool, however, was not formalized until late 2014 along with the QE exit plan (this has all been very well planned out). Indeed, the details were laid out in the FOMC minutes from the February meeting: Set the IOER rate equal to the top of the target range for the Federal Funds rate and set the offering rate associated with an ON RRP facility equal to the bottom of the target range for the Federal Funds rate. Allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated to support policy implementation; adjust the IOER rate and the parameters of the ON RRP facility, and use other tools such as term operations, as necessary for appropriate monetary control, based on policymakers' assessments of the efficacy and costs of their tools. The Committee expects that it will be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility fairly soon after it commences policy firming. The overnight repo facility (ON RRP) was created for the same purpose as the IOER. They are both tools for the Fed to attract deposits from banks or depository institutions. The only difference is that the IOER will always be higher than the ON RRP. In this way, the Fed has manufactured an arbitrage market for "Fed Funds" in its own back yard. From a policy perspective, this is a way to increase the money supply, while keeping it mostly at the Federal Reserve. (Subscribers can access a list of organizations eligible for the ON RRP here ; note the GSEs and money market funds.) What exactly does this mean? If the new target range set for the Fed Funds rate is .25% to .50%, the IOER will be set at .50%. The IOER acts like a magnate by pulling the Fed Funds rate up to a ceiling. The math looks something like this: And, if we were to graph this chart it would look something like this, with the Fed Funds rate falling squarely in the middle. There are those that believe the Fed plans on draining reserves; that is, they believe the Fed wants the reserves/deposits held at the Fed to go down, but this is the opposite of what the Fed wants. Additionally, the economy simply can't absorb $2.4 trillion in reserves without going into hyperinflation, which is the Fed's worst nightmare. So, while the Fed is watching GDP (which grew 3.7% in Q2), it is also monitoring balances at the Federal Reserve that are driven primarily by loan activity. The FDIC reports on the level of reserves held at the Fed every quarter in the FDIC Quarterly . What did the Quarterly have to say about reserves held at the Fed in Q2? Total loans and leases rose by $185 billion (2.2 percent). C&I loans increased by $49.4 billion (2.8 percent), residential mortgage loans rose by $24.7 billion (1.3 percent), credit card balances grew by $21.2 billion (3.1 percent), and loans to nondepository financial institutions increased by $18 billion (7.6 percent). This last loan category is up 39.9 percent over the 12 months ended June 30. Here's a chart comparing 2015 Q2 activity to the last 8 years. So, we are approaching an uncomfortable level of loan activity for the Fed. Remember, the Fed's mandate is stabilizing the economy, not growing it. One of my favorite speeches by Chair Janet Yellen is, ' Normalizing Monetary Policy: Prospects and Perspectives ', one that's often overlooked. She originally gave the speech at a conference in San Francisco on March 27. In it, it becomes clear that Yellen is not looking at the same information "market oracles, Fed watchers and CNBC pundits" are looking at, as Dr. Damodaran alludes to in his article. This is what she had to say: ...we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of monetary policy are felt only after long lags. This means that policymakers cannot wait until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy. I would not consider it prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the verge of reaching, our inflation objective. Doing so would create too great a risk of significantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment... A substantial body of theory, informed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource utilization continues to tighten. It is largely for this reason that a significant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not be a precondition for me to judge that an initial increase in the Federal Funds rate would be warranted. My point is, everyone's looking at current numbers and Yellen is looking eight quarters out. Based on current rates of growth in both the economy and reserves, I would not be surprised if we get a rate hike tomorrow. Here's a dot plot of a survey taken from the FOMC participants at the July meeting showing the likely pace of rate hikes over the next few years: And, this is an excerpt from the FOMC minutes which were released along with this dot plot. Results from the Desk's July Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that a majority of respondents to both surveys continued to view the September 2015 meeting as the most likely time for the first increase in the target range for the Federal Funds rate... The point is, rates are going up. Maybe not tomorrow, but they are going up and the banking industry, much more so than the rest of the economy, has good reason to salivate at the prospect. Conclusion: Banks Are About To Get PAID For the general economy, I fully agree with Professor Damodaran. He's saying we make too big of a deal about rate hikes and their impact on the market economy. By doing so, we also give the Fed too much power. I get that. Yellen and most of the top economists out there agree with Dr. Damodaran as well. Before 2008, banks were effectively getting paid 0 percent interest. Now they are getting .25 percent, and .25 percent on $2.5 trillion in reserves is $6.25 billion. If the FOMC sets the Fed Funds rate to 2.25 percent over the next 5 years it will pay ~$156 billion to banks. At 4 percent (the historical Fed Funds average), it goes to $250 billion. For perspective, according to the FDIC's annual report , total full-year bank earnings were $152.7 billion in 2014. And, yes, I agree with Dr. Damodaran, the Fed runs the risk of loosing some credibility in the general economy. Here's the example he provided in his article which I love, and so must share: The best analogy that I can offer for the Fed and its role on interest rates is the story of Chanticleer , a rooster that is the strutting master of the barnyard that he lives in, revered by the other farm animals because he is the one who causes the sun to rise every morning with his crowing (or so they think). In the story, Chanticleer's hubris leads him to abandon his post one morning, and when the sun comes up anyway, the rooster loses his exalted standing. Given the buildup we have had over the last few years to the momentous decision to change interest rate policy, think of how much our perceptions of Fed power will change, if stock and bond markets respond with yawns to an interest rate policy shift. I could never have come up with a better way to describe the Fed's dilemma - this is what makes Damodaran such a good teacher. Are you in any doubt of the message? That said, banks don't care about the Fed's reputation like we do. They don't even care if the Fed Funds rate doesn't hold. Indeed, the slope may end up being much steeper. In other words, it may take a .75 percent increase in the IOER to achieve a .25 percent increase in the Fed Funds rate. Meanwhile, whatever happens, banks are still getting paid the IOER - whether it's the effective Fed Funds rate or not. A year from now those market oracles, Fed watchers and CNBC pundits may be wondering why market rates aren't following the Fed Funds target, but banks will still be getting paid. Bottom line: I wouldn't be surprised if rates go up tomorrow. If they do, make no mistake about it, banks are popping bottles. I know I will be.
