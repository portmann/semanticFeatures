New Regulations May Lower Chance of Another Crisis, Bernanke Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who headed the central bank from 2006 to 2014, said itâ€™s impossible to rule out the possibility of future crises. Efforts to strengthen regulatory oversight of financial institutions in the U.S. following the 2008 debacle should make future crises less likely to occur, or less severe if they do, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Friday. “Nobody knows where the next shot will be,” Mr. Bernanke told bankers at a convention in the Mexican resort of Acapulco. The man who led the Fed through the worst financial crisis since 1929, and an expert on the Great Depression, said itâ€™s impossible to rule out the possibility of future crises. “I hope we don’t get tested.” Steps such as submitting large banks to Fed stress tests to assess risk should lessen the likelihood of another crisis or soften the broader economic impact should one occur, he added. Mr. Bernanke, who headed the central bank from 2006 to 2014, gave no view on when the Fed is likely to start raising short-term interest rates from near zero, except to say that its communications efforts could mean much of the related market volatility will precede the first rate increase and investors may embark on a relief rally once rates rise. “The trick is always when to move,” he said, since raising rates too soon risks crimping the recovery, while waiting too long risks letting inflation rise to undesirable levels. Mr. Bernanke said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Abenomicsâ€”Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s eponymous program designed to lift Japan out of deflation and into steady long-term growthâ€”can render results. But he was less so about Europe’s prospects for economic improvement via monetary policy, noting that the European Central Bank’s new bond-buying program lacks fiscal support and is being implemented “rather late.” Plus, there are the problems in Greece. “Monetary policy can only do so much,” Mr. Bernanke said. If efforts in Japan and Europe fail to stoke demand and economic improvement, the Fed will face additional headwinds, he said.
