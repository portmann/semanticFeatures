Grand Central: Digging Deeper Into the Strange Seasonality of Fed Decision-Making - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fedâ€™s Rate Decisions Hang on Dollar, Growth Concerns Swedish Central Banker Sees Inflation Heading in the Right Direction Thereâ€™s a good deal of talk these days about the seasonality of post-crisis economic patterns. The first quarter seems to be a perpetual disappointment. As researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s Macroblo g pointed out last week, output in the first quarter has grown at a 0.6% average rate during the past five years, compared to a 2.9% average during the remaining three quarters of the year. It is a development that has gotten the attention of senior officials . What gets less attention, if any, is the seasonal pattern that seems to have set in on Fed decision-making in the post-crisis environment. Many of the Fedâ€™s biggest decisions since the 2007-2009 crisis have happened between the months of August and December. The Fedâ€™s second bond-buying program (QE2) was launched in November 2010. Interest rate guidance tied to calendar dates was launched in August 2011. A program to extend the maturity of its bond holdings, known as Operation Twist, was launched in September 2011. The third bond-buying program (QE3) set sail in September 2012. Economic thresholds meant to guide interest rate decisions were introduced in December 2012. QE3 was also expanded that month. The Fed decided to taper its bond purchases in December 2013. It ended bond purchases in October 2014. Then it shifted its interest rate guidance away from assurances of low rates for a considerable period in December 2014. You can peruse the statements around these shifts here. Some tweaks in its decision-making have happened in the first half of the year. For instance, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen altered interest rate guidance in March 2014 and again in March this year. Still, the Fedâ€™s biggest calls seem to be happening in the second half of the year. No wonder the Fedâ€™s annual Jackson Hole retreat hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City every August has become something of an annual spectacle where investors look for big clues on what is to come. This might all be coincidence, or there might be a broader pattern setting in. Fed officials do seem to be spending a good part of the first half of the year trying to figure out if their economic forecasts are holding up to the stream of incoming economic data. It might be the case that it takes several months to assess the accuracy of annual forecasts and formulate responses as the outlook shifts. If the pattern holds, then the Fedâ€™s call on raising short-term interest rates is still several months away. As the Journal reported last week, a June rate hike looks like an increasingly remote possibility, thanks to another winter filled with economic growth disappointment s. Â In a story today, we examine how the shifting currency backdrop is a key factor giving Fed officials trepidation about moving too quickly. Maybe we should all take off until August. Fedâ€™s Rate Decisions Hang on Dollar, Growth Concerns. The strong U.S. dollar and an unsteady global economy are emerging as primary concerns for Federal Reserve officials as they prepare for a policy meeting next week to consider their coming steps on interest rates. The Fed has already said itâ€™s unlikely to raise rates next week and officials in recent interviews and public comments have signaled a rate increase in June has become less likely because the economy slowed in the first quarter. As they discuss the outlook beyond midyear officials are increasingly weighing how much the strong dollar might have hurt the prospects of achieving their economic forecast of near-3% annual growth, gradual increases in inflation and continued declines in unemployment.

Each time the Federal Reserve has suggested it will pull back on easy money policies, the marketâ€™s negative reaction makes it harder to follow through.
