Nowotny Says ECB Canâ€™t Give Greece Interim Funding - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ewald Nowotny, governor of Austria’s central bank, gestures as he addresses the ECB and its watchers conference in Frankfurt, Germany, in Â March. VIENNA–The European Central Bank canâ€™t provide interim funding to Greece under current rules, a member of the central bankâ€™s governing council said. â€œI know that there have been some ideas floating around that we [the ECB] might give some interim financing just like that. I donâ€™t see any legal possibility for that,â€? Ewald Nowotny, who is also Austriaâ€™s central bank governor, told CNBC television in an interview broadcast Thursday. Mr Nowotnyâ€™s comments follow those of other European officials who have played down Greeceâ€™s comments that a bailout deal is on the horizon. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that no substantial progress had been made and Valdis Dombrovskis, the vice president of the European Commission, said the Greek government needed to present a comprehensive reform package to complete the review to receive additional funds. â€œFor us it is quite clear that we have certain conditions to be met, the one condition is for instance whether we can accept … Greek assets, Greek bonds as collateral. The answer for the time being is no,â€? Mr Nowotny said. â€œThere is always a lot of noise in such a situation. I think the important fact is to distinguish the noise from the facts,â€? Mr Nowotny said. The rate setter also repeated earlier comments that the ECBâ€™s low interest rate policies for the eurozone canâ€™t remain in place forever. â€œThe situation of low interest rates is something that makes sense for a certain period of time but that this world of ultra-low interest rates is not a long term equilibrium,â€? Mr. Nowotny said, adding that negative interest rates aren’t a normal element of an economy.
