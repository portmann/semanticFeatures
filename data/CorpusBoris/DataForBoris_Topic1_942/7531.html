Live Blog: Fed Decision and Janet Yellenâ€™s Press Conference - Real Time Economics - WSJ TheÂ Federal ReserveÂ is widely expected to take a step Wednesday toward raising short-term interest rates later this year byÂ  dropping its promise to be â€œpatientâ€? Â in deciding when to start. TheÂ  Fedâ€™s policy making committee Â issues its statement and new economic projections Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, followed by ChairwomanÂ Janet Yellenâ€™sÂ press conference at 2:30 p.m. Follow all the action here. Investors have been relatively calm heading into the big Fed decision. Stocks are down a bit and so are bond yields . Maybe they’re patiently waiting for the Fed to keep the party going longer than most markets now expect. Six decades ago, then-Fed chairman William McChesney Martin helped popularize the “punch bowl” metaphor about the central bank. The Fed, he said at the time, “is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.” As we highlighted today on Real Time Economics , former Fed vice chairwoman Alice Rivlin has some thoughts about that punch bowl metaphor:Â â€œThe proverbial punch bowl is still there and the party-goers never want it taken away. It is a different punch bowl at a different party than it used to beâ€” now related to systemic risk-taking rather than runaway inflation.â€? Ms. Rivlin offers this inflation factoid that’s worth remembering whenever your neighbor screams about runaway prices: Underlying inflation–measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy–has not hit 3% since 1992. That’s a long time to have mild inflation. And it’s also why the Fed, at least behind closed doors, may be worrying about a lot more than inflation these days. In todayâ€™s paper we took a look at some of the recent economic reports that have been disappointing. Industrial production, retail sales and housing starts all have had recent disappointments. The strong dollar, in particular, could pinch U.S. exporters and cause inflation â€” already lower than the Fed prefers â€” to sink ever lower. But thereâ€™s also a chance this will mostly prove transitory. The economy goes through these sorts of wiggles all the time. More often than not the economy snaps out of these brief periods of funk. But sometimes these signs of weakness spread. Weâ€™ll get some idea today of what the Fed thinks. One reason to believe the Fed wonâ€™t be too concerned? The labor market has continued performing well. The unemployment rate is near its lowest in seven years, and job growth is near a 15-year high. Before Chairwoman Janet Yellen was a Fed governor, Fed president or the top official, she was a labor market economist â€” thereâ€™s little that she spends more time thinking about.Â  Chief economics commentator Greg Ip takes a look at the Fedâ€™s conundrum on rate-hike timing in todayâ€™s Capital Account column. On one hand, low inflation argues for the Fed to continue moving slowly and â€” dare one say it?Â  â€” patiently. On the other hand, a return to a normal level of interest rates would be helpful for the Fed to have as a tool to fight the next recession, whenever it comes. Itâ€™s a Catch-22 of sorts. The big question over todayâ€™s meeting is about â€œpatienceâ€? but thereâ€™s also going to be a lot to learn from the Fedâ€™s Summary of Economic Projections. Â Thereâ€™s two key pieces of information in this document:Â  First, this is where Fed policy makers reveal their estimates of how quickly interest rates will rise. Currently the median estimate from the Fed calls for the target interest rate to rise a bit above 1 percent by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of 2016. Thatâ€™s a pretty slow pace of increases compared to 2004-05 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% at every meeting, or by 2 percentage points a year. Second, weâ€™ll see the Fedâ€™s forecasts for GDP, unemployment and inflation. The Fed currently sees pretty strong economic growth, unemployment falling below 5% in the next couple years, and inflation returning to their target, or just underneath it. If those forecasts mostly hold in place, then the likelihood of the first rate increase coming in June could increase. For more on the forecasts, check out the 5 Things to Watch from todayâ€™s meeting. Today will mark Janet Yellenâ€™s fifth press conference since taking over the top spot at the Fed. It will be the 17th press conference overall since Ben Bernanke started the tradition in 2011 after a Yellen-led committee helped shape the format of this ritual. Weâ€™ve followed all 16 here on Real Time Economics. So while youâ€™re demonstrating your patience for the Fedâ€™ decision, you can take a tour through QE ups and downs and all sorts of other excitement in Fed land over the past four years.Â  Since pushing its interest-rate target to near zero in December 2008, the Fed has done three rounds of bond-buying, offered thousands of words of speeches and agonized over wording changes in dozens of policy statements. None of it is as easy to understand as a simple change in interest rates. By moving toward a rate increase, the Fed â€” in theory â€” would be returning to a simpler pre-crisis playbook for policy and communications. Fewer unconventional tools and cleaner policy decisions should make life easier. But none of it will really be all that simple. The crisis changed how Fed officials, and the public, think about their policy approach. Thereâ€™s also a deepening mess around the world weighing on U.S. central bankers. A misstep in using a blunt tool like interest rates could force the Fed back into a corner. Thatâ€™s what today is all about. Will the Federal Reserve drop its â€œpatientâ€? stance from its statement? All signs suggest it will, opening the door to a rate increase as early as June. Whatâ€™s perhaps more important out of today is how the Fed frames its change in posture.Â  Weâ€™ll have a statement at 2 p.m. ET and then a press conference with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen that should shed more light on the Fedâ€™s plans. previous Housing Waits–and Waits–on Millennials We welcome thoughtful comments from readers. Please comply with our guidelines . Our blogs do not require the use of your real name. The Fed should say that they will be data driven and are "not impatient" to raise rates. Then all the talking heads can spend the next week trying to decide what is the difference between being "patient" versus being "not impatient". If anyone believes in these stupid key words make a difference in what is coming is an utter moron. this is it in your face the Fed will never raise rates because if they did it would be suicide. We are well over 200% over in debt of our GDP and raising rates mean the difference of being able to pay the debt or default. I find it interesting if you are nearing bankruptcy you can not borrow because its called fraud and yet the fed did just that sticking the tax payer with fraudulent debt. The banks should have collapsed in 2008 instead we made the problem 10 times worse. previous Housing Waits–and Waits–on Millennials Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
