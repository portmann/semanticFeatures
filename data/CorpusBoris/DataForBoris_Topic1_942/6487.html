5 Things to Watch in the Fedâ€™s March Meeting - WSJ TheÂ Federal ReserveÂ is widely expected to take a small step Wednesday toward raising short-term interest rates later this year by dropping its promise to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to start. The Fedâ€™s policy making committee issues its statement and new economic projections Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, followed by ChairwomanÂ Janet Yellenâ€™sÂ press conference at 2:30 p.m. Here are a few things to keep an eye on. The committee is likely to strike the â€œpatientâ€? pledge from its policy statement, which would formally open the door to the possibility of a rate increase in June. Watch to see if it provides any other verbal guidance on the outlook for interest rates. The Fed could say, as Ms. Yellen did in recent congressional testimony , that it wonâ€™t start raising its benchmark short-term rate from near zero until it is â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will move back toward the central bankâ€™s 2% target. Based on its current assessment, the committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. In December, Fed officials forecast the unemployment rate to be 5.2% to 5.3% by the end of this year. Since the rate was 5.5% in February, expect them to lower that estimate. Normally, that would imply they could raise interest rates sooner. But watch whether they also lower their estimates for the long-term unemployment rate. In December they pegged the range for the long-term rate at 5.2% to 5.5%. If they nudge that range lower, they could be comfortable letting joblessness keep falling for longer before raising rates. If employment gains have bolstered the case for higher rates, inflation has moved in the opposite direction. It has slipped further below the Fedâ€™s 2% target as oil prices fell sharply, spilling over into other areas. Most Fed officials say they expect inflation to move up toward their target over time. Watch their forecasts to see how long they think it will take. Keep an eye out for any shifts in the Fedâ€™s â€œdot plot,â€? which indicates where individual policy makers expect to see their benchmark interest rate in coming years. Officials have worried that markets are expecting them to raise rates more slowly than the Â central bankers expect. Watch for whether they are more in the marketâ€™s direction or whether that divergence of views is widening. This is the least predictable but also potentially most informative part of Fed day. Reporters will likely question Ms. Yellen on how confident she is about the prospect for an inflation rebound given slowing economic activity in so many large countries around the world. She will also be pressed on her vision of full employment, including how much weight she puts on factors such as depressed labor-force participation or high underemployment in calculating how much further unemployment can fall without triggering too much inflation. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
