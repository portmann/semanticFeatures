Grand Central: Donâ€™t Put Too Much Weight on Atlanta Fed Growth Estimate Yet - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s economic forecasting model seems to be sending an ominous signal about the economyâ€™s current growth prospects. After accurately projecting paltry economic growth in the first quarter, Atlantaâ€™s model is again signaling meager growth in the second. But, as Atlanta Fed Research Director David Altig explained in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Â now is not the time to worry about the signal it is sending. The Atlanta Fed model is called GDPNow . It estimates growth in gross domestic product in the current quarter as the quarter unfolds. The model won praise and attention Â for correctly projecting near zero growth in first-quarter economic output when many Wall Street analysts were predicting expansion at a rate near 1%. The official Commerce Department estimate for the first quarter growth rate is 0.2% and many analysts now expect revisions to reveal a contraction. Looking beyond the first quarter, the Atlanta model estimates growth at a 0.7% rate in the second quarter, a truly dismal rate after a first quarter contraction. However, Mr. Altig noted that the Atlanta Fed model could be misleading early in a quarter, because it doesnâ€™t have a lot of information to go on. â€œIt is not telling us much of anything right at the moment,â€? Mr. Altig said. â€œWhat it is designed really to do is to build up in a consistent and reasonable way toward a real-time quarterly forecast as data comes in. This thing really only starts to send off what we would consider to be a reasonable signal about things as the data accumulates over the quarter. We would not encourage anyone to put a lot of weight on the number that is coming out right now.â€? Case in point: As of Feb. 13, Atlantaâ€™s GDPNow forecast was estimating a 2.3% growth rate for the first quarter. It didnâ€™t tumble toward zero until the final six weeks of the quarter. This is not to say that all is well with the U.S. economy. As the WSJ reported Friday , analyst estimates for first and second quarter growth are indeed coming down after disappointing reports on retail sales, industrial production, trade and inventories. It is within the realm of possibility that the economy wonâ€™t expand much at all in the first half of the year. Itâ€™s just too early to ring alarm bells based on Atlantaâ€™s especially dismal estimate. Growth Hiccups Vex Fed Yet Again. Â A slew of recent soft economic data has fueled fresh expectations of dimmer U.S. growth, underscoring the already-anemic economyâ€™s unusual vulnerability to even fleeting shocks. This softnessâ€”with output possibly flat for the first half of 2015â€”looks set to give Federal Reserve officials pause as they eye when to raise short-term interest rates from near zero. Fedâ€™s Evans: Overshooting Fedâ€™s 2% Price Target May Be A Good Idea. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans renewed his call for the U.S. central bank to refrain from raising short-term interest rates this year , in remarks that said it might not be a bad idea for officials to allow inflation to rise above their 2% target for at least a time. More Bad News from Forecasters. Fed staffers and private sector economists are becoming increasingly glum about the prospect that the U.S. economy will rebound strongly in the second half of 2015 after a shaky start to the year. Staff economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said growth will fall short of the 3% some had hoped for in the second half of the year. And forecasters polled by theÂ Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released FridayÂ  sharply lowered their outlook for U.S. economic growth Â after a raft of weak data. Economists polled now see U.S. gross domestic product expanding just 2.4% this year, down from a median 3.2% estimate in the first quarter survey. But the Outlook for Graduates Could Be Improving. The New York Fed says the labor market for college graduates is improving, pointing to an uptick in job openings requiring a college degree . The numbers show postings for college jobs rebounded right after the recession, then leveled off around 2013 and declined slightly through mid-2014. But since last summer, the number of postings is up more than 10%. A better job market for college graduates could signal a coming increase in wages, which have stayed stubbornly low throughout the recovery. China Reverses Course on Local Debt. Authorities are so desperate to boost the countryâ€™s growth that they have shelved a longstanding effort to clamp down on local governmentsâ€™ ability to tap into government-sponsored financing companies. Heavy reliance on those companies has been blamed for the heavy run-up of local government debt in recent years. The move comes after a string of monetary-easing measures over the last year have proved inadequate to counter a real-estate downturn and flagging factory output. Bank of Japan Relaxing All-Out Approach to Hitting Inflation Target. Â The Bank of Japan appears to be relaxing its stance of doing whatever it takes to quickly reach its 2.0% inflation target, as it opts to wait for tightening labor conditions and higher economic growth to push up prices. Raising Definition of Price Stability â€˜Misguidedâ€™, Says ECBâ€™s Mersch. Â The European Central Bank canâ€™t change the fundamental goal of its monetary policy, even in times that call for extraordinary measures, said European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch in remarks published Monday. Consumption to Help German Economy to Grow, Bundesbank Says. Â The German economy is expected to continue to grow on the back of consumption, the countryâ€™s central bank said Monday, less than a week after the country recorded sluggish growth in the first quarter. Swiss Central Bank Satisfied With Negative Rate Impact.Â The Swiss National Bank is satisfied its negative interest rates are damping demand for the Swiss franc although the currency remains “highly valued” against the euro, governing board member Fritz Zurbruegg said in an interview with the Berner Zeitung–Dow Jones Newswires. Australia Central Bank Sees Economic Transition Working.Â The Australian central bank’s deputy governor expressed confidence that a transition away from the country’s reliance on the mining industry was proceeding well thanks to a lower currency, modest wage growth, and record-low interest rates. New Indicator on the Way. TheÂ Commerce DepartmentÂ this summer will add to its gross domestic product calculations withÂ  two new sets of figures Â on economic output, adding another data point for economic observers to pore over. The first merges GDP with gross domestic income, which also measures economic growth but from the point of view of incomes. The combined measure is intended to provide more reliable estimates. The second, known as final sales to private domestic purchases tracks demand from businesses and consumers but not the more volatile government, inventory and international trade data. Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers called it â€œa more accurate predictor of next-quarter GDP than GDP itself .â€? -Bank Indonesia releases a policy statement -11:45 a.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Poloz speaks in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island -12:30 p.m. EDT: RBIâ€™s Rajan speaks in New York -1 p.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Poloz speaks at press conference in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island -2:30 p.m. EDT: Financial Stability Oversight Council meets in Washington -0700 GMT (3 a.m. EDT): Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans speaks in Munich -0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT): Bank of England releases minutes of its May 7-8 policy meeting -Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey releases a policy statement -1315 GMT (9:15 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Weale speaks in London -1730 GMT (1:30 p.m. EDT): Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on â€œPast, Present, and Future Challenges for the Euro Areaâ€? at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -7 p.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on a panel about central bank reforms in Stanford, Calif. -Bank of Japan releases a policy statement -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Draghi speaks at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Praet chairs session on inflation and unemployment at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -0945 GMT (5:45 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Shafik speaks in Manchester, England -1100 GMT (7 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Carney, Bank of Mexicoâ€™s Carstens speak on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s ConstÃ¢ncio chairs session on employment, productivity and growth at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -1030 GMT (6:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Honohan speaks on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -1330 GMT (9:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Draghi, Fedâ€™s Fischer, BOJâ€™s Kuroda speak on a panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Liquidity Mismatch Can Predict Bank Failures. The Dallas Fed finds that liquidity mismatch â€“ the risk of banks being unable to come up with cash for assets or to pay for obligations â€“ can predict bank failure and distress one year ahead. â€œA five percentage point rise in liquidity mismatch raises the probability of failure or distress in the next year about 0.25 percentage points,â€? write J.B. Cooke, Christoffer Koch and Anthony Murphy. â€œBy contrast, a one percentage-point fall in equity capital (as a share of assets) raises the probability about 0.5 percentage points.â€? What Happened to Inflation? The Peterson Instituteâ€™s William R. Cline studies why inflation has been muted in the wake of the Federal Reserveâ€™s quantitative easing program. Boosting the money supply might have led to inflation between the 1960s and 1980s, but thatâ€™s no longer the case. â€œThe sharp increase in banks’ excess reserves and corresponding sharp decline in the â€˜money multiplierâ€™ after the Great Recession has meant that the rise in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has not translated into increased money available to the public in the usual fashion. But if nascent inflationary conditions materialize, the Federal Reserve will need to manage adroitly the large amounts of banks’ excess reserves accumulated as a consequence of QE.” Worry About the Decline in Productivity. Writing in the Journal, Alan S. Blinder takes a look at the troubling stalling out of productivity growth over the past five years. He argues that itâ€™s not because new online products and apps arenâ€™t being measured properly. And itâ€™s not because businesses are still rapidly hiring workers and boosting hours. Instead, he points to weak capital investment, less entrepreneurial dynamism and a recent drought of world-changing technological improvements such as the Internet or the personal computer. â€œThe big question mark is technological improvement. Has it really slowed down? Or are we simply waiting for the productivity fruits of the latest inventions? Tune in 20 years from now to find out. In the meantime, worry.â€? Bernanke Hits Back at Vitter-Warren. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argues in a blog post for the Brookings Institution that the new bipartisan Senate bill restricting the central bank’s emergency lending power is misguided. The lender-of-last-resort principle is an essential function that central banks can use to keep financial panics from spreading, he argues . And requiring a public accounting of the assets and liabilities of borrowing institutions would stigmatize those institutions, which would only inflame bank runs rather than stifle them. The bill is equivalent â€œto shutting down the fire department to encourage fire safety; orâ€”more relevant to the current contextâ€”eliminating deposit insurance so that banks will be more careful,â€? he writes. â€œRather than eliminating the fire department, itâ€™s better to toughen the fire code.â€? Europeâ€™s Not Out of Bizarro World Yet. Â Writing in the Journal, Â Allianz Global Investors’ Franck Dixmier warns that the low, and in some cases negative, eurozone bond yields that are partly a consequence of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank risk damaging the financial system and becoming self-reinforcing. “Fans of the Superman comics will be familiar with Bizarro World,” he writes. “Home to the supervillain Bizarro, the antithesis of Superman, it is a planet where circumstances run contrary to conventional wisdom. In one episode, a salesman does a roaring business selling Bizarro bondsâ€”â€œGuaranteed to lose money for youâ€?â€”not unlike the strange phenomenon of Europeâ€™s negative interest rates.” -U.S. Industrial Production Fell in April for the fifth straight month, dropping 0.3% from March, the Federal Reserve said Friday. Capacity utilization also fell . The Michigan consumer sentiment index for May also fell to 88.6 from 95.9 in April, an unexpected drop that suggests consumer spending will likely stay low. -The New York Fed Empire State Survey Rose Modestly to 3.09 from -1.19.
