Tim Duy Discusses The Evolving Views Of Fed Governor Powell - ProShares 30 Year TIPS/TSY Spread ETF (NYSEARCA:RINF) | Seeking Alpha Tim Duy has a very good new post, showing how Jerome Powell is moving in a more dovish direction. The following quotation is Powell, with the remark about the flat Phillips curve being Tim: When I was first exposed to macroeconomics in college, more than four decades ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by the amount of slack in the economy. But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially over the years. Or, in other words, the Phillips Curve is flat. Not quite flat as a pancake, but pretty darn flat. More important: In addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of workers and firms. A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but are fairly constant, or anchored. For both these reasons, inflation has become less responsive to cyclical changes in the economy. I'd go even further. The Phillips curve is not useful because it is NGDP, not inflation, that best explains how nominal and real variables are related. And the causation goes from the nominal to the real (NGDP to unemployment) not the real to the nominal (unemployment to inflation). Once again, here's Powell, with a follow-up comment by Duy: I am often asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment. A big part of the answer is that, at least for the time being, the appropriate level of rates is simply lower than it was before the crisis. As a result, policy is not as stimulative as it might appear to be. Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep the economy on an even keel if it were operating at 2 percent inflation and full employment-the "neutral rate" of interest-are currently around zero. Today, the real short term interest rate is about negative 1-1/4 percent, so policy is actually only moderately stimulative. I anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that have weighed on economic growth ease. The Fed increasingly recognizes that policy is not highly accommodative simply because rates are zero. The stance of policy is relative to the real interest rate, and a lower real rate means that policy is actually only "moderately" stimulative. Translation: There is no need to hike rates soon because policy is not particularly accommodative. Of course, market monetarists have been saying that low rates don't mean accommodative policy ever since 2008. I'd go even further. Not only is the current policy not as accommodative as it seems, it's not accommodative at all. NGDP growth (or inflation) are likely to undershoot the Fed's goals. Over the period since 2009, we've seen macroeconomic discourse evolve as follows: 1. NGDP may be a more useful indicator of nominal conditions than inflation. 2. The Phillips Curve is not very useful. 3. Low interest rates do not imply that money is easy. 4. Expansionary fiscal policy may be offset by an inflation targeting central bank. 5. The zero lower bound does not prevent negative IOR. 6. At the zero bound, a premature increase in interest rates will lead to lower interest rates in the long run. Of course, no one has a monopoly on these views, but which set of bloggers were most forcefully making these points in early 2009? With the post-Brexit vote plunge in global bond yields, any doubts that low rates are the new normal are gone. The Fed's been much slower than the markets to understand this new reality, but they aren't stupid. At some point, the Fed will realize that its preferred ("conventional") policy tool simply doesn't work. Rates will immediately fall to zero in all future recessions, so "conventional" monetary policy will be useless. How will the Fed react: 5. Throw up their hands and ask for support from fiscal policy PS. Tyler Cowen just reported that Swiss yields are negative out to 50 years. That's why I opposed the Swiss decision to revalue the franc upward last year. The upward revaluation was motived by a fear of inflation (and no, I'm not kidding.)
