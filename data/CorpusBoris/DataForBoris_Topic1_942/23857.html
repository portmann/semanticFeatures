Fed to Temporarily Lift Cap on Reverse-Repo Program When Liftoff Arrives - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve officials in March decided to expand the boundaries of a program they intend to use to control short-term interest rates once they start raising them, likely later this year. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement program is one of several tools the U.S. central bank will use to raise rates that have been pinned near zero since December 2008. Rather than cap the total activity at $300 billion per day, as previously planned, officials decided they might allow a higher limit, at least in early stages of rate increases, according to minutes of the March 17-18 Fed meeting, released Wednesday. In normal times, the Fed increases or reduces small amounts of reserves in the banking system to manage interest rates. Because it has flooded the system with trillions of dollars in reserves, it is using new instruments to manage rates. When it comes time to lift borrowing costs through the economy, Fed officials will raise the target range for their benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, which is now set at zero to 0.25%. The Fed will use two other interest rates to set the ceiling and floor of that range. The top will be the interest rate the Fed pays to banks on reserves, the money they park at the central bank. The bottom will be the interest rate paid through the overnight reverse repo program. Through this program, the Fed pays interest to money market funds and other firms on money they temporarily exchange for central bank-owned securities. Fed officials have been wary about making heavy use of the reverse-repo facility , which has been in testing since September 2013, because it is new and experimental and some worry it could become a source of financial instability. Last September, they set a $300 billion daily cap on the program, and Chairwoman Janet Yellen said it â€œwill only be used to the extent necessary and will be phased out when no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.â€? The limit stoked concerns that it could reduce the programâ€™s effectiveness Â in establishing a floor for interest rates . At their January policy meeting, Fed officials debated whether they should raise the daily cap when the time came to raise rates, minutes of that meeting showed. At their March meeting, they decided to let the program capacity â€œbe temporarily elevated to support policy implementation,â€? according to minutes of that meeting . Officials clearly remain wary of the program, signaling they want to reduce its capacity â€œfairly soonâ€? after they start raising rates, the minutes said. Policy makers in March discussed a number of potential strategies to reduce use of the facility. Most officials said raising the interest on excess reserves would be a good first step, and that other reserve-draining tools could be put into play. They discussed other ways to reduce reserves in the banking system to help manage interest rates. Some officials suggested the Fed might want to allow its bond portfolio to start winding down sooner than planned, which would reduce bank reserves. Right now the Fed is holding its bond portfolio steady by reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds into other securities. And while the Fed has said it doesnâ€™t plan to reduce its asset holdings through outright sales of securities, â€œmany participants mentioned that selling assets that will mature in a relatively short time could be considered at some stage, if necessary to reduceâ€? use of the overnight reverse repo program, the minutes said. They didnâ€™t appear to reach decisions on these ideas, and some officials were particularly skeptical about the idea of selling securities. â€œA number of participants noted that it could be difficult to communicate the reason for such sales to the public, and, in particular, that the announcement of such sales would risk an outsize market reaction, as the public could view the sales as a signal of a tighter overall stance of monetary policy than they had anticipated or as an indication that the [Fed] might be more willing than had been thought to sell longer-term assets,â€? the minutes said.
