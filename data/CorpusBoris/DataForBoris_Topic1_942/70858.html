Fear Bond Buys Would Spark Inflation Misplaced, Cleveland Fed Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ Worries that theÂ Federal Reserveâ€™sÂ bond buys would lead to runaway inflation were misguided and have proven incorrect, according to new research from theÂ Cleveland Fed. In response to the deep recession and financial crisis in 2007-09, the Fed cut short-term interest rates to near zero and undertook three programs of large-scale purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds, known as quantitative easing. â€œSuch measures caused an unprecedented increase in the Fedâ€™s balance sheet and led some to fear that high inflation would soon follow,â€? writes economist Mehmet Pasaogullari in the regional central bankâ€™s latest Economic Commentary . â€œHistorical data for various measures of expected inflation did not provide any support for those fears. In addition, a look at the past six years shows that these fears have not materialized.â€? Yet U.S. inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fedâ€™s 2% target for just about three years, frustrating officials who believed consumer prices would firm up more as the labor market improves. Some Fed policy makers see the low inflation as a sign that the economy is still running well below its potential. Mr. Pasaogullari looks at various time periods when Fed asset buys were announced and then implemented, finding they did not unduly push inflation expectations higher. Fed officials see inflation expectations as a key harbinger of future consumer price increases. â€œCurrent readings of survey and market-based inflation expectations show that forecasters and market participants do not expect high inflation in the short, medium or long terms,â€? the author writes. â€œNothing suggests that the Fedâ€™s new policy tools have been perceived by professional forecasters or financial market participants as harbingers of hyperinflation.â€?
