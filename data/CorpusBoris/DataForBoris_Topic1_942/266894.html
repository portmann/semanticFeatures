Fed Interest-Rate Decision and Janet Yellen’s Press Conferenceâ€”Recap - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen announces that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008 on WednesdayÂ in Washington, D.C.Â  The Federal ReserveÂ decided Wednesday to lift its interest-rate target from near zero,Â seven years after it pushed its benchmark rate to theÂ floorÂ during the financial crisis. In a press conference after a two-day meeting, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the central bank would move gradually in raising rates further in coming years. Fed Forecasts Show Only Small Changes to Officialsâ€™ Outlook Fed Risks New Distortions When It Raises Rates Itâ€™s a big day forÂ the central bank, poisedÂ to raise interest ratesÂ after pinning them near zero seven years ago today.Â  The road has been long and confusing.Â A near-zero benchmark rate longer than anyone expected, trillions of dollars ofÂ bond-buying andÂ every kind of verbal jujitsu known to central bankersÂ have all been deployed to keep markets calm and push the economy forward. Where has that left us? The entire Wall Street Journal team will be here today to take you through the Fed decision, the path ahead and implications for markets and the economy. Fed officialsÂ are wrapping up their two-day meeting now. Part of their message will come from the Federal Open Market Committeeâ€˜s statement at 2 p.m. ET.Â Thatâ€™s also whenÂ theÂ Fedâ€™s latest economic forecasts come out. Those will be critical to understanding the outlook ahead, well beyond the quarter-point rate increase widely expected today. At 2:30 weâ€™ll get Janet Yellen herself, sitting down for an hour toÂ walk through the decision and take questions from a room ofÂ Fed nerds. WHAT TO WATCH: Just catching up? The WSJâ€™sÂ Ben Leubsdorf gives you theÂ quickest and best guide to followingÂ the Fed decision. The key elements: The guidance: How gradual is gradual? NUMBER TWENTY: Today marks the Fed’s 20th press conference since the Fed started the practice in 2011, the result of lengthy planning by Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen (who was vice chair at the time). This will be Yellen’s eighth press conference as chairwoman of the Fed. She’ll haveÂ at least eight more after that in her term, and maybe more depending on what happens next November. Weâ€™ve followed all 19 of them here on Real Time Economics. Feeling nostalgic about QE2 or operation twist? We have rundowns from every gathering. END OF AN ERA: Seven years ago today, the Fed pushedÂ its target for the federal funds rate as low as it could go (long before major economies started toying withÂ negative interest rates).Â  It was a deeply confusing period, in the depths of the financial crisis. The explanations from the central bank were far from comforting, and the Fed’s outlook at the time turned out to be ratherÂ optimistic. Every stepÂ after that — the bond-buying, the communications innovations, the market tantrums — seemed to heighten anxiety about the state of the U.S. economy, the world and the mess we had gotten ourselves into.Â  Where did it leave the Fed? Neither aÂ hero nor aÂ villain, in the end. As theÂ WSJ’s Jon Hilsenrath capturedÂ today : Despite the Fedâ€™s aggressive efforts to spur the economy since the 2008 financial crisis,Â itâ€™sÂ delivered neither the vigorous expansionÂ itÂ wanted nor the disasters its critics feared. In the process, the central bank emerged less like an all-powerful force and more like so many other institutions that have struggled in recent years to keep up with events beyondÂ theirÂ control. â€œIt was in fact a period of great uncertainty and insecurity for the Fed,â€? the central bankâ€™s former chairman, Ben Bernanke, said in an interview. WHAT THEYâ€™RE FEARING: Fed officials have plenty of issues on their minds these days. Among the biggest is whether theyâ€™ll end up right back where they started. THEN AND NOW: Today will bringÂ the central bankâ€™s first rate increase since June 2006. Janet Yellen voted for that last rate increase while serving as president of the San Francisco Fed, but she didnâ€™t feel great about it. The transcript of the June 28-29, 2006 policy meeting shows she was on the fence about the decision and said that â€œon purely economic groundsâ€? she would have preferred to leave the fed-funds rate unchanged. â€œIn general, I believe that we should do the right thing, even if it surprises markets, but in this case our public statements seem to have convinced the public that we will raise the funds rate today,â€? she said then. â€œIf we didnâ€™t follow through, there would likely be some loss of credibility for policy.â€? Itâ€™s nine and a half years later, and public statements by Ms. Yellen and others have again convinced observers that the Fed is poised to raise rates. GRAPHIC INTERLUDE: See rate changes and other monetary policy tools in action with this great interactive from WSJâ€™sÂ Pat Minczeski, Martin Burch and Elliot Bentley: THE BIG BUBBLE QUESTION: Looming over the Fed’s extraordinary policy for all these years is the big bubble question. Dangerous asset bubbles have been root causes of the past three recessions, fueled in part by low-interest-rate policies. Central bankersÂ have spentÂ decades trying to understand how they could get ahead of bubbles, including a “war games” exercise. The results probably aren’t too encouraging . That’s not theÂ only reason ratesÂ will be rising soon. ButÂ Fed officials are wary of having a fourth financial bubble in a quarter century on the books. SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Â The Fed is widely expected to raise rates today ( 97% of the Wall Street Journalâ€™s survey of economists predicts an increase today) but thereâ€™s a lot of questions that remain: 1) How fast will the Fed raise rates? The Fedâ€™s own forecasts seem to suggest about 4 interest rate increases a year. Economists and markets are skeptical, however. The economists in the WSJ survey, for example, expect on average that theyâ€™ll only raise rates 3 times next year. 2) How high will rates eventually get? As of September, most Fed officials see rates, in the long-run, of around 3.5%. That seems sky-high compared to the past 7 years, but thatâ€™s actually on the low side in historical terms. Will such low rates really prevail once the financial crisis is more than a decade in the rearview mirror? 3) What happens to the Fedâ€™s enormous balance sheet? The central bank hasnâ€™t sent extremely clear signals about how long it plans to keep its enormous balance sheet â€” around $4.5 trillion in assets â€” at such an elevated state. By contrast, prior to the financial crisis, it maintained a balance sheet of under $1 trillion. The first step in shrinking the balance sheet would be allowing mortgage bonds to roll off the balance sheet when they mature. But when will the Fed do that? And how long will it take? These are big, and pretty open questions, for Fed policy. Once the first rate hike is out of the way, expect curiosity to build around these topics. STATEMENT STRATEGY:Â The Federal Open Market Committee statement (due at 2 p.m. ET) is not a long document, but it is a carefully written note that must be signed off on by a fairly large number of central bank officials, with very fast turnaround. A 2014 St. Louis Fed report noted Alan Greenspan-era statements were on average a brief 201 words, rising to the 800-word statements of the Janet Yellen reign that also require a much higher reading level to comprehend. So how does the Fed knock the document out relatively quickly after voting on a monetary policy decision? Itâ€™s partially plug-and-play, Atlanta Fed boss Dennis Lockhart said in a recent Wall Street Journal interview. Fed officials get to see â€œsome optionalÂ languageâ€? for the statement ahead of the decision â€œas a way of getting started in the discussion around communication,â€? he said. At todayâ€™s meeting, he said â€œI am going to react to the statement drafts that I get a chance to look at in advance of the FOMC meeting.Â  And then at the meeting, of course, as we always do, weâ€™ll discuss whatâ€™s the most effective way to communicate whatever decision the committee comes toâ€? using in part the language options presented to them. FED-TIME READING: How did we get to this historic moment? Read our Flipboard Magazine, a roundup of our extensive coverage of the Fed, its pending decision and how other central banks around the world are dealing with today’s move: MEANWHILE, IN THE MARKETS: With just over 30 minutes to go, U.S. stocks are struggling to maintain their morning rally. The DowÂ rose as much as 165 points early in the session, but is now up only 36 points. The S&P 500 rose to 2060, but has since fallen back, now up seven points at 2051. The biggest move has been in the oil market, where the Nymex crude contract is now down more than 4%, and back under $36 a barrel. Both the benchmark junk-bond ETFs, the iShares iBoxx and SPDR Barclays, are up marginally on the day, but down from their highs.

We’ll also be tweeting the terms as Ms. Yellen speaks fromÂ  @WSJCentralBanks . While the statement and economic projections (at 2 p.m.) will beÂ revealing, and trigger some sharp market moves as usual,Â the important nuance from Yellen at the press conference will be key to understanding the economic impact ahead. DECISION TIME:Â The era of zero interest rates is over. The era of extremely low interest rates will be with us for many years. The statement delivers on the dovish tone that markets wanted, emphasizing that coming moves will be gradual. Still, the economic projectionsÂ indicate Fed officials expect four quarter-point rate increasesÂ in 2016. That’s pretty much what investors have expected. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. GOING ABROAD: The Fed is clearly monitoring overseas developments but doesnâ€™t seem too concerned. In itâ€™s statement: â€œOverall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced.â€? Officials add that theyâ€™ll take an array of factors into consideration as they raise rates, including â€œreadings on financial and international developments.â€? While the median projection coming from the Fed did not drop significantly, individual membersâ€™ projections â€“ the so-called â€œdot plotâ€? â€“ in some cases did. In October, for instance, three members thought a 2018 rate below 3% was appropriate. Following this meeting, that number had increased to six. In October, one official saw rates going as high as 4% by 2017. Now, the highest 2017 projection has dropped under 3.5%. TREASURYS LOWER : Bond yields briefly hit session highs after the Fed raises rates for the first time since 2006, and the 2-year Treasury yield rose above 1% first time since 2010. But the selling is moderate as the rate increase was widely expected. Fed signals slow path of tightening which contains the selling pressure in bonds. Bond yields already rose over past two months, and now some investors booked profit from their short bond wagers. The 10-year yield was recently at 2.3% vs 2.296% before the Fed release. The two-year yield was recently at 0.996% vs 0.992% before the Fed decision. UNANIMITY!Â One of the big surprises out of this statement is the unanimous vote among Fed officials. Several officials had indicated that they were uncomfortable raising rates this year, including Fed governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans has also not been especially excited about raising rates. But when it came time to vote today, it appears they were either persuaded by the arguments of their colleagues or at least persuaded that, for a decision this important, it was crucial to present a united front. The forecasts released with today’s statement show that there’s not total unanimity. Two Fed officials indicated that they think it would be appropriate for rates still to be near zero at the end of this year, that is, that they should not have been raised today. These officials either 1) don’t vote this year on the FOMC or 2) they were persuaded to vote for a different strategy than their forecast implied. Fed officialsâ€™ median expectation for economic growth in 2016 is now 2.4%, up from the 2.3% forecast in the September release. For 2017 the median expected growth rate held steady at the prior forecastâ€™s 2.2%, and in the longer run, Fed officials continue to see the economyâ€™s growth rate at 2.0%. Fed officials still seeÂ  a slow rise in inflation Â back to their target. The median expectation for inflation next year is for 1.6%, versus the median 1.7% seen in September. Fed officials still donâ€™t expect a return to 2% until 2018. Policy makers are more optimisticÂ  about unemployment , which was 5% in November. The median expected unemployment rate for 2016 is 4.7%, down from the prior estimate of 4.8%. The median forecast of longer-run unemployment held at Septemberâ€™s 4.9%. STOCKS FALL, THEN RISE: Stocks gave back some earlier gains, then reversed course and pushed higher after the Fedâ€™s rate announcement. The S&P 500 is now up 16 points, or 0.8%, to 2060. The benchmark was up just 12 points before the 2 pm announcement, and briefly dipped into negative territory immediately after the announcement. Utilities stocks lead gainers with a climb of 1.8%. The Dow Industrials rise 105 points, or 0.6% to 17629. HEREâ€™S YELLEN: The press conference is under way. Ms. Yellen, as she does to start each of these pressÂ conferences, is putting a bit ofÂ color around the FOMC statement and economic projections. Itâ€™s the end of an extraordinary era, YellenÂ says, and the rate increase reflects the Fedâ€™s confidence that the U.S. economy will continue to strengthen. BUYERS STEP INTO TREASURYS: The Fedâ€™s latest signal of a slow path drove buyers into bonds as recent rise in yields attracted buying interest. â€œI was relieved the first rate increase is out of the way,â€? said Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12B as head of fixed-income trading in New York at Deutsche Bankâ€™s private wealth-management unit. â€œThe Fed is going to be very slow as they indicate they are looking at a broad set of factors. It is hard to see yields rise significantly.â€? The two-year yield was recently at 0.98% vs 0.992% before Fed. The 10-year yield was 2.282% vs 2.296% before Fed. GOLD PRICES PARE GAINS: Gold for February delivery, the most actively traded contract, was recently up 0.8% at $1,070.50 a troy ounce in aftermarket trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices settled up 1.4% at $1,076.80 a troy ounce in regular trading. Higher rates tend to weigh on gold, which pays its holders nothing and struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments when borrowing costs rise. However, a gradual pace of rate increases revives the chance that inflation, which has remained tame in recent years, could flare higher and reanimate demand for gold as a store of value. HIGH DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS RISE: Utilities, telecom and consumer staples stocks led the broader S&P 500 higher following the statement. Utilities stocks in S&P 500 up 2%, staples up 1.3% and telecom stocks up 1.4% JUNK GAINS: Junk bonds advanced after the Fed’s decision to raise rates. The iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF was up about 0.6% on the day. Shortly before the decision, the ETF was up only 0.05%. The gains extend a recovery that began Tuesday. The junk-bond market had been roiled by an intense selloff as investors fretted over the low price of oil and the closure of a junk-bond fund, sparking fears of contagion. THE INFLATION ISSUE:Â Ms. Yellen isnâ€™t waiting for the press conference questions. In her opening remarks, she just went straight for the question on a lot of criticsâ€™ minds. â€œWith inflation currently still low, why is the committee raising the federal funds rate target?â€? Ms. Yellenâ€™s answer to Ms. Yellenâ€™sÂ question: Recent softness in inflation is due to â€œtransitoryâ€? factors that are expected to abate, she says. Ms. Yellen is also repeating her prior warning about moving too late, an old chestnut for central bankers in every kind of cycle: â€œIt takes time for monetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes. Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting our objective.â€? An abrupt tightening could raise the risk of pushing the economy into recession, she says. But the first rate increase â€œshould not be overstated,â€? Ms. Yellen says. Janet Yellen’s Washington news conference is shown on a TV screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. FROM THE FLOOR: Reaction was subdued on the floor of the NYSE after the announcement. â€œItâ€™s the end of the year. No big money manager is going to make or break their year in next two weeks,â€? said Kenny Polcari, director at Oâ€™Neil Securities. The S&P 500 is down 0.2% so far this year. Mr. Polcari said the Fedâ€™s unanimous decision showed confidence in economy, and that investors would be watching Ms. Yellenâ€™s commentary. â€œItâ€™s the way she says itâ€? that matters, he said. STRONG ENOUGH: â€œThereâ€™s been a tremendous amount of healing in this country,â€? said Michael Scanlon, who helps oversee $4.5 billion as a portfolio manager at John Hancock Asset Management. â€œIn my opinion, the economy is strong enough to handle higher rates.â€? Mr. Scanlon added that he expects a better backdrop for corporate earnings next year, which bodes well for stock-market gains. Her answer is that the Fed sees itselfÂ on course to hit its goals: â€œWe decided to move at this time because we feel the conditions we set out, for a move, namely further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2% in the medium term, we felt these conditions had been satisfied,â€? she said. â€œWe have been concerned about the risks from the global economy and those risks persist, but the US economy has shown considerable strength,â€? she said. She added a careful reminder: donâ€™t â€œoverblow the significance of this first move. Itâ€™s only 25 basis points. Monetary policy remains accommodative.â€? HERE COME THE GOLD BULLS: We’re past the statement and into the question and answer part of the press conference, and there hasn’t been any signs of hawkishness besides the Federal Reserve’s initial move to raise interest rates by 25 bps. Gold bulls are starting to get braver, bidding the metal back up to where it closed in regular trading earlier this afternoon. “I’d be willing to bet you will not see a rate increase by March, or maybe even until the summer,” said Peter Hug, director of global trading at Kitco Metals. “Right now, there is just not enough juice to create a significant barrier to gold.” Gold is up 1.3% at $1,074.90 a troy ounce in aftermarket trading. OVERSHOOT: Ms. Yellen says odds are good the Fed would end up overshooting its objectives of 2% inflation and maximum employment if it leaves rates near zero for too long. So itâ€™s starting now in an effort to keep the expansion on a long-term, sustainable path. â€œWe have considered the risks to the outlook and worry about the fact that with interest rates at zero we have less scope to respond to negative shocks than positive shocks.â€? “IT’S A PUNCTUATION ON AN ERA”: That was the response from Bill Smead, chief executive of Seattle-based Smead Capital Management, which manages $2.3 billion. Still, he wasn’t overly worried about the decision; he actually was at a Starbucks in his office building enjoying a coffee when the announcement was made. He said he distinctly remembered the last time the Fed was raising rates, when there was reason he said to be nervous due to leverage in the financial markets. This time, he’s not concerned. “You don’t usually have recessions with favorable demographics, overcapitalized banks, and great balance sheets and income statements with the average household,” he said. “It’s not a ticket to despair.” SAW IT COMING: It appears as if the markets saw all thisÂ coming. The rate increase and theÂ expectation ofÂ only â€œgradual adjustmentsâ€? in rates in the future appeared toÂ strike the right tone for traders. No major asset classes are suffering anything approaching the â€œtantrumsâ€? that they threw after some earlier Fed meetings, and as Ms. Yellen fields questions, the Dow and S&P are trading at their highs for the day.Â  Ms. Yellen acknowledges inflation remains “well below” the Fed’s 2% goal. That goal is symmetric, she says, and the FOMC is committed to not allowing inflation to persist above or below that objective. Now stop us if you’ve heard this one before: The Fed still expects inflation to move up over time. If officials were to see their underlying theory of inflation not bear out, “that would certainly give us pause.” She’s not going to reveal much here. “I’m not going to give you a simple formula for what we need to see on the inflation front, in order to raise rates again,” Ms. Yellen says. OF OIL AND TOO-LOW INFLATION:Â Ms. Yellen just answered a two-part question on low oil prices and inflation below their target.Â  On inflation, Ms. Yellen conceded surprise at continued declines in oil prices but said “We do not need to see oil prices rebound” before concluding that they will no longer drag down inflation rates. “All they need to do is stabilize. I believe there is some limit below which oil prices are unlikely to … fall.” Then Ms. Yellen addressed a pointed challenge to the Fed’s strategy. The Fed has been criticized in recent years for not doing more to raise the inflation rate to their 2% goal. Because inflation has hovered between 1 and 2%, some have accused the Fed of having an inflation “ceiling” rather than a target. Ms. Yellen dismissed this allegation with a history lesson.”for a number of years between 2004 and 2008, we had a series of increases in oil prices that, for a series of years, raised inflation above” the rate of 2%. The Fed wasn’t formally targeting 2% inflation at the time, but Ms. Yellen noted that the Fed “judged those increases to be transitory as well and looked through them.” â€œYes we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that would disappear over the medium term, just as we did overshoots of inflation that we also judged to be transitory,” said Ms. Yellen. VOLATILITY: Ms. Yellen says the Fed will be focused on the long-term economic outlook, not short-term financial market volatility in developing monetary policy. â€œBut what we are looking at here is the longer-term economic outlook.Â Are we seeing persistent changes in financial market conditions that would have a bearing, a significant bearing, on the outlook that we would need to take into account in formulating appropriate policy.â€? DOESNâ€™T CHANGE SLOW-GROWING ECONOMY: â€œMy reaction is relief,â€? said Andrew Slimmon, a portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He added that while it appears the Fed was eager to make the first step toward raising short-term rates, he doesnâ€™t view the raise as a signal that the economy is really accelerating. â€œThe overall consensus should remain that we remain in a low-growth environment,â€? said Mr. Slimmon, adding that he â€œwouldnâ€™t get too optimistic that the economy is breaking out just because the Fed is raising rates,â€? same as he wouldnâ€™t get too pessimistic when headlines cause panic in the stock market about slowing global growth. RECESSION ODDS: Historically, economic expansions fade when theyâ€™re this long. How confident is the Fed that the U.S. wonâ€™t slip back into recession in the near term? Ms. Yellen says sheâ€™s â€œconfident about the fundamentalsâ€? driving the U.S. economy, which she calls â€œquite sound.â€? And sheâ€™s not much of a fan of the idea that weâ€™re running on fumes now.Â  â€œI think itâ€™s a myth that expansions die of old age.â€¦So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesnâ€™t lead me to believeâ€¦that its days are numbered.â€? Â Still, Ms. Yellen acknowledges reality: An economy can get hit by shocks, both positive and negative. The risk of one hitting and pushing the economy into recession: about 10%. â€œSo, yes, there is some probability that that could happen, and of course, we would appropriately respond. But it isnâ€™t something that is fated to happen, because we have had a long expansion.â€? WHEN DOES REINVESTMENT END? One of the big remaining variables for the Fed is the size of its balance sheet. Currently, the Fed is holding the balance sheet steady at around $4.5 trillion. Every time one of its bonds matures, the Fed reinvests the proceeds. Ms. Yellen said that the Fed still expects eventually to “reduce the size over time by ceasing reinvestments.” Ms. Yellen said that before beginning to allow the balance sheet to shrink, the Fed would like interest rates to be somewhat higher than just this one increase. “One factor is the desirability of having some scope to respond to an adverse shock to the economy,” Ms. Yellen said. “It would be nice to have a buffer in terms of having raised the federal funds rate to a certain extent.” Ms. Yellen declined to cite a specific level of interest rates that she’d want to see before she’d be confident that the Fed has built up a “buffer.” (The rationale for a buffer is that the Fed would then have scope to cut interest rates in response to a decline in the economy.) For now, this is not an urgent agenda item: “This is not something we expect to be turning to, to cease reinvestment, very quickly,” she said. Janet Yellen’s news conference Wednesday. JUNK BONDS: Ms. Yellen weighs in on volatility in junk-bond markets and, specifically, on Third Avenue Managementâ€™s move to suspend withdrawals at its fund. â€œThird Avenueâ€¦was a rather unusual open-ended mutual fund. It had very concentrated positions and especially risky and illiquid bonds, and it had been facing very significant redemption pressures.â€? Despite that fundâ€™s troubles, Ms. Yellen said she expects financial conditions in the U.S. will continue to support economic growth, though, of course, â€œwe have been and will continue to track developments in financial markets very carefully.â€? She adds the U.S. financial system is more resilient now than before the financial crisis that led into the recession. DON’T PANIC:Â This is something of a repeated theme from Ms. Yellen. Yes, some consumer rates will begin to rise as a result of today’s action — the prime interest rate could head up, some longer-term borrowing rates could slowly drift higher. But Ms. Yellen cautioned we’re still talking about “very low rates and weâ€™ve made a very small move.â€? WHO KILLS EXPANSIONS?Â A good follow-up on the old adage, â€œexpansions donâ€™t die of old age,â€? is the rest of that common statement. They often die at the hands of the central bank. Ms. Yellen wonâ€™t be backed into a corner on this one. She turns it around, pointing out that when central banks kill expansions, itâ€™s because they begin too late to tighten policy and allow inflation to get out of control. Â Then they have to raise rates abruptly and substantially, causing a downturn.Â  As a result, she said, â€œit is prudent to begin early and gradually.â€?Â  â€œIâ€™m not denying that there are situations where central banks have moved too early,â€? Ms. Yellen adds. â€œWe have weighed that risk carefully in making todayâ€™s decision. I donâ€™t believe we will have to do it.â€?Â  NOT A MECHANICAL PATH:Â In 2004, when the Fed last began raising interest rates, it raised them 0.25% at every single FOMC meeting until mid-2006. It was mechanical. When the Fed started its third round of bond buying, known as QE3, it purchased $85 billion of assets a month for an entire year. When it decided to “taper” these purchases, it cut the pace by $10 billion every single meeting until ending the program. In other words, it was very mechanical. This time, Ms. Yellen is insisting the Fed doesn’t want to be mechanical.Â “I do want to emphasize that while weâ€™ve said gradual, gradual does not mean mechanical, equally-timed, equally-sized, interest rate changes,” she said. “My guess is that the economy will progress in a manner that is not sufficiently even that we will decide to make evenly spaced hikes,” she said. “I strongly doubt that it will mean equally spaced hikes and it certainly is not the intention of the committee to follow any mechanical formula.” UPSIDE RISKS: How might the economy surprise us on the upside? Â With so much gloom in the world, this one gives the economist-in-chief a chance to be cheerleader-in-chief. Her list of good things: Consumers are in a much healthier condition with better income prospects. Theyâ€™re buying a lot of cars. Housing has been recovering slowly and demographics would point to â€œconsiderable upsideâ€? for residential investment. IDIOSYNCRATIC INFLATION: Ms. Yellen cites “idiosyncratic factors,” such as medical care prices, holding down inflation. But the main reason for a very slight downward revision to the Fed’s inflation outlook is a strong dollar and the knock-on effects of cheap energy, which are holding down core prices. “But I personally don’t think we are in a world where inflationÂ is being determined in a different way than it has been historically.” Still, Fed economists are watching the inflationÂ picture closely and if it does’t unfold as expected, they will reconsider that outlook. EMERGING WORRIES: Ms. Yellen, asked about the impact of the Fed decision on emerging markets, says â€? our fates are very much linked and that the performance of the U.S. economy has important spillovers into emerging markets and vice versa.â€? She says the Fed decision â€œhas been expected and well communicatedâ€? in emerging markets. And a bonus history lesson, too: Ms. Yellen says many emerging markets are in a stronger position than they would have been in the 1990s with stronger economic policies and financial systems.Â â€œOn the other hand, there are vulnerabilities there, and there are countries that have been badly affected by declining commodity prices. So we will monitor this very carefully, but we have taken care to avoid unnecessary negative spillovers.â€? THE FUTURE OF WAGES: In response to her final question on wage growth, Ms. Yellen outlined some evidence that wages were strengthening but added the caveat that “I hesitate to say this is a firm trend,” noting that wages have appeared to firm only to disappoint in the past.Â  Ms. Yellen said this is something they’ll continue to watch closely: “It does affect views about how much slack there is in the labor market and the inflation outlook,” she said. It’s a reminder that the first Fed rate increase of the twenty-teens is now in the books, but the future of Fed action and the U.S. economy remains very much unwritten. She got her â€œgradualâ€? message across and wonâ€™t have a market crash on her hands, at least for today. Â As our friends from the WSJ Markets teamÂ have been noting, stocks are on a tear and (apart from the long-running slide in commodity markets) investors are mostly happy with the outcome. DONâ€™T WRITE OFF THE DOLLAR JUST YET: The dollar has sold off at the start of the last three rate tightening cycles, but this time may be different, some investors believe. While the Fed is tightening, central banks in Europe, Japan and China are still engaged in massive quantitative easing, widening the divergence between rates in the U.S. and abroad. At the same time, thereâ€™s also the possibility that the economy performs better than expected, forcing the Fed into a faster pace of tightening and fueling more dollar gains. YELLEN’S CHRISTMAS GIFT TO INVESTORS:Â In the stock market, the reaction to the Fed’s move was about as good as the occupants of the Eccles Building could have hoped for. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 224 points, or 1.3%, to 17749.09. The S&P 500 was up 30 points (1.45%) at 2073. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5% to 5071. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note didn’t move much from before to after the meeting, closing at 2.29%, which is still up sharply from where it wasÂ on MondayÂ morning (2.15%). Even the two benchmark junk-bond ETFs did well on the day. The iShares iBoxx (HYG) rose 0.8% and the SPDR Barclays (JNK) rose 0.9%. The only sour note – and it was very sour – was sounded in the one market that’s been the biggest problem. Nymex crude oil fell nearly 5%, down 4.9% to $35.52. THATâ€™S A WRAP: It was a remarkably long time to wait for a single quarter-point rate increase from the Fed. Given all the tossing and turningÂ by all partiesÂ involved, this one turned out to be as good as the central bank could have hoped for on Day 1. TheÂ key test in the coming days and weeks will be whether the Fedâ€™s new posture â€” slowing climbing off the floor instead of chainingÂ itself to the zero bound â€” changes market dynamics enough that they reshape other parts of the economy. Weâ€™ll know before long whether emerging marketsÂ took all this time to cushion themselves, whetherÂ exportÂ sectorsÂ manage to power throughÂ a stronger dollar and whether theÂ turmoil in junk bonds andÂ commodities is deepened by a Fed move.Â  Weâ€™ve got an incredible package of coverage across WSJ.com about the rate decision, itsÂ global economic impact and the market reaction.Â Be sure to check it out from here, our WSJ Economy page and WSJ Pro Central Banking . previous What to Expect From the Fed Interest-Rate Decision: WSJ’s Hilsenrath Discusses We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

Sam Zell predicts we will be in a recession within 12 months, because despite all the Fed shenanigans, there is no demand.  And why is that?  Because vast amounts of money have been hoovered up like so much blow by the financial and moneyed interests, and it no longer circulates through mainstream economy. The middle class is being crushed and the rich just say that they need lower taxes to make things better.  It's enough to make you sick. "In its annual report, the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements says that what used to be considered â€œunthinkableâ€? risks becoming the â€œnew normalâ€?, with clear risks for future stability. BIS said the need for abnormally low level of interest rates to be kept in place six years after the trough of the global financial crisis in early 2009 reflected a broader malaise. It added that monetary policy â€“ the willingness of central banks to print money and keep borrowing costs low â€“ was bearing too much of the burden and that governments needed to rely more on structural reform to secure sustainable growth." So, if you read this what they are saying is that low rates are still needed because the overall economy isnt creating broad based growth. The problem is that they end with " governments needed to rely more on structural reform to secure sustainable growth."  Structural reform from these people usually means cutting spending on social safety nets.  Guess what....that cuts overall spending, curtailing growth.  So basically these guys are A) worried about innate weakness in economies creating a reliance on low rates that is risky, and think that cutting spending, which will further weaken growth, is the solution. The international body that represents the worldâ€™s central banks has issued a stark warning that an unprecedented period of ultra-low interest rates mask deep weaknesses in the global economy and threaten to be the trigger for the next financial crisis. In its annual report, the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements says that what used to be considered â€œunthinkableâ€? risks becoming the â€œnew normalâ€?, with clear risks for future stability. BIS said the need for abnormally low level of interest rates to be kept in place six years after the trough of the global financial crisis in early 2009 reflected a broader malaise. It added that monetary policy â€“ the willingness of central banks to print money and keep borrowing costs low â€“ was bearing too much of the burden and that governments needed to rely more on structural reform to secure sustainable growth. BIS was the one global body to point out in advance of the financial crash of 2007 that booming asset prices could cause problems even during periods of low inflation, and its latest warning will be seen as a call for its central bank members to start returning monetary policy to more normal settings. â€œGlobally, interest rates have been extraordinarily low for an exceptionally long time, in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, against any benchmarkâ€?, the report said. â€œSuch low rates are the most remarkable symptom of a broader malaise in the global economy: the economic expansion is unbalanced, debt burdens and financial risks are still too high, productivity growth too low, and the room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy too limited. The unthinkable risks becoming routine and being perceived as the new normal.â€?... previous What to Expect From the Fed Interest-Rate Decision: WSJ’s Hilsenrath Discusses Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
