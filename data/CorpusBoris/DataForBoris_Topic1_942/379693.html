Fed (Up) | Seeking Alpha It came as no surprise that the Fed left its benchmark rate unchanged following its two-day meeting this week. That was the expectation of the market, and since this Fed clearly serves as the market's whipping boy, it will never surprise or disappoint. The day it does will be a day of reckoning. There were not many changes to the Fed's boiler plate press release , other than a modest upgrade to its description of the rate of economic growth in the US compared to its December assessment. The Fed stated that "economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months." I'm not sure how the Fed deduces that growth is "moderate," unless it is simply pulling up the latest GDPNow estimate for the first quarter of this year. That wouldn't surprise me. A far more accurate assessment is that the rate of economic growth is slowing, as it has slowed year-over-year for four quarters in a row, and there hasn't been any data in recent months that points to an acceleration. The Fed also repeated its warning that global developments can pose risks, but it removed the wording that it is "closely monitoring" these developments. My suspicion is that the Fed believes the risks posed by global developments have been effectively drowned by the European Central Bank in its new wave of liquidity measures announced last week. Lower, if not negative, interest rates and more liquidity is the answer to everything in the minds of central bankers today. Lastly, the Fed acknowledged a pickup in the rate of inflation, but it dismissed any concerns about the increase because the rate continues to run below its target as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. The Fed's forecasts are horrible, but providing them is a part of the job. They should more accurately be described as wish lists. The Fed lowered its expectations for the rate of growth in 2016 from what was a range of 2.3% to 2.5% to a range of 2.1% to 2.3%. This forecast will be lowered again in coming months as what the Fed hopes for and what transpires move further apart. At least it has given up on the repeated forecast for a 3% rate of growth. The Fed modestly lowered its expectations for inflation, and now sees the PCE index within a range of 1.4% to 1.7%, just below what was a range of 1.5% to 1.7%. It will be interesting to see what happens if the price of oil recovers substantially in the second half of the year. That will wreak havoc in the Fed's inflation outlook. The Fed only expects to raise rates two more times this year, which is down from the expectations for four at the beginning of the year. The only shock here is how quickly the Fed is giving up on its forecast for four rate increases, especially when it is so close to achieving its stated mandate of full employment and stable prices. Fed Chair Yellen said that it would be better to raise interest rates quickly if rates of economic growth and inflation accelerate rather than have to cut them if the economy falters moving forward. This is exactly the opposite of what Fed board members, including Yellen, have said in the past. They previously concluded that since changes in interest rates work with a lag, it is important to get in front of expectations for future increases in growth and inflation with changes in policy today. This appears to be a significant change in policy. Yellen also said that the Fed's next meeting in April is "a live meeting," implying that there could be a rate increase. It is ridiculous to suggest that a rate increase is a possibility in April when the Fed just lowered its economic outlook and reduced the number of expected rate increases from four to two. This is nothing more than an attempt to save face after lowering projections across the board. She also discussed the possibility that the Fed could overshoot or undershoot its target of 2% for the rate of inflation. This is convenient, as no matter what happens now, the Fed can say that the rate of inflation is within its targeted range. I am fed up with the Fed, and have been for a long time. It has mismanaged monetary policy during the past several years of this economic expansion, as has been its history over previous expansions, continually fostering an environment conducive to booms and busts. History has never repeated itself with such frequency and ferocity as it has over the past 20 years. Today the Fed has reduced itself to nothing more than a cheerleader, because its overuse of extreme monetary policy measures has led to current policy having virtually no impact on economic growth. Following a financial crisis that resulted from the speculative use of excessive amounts of leverage, it has encouraged employing even more leverage. Its interest-rate policy has again been the basis for huge amounts of speculation. Furthermore, it hasn't helped to eradicate the debt built up from the previous crisis. Instead, it has helped to transfer this debt from the balance sheets of consumers and corporations to the balance sheet of the federal government. While this may have helped to increase the rate of economic growth over the past several years, it will be a burden on future rates of economic growth. In the same way that Fed policies have stolen forward demand in the real economy, which is demand that would have occurred on its own at a later date, it has stolen forward demand for financial assets through its manipulation of interest rates and money supply. This has created a significant dislocation between market prices and the fundamentals that ultimately dictate prices. Because monetary policy is no longer effective, we are now seeing prices gradually fall back in line with fundamentals. It would be far more favorable for investors today if the Fed had removed itself from its financial market involvement several years ago. The primary cause of the financial market dislocation we have today is the excessive amounts of liquidity in the financial system, resulting from the Fed's quantitative easing programs. There was no need for this liquidity. It did not create an environment that led to job growth or faster rates of inflation in the real economy. All is did was fuel a significant rise in financial asset prices. Now investors must contend not only with a deteriorating fundamental landscape, but also with a waning in the price premiums that resulted from the excess of liquidity. When the Fed suggested in December that it would raise interest rates four more times, in line with its forecast for faster rates of economic growth and inflation, I asserted that there would be no interest rate increases in 2016 and that the rate of economic growth would slow. Three months later the Fed has lowered its projections and reduced its expected rate hikes from four to two. I am sticking by my forecast. The Fed's reliance on inflated financial asset prices will be the primary reason that it does not raise interest rates. It knows that any rate increase will accelerate the decline in prices that is already underway, undermining the current levels of consumer spending and sentiment for the wealthiest Americans who are keeping the economy afloat.
