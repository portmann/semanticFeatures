ECB’s Liikanen: Bond-Buying Program Has Stimulated Inflation Expectations - Real Time Economics - WSJ HELSINKIâ€”The European Central Bankâ€™s government bond-buying program has stimulated inflation expectations while some oscillation in bond yields can be expected in the future, ECB policymaker Erkki Liikanen said on Friday. The ECB started in March to buy various debt securities including sovereign bonds at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros ($67.61 billion) to fend off a potential threat of deflation, or a persistent and broad-based fall in prices in the eurozone. Although the bond-buying program, which is now scheduled to continue until at least September 2016, is still at its early stages, it has already triggered some positive market reactions, said Mr. Liikanen, who leads the Bank of Finland and is a member of the ECBâ€™s policy-setting governing council. The ECBâ€™s new monetary policy measures and its commitment to them has had an impact by halting a long and steady decline in inflation expectations and turning them slightly higher, Mr. Liikanen said at a conference in Helsinki. â€œWeâ€™re not at the levels where we should be, but the direction is right,â€? Mr. Liikanen said. Mr. Liikanen also said the continuous decline in the yields of longer-maturity government bonds has recently stopped with the yields now up from their record-low levels. â€œThe markets are of course assessing their own actions, and it is reflected here. There will probably be some oscillations,â€? Mr. Liikanen said. Mr. Liikanen compared the ECBâ€™s bond-buying program to a marathon, which is a 42-kilometer running event. â€œIf this purchase program which is set to run until the end of September next year is a marathon, so far weâ€™ve run four kilometers,â€? Mr. Liikanen said. Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
