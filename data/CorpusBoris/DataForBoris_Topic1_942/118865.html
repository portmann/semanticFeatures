WSJ Survey: Most Economists Expect Fed Will Raise Rates in September - Real Time Economics - WSJ Most private forecasters polled continue to expect the Federal Reserve to start raising short-term interest rates in September, though a growing number think the central bank will wait until December. About 82% of economists surveyed over the past week by The Wall Street Journal picked September for the first rate rise, while 15% said the Fed would wait until December. In last monthâ€™s survey , 72% chose September and 9% went for December. “The Federal Reserve continues to message that it intends to normalize rates this year, and with rebounding activity in the coming months, September continues to be the leading candidate,” National Association of Manufacturers chief economist Chad Moutray said. None of the respondents said the Fed would raise rates at its July 28-29 policy meeting, though 3% thought the Fed would begin to move in October. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to hold press conferences after the September and December meetings, but not after the July and October meetings, so many analysts think the latter two are less likely occasions for such an important move. The Fed has kept its benchmark federal-funds rate pinned near zero since December 2008 and hasnâ€™t raised rates since June 2006. Ms. Yellen has said repeatedly the Fed is on track to raise rates this year as the U.S. economy heals from the 2007-09 recession. â€œIf the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal-funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,â€? Ms. Yellen told lawmakers Wednesday . In April, a stretch of weak economic data prompted economists who had been split between June and September to shift their predictions for the Fedâ€™s first rate increase toward the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting. September has remained economistsâ€™ top choice in recent months despite turmoil overseas . A smaller but growing number of economists think liftoff will come later in 2015. The 15% who this month predicted a first rate increase in December is up from none in Marchâ€™s survey. Georgia State University economist Rajeev Dhawan was among those who thought the Fed would wait until December to raise rates. â€œGlobal turmoil will give them cover for a delayed action,â€? he said. Even so, 71% of economists in the July survey said the greater risk was that the Fed would raise interest rates too late, versus 29% who said the greater risk was the central bank would move too soon. That breakdown was little changed from Juneâ€™s survey. The latest Journal survey was conducted Friday through Tuesday; 60 business and academic economists offered predictions for the timing of the Fedâ€™s first rate increase.
