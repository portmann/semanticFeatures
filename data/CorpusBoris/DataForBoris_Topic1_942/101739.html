RBA Governor: Unorthodox Central Banking Here for a While Yet - Real Time Economics - WSJ The unorthodox world of central bank policy, in vogue since the global economy plunged into a deep banking and markets crisis almost a decade ago, will remain the norm for some time yet, according to the head of Australia’s central bank. In a speech to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum in London, Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Glenn Stevens said the central banking modus operandi in play before the financial crisis “may be quite some time away.” The comments come as global financial markets nervously watch Greek debt negotiations, and a coming referendum that will determine if the country remains within the eurozone. Economists are fearful that turmoil in Greece could spread into the global economy, damping growth in Europe and potentially deterring the U.S. Federal Reserve from raising interest rates from zero later this year. Mr. Stevens said the lessons of history are being repeated, as economic recovery globally has been extremely slow. “The lesson that recovery from a downturn associated with a period of financial excesses almost always proves to be a slow one has been learned once again,” he said. Central banks will need to accept that extremely low interest rates and stimulus through the use of central bank balance sheets are going to have consequences in terms of rising asset prices and threats to financial stability. Those fires will need to be fought with added regulation, that may or may not work “In all likelihood, very accommodative policies will continue for quite a while. During that period, central banks will have little choice but to rely in part on regulatory tools to try to contain potential financial excesses, without convincing evidence of the power of such tools,” he adds. Mr. Stevens comments are apt for Australia, where record low interest rates are supporting a moribund economy that is fighting a high currency and a mining downturn. Low rates are also fanning a house price bubble in Sydney that is so far being addressed by added regulation targeting surging lending to mortgage investors. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it has proved difficult for central banks to generate the demand needed across economies to lift growth, Mr. Stevens added. “Financial risk-taking has increased, driven by the search for yield, but real economy risk-taking is more difficult to find,” he said. “Corporations sit on stockpiles of cash, in many cases apparently reluctant to accept lower returns on investment projects in spite of the lowest cost of debt funding ever seen,” he added. Australia’s economy is growing sluggishly, in part because firms are reluctant to invest, prompting Mr. Stevens to call for more “animal spirits.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
