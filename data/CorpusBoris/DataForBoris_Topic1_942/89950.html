Fed Cuts 2015 Growth Outlook, Officials Still Favor 2015 Rate Rise - Real Time Economics - WSJ WASHINGTONâ€”Federal Reserve officials cut their estimates of 2015 growth in new forecasts that also continued to show most officials favoring one to two interest rate increases this year. The projections show a strong majority of Fed officials continue to believe they’ll lift interest rates this year from the near zero levels they’ve occupied since the end of 2008. Fifteen of 17 officials hold that view, while two expect to hold off on rate increases until next year. That matches what officials said in projections released in March . The Fed’s outlook for the economy and monetary policy was released Wednesday along with the announcement of the outcome of the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee. Central bankers matched widely held expectations and left their short-term interest rate target unchanged at near zero, as they continued to prepare the way for interest rate rises. A number of Fed officials have been making the case that when they do begin raising rates, it’s likely that they’ll do so slowly . The latest forecasts affirm that outlook, and are little changed from what officials thought likely in March. The median expectation for the Fed’s short-term rate target at the end of this year still stands at 0.625%. The end-2016 forecast is for a 1.625% rate, while the median expected interest rate target for the close of 2017 stands at 2.875%. Longer run, officials expect their short-term rate target to stand at 3.750%, matching March’s view.

For 2016, the economy is seen growing by 2.4% to 2.7%, in line with March’s estimate, while 2017 growth is forecast to range between 2.1% and 2.5%. The economy’s long-run growth rate was left at a 2.0% to 2.3% increase. The cut in the Fed’s growth estimates was no surprise. First quarter U.S. growth was last reported at a 0.7% decline , and data for the second quarter has raised questions about whether activity picked up much from the start of the year. There’s an active debate among central bankers how much of that weakness owed to the terrible winter weather seen over much of the nation, and how much might be due to deeper issues in the economy. Fed officials continue to expect progress on the jobs front. They see what is now a 5.5% jobless rate ranging between 5.2% and 5.3% for the fourth quarter of 2015, versus March’s forecast of 5% to 5.2%. Unemployment is expected to be between 4.9% and 5.1% late next year. Fed officials maintained their estimate that the long-run jobless rate stands between 5.0% and 5.2%. Although they’ve fallen short of their 2% inflation target for three years, officials continue to believe they’ll get prices back in line with desired levels. But it will take a while: inflation over 2015 is seen between 0.6% and 0.8%, moving up to between 1.6% and 1.9% next year. For 2017, inflation is seen ranging between 1.9% and 2.0%.
