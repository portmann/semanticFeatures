Yellen Upbeat on Foreign Central Bank Stimulus for U.S., Despite Dollar Impact - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Friday that overseas central bank stimulus is mixed but ultimately positive for the U.S. economy. Mr. Yellen, speaking to a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in response to an audience question that it’s true that stimulus in the European Union and Japan were helping lead to a stronger dollar that will weigh on total U.S. growth by lowering American exports. But she cautioned more was at play. With the foreign central bank actions, “there are a number of channels of influence.” They might push the dollar higher, but “to the extent that these policies succeed in improving the outlook in our trade partners, faster growth abroad” is a plus for the U.S., Ms. Yellen said. The actions leading to a stronger dollar are also pushing down long-term borrowing costs for the U.S. These rates are “also a positive” for the outlook, she said. That said, Ms. Yellen observed “clearly we do have to take into account the global economic environment, and the impact it has on our own outlook.” And what’s happening is “mixed,” she said. Some central bankers have been signaling that further dollar gains could cause them to think differently about the outlook for Fed policy. Most officials expect to raise interest rates this year, and Ms. Yellen affirmed the likelihood of that in her formal remarks Friday. But too much vigor in the dollar coupled with its impact on markets may complicate that analysis. In remarks Thursday, Atlanta Fed Chief Dennis Lockhart said that given overseas policy actions, “I think we have to be a little concerned the longer rates will rise in concert” with the increases in short-term rates Fed officials believe are likely, he said. Ms. Yellen also said after her speech the Fed considered implementing negative interest rates in the past, having lowered short-term rates to near-zero levels. She said that officials concluded there was little benefit to following that path. Citing negative rates in parts of Europe, Ms. Yellen said “I’m surprised that there hasn’t been more pick up in the demand for cash” in affected countries.
