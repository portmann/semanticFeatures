Fed Paves The Road To Higher Interest Rates | Seeking Alpha Fed Paves The Road To Higher Interest Rates The recent Federal Reserve statement acknowledges progress in the U.S. labor market, while continuing the watch for higher inflation and wages. For the Fed, acknowledging improvement in the U.S. labor market is a critical first step on the road to hiking interest rates. But labor market conditions haven't really been the determining issue in our minds, instead we have believed, and still do, that oil, wages, and core inflation will determine when the Fed first raises rates and the pace of following increases. With only six weeks to the next Fed meeting, we believe the likelihood is low that inflation measures will present a clear trend to the point of giving the Fed reasonable ammunition to raise interest rates. By Byron Carson, Portfolio Manager, Principal Global Fixed Income The recent Federal Reserve statement acknowledges progress in the U.S. labor market, while continuing the watch for higher inflation and wages. Looking at this statement in its two component parts may help us better understand how the Fed is thinking about a possible rate hike later this year. In January, we in Principal Global Fixed Income forecasted a continuing economic recovery with solid job growth throughout the year. We believed then, as we still do today, that economic growth as well as job growth, would trend on a path, which would make it possible for the Fed to raise interest rates at least once in 2015. After its latest meeting, the Fed acknowledged labor market progress on two slight, but meaningful fronts. First, the committee strengthened its view of the labor market by removing the word "somewhat," from its description of labor market improvement. The new sentence reads, "On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year." The previous Fed statement read, "…underutilization of labor resources has diminished somewhat…" For the Fed, acknowledging improvement in the U.S. labor market is a critical first step on the road to hiking interest rates. And since the Fed acknowledged this improvement, they also modified the labor conditions needed in order to raise interest rates in the following sentence, "The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise… the fed funds rate, when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market…" My emphasis on "some" is the only change to the conditions the Fed will need to see before raising rates. "Some further improvement" is a lower bar to reach than "further improvement," so the Committee is fully consistent when they acknowledge labor market improvement and at the same time lower the bar for the conditions needed to raise rates. The best takeaway from the Fed's recent statement is that the real U.S. economy is progressing, so rate hikes could very well be right around the corner. Other Factors Will also Determine a Rate Hike But labor market conditions haven't really been the determining issue in our minds, instead we have believed, and still do, that oil, wages, and core inflation will determine when the Fed first raises rates and the pace of following increases. We stated at the beginning of 2015, that we believed before raising rates, the Fed would want to see oil prices stabilized and wages and core inflation trending higher. These measures have shown some progress as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil remains above the low price of $43.46 from mid-March, but has fallen from $61.43 in June to $48.79, as of July 29. Indeed, the only change in the Fed statement related to inflation was deleting the reference to "…energy prices appear to have stabilized." Hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory employees have also made progress bottoming on a year-over-year basis in February at 1.66% up to 1.94% in June, but this is still below its mark of 2.04% in May. Core inflation is a bit trickier to assess since core CPI clearly bottomed late last year at 1.60% year-over-year moving up to 1.76% year-over-year in June. However, the Fed's preferred inflation measure core PCE has instead moved lower on a year-over-year basis from mid-last year reaching a recent low point of 1.24% year-over-year in May. The Fed stated, "Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term…" They also stated that "…it will be appropriate to raise… the federal funds rate when it… is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term." Since the beginning of the year, our view on the road to interest rate hikes hasn't changed course. We continue to believe that the Fed will want to see stable oil prices and a clear trend of higher wages and core inflation. To date, some progress of inflation measures has been made, but the conditions haven't yet been met for a rate hike. With only six weeks to the next Fed meeting, we believe the likelihood is low that these inflation measures will present a clear trend to the point of giving the Fed reasonable ammunition to raise interest rates.
