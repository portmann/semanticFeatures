Grand Central: With Greek Sales Tax, Policy Makers Again Choose Short-Term Pain - Real Time Economics - WSJ Central Banks Likely to Jump Into China Bond Market It is striking how policy makers managing economies most in need of long-term reform keep choosing short-term pain in the process. Greek lawmakers agreed Wednesday to a new package of austerity measures, including increased value-added taxes, in exchange for up to 86 billion euros worth of new loans to keep its financial system afloat. The idea is to raise government revenue and harmonize generally-low Greek sales taxes with the rest of the European Union. (Of course, if German policy makers really wanted harmonized sales taxes, they could also cut theirs and give the limp European economy a shot in the arm in the process.) We know how this will play out for Greece in the short-run. Twice in the past two decades Japanese policy makers have increased sales taxes in a weak economy to address long-term budget issues.Â Japan’s economy sank into recession, increasing the nationâ€™s ratio of government debt to economic output. In the U.S., the Obama Administration and Congress after the financial crisis were unable to reach a deal on long-term budget reforms. Instead they chose short-run cuts to discretionary spending and immediate higher taxes on the wealthy, draining the U.S. expansion of energy. Budget reform seems best enacted slowly for economies in distress, a point former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made repeatedly and to little effect during U.S. budget debates. Trust is a central problem here, especially in Greece. If policy makers donâ€™t take hard steps right away, itâ€™s not clear they will ever follow through on promises to streamline budgets. Still, austerity now for Greece is going to be an awfully painful â€“ and potentially counterproductive — way to rebuild trust. Yellen Aims to Move Rates Up This Year, but Slowly.Â  Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that recent turbulence in Greece, China and elsewhere overseas isnâ€™t threatening the U.S. economy enough to divert the central bank from plans to raise short-term interest rates later this year. She was more inclined to move rates up soon and proceed slowly than to wait a long time and move aggressively to catch up if the Fed finds itself behind the curve in preventing the economy or markets from overheating, she told the House Financial Services Committee. Moving soon and slowly, she said, could give the central bank flexibility as it proceeds. ICYMI: Our Live blog provided play-by-play coverage of the hearing. Beige Book Offers Hints of Rising Wages. The U.S. economy continued its expansion through mid-2015 as auto sales and lending picked up around the country, although wage pressures remained â€œmodest,â€? according to the Fedâ€™s latest survey of regional economic conditions.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday the economy could easily deal with a rate rise right now, but she didnâ€™t call for short-term rates to be boosted at any specific time. Fedâ€™s Williams Expects Rate Rise This Year. â€œI still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to raise rates poses its own risks ,â€? San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Wednesday, without predicting when the Fed would start raising short-term rates from near zero. Bank of Canada Cuts Rates. The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 0.50% Wednesday, citing a deeper-than-expected impact of the decline in oil prices and a sluggish recovery in nonenergy exports. The central bank said it projects that Canadaâ€™s economy shrank modestly in the first half of 2015, and said plunging business investment and weak exports led it to lower its growth outlook to 1.1% for the full year from the previous forecast of 1.9%.

Greeceâ€™s Parliament passed austerity measures needed to secure a fresh bailout, but a rebellion within the ruling Syriza party is testing whether Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras can hold his government together as he seeks to complete the deal. Five Things to Watch at the ECBâ€™s July Press Conference. With the Eureopean Central Bankâ€™s quantitative easing program running at about â‚¬60 billion per month and interest rates essentially as low as they can go, additional policy stimulus is highly unlikely on Thursday. ECB President Mario Draghiâ€™s post-meeting press conference will surely be dominated by Greece with some key dates approaching. Here are five things to looks for .

Bad Loans on the Decline. Consumers and businesses chastened by the recent recession are paying back their debts more regularly than they have in more than a decade. On Tuesday,Â banking giantsÂ J.P. Morgan ChaseÂ & Co. and Wells FargoÂ & Co. both said the percentage of loans they couldnâ€™t collect was close to zero in the second quarter . -1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT): European Central Bank releases a policy statement -1230 GMT (8:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™sÂ DraghiÂ speaks at a press conference in Frankfurt -1800 GMT (2 p.m. EDT) BOEâ€™s Carney speaks Health and Unemployment During Macroeconomic Crises. Prashant Bharadwaj, Petter Lundborg and Dan-Olof Rooth say that health and unemployment in an economic crisis are linked. â€œUsing data on adults during Swedenâ€™s unexpected economic crisis in the early 1990s, we show that early and later life health are important determinants of job loss after the crisis, but not before,â€? they write. â€œWe conclude that poor health (both in early life and as adults) is an important indicator of vulnerability during economic shocks.â€? Greece Lessons for an Indebted World. The Journalâ€™s Greg Ip writes that Greeceâ€™s debt woes should serve as a cautionary tale for the rest of the world, forcing officials to make difficult decisions. â€œA country can shed such steep debt several ways: via austerity, economic growth and low real (that is, inflation-adjusted) interest rates. More common than appreciated, though, is the more radical step of restructuring debt by reducing interest, lengthening the maturity or slashing the amount owed,â€? he writes. Chinaâ€™s Recovering Economy. Leland R. Miller and Craig Charney of China Beige Book International argue that Chinaâ€™s improvement is real. â€œWhile official data is indeed unreliable, our firmâ€™s latest research confirms that the Chinese economy is improving after several disappointing quartersâ€”just not for the reasons given by Beijing. The modest but broad-based improvement in the Chinese economy that we tracked in the second quarter may seem at odds with the headlines of carnage in the countryâ€™s financial markets.â€? Industrial Production Rises. Industrial production, a measure of output in the manufacturing, utilities and mining sectors, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% from May, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. Producer Prices Rise. The producer-price indexâ€”measuring the prices companies charge to other firms, consumers and the governmentâ€” rose 0.4% in June after jumping 0.5% in May, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The eurozoneâ€™s adjusted trade surplus narrowed in May as exports dropped from April, data from the European Unionâ€™s statistics agency showed Thursday, a sign that a weaker euro exchange rate has yet to provide a lasting boost to the regionâ€™s economy. New Zealand’s inflation rate improved slightly but remains well below the central bank’s target range of 1% to 3% as prices for petrol and international air fares were significantly lower over the last 12 months–Dow Jones Newswires.
