Cleveland Fed’s Median CPI Shows Steady Rate of Inflation - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Friday that underlying inflation is most likely stronger than more traditional price indexes indicate. The Labor Department said Friday its consumer price index rose 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the first annual increase since December. The Median CPI is one of a small class of alternative inflation gauges that aim to provide an alternative read on price movements in the U.S. economy. The index tosses out the biggest price gainers and losers in a given month. Its creators say that gives a truer picture than the Labor Department’s CPI measure or its so-called core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, and was up 1.8% in the year ended in June. The June CPI was in part boosted by a highly unusual jump in egg prices. That’s exactly the sort of thing Fed officials would want to shrug off, and explain away. The Cleveland Fed’s Median CPI has been showing pretty steady annual gains for a while in the low 2% range. The Cleveland measure usually runs hotter than the Fed’s preferred measure, the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index. This suggests inflation currently is running just a bit under, but close to the Fed’s 2% target. So it’s quite possible inflation is both higher and steadier than the Labor Department’s CPI indicates. Fed officials have said they won’t start raising short-term interest rates from near zero until they are reasonably confident inflation will rise toward 2% and most have indicated they are looking to move this year. The Cleveland Fed’s inflation measure could help boost their confidence.
