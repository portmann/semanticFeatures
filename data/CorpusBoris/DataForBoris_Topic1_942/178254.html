The Fed Keeps SLV Up, For Now - iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV) | Seeking Alpha The FOMC meeting concluded with no changes to policy, but its members voiced their concerns over the global economy. The silver market could benefit for the near term from the Fed keeping rates low for a bit longer. The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its recent meeting, as expected, with no rate hike. The tone of the statement was considered by many as dovish - the FOMC voiced its concerns over the progress of the global economy. Following the statement and Chair Yellen's press conference, price of the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: SLV ) bounced back. And the price of SLV could further rally if the FOMC keeps moving towards maintaining its current policy unchanged for a bit more. But, over the coming months, the Fed will keep making us guess whether rates will rise this year. Following the recent decision, the price of SLV bounced back. As you can see, in the past, when the Fed tended to issue a dovish statement, the price of SLV rallied. And when the statement was more hawkish, SLV tended to fall. As I pointed out in a recent article , the main paragraph from the statement worth noticing is : "Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term". The main difference is that as opposed to previous FOMC statements, this time the Fed acknowledged that the recent global developments are starting to be a concern that could impact the Fed's policy - i.e. the Fed may hold off the first rate hike to a later date than previously estimated. The FOMC also revised down its outlook for the GDP, unemployment and inflation in 2016-2017. Except for the fall in rate of unemployment, the other economic measurements actually suggest the Fed may keep rates lower than previously estimated. This could also explain the change in the dot plot. For 2015, instead of 15 members for a rate hike, there are now 13 members. The median was revised down by 0.25% to 0.375 - this means only one rate hike this year of 0.25%. And fewer members still think the cash rate could reach 0.875% by the end of the year. For next year, not only the median dropped by 0.25%, but also a few think the rate will reach 1.625% - last meeting's median rate - by the end of the year. The 2017 and long-run median cash rates were also cut by 0.25%; the FOMC expects rates will have a lower trajectory by 0.25% over the coming years. In other words, the recent economic developments could persist and keep the Fed's cash rate lower than previously expected. For silver investors, this is good news because these low cash rates could keep down long-term treasury yields - another factor that could reverse the recent decline in the price of SLV. It's unlikely that we were to see a sharp rise in the price of SLV to its former high levels in the near term, but it could offer some relief for bullion investors. If the October statement will be also considered dovish - the Fed reiterates its concerns over the global economy and sees additional downward pressure on U.S. inflation in the near term - then SLV could get another modest short-term boost from such a decision. Following the recent statement, the implied probabilities of an October rate hike are only at 11%; the odds of a hike in December are 39% - also lower than previously projected. But don't close the door on this year's liftoff. The FOMC keeps making us assume there could be a hike this year. After all, over the weekend, Fed officials including San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker expressed their take and think the Fed should raise rates this year - Lacker was also the only dissenter and thought the Fed should raise rates this year. Nonetheless, it will eventually boil down to what Yellen thinks. And, for now, she seems less inclined to raise rates. If the Fed keeps its low rates a bit longer, this could bring back up SLV's price a bit. But it's too soon to consider it a start of a recovery. After all, rates have been down for a long time with little positive impact on SLV. But over the near term, the delay in the Fed's rate hike along with the global uncertainty could help boost the demand for SLV - even if for a short time.
