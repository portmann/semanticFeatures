Grand Central: Chinese Stocks Defy Signs of Economic Distress  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Stocks in China rose 3% Monday after the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China cut short-term interest rates for the third time in six months. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 74% since November. In a conventional sense, lower rates are supposed to have this effect on stocks. Low rates reduce the cost of funds for firms and investors, pushing up asset values. It is straightforward math in any stock valuation model. But it is hard to reconcile the apparent exuberance of investors toward Chinese equities with growing evidence of a debilitating economic slowdown in the worldâ€™s second largest economy. Policy makers are clearly distressed. My colleague Lingling Wei notes in her report on Chinaâ€™s rate cut that the PBOC warned in its monetary-policy report Friday about the challenges posed by rising debt levels. Among those challenges, it has limited the room for further fiscal expansion to respond to slow growth. New reports showed Chinese car sales slowed in April to 1.67 million vehicles, the lowest figure recorded since February 2013, when Chinaâ€™s Lunar New Year dragged sales down. Meantime inflation, at 1.5% in April from a year-earlier, is running far lower than officials want . One problem posed by low inflation is that it holds up inflation-adjusted interest rates. The PBOC cuts interest rates, but firms have less money to pay back their debts because they canâ€™t keep up on what they charge for their goods and services. Stocks markets are supposed to be leading indicators of economic activity. It is worth remembering, however, that sometimes they are wildly wrong. Hereâ€™s one historical reference that might come in handy as China stocks soar: The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs in October 2007, after the Federal Reserve had started responding to signs of a worsening U.S. debt crisis. We know now that events were about to turn dramatically worse in the U.S., for stock investors and just about everyone else. April Jobs Numbers Keep Fed Expectations on Track. Federal Reserve officials will want further confirmation the economy is growing at the 2.3% to 2.7% pace they project and inflation heading back toward their target of 2%. This means a June interest rate increase looks unlikely and September the most probable liftoff date . Payroll growth bounced back after slowing sharply in March, with employers adding 223,000 jobs in April, which is in line withÂ  their average since September 2012 . Read All About the April Jobs Report in 12 Charts . Full Employment Possible in Six Months. According to the Atlanta Fed’s job calculator, if the economy can maintain the average monthly pace of job gains seen in April, it can reach the 5% jobless levels that currently defines the lower end of the range of what many Fed officials determine to be full employment within six months. As many central bankers see it, when the jobless rate goes below this level, inflation pressures should begin to mount. The Upside-Down World of Negative Rates.Â  The New York Fedâ€™s director of research James McAndrews in a speech dives deep into the complications that would arise if negative rates become a more permanent and prevalent reality . Negative rates could result in employees leaving paychecks un-deposited, debt collectors pushing for slower repayments, taxpayer pre-paying what’s due. Mr. McAndrews warns society’s financial and legal frameworks aren’t set up for that–Dow Jones Newswires. Democrats Threaten to Oppose Bank Regulatory Relief Measure.Â Frustration over negotiations on a bill to provide relief to banks boiled over on Friday, with Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee unanimously threatening to oppose legislation from Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.). Dudley Booed in the Bronx. New York Fed President William Dudley earned himself a Bronx cheer while speaking to the boroughâ€™s community and banking lenders for professing his allegiance to the Boston Red Sox . â€œIâ€™m from Massachusetts,â€? he said, speaking deep in rival Yankeesâ€™ territory. Dudley did not address the national economic outlook or monetary policy but instead highlighted the importance of community banks in supporting job creating . China Cuts Interest Rates as Economic Growth Slows.Â China cut interest rates for the third time in six months amid a worse-than-expected economic slowdown, as authorities scramble to ease the heavy debt burdens of companies and governments. PBOC Sees No Need for QE Despite More Pressure on Economy. China’s economy faces downward pressure in the short term, but there is no need to use quantitative easing to aggressively boost liquidity, the nation’s central bank said Friday. The People’s Bank of China in its first-quarter monetary-policy report said mounting levels of debt have limited Beijing’s ability to use government-led investment to stimulate the economy. Asiaâ€™s Stalling Exports Make the Case for Stimulus. A slew of recent data across Asia is underlining how one of the worldâ€™s major economic engines is sputtering , raising the likelihood of further interest rate cuts and public spending to support growth. An uneven U.S. recovery , combined with a slowing Chinese economy , has cast a pall over the regionâ€™s prospects. Bank of England Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged, as Expected. The Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Monday amid signs the U.K. economy had a slow start to the year. In its first policy announcement since the U.K. election last week, the BOE said that its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee kept the central bankâ€™s main rate at 0.5% and the size of its bond portfolio at 375 billion pounds ($579 billion). As if ECB’s Draghi Wasn’t Busy Enough. The European Central Bank president has been writing lots of letters . The ECB released nine such letters on Friday, which are responses to questions posed to him by members of European parliament. The topics run the gamut from the ECBâ€™s QE program toÂ  electronic money ,Â  Cypriot banks , non- performing loans Â and even the ECBâ€™sÂ  new skyscraper headquarters . Mr. Draghi doesnâ€™t break much new ground in his letters, but they do show his latest thinking on monetary policy and other matters. ECBâ€™s Constancio: QE is Working. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said quantitative easing is beneficial for the stability of the financial system. He said the low market interest rates that have inspired a â€œsearch for yieldâ€? among investors have been a consequence of weak economic growth and low inflation, rather than the central bankâ€™s purchases of government bonds, or QE. As QE moves the inflation rate back towards the central banks inflation target of just under 2%, market interest rates should rise, he said. ECBâ€™s Nowotny: Capital Controls Can Help in Emergency–Reuters. Ewald Nowotny, a member of the ECBâ€™s governing council told Reuters Friday that capital controls â€œcan be applied only in very special circumstances.â€? Nowotny said capital controls had been effective in Cyprus. Some analysts worry about a bank run should Greece fail to reach an agreement with its European creditors. Swiss Currency Remains Overvalued, Central Bank President Says. The Swiss franc remains “significantly overvalued” and this poses considerable challenges for the Alpine country’s economy, Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan said Friday. He said the central bank’s decision in January to scrap its cap on the franc had led to an appreciation of the currency that would have a big impact on the country’s exporters and the economy.â€”Dow Jones Newswires Oil Jobs Fall. The fall in gas prices is hitting oil and gas extraction workers hard. Employment in the industry fell by 3,300 in April to a seasonally adjusted 194,400. Thatâ€™s the fewest since March 2014 and represents a year-over-year decline for an industry that until recently had been a growth engine for the labor market . -0730 GMT (3:30 a.m. EDT): Swedenâ€™s Riksbank releases minutes of its April 28 policy meeting -0245 GMT (10:45 p.m. Tuesday EDT): BOJâ€™s Sato speaks in Tokyo -0645 GMT (2:45 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Hansson speaks in Talinn -0930 GMT (5:30 a.m. EDT): BOE releases May inflation report -10 a.m. EDT: ECBâ€™s Draghi speaks in Washington -Philippine central bank releases a policy statement -Central Reserve Bank of Peru releases a policy statement -0340 GMT (11:40 p.m. Thursday EDT): BOJâ€™s Kuroda speaks in Tokyo -Bank of Korea releases a policy statement RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Difficulties Forecasting Wage Growth. Cleveland Fed economist Edward S. Knotek II suggests that obsessing over wage growth may not be very useful. â€œMovements in compensation growthâ€”which depend on a complex combination of labor market slack, bargaining power, worker productivity, inflation, and myriad other factorsâ€”have been essentially unpredictable since the mid-1990s.â€? The researcher notes, â€œthese difficulties in forecasting labor compensation provide at least some evidence for why wages often appear to have little predictive power when forecasting inflation.â€? Even with the April Rebound, Itâ€™s a Weak Start to 2015. The Journalâ€™s Greg Ip says growth in hours worked has slowed, suggesting that the recovery may have started to slow. â€œBottom line, the jobs data do not ratify the message from GDP that the economy is shrinking. But they confirm a slowdown has occurred. It remains to be seen how long it lasts.â€? Markets must temper relief at UK poll result. Donâ€™t expect last weekâ€™s Conservative Party victory to change much in terms of the UKâ€™s economy, warns Stephanie Flanders Â in the Financial Times.Â â€œIt is important to realize that none of the factors that will do most to shape Britainâ€™s medium-term outlook was decided on May 7,â€? she writes. â€œCall me crazy, but I think the rate of domestic demand growth in the eurozone in 2015 and 2016 will have a much bigger impact on the prospects for UK companies than the number of Scottish National party MPs in Westminster â€” or even the number of Conservative ones.â€? Labour Power Sets The Neutral Real Rate. Very low interest rates are the result of major shifts in the structure of the global economy, rather than the actions of central banks, writesÂ Columbia Threadneedle Investments’s Toby Nangle for VoxEU. “Globalisation and associated labour market convergence have been associated with a collapse in labour power in the west,” he writes. “When labour had power, the marginal costs of labour were high. As such, there was a big incentive to invest in capital to substitute labour for capital, and this brought the cost of capital higher.” - The U.S. Economy Probably Contracted in the First Quarter. New first quarter data on trade and inventories suggests that the economy shrank in the first quarter . Last month, the Commerce Department estimated that GDP grew an anemic 0.2% but the weak new numbers have made forecasters lower their estimates. -Eurozone GDP Likely Grew at a Faster Pace Into 2015. Official figures due this coming week are likely to show the economy of the eurozone grew at a stronger pace during the first quarter of 2015, economists say. Analysts expect the 19-nation bloc’s gross domestic product to have expanded 0.5%, compared with 0.3% in the final quarter of 2014, SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
