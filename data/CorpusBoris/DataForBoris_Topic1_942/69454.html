Fed’s Williams Says Never Use Rates to Prick Bubbles - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve should refrain from using interest-rate policy to address risks to financial stability “even as a last resort,” San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Thursday. That is because the effects of monetary policy on financial markets and excess risk taking are highly uncertain and potentially detrimental to the central bank’s main objectives of stable inflation and maximum employment. “I am convinced that monetary policy should not be used to address risks to financial stability given the very real and sizable costs, not to mention that the potential benefits are anything but certain,” Mr. Williams said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at the Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance in Singapore. His remarks come amid debate over whether central banks should consider raising interest rates to prick apparent financial asset bubbles while they are forming, to forestall the damage to the financial system that could occur if they burst on their own. Before the financial crisis, the standard view at many central banks including the Fed was that, because asset bubbles are too hard to spot ahead of time, policy makers shouldn’t raise rates to restrain them. Instead, central bankers should wait until after they burst, and if necessary cut interest rates to help the economy recover afterward. The heavy toll of the 2008 financial crisis that followed the housing bubble, estimated at several trillion dollars in lost economic output and millions of jobs eliminated, led many policy makers to question that view. Former Fed Board Governor Jeremy Stein, for instance, was a proponent of incorporating financial-stability concerns into monetary-policy deliberations. The Bank of England has embraced such an approach, with its Financial Policy Committee providing direct input into the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee. Mr. Williams firmly pushed back against the notion the Fed should do the same. “Monetary policy is poorly suited for dealing with financial stability concerns, even as a last resort,” he said. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has voiced similar concerns about using monetary policy to address financial bubbles but, unlike Mr. Williams, she has remained open to using interest rates if other tools failed to restrain frothy markets.
