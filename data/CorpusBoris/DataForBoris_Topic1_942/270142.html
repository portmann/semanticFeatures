Reading The Fed In 2016: Will They Or Won't They | Seeking Alpha The Fed meets 8 times in 2016, and volatility should be expected as we approach each meeting. The Fed will be determined to avoid surprising the markets with its rate hikes in 2016, so as not to rock global equity and bond markets. Fed dot plots show 3-4 hikes in 2016 is most probable, but we must consider a more hawkish FOMC committee. So it is out of the way - the first rate hike is put to bed. Now with that event risk out of the way, the market's focus can swing elsewhere in 2016, or will it? The FOMC meets a total of 8 times in 2016 - January, March, April, June, July, September, November and December - and I suspect we will see volatility return to the markets each time we near one of the meetings, and with 8 months the Fed can choose to hike, 2016 could well be tumultuous. What I learnt from December's rate hike was that the decision was over 70% priced in (the highest reading yet in 2015), according to fed funds futures, which gauge traders' expectations for future interest rates. The high expectation of a rate hike in December was in part due to the Fed's communication with the markets, conditioning it for a rate hike in December, coupled with a strong October jobs report . I feel going forward in 2016, the Fed will want to make sure any potential rate hike will be priced in/expected by the markets before they act, so as not to rock the equity and bond markets, such as during the 1994 tightening phase . This may seem contrary to the Fed's mandate, which primarily includes employment and inflation in the United States. However, we saw in the Fed's September meeting minutes that they were concerned with the weaker growth outlook in China coupled with falling stock prices around the world. It is arguable that the recovery in global equity markets post-September, coupled with loose monetary policies by both the ECB and BOJ, played a part in the Fed's decision to lift off in December. As such, the fed funds futures should be closely watched to gauge the market's expectation/positioning going into each FOMC meeting, and it is of interest to the Fed to sufficiently raise the market's expectation in advance to prepare it for an impending rate hike. This is to prevent surprising the markets and to avoid any potential selloffs in equity and bond markets worldwide. That said, how many rate hikes are currently expected in 2016? At the moment, 3-4, judging from the Dot Plot diagram provided in FOMC's December meeting. As seen in the diagram below, the median FOMC member expects rates to be between 1.25% to 1.50% by end 2016. Considering there are 8 FOMC meetings in 2016, and assuming the committee will raise rates by 0.25% each time they choose to act, we could see 3-4 rate hikes out of the 8 meetings in 2016. However, as detailed in one of my previous articles , the 2016 FOMC committee is expected to be more hawkish in nature, which could tilt the median rate expectation up above the current 1.25-1.50%. A more hawkish FOMC committee may lead to a faster pace of rate hikes in 2016, but judging from how the Fed is increasingly concerned with the health of global markets (outside the scope of their typical mandate), I believe the Fed would still go to great lengths to ensure the markets are positioned and conditioned for an impending rate hike.
