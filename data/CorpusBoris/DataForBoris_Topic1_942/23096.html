Grand Central: The Great Oil Price Easing - Real Time Economics - WSJ In the era of inflation targeting, central bankers tell us they are inclined to “look through” developments that threaten to temporarily raise or lower the rate at which consumer prices are changing. Their logic is that monetary policy works with a lag, and that in any case a national central bank can’t affect the global forces that drive energy and food prices higher or lower. For central bankers, it’s the medium term that matters and they respond to more fundamental forces that determine whether the goods and services demanded by households can be supplied without pushing prices sharply higher or lower. But that’s not how the last six months have looked. Figures released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week showed that the annual rate of inflation across its 34 members picked up in February , to a meager 0.6% from 0.5% in January.Â It had fallen sharply over the previous seven months, due almost entirely to a collapse in oil prices. Across the Group of 20 largest economies, which account for 85% of world output, inflation had also been in a long decline, until it too picked up in February. The response of central bankers to the sharp fall in oil prices was not a measured passivity that showed only concern for the medium term. Instead, central bankers provided a flood of new stimulus on a scale not seen since the months that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The OECD calculates that since December, central banks from countries that account for 48% of global economic output have eased, and that doesn’t include the Bank of Japan, which acted earlier than most in October. That’s not to say central bankers have been wrong to act as they did. In many parts of the world, inflation was already too low even before oil prices began to fall, and a slide into deflation seemed like a very real threat. But there does seem to be some inconsistency between the declared philosophy of modern central banking, and its actual practice. “Looking through” short-term price pressures may no longer be the most sensible behavior and it might be better to acknowledge that the medium-term is just a lot of short-terms strung together. Fedâ€™s Dudley Links Weak First Quarter to Temporary Factors.
