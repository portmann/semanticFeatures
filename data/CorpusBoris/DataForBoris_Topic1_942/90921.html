Inflation Ate the Average Worker’s Raise in May - Real Time Economics - WSJ Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings fell 0.1% from April, the Labor Department said on Thursday , the latest reminder of paltry wage gains for many Americans. The dip followed a 0.3% bump in pay that was offset by a 0.4% rise in the consumer-price index . Real average hourly earnings have been flat or fallen for four straight months, though the picture is a little brighter when measuring from a year earlier. From May 2014 to May 2015, they were up 2.2%. The Federal Reserve is watching inflation and wages–among many indicators–as it weighs the first increase for its benchmark interest rate since 2006. The central bank on Wednesday said it would leave interest rates unchanged Â while it awaitsÂ signs of firming inflation and further improvement in the labor market. Data out Thursday offer hope on both fronts. The consumer-price index rose the most in more than two years in May. And initial claims for jobless benefits , a measure of layoffs, remained at a level consistent with steady job growth. â€œWage increases are still running at a low level, but there have been some tentative signs that wage growth is picking up,â€? Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday. â€œWeâ€™ve seen an increase in the growth rate of the employment-cost index and a mild uptick in the growth of average hourly earnings.â€? But numbers on real hourly and weekly earnings show how higher inflation can cancel out those mild wage gains. Higher gasoline prices were the big reason inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings barely budged from the prior month. But oil is still a lot cheaper than a year ago, hence the divergence between the monthly and annual measures.
