When Fed Policy Hits Emerging Economies, Some Do Better Than Others. A New Paper Suggests Why - Real Time Economics - WSJ An investor looks at stock information at a securities firm in Shanghai late last year. Emerging market economies with stronger fundamentals are better positioned to weather policy spillovers, according to new Federal Reserve research.Â  What happens in the U.S. doesnâ€™t always stay in the U.S. when it comes to monetary policy. But emerging economies may be better positioned to weather spillovers from the Federal Reserveâ€™s actions if they start out on a strong foundation, according to a recent analysis by central bank economists. “Taken at face value, these results suggest that policies to further strengthen economic fundamentals could go a long way to help the [emerging market economies] mitigate any disruptive effects from eventual normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies,” Shaghil Ahmed, Brahima Coulibaly and Andrei Zlate wrote in a discussion paper released last month by the Fed board of governors. Spillovers, when policy decisions in one country affect other nations , have been the subject of study and debate in recent years as big central banks including the Fed have taken aggressive action to shore up their domestic economies. Raghuram Rajan, governor of India’s central bank, has criticized the Fed for not expressing public concern about the effects of its easy-money policies on emerging market economies Â and recently said the world needs “much clearer rules of the game” as to what is and isnâ€™t allowed. Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Fed and former head of the Bank of Israel, said this week that the U.S. central bank will keep in mind the effects on others as it prepares to tighten policy, and will â€œseek to minimize adverse spillovers.â€? But, Mr. Fischer said, â€œThe most important contribution that U.S. policy makers can make to the health of the world economy is to keep our own house in orderâ€”and the same goes for all countries.â€? The analysis by Messrs. Ahmed and Coulibaly, both economists at the Fed board in Washington, and Mr. Zlate, an economist at the Boston Fed, looked at a half-dozen financial crises over two decades plus the 2013Â  â€œtaper tantrum,â€? when expectations that the Fed might soon begin reducing its bond purchases roiled financial markets. Financial conditions in emerging-market countries deteriorated sharply during the taper tantrum, the researchers said. But differences emerged across a sample of 20 emerging-market nations. Countries â€œthat had relatively better fundamentals to begin withâ€¦suffered less deterioration during the taper-tantrum episode as measured by a broad range of financial variables, including exchange rate, depreciation pressure and government bond yields,â€? they wrote. (The six variables used to gauge economic fundamentals were current account balance as a percent of gross domestic product, foreign exchange reserves as a percent of GDP, short-term external debt as a percent of foreign exchange reserves, gross government debt as a percent of GDP, inflation and the rise in bank credit to the private sector.) Other forces also were at work, they added, but â€œthe strength of economic fundamentals explains much more of the variation in responses across [emerging market economies] compared with other factors.â€? However, there was little variation based on economic fundamentals among emerging markets during some earlier financial crises, suggesting that â€œinternational investors may have moved from herd behavior in the pastâ€“such as during the 1990s and the early 2000sâ€“to progressively differentiating more and more among [emerging market economies] according to their economic fundamentals through the [global financial crisis], the European debt crisis and the taper tantrum,â€? the researchers wrote.
