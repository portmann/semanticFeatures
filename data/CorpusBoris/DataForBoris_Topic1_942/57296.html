Pressure Mounts on Sweden’s Riksbank to Ease Policy Again - Real Time Economics - WSJ Sweden’s consumer price index fell 0.2% in April, below expectations of a 0.1% rise.Â Officials at the central bank have repeatedly said they wonâ€™t tolerate any more negative CPI surprises. A flickering revival in the Swedish inflation rate fizzled out in April, data showed Tuesday, piling pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates to new record lows. The Swedish statistics agency said the consumer price index, which measures the cost of a range of household goods and services, fell 0.2% compared with April last year. That was below the 0.1% rise forecast of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal. The Swedish krona dived against the euro, which rose to 9.31 kronor from 9.25 kronor, as investors judged the inflation data made a further interest rate cut more likely. Officials at the Riksbank, the central bank, have repeatedly said they wonâ€™t tolerate any more negative CPI surprises as they seek to boost inflation closer to a 2% target. In the minutes of the bankâ€™s most recent meeting, also published Tuesday, Gov. Stefan Ingves said the bank stands ready to act, even between scheduled meetings, to make monetary policy still more expansionary if the inflation outlook warrants it. The Swedish central bank, the worldâ€™s oldest, already has a benchmark interest rate of minus 0.25% and has launched a bond-buying program. Mr. Ingves said the Riksbank could cut rates further, buy more bonds, lend money to companies via banks, or intervene in the foreign-exchange market. Like other small central banks close to the eurozone, the Riksbank has been rocked by the effects of the European Central Bankâ€™s massive quantitative-easing program . The ECB bond-buying program is good for Sweden’s already fairly bright growth prospects in that it is helping the eurozone, a vital market for Swedish goods, to recover from a drawn-out downturn. But the program has also pushed down the value of the euro against the likes of the Swedish krona, making goods entering Sweden cheaper and choking off a vital source of inflation. That has complicated the job of the Riksbank, which was struggling to meet its inflation target long before the ECB’s latest easing. Prices fell in Sweden in annual terms in each of the six months to January this year before turning positive in February and March. Market watchers think the chances of the Swedish central bank changing policy before the next scheduled meeting in July has increased following April’s CPI fall.
