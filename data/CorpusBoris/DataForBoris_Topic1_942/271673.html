Fed Dot Plot Forecast Of 4 Rate Hikes In 2016 Seems Really Unlikely | Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking , Get Smart, Get Wealthy (257 clicks) Dec. 22, 2015  7:57 AM ET  |  Includes: RINF by: Dave Dierking The Fed's "Dot Plot" diagram that gets released with every quarterly Fed meeting is one of the most watched indicators of future Fed policy decisions. It basically surveys each Fed committee member to see where they see interest rates landing at various points in the future. While the report is intriguing in that it gives us an idea of where the Fed thinks that rates are going, it also shows how incredibly inaccurate these projections and, in recent cases, how the Fed may be getting a little overzealous with future rate hikes. The Fed has been forecasting rate hikes for around two years now and whether it's due to something like weaker than expected job growth, slow wage growth or low unemployment the can has been getting kicked down the road. Looking at the dot plot from the most recent Fed meeting, the greatest number of committee members (7 of the 17) are projecting a Fed Funds rate target range of 1.25-1.50% by the end of 2016. That's the equivalent of quarter point rate hikes in each of the next four quarterly meetings. With economic growth solid but not strong and the Fed seeming to be unwilling to rock the boat and send things back into recession, this scenario seems quite unlikely. Most members got it right saying that rates would remain near zero in 2014 but the risk of that being not right seemed pretty low. More interesting is the fact that at this meeting, 11 of the 16 members saw a Fed Funds rate of 1% or above with 3 in the 2% or above range. Even as recently as the March meeting, 14 of the 17 members saw at least two quarter point hikes by the end of the year with nearly half of the members projecting three quarter-point hikes or more. The June meeting saw expectations moderating again, but even 6 months ago, most members still saw quarter-point hikes coming in both September and December. What I find interesting here is the wildly disparate views of not only the Fed members but the members of the financial media as well. Some outlets were discussing a "one and done" scenario where the Fed would raise in December and then wait at least a couple of quarters to see how the economy would react before moving again. The Fed clearly sees things differently as every member sees the Fed Funds rate at least 50 bps higher at this time next year. 10 of the 17 members see the Fed Funds rate at least 100 bps higher in the next 12 months, which, again, would be a quarterly rate hike at each of the next four meetings. While I appreciate that the Fed feels confident enough in this economic trajectory to think that this type of movement is both warranted and sustainable, but it just seems really unlikely at this point given the tentativeness to move things too far too fast up to this point. In my opinion, two rates hikes in 2016 - one in June, one in December - seems about right to me. According to this, there's about an 80% chance that the Fed raises between 0.25% and 0.75% by the end of 2016 with a still sizeable 10% chance of no further rate hike in 2016 at all. All of this is to say that while the dot plot might be a fun read for market watchers, it hasn't in the recent past been any kind of reliable indicator of what Fed policy is going to look like even a couple of quarters from now. The fact that the Fed has begun moving interest rates back up finally is a good first step but it needs to maintain a cautious, not aggressive, tone in ensuring that the return to a more normal rate environment is not interrupted.
