Grand Central: BOE Sees Little Sign Lowflation Threatens Spending  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of England officials have sent a couple of new signals about the prospects for inflation in the U.K., but still seem a long way from raising interest rates. Minutes of officialsâ€™ April policy meeting, published Wednesday, were terse and to-the-point, running to only eight pages. The minutes usually run to something closer to 12 and are occasionally much longer. But they offered investors a few interesting nuggets: First, officials have decided they probably donâ€™t need to worry that the recent spell of zero inflation in the U.K. will morph into a sustained fall in prices and hit spending. Central banks fret that falling prices prompt consumers to delay purchases but the BOE said it sees little chance of that in the U.K. Second, officials have honed in on two things in particular when judging the outlook for inflation: The exchange rate and wages. Wage growth is still sluggish despite a sharp fall in unemployment and a buoyant economy. Officials reckon wage growth will have to speed up if they are to hit their 2% inflation target by early 2017 as expected. On the flipside, officials said it’s possible a period of cheap imports from a strong pound is coming to an end. Imported goods prices are beginning to rise, which could cause a faster-than-expected rise in inflation next year once the effects of lower oil prices fade. Third, the BOE sees news from the global economy as mixed. They were cheered by the pickup in the eurozone but disappointed by growth in the U.S. and China. In all, the BOE seems calm as officials wait for clearer signs on where price pressures are coming from. Investors doubt the central bank will raise interest rates until mid-2016. ECB Raises Ceiling on Emergency Lending to Greek Banks.

BOJ Chief Says High Possibility of Hitting 2% Target in First Half FY2016.Â Bank of Japan Gov.

Â The country’s annual inflation rate is very likely to reach 2% by March of next year or “in the first half of fiscal 2016 or in early part” of that year, Mr. Kuroda said during a parliamentary session.

Chances for Positive Returns on Eurozone Government Debt Diminish. Investors chasing positive returns in European government bonds are fast running out of road . Only six weeks into the European Central Bank’s EUR1 trillion ($1.07 trillion)-plus bond-buying program, over half of the eurozone government debt market now offers investors a negative yield. Given that yields fall as prices rise, this means European fixed-income markets have never looked so expensive. Deutsche Bank Set to Pay Record Fine in Libor Case.

New-Home Prices Are on Fire. Two different segments of the housing market are yielding two different price trends. When discussing Wednesdayâ€™s news that existing home sales climbed in March, National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said the 7.8% yearly rise in Marchâ€™s median price was unsustainable. â€œThis price gain of near 8% is not healthy, considering peopleâ€™s incomes are only rising by 2%,â€? said Mr. Yun. â€œThe only way to relieve housing cost pressure is to have more homes coming onto the market .â€? The Preferences of FOMC Members. Applying spatial voting models to the meeting transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee, economists atÂ  Tilburg University find little variation in the behavior of members appointed by different presidents, or evidence that previous career paths affected preferences. “There may be less evidence in favour of systematic patterns in the preferences of FOMC members than previously thought,” the economists write in a posting for VoxEU. “The analysis suggests that a political appointment channel was not active or effective and also finds little scope for the effect of career experiences. The results are comforting for those concerned about the institutional design of the FOMC.”Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Fed Should Consider Making Bond Buys Regular Policy Tool–Boston Fed Paper.

Wall Street Watchdogs Should Prevent Crises, Not Build Buffers. The effort by financial regulators to ensure big banks and other financial institutions have adequate levels of capital is misguided since that will only help lessen the impact of a crisis, not prevent one.

At Last, Eurozone Growth Gets in Gear. â€œThe eurozone has got so many things wrong in the past few years, you may not have noticed that it has finally begun getting things right,â€? writes the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Greg Ip . â€œAusterity is no longer a drag on growth, monetary policy is in overdrive, banks are healing, oil and the euro are cheap, and structural reforms are bearing fruit. While not exactly the worldâ€™s locomotive, the eurozone is no longer its caboose. Home free, then? Not quite. AÂ political time bomb could still upendÂ a perfectly good recovery as Greece lurches dangerously closer to default and a disorderly exit from the euro.â€? Mythology that blocks progress in Greece. The latest crisis â€œwill not end well if the people involved do not recognise they are clinging on to myths,â€? writes Martin Wolf in the FT. He offers six examples, â€œeach of which poses intellectual and emotional obstacles to reaching a solution.â€? Wealth Redistribution Fails Big Mac Test. In a new twist on the old Big Mac index of currency comparisons that turns its attention to wages, Eduardo Porter writes in the New York Times: â€œReal McWages â€” measured in terms of the number of Big Macs they might buy, declined over the first decade of the millennium widely across the industrialized world.â€?
