Bank Indonesia Holds Benchmark Rate at 7.50% - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank Indonesia kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 7.50% Tuesday, highlighting “abundant” external risks but also saying it would ease some lending rules to promote consumption. The bank also kept its overnight deposit facility at 5.50% and its lending facility rate at 8%. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo told reporters that the bank will ease regulations on loans for home and vehicle purchases. In 2013, seeking to curb consumption as the current-account deficit widened, the bank raised down-payment requirements for purchases. Mr. Martowardojo said the rate decisions were “in line with our tight bias policy in order to keep inflation to within 4% to 5% in 2015 and 2016? and to bring the current-account deficit to between 2.5% and 3% of gross domestic product. He stressed that external risks–including the uncertainty of global economic recovery and the timing of any U.S. interest-rate increases–”remain abundant.” The central bank has been under political pressure to cut rates since growth in the first quarter dropped to its lowest level in more than five years. But the bank also has to weigh the risk of further weakening the rupiah–currently hovering at a 17-year low–and inciting capital flight. Bank Indonesia’s deputy governor Perry Warjiyo said the central bank must still prioritize “economic stability over economic growth.” But he added that it is of the opinion that economic growth will pick up in the second half of the year, when government spending and commercial-bank loans are expected to increase. Foreign investors fled Indonesia in 2013 when then-chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke first hinted at interest-rate increases. Indonesia’s current-account deficit has improved in the past two quarters as lower global oil prices reduced the country’s fuel-import bills. But inflation remains stubborn above Bank Indonesia’s target. “We have to rein in on inflation and ensure that our current-account deficit is improving,” Mr. Martowardojo said. He also cited rising corporate offshore debt and high foreign ownership of government bonds as reasons keep interest rates unchanged. “Foreign ownership in the government’s (rupiah) bonds is around 38% of the total amount,” he said, adding that a safe level is below 30%. OCBC economist Wellian Wiranto said that the central bank’s decision to keep the rate unchanged “despite tell-tale signs of political pressure” has definitely added to its credibility.
