Grand Central: Reassuring Consumer Data Keep Fed On Track for Rate Increases - Real Time Economics - WSJ WSJ Survey: Fed Wonâ€™t Raise Rates Before September BOEâ€™s McCafferty Says Downside Risks to Inflation Diminishing The last batches of economic data to arrive before the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy meeting next week have surely put policy makers at ease about the pace of the U.S. expansion. A puzzling slowdown in consumer spending earlier this year turns out to have been less pronounced than feared. The Commerce Department reported a jump in retail sales in May and revised up earlier estimates of sales. Moreover, new data on services spending in the first quarter â€“ captured in the Census Bureauâ€™s Quarterly Services Survey â€“ suggests upward revisions to first quarter spending data. Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm, now estimates that rather than contracting in the first quarter U.S. economic output was flat, and that it is growing at a 2.5% annual rate in the second. Fed officials had been signaling before they entered their self-imposed blackout period this week â€“ in which they donâ€™t speak publicly — that they were in a wait-and-see mode. They believed the first quarter contraction was transitory but wanted to see evidence this was the case before deciding to raise short-term interest rates. The latest reassuring data keep the Fed on track to raise short-term interest rates in the months ahead, and could make Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen more comfortable signaling as much after next weekâ€™s policy meeting. Nearly three out of four economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal see September as the likely liftoff date . Because many officials want to avoid unsettling markets about such a momentous event â€“ and because many want more evidence of a true rebound — thereâ€™s reason to believe the Fed will follow the marketâ€™s lead and avoid moving sooner than expected unless more robust data pile up. The next step for Fed officials is updating their economic projections before the meeting, a process they are completing Friday. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s survey of private analysts suggests the Fedâ€™s forecasts for unemployment and inflation are likely to remain largely intact, another prerequisite to interest rate action. However the survey suggests there could be some downward drift in interest rate projections , given the Fedâ€™s nagging worries about the longer-run outlook for growth. WSJ Survey: Fed Wonâ€™t Raise Rates Before September. Private economists increasingly expect theÂ Federal ReserveÂ to wait until September or later to begin raising interest rates, remaining on hold at theÂ upcoming June policy meeting. Some 72% of the economists surveyed over the last week byÂ The Wall Street Journal said the Fedâ€™s first rate increase will come in September, versus just 3% who saw liftoff coming in June and another 3% who predicted officials will raise rates in July. WSJ Survey: Fed GDP and Interest Forecasts Could Drop. Private analysts surveyed by the Journal have revised down their estimatesÂ of growth in gross domestic productâ€“a measure of the economyâ€™s output of goods and servicesâ€“to 2.1% this year from 2.9% in March. That is due largely to a contraction in output in the first quarter associated with bad weather and other factors. The new 2.1% estimate is below the Fedâ€™s 2.5% projection for March and suggests Fed officials might be taking down their own numbers when they release their new Summary of Economic Projections at the June 16-17 meeting. U.S. Shoppers Go on Buying Spree. U.S. retail sales surged in May, a sign consumers are stepping up spending after a cautious start to the year. Sales at retailers and restaurants rose 1.2% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $444.9 billionÂ in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Figures for the prior two months were upwardly revised to show stronger consumption than previously estimated this spring. Reports of U.S. Economic Contraction May Have Been Exaggerated . Fed Meetings May Be Live, But Hereâ€™s Why Theyâ€™re Unlikely to Surprise. If Federal Reserve policy is as data-driven as officials say it is, that means the outcome of any central bank interest rate meeting is a wildcard, right? Â  Well, not exactly. While itâ€™s true that central bankers are saying a lot less about the timing of boosting rates off currently near-zero levels, that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll be going into Federal Open Market Committee gatherings without a pretty strong idea about what they, individually, want to happen. IMF Halts Bailout Talks With Greece. With its announcement, the IMF put an official halt to negotiations over details of the bailout between Greece and the institutions overseeing the program, which also include the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Those talks had been on pause for a few days already. But making the break public significantly heightens pressure on the government in Athens to sign on to unpopular policy overhauls and spending cuts, or risk a default on its debt and even greater financial chaos. European Leaders Are Losing Patience With Greece . Draghi: ECB Didnâ€™t Give Privileged Information to Fund Managers. ECB President Mario Draghi defended his institution against criticisms that a board member divulged market-sensitive information to a gathering that included hedge fund managers at a speech last month 12 hours before the remarks were made public, an incident that raised questions about the bankâ€™s communications policies. Mr. Draghi wrote in a letter to the European Ombudsman that the frontloading of bond purchases in the ECBâ€™s quantitative easing program, which executive board member Benoit CoeurÃ©Â announced at a private event on May 18, was already visible in the markets. Chinaâ€™s Economy Shows Signs of Revival. A series of readings released this week offered tentative signs that efforts to revive the Chinese economy were having some effect, but also evidence that China will struggle to match in the second quarter the 7% year-over-year quarterly growth rate it set in the first quarterâ€”the slowest pace in six years. BOEâ€™s McCafferty Says Downside Risks to Inflation Diminishing. The forces keeping a lid on inflation in the U.K. appear to be diminishing, meaning interest rates in the U.K. may soon need to rise , according to a Bank of England official. Ian McCafferty, one of the nine members of the BOEâ€™s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, told teachers and students in a speech Thursday that the current low level of inflation in the U.K. is unlikely to last, according to a text of his remarks published by the central bank on Friday. Brazil Central Bank Reaffirms Commitment to Lowering Inflation. Brazilâ€™s central bank said Thursday that â€œdetermination and perseveranceâ€? are needed to bring the countryâ€™s rampant inflation down to the official target by the end of next year, prompting analysts to brace for another sharp increase in borrowing costs. Higher Risk in Canada.Â The Canadian central bank said slumping oil prices, coupled withÂ  elevated household debt levels Â and overvalued house prices, led to a slight increase in the overallÂ risk to financial stabilityÂ in Canada. Central Banks in Peru and Chile Hold Policy Rates Steady.Â Central banks in Peru and Chile on Thursday left their monetary policy rates unchanged, as concerns about inflation were offset by worries over weak growth. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru left its reference interest rate unchanged at 3.25%, saying this was in line with inflation that will move to 2% during the next two-year period.Â Chile’s central bank earlier in the day left its monetary policy rate unchanged at 3.0%, saying the annual inflation rate there is expected to remain high in the coming months–Dow Jones Newswires. An Invitation.Â Fed officials are considering an interest rate increase for the first time in nearly a decade, but they face a complicated economic backdrop. Join Wall Street Journal Chief Economics Correspondent Jon Hilsenrath for a breakfast interview with Fed Governor Jerome Powell on June 23 at 8:30 a.m. at the St. Regis, 16thÂ Street NW, Washington D.C. to explore how the Fed is navigating the tough decisions that loom.Â  RSVP here . Where Did Americans Spend Their Money in May? Americans have gotten a windfall from cheaper gasoline prices, though in recent months theyâ€™ve been more inclined to save than spend it. But in May, gasoline stations posted their biggest jump since 2012â€“and Americans shrugged it off. They spent more on building and gardening materials and clothing stores and nonstore retailers. Restaurants and bars sales, generally considered a nonessential expense, barely inched ahead . Where do Workers Go When They Switch Jobs? â€œJob-to-job moves generally reallocate workers from lower paying to higher paying firms, and this reallocation of workers is highly procyclical,â€? write John Haltiwanger, Henry Hyatt and Erika McEnterfer in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. â€œDuring the Great Recession, this firm wage job ladder collapsed, with net worker reallocation to higher wage firms falling to zero. We also find that differential responses of net hires from non-employment play an important role in the patterns of the cyclicality of employment dynamics across firms classified by size and wage.â€? And How Long Do They Stay At Their Jobs? â€œDeclining job tenure is not just all about millennials having short attention spans,â€? conclude the Atlanta Fedâ€™s Julie L. Hotchkiss and Christopher J. Macpherson.â€? In fact, there is a greater (five-year) decline in median job tenure between 41- and 50-year-old “Depression babies” (born in 1933) and 41- to 50-year-old Gen Xers (born in 1973). So, just as our colleagues here at the Atlanta Fed discovered with regard toÂ declines in first-time home mortgages, millennials aren’t to blame for everything!â€? The Fed Risks Inflating Another Housing Bubble. Low interest rates are driving the housing sector back up, writes Jason Cummins in the Financial Times. â€œBy keeping rates near zero, the Fed has strongly stimulated housing demand,â€? he writes. â€œIt is entirely possible that this time we will see house prices go even higher. It takes many months for changes in monetary policy to have an effect, and the Fed has yet to begin tightening. Prices this time could go even higher than in the last cycle. There is also less house building this time round.â€? A Monetary Culprit for Europeâ€™s Unemployment? Writing in the Journal, Matthew Dalton identifies a possible culprit for the eurozone’s high unemployment rates: overly tight monetary policy. “AÂ few practitioners of the dismal science argue the answer has been staring policy makers in the face: Tight monetary policies aimed at controlling inflation and setting the region on a path to a single currency have damaged Europeâ€™s labor markets,” he writes. Jobless Claims Rise. Initial claims for unemployment benefits, a measure of layoffs across the U.S., climbed 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 279,000 in the week ended June 6, the Labor Department said Thursday. Americansâ€™ Net Worth Hits Record. The net worth of U.S. households and nonprofit organizations rose about $1.6 trillion between January and March to $84.9 trillion. Import Prices Rise. Import pricesÂ increased 1.3% in May from a month earlier, the Labor Department said, a sign that a rebound in oil markets is slowly pushing up inflation pressures in the U.S. Brazil to Reduce Forex Interventions. The monetary authority Wednesday night said it would reduce the volume of currency swap contracts offered through daily auctions to $315 million , from $350 million previously. Former Nigerian Central Bank Head Joins Blackstone Africa. Lamido Sanusi was considered an astute and charismatic central-bank governor for Africaâ€™s biggest economy and oil producer, butÂ  he was suspended early last yearÂ  after he raised concerns that the national petroleum company was either losing or stealing billions in oil revenue that should be ending up in state coffers.
