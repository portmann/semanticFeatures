Week Ahead In FX: Dismal NFP Hurts USD, Raises June Rate Hike Doubts | Seeking Alpha Fundamental indicators rose in priority as the U.S. Federal Reserve had signalled in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes that its members would consider a rate hike in June if the economy improved. The two indicators released on Friday depreciated the USD across the board. The U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) recorded a two-year low at 36,000 jobs added in May. The report was mixed as the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent and wages grew by 0.2 percent. With a huge question mark hanging over the June FOMC meeting, the lacklustre jobs report could force the Fed to exercise caution, pushing the probable time table to July if not beyond. The disappointing NFP report shifts the market's focus to Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Monday, June 6 at 12:30 pm EDT. Chair Yellen will address the economic outlook and monetary policy at the World Affairs Council. After the minutes from the April FOMC meeting brought June back on, and it looks like the NFP might have pushed it off up to policy members to manage market expectations. The central banks of Australia and New Zealand will announce monetary policy decisions a day apart from each other. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will publish its rate statement on Tuesday, June 7 at 12:30 am EDT. The RBA cut its rate by 0.25 percent to 1.75 percent last month. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will follow suit on Wednesday, June 8 at 5:00 pm EDT. The RBA is expected to hold, while there are estimates that see the RBNZ cutting the Kiwi rate down to 2.00 percent. The EUR/USD rose by 1.901 percent in the last week. Most of the move happened after the release of the NFP employment report. The lower than expected indicator put downward pressure on the USD after rising to a wave of hawkish comments in the FOMC minutes from April. The pair is trading at 1.1355 when at one point it touched a weekly low of 1.1098. The road ahead for the USD is uncertain, although Fed Chair Janet Yellen will have a change to add her comments on current economic trends on Monday. European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will also address the market on Thursday as part of the Brussels Economic Forum. The ECB kept rates and its QE program unchanged while keeping forecasts close to those published in March. Energy prices fell this week. WTI lost 1.105 percent in the last 5 days. The price of West Texas is $48.07 after being close to $50 at one point during the week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna brought a few surprises, but perhaps the only worth mentioning is that Saudi Arabia is still taking the organization seriously. No oil production changes were agreed upon, but the tone of the talks was amicable and Saudi Arabia's new oil minister passed a hard test by showing a flexible stand.
