Grand Central: Can Asiaâ€™s Banks Withstand a Financial Shock?  - Real Time Economics - WSJ My colleague Victoria McGrane and I document in todayâ€™s Wall Street Journal the increased scrutiny that financial regulators are imposing on boards of directors at U.S. banks.Â  A chart accompanying the story raises a governance question not about U.S. banks, but about banks in Asia. Academic research suggests that banks with independent board members are less prone to excessive risk-taking than other banks.Â  In Asia, bank boards are becoming less independent . Here are the numbers: As part of its Global Financial Stability Report in October, the International Monetary Fund studied governance at 800 banks in 72 countries. It found that U.S. boards have been expanding the representation of independent board members since the financial crisis. The percentage of independent directors on bank boards increased from 62% in 2006 and 2007 to 73% in 2012 to 2013. In Europe, the share was low, but has been growing. It went from 43% to 48%.Â  In Asia, on the other hand, the share of independent directors is low and falling. It went from 44% to 33% during the same period. In the U.S. and Europe, banks also are moving to empower risk officers. One complaint about the pre-crisis financial architecture was that nobody listened to internal risk officers when they tried to say, â€œStop.â€? In the U.S., the share of firms that placed chief risk officers on their board of directors increased from 5% to 10% after the financial crisis. It expanded from 5% to 9% in Europe. In Asia, it has fallen since the crisis from 9% to 3%, according to the IMF. Financial crises find a way into weak banking systems the way a virus preys on weak immune systems. One has to wonder whether the financial body in Asia has gotten stronger of late. Regulators Intensify Scrutiny of Bank Boards. U.S. regulators are zeroing in on Wall Street boardrooms as part of the governmentâ€™s intensified scrutiny of the banking system, shifting from light-touch oversight of bank board directors to regular and intense interactions . The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators are holding frequent, in some cases monthly, meetings with individual board directors at the nationâ€™s biggest banks, demanding detailed minutes and other documentation of board meetings and singling out boards in internal regulatory critiques of bank operations and oversight. In some instances, Fed supervisors meet more often with directors than the directors meet formally as a full board. Boards at small banks are also getting new attention from regulators. Fedâ€™s Fischer Floats Ideas for Regulating Shadow Banks. Â The Federal Reserveâ€™s No. 2 official floated a series of ideas for regulating nonbank financial companies, the latest indication that top U.S. policy makers are focusing on risks in the so-called shadow banking sector. Bernanke Says Fed is Groping to Find the Full Employment Rate. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday he doesnâ€™t know where the so-called full-employment level is now. â€œNobody really knows that number with any precision,â€? he said, â€œand the Fed will continue to grope to find out what the right number is.â€? Eurozone Price Falls Ease in March.

BOE Officials Go Into Election-Season Blackout. Those hungry for central-bank news shouldnâ€™t expect to hear much from the Bank of England for the next six weeks . Britons go to the polls May 7 to elect a new government and the BOE is bound by â€œpurdahâ€? rules that prevent officials from speaking in public while the general election campaign is in full swing. The clock started ticking March 30, with the dissolution of Parliament, and runs at least until May 11, the first Monday after the poll. China to Begin Deposit Insurance From May.Â China said Tuesday it would roll out its long-awaited deposit insurance on May 1, a key step in its plans to liberalize the financial system .Â In a statement on the main government website, the State Council, the top government body, said it would set up a deposit-insurance fund that would guarantee deposits of up to 500,000 yuan ($81,000).

But, this being the eurozone, the puzzles are proving different from elsewhere.” The Global Economy Is Now a Rorschach Test. “The global economy is unusually fragile at present, with complications including the threat of deflation, negative bond yields and central bank rates in many countries, and a puzzling absence of wage growth in both the U.S. and U.K.,” Mark Gilbert writes in a Bloomberg View column. “Both Ray Dalio and Jeffrey Gundlach, two of the worldâ€™s leading investors, have warned that the Fed shouldn’t be in too much of a hurry to achieve so-called policy normalization. Theyâ€™re right. And if the Bank of Englandâ€™s soothsayers, all looking at the same economic evidence, see three different monetary-policy prescriptions, policy makers everywhere should take that as a warning to be even more careful than usual.” Is The Era of Middle-Class Stagnation Finally Over? “Hereâ€™s what economists mean when they talk about stagnant middle-class incomes: In the first quarter century after World War Two, median household incomes rose by about 3% a year. Since then, about 0.2% a year, or virtually flat,” James Pethokoukis writes on the AEIdeas blog. “Why the big downshift? In a new analysis, Goldman Sachs cites a number of reasons: (a) slower productivity growth, (b) labor getting a falling share of national income, (c) greater income inequality, and (d) rising cost of living, particularly energy and healthcare.
