The Fed: We Aren't Using Forward Guidance Any More, But, By-The-Way, We Expect Interest Rates Will Only Rise Gradually | Seeking Alpha Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a talk on Friday and indicated that short-term interest rates, when they begin to rise, will only rise gradually. But, we have just heard that the Fed is not going to be patient about raising short-term interest rates although with the economy as weak as it is, who knows. Janet Yellen, Fed Chair, spoke Friday at the "The New Normal Monetary Policy," a research conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in San Francisco, California. The message of her talk: " Interest Rates Won't Rise Too Quickly, Yellen Says ." So, we hear in recent weeks that the Federal Reserve is not going to be "patient" any more in terms of when it might raise interest rates. Oh, the Fed might seek to raise short-term interest rates in June. Then we hear in the same press release that the economy is not really that strong. The take-away from this is that the Fed will probably wait until September before it begins to oversee a rise in short-term interest rates. And, at the same time, the Fed indicated that it was giving up using "forward guidance" as a means to transmitting what the Fed intends to do as far as future monetary policy. Now, we hear that short-term interest will rise…but, they won't rise too quickly. Wait a minute, this sounds like forward guidance to me. From Ms. Yellen's speech: "The average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years." Or, in the words of the New York Times article cited above, "her message was that the return to normal conditions was likely to come slowly. There will be no repeat of the two-year period beginning in June 2004 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage points at every meeting." There you have it, short-term interest rates are going to rise this year and the Federal Reserve is not going to be patient about any increases, but they may not come as soon as originally thought because the economy is not that strong and also, expect any increase in short-term interest rates in the future to be gradual because of the uncertainty surrounding the strength of the economy. This kind of guidance, in my mind, we can do without. All this kind of guidance indicates to me that the officials at the Federal Reserve all over the place in their thinking and that the leadership of the Fed is lacking. If this is a sign that the particular circumstances the United States economy finds itself in are confusing and that the future is uncertain, then our leadership at the Fed is doing an excellent job in conveying this situation. The United States economy has been expanding at a compound rate of about 2.3 percent per year for six and one-half years now. This is the most anemic economic recovery on record. The Fed's forecast for economic growth over the next two years is only slightly better than this. Inflation remains below the Fed's target rate of 2.0 and Fed projections, again, show no substantial pickup in this price increases. The unemployment rate continues to drop but wage increases are tepid at best and the labor force participation rate remains at almost a forty-year low. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing still remains below the peak level it hit in the previous economic recovery. And, there is the strength of the United States dollar to deal with and how it might impact the rate of economic growth in the near future and the corporate profits. A lot of uncertainty here. Then, there is the rest of the world…the chaos in the Middle East, the situation in the Ukraine, and so forth. What does the Fed have to deal with? A balance sheet that has ballooned to $4.5 trillion and a banking system with $2.7 trillion in excess reserves. It is truly mind-boggling what the officials at the Federal Reserve have to face. The conference Ms. Yellen spoke to in San Francisco was titled "The New Normal Monetary Policy." Given the state of the world, this conference had to be thought of in the realm of science fiction. Officials at the Fed face a terrible burden right now. The challenges they face are almost overwhelming. And, there are a lot of people sitting around just waiting to be able to write books about how the Fed screwed up the "return to normal." But Ms. Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed must not make things worse than they are. What the Fed has put out for the past year or so is "a little bit of this" and "a little bit of that." The recent "guidance" has continued this. Times may be tough and demanding, but investors and financial markets need more than just confusion from the leadership. Unfortunately, at this time, leadership seems to be exactly the trait that is missing from the Washington, D. C. scene.
