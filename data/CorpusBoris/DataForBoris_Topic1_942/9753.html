Mexican Central Bank Leaves Door Open to Act Before or After Fed - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Mexico governor Agustin Carstens Mexican said the central bank would like to be able to observe the Fed’s decision and its impact before making its own monetary-policy move. ACAPULCO, Mexicoâ€”Bank of Mexico governor Agustin Carstens said on Friday he would like to keep options open to adjust monetary policy either before or after an expected interest-rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Ideally, the Mexican central bank would be able to observe both the Fedâ€™s decision and its impact on markets before itselfÂ making a move, Mr. Carstens told a group of reporters at a Mexican bankers convention. But if other factors merit preemptive action, then the bank might also consider the possibility of moving at a different time, he said. The Fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates sometime this year. The Mexican central bank, which is expected to start raising interest rates once the Fed does, kept its overnight lending rate target at a record-low 3% at its January meeting. The next policy meeting is scheduled for March 26. Annual inflation in Mexico slowed to 3%â€”the central bank’s official targetâ€”at the end of February, helped by lower electricity and telephone service costs. The Mexican currency, though, has seen sharp swings recently as the market anticipates Fed action after years of lax monetary policy. The Mexican peso touched a record-low against the U.S. dollar last week of 15.67 pesos. The peso was gaining Friday, trading in Mexico City around 15.00 pesos to the dollar. Mr. Carstens said that while the bank prefers transparent mechanisms such as pre-scheduled dollar auctions to stabilize the peso, he wouldnâ€™t rule out the possibility of direct dollar sales in the market if there is a drastic move in the exchange rate. â€œIt would really have to be an extraordinary case,â€? he said, adding that any direct intervention would be temporary. Since March 11, the Bank of Mexico has been selling $52 million a day via auctions to help curtail volatility in the exchange market. The bank also offers $200 million on days when the peso weakens 1.5% or more from the previous session. The conditional auctions have only triggered dollar sales twice since they were activated in early December. Like many emerging markets, Mexico has benefited in recent years from an influx of foreign capital as investors seek higher yields due to low interest rates in the U.S. Mexican authorities are doing what they can to retain that capital and attract more, if possible, Mr. Carstens said. The Mexican government, which is highly dependent on oil revenue for its budget, has reduced spending plans this year. It has also been active in overseas debt markets to extend debt maturities.
