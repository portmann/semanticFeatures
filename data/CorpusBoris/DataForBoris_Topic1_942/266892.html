Economists React to the Fed’s Interest-Rate Decision: ‘When Is the Next Hike?’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ â€œThe rate rise has been overhyped and won’t have a big impact on the U.S. economy,” saidÂ Joseph Lake of the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would move to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point , lifting them from near zero for the first time since the recession. Fed officials said economic activity â€œhas been expanding at a moderate pace,â€? pointing to â€œsolidâ€? household spending and business investment and diminished slack in the labor market this year. Officials emphasized, however, rate increases would proceed gradually. The move was widely expected by economists and markets. Here are comments from economists on Wednesdayâ€™s announcement: â€œThe rate rise has been overhyped and won’t have a big impact on the U.S. economy. Monetary policy is still extraordinarily accommodative. The absence of an economic shock or financial turbulence [following] the rate rise will restore some confidence that has ebbed as markets have waited for months for the Fed to move.â€? â€”Joseph Lake, Economist Intelligence Unit â€œIn the end, the pace [of future rate increases] will be determined by the data and financial markets developments. We remain skeptical that the pace will be as gradual as is being suggested, mainly because we expect the unemployment rate to keep falling, eventually leading to more upward pressure on inflation. For now, though, it makes sense for officials to be as reassuring for markets as they can without compromising their flexibility later.â€?Â â€”Jim Oâ€™Sullivan, High Frequency Economics â€œThe deed is done and the Fed has delivered to us all a wonderful holiday giftâ€”something new to write and talk about: When is the next hike?.â€¦Reading from the minutes and the dot plots, the Fedâ€™s plan is for the funds rate to rise to the inflation rate by year-end 2016 and then modestly pull ahead by year end 2017 and then move to a 1.5% real rate by year end 2018. Ah, the sweet world of econometric model outcomes. All of this is, of course, contingent on core inflation rising in 2016 towards their target and, first and foremost, that progress continues for the labor market.â€?Â â€”Steve Blitz, ITG Investment Research â€œThis is the first rise in the funds rate since June 29, 2006, when it was last hiked by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. In this context, today’s 25 basis-point funds rate target hike could be mistaken for a ‘pinky flick’ in a dead corpse which could be temporarily alarming and frightening to the financial markets, especially those younger members who have never seen a rate hike in their short careers. But, instead, the correct diagnosis is that Fed policy is awakening from a seven year â€˜self-induced interest rate comaâ€™ in response to improving vital signs for the U.S. economy, including better job growth, wage and income growth, solid consumer spending, and improving housing activity, at least enough to slowly begin notching up [the] abnormally low funds rate.â€? â€”Stuart Hoffman and Gus Faucher, PNC â€œThe intention to tighten at a gradual pace comes with a warningâ€”courtesy, presumably of Stan Fischerâ€”that â€˜the actual path of the funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.â€™ The last time the Fed stuck to a promise to take it easyâ€”the â€˜measuredâ€™ pace of tightening in 2004-to-06, it ended badly, and we have no confidence that the serene glide path for the economy envisaged by the Fed and, especially, the markets, will be achieved this time either.â€? â€”Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics â€œNormally, raising interest rates is a form of a contractionary monetary policy, meaning that the central bank believes the economy is overheated or strong enough, so that higher rates are necessary to prevent future excessive inflation. But this is not the case today. Inflation has been stubbornly low in the past few years, which is a big concern for the Fed. The FOMC today continued to lower its projection for inflation in the short term.â€? â€”Jia Liu, American Institute for Economic Research â€œIn taking todayâ€™s actions, the Federal Reserve has recognized significant improvements in the U.S. economy, and manufacturers recognize that economic conditions today are far better than they were in recent years. At the same time, manufacturers continue to feel anxiety in the face of headwinds like the strong dollar and weaker growth in key international markets. In the latest NAM Manufacturersâ€™ Outlook Survey, manufacturers indicated a preference for the Federal Open Market Committee to wait until these headwinds die down a bit before beginning the process of raising short-term interest rates.â€? â€”Chad Moutray, National Association of Manufacturers Fed Risks New Distortions When It Raises Rates We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.
