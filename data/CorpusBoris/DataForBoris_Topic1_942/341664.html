It's Still Unclear Where The Labor Market Is Heading | Seeking Alpha The recent non-farm payroll report showed a gain of 242,000 jobs -- higher than expected. But wages rose at a slower pace of only 2.2%. Even though the recent non-farm payroll presented a higher than expected gain number of jobs -- 242,000 jobs compared to expectations of 195,000 jobs - the report wasn't good enough to persuade the market that the labor market is recovering mostly due to lower wages. Nonetheless, this report is likely to make it harder for the Federal Reserve to justify another rate hike any time soon. Unlike the previous report, in which the headline figure was disappointing and the wages grew at an annual pace of 2.5%, this time it was the other way around: Solid gains in jobs, but a decline in wages. The good news, besides the strong headline figure, there were also upward revisions for the past couple of months - 30,000 jobs were added; the participation rate picked up by 0.2 percentage points, while the "real unemployment" also known as U6 unemployment edged down by 0.2 percentage points to 9.7%, which is the lowest level since May 2008 . Also, the participation rate edged up. But the main bad news from this report is 0.1%, month over month, decline in average hourly earnings; this measure fell from an annual growth of 2.5% back in January 2016 to 2.2% in February - the lowest rate since June 2015 . And this situation -- falling unemployment without rising wages -- goes against what the traditional economic models - Phillips curve and the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment -- imply: When the rate of unemployment falls to its natural rate of say around 5%, as is the current case, wages should start to pick up at a faster pace. And more money in people's pocket should result in higher spending and stimulate the economy. In reality this latest report doesn't coincide with this theory. And the Fed is more likely aware of this issue, which is likely to hold the Fed off from raising rates in the near term and perhaps to start reconsider its policy. The Fed's objectives are reaching its inflation target of 2% and maximizing employment. While the matter of full employment could be argued to have been reached, the same can't be said of the inflation target. And the latest NFP report suggests the U.S. core inflation, which is affected by the progress of wages, isn't rising any faster. The Fed has been stating for a long time that the decision to raise rate will be data dependent. And the NFP report doesn't make it any easier for the Fed to make another rate hike even with a high gain in jobs. The markets don't expected a hike in March and even if June the odds are very low. But the markets still consider it's a matter of coin flip, at this point, whether the Fed will raise rates again by December. After all, the labor market is doing well when it comes to growth in jobs and keeping unemployment down, but for wages - it's a different story. While the pace of wage growth started to pick up at the end of last year - it even came close to a 2.7% yearly growth rate back in December 2015 - the recent report puts into question the progress of the labor market on this front. And without higher wages, the core inflation isn't likely to progress, people aren't going to spend more and the economy could become more vulnerable to an economic slowdown.
