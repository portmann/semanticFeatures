Grand Central: BOE Policy Makers Share Worries Over Stronger Currency - Real Time Economics - WSJ Sign up for the newsletter:Â  http://on.wsj.com/grandcentralsignup Douglasâ€™s Take: BOE Policy Makers Share Worries Over Stronger Currency Economic Data Complicate Fed Rate Deliberations Just as the surging dollar is complicating the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy debate as it moves closer towards raising interest rates, a buoyant pound is posing a similar challenge for the Fedâ€™s counterparts in London. Minutes of Bank of England officialsâ€™ March policy meeting, published Wednesday , revealed that the central bankâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee is increasingly worried that sterlingâ€™s strength could prolong a spell of ultra-low inflation in the U.K., where annual consumer price-growth has already slowed to its lowest rate in decades following a slump in the oil price. Sterling has gained 4% against the euro in the past month and 2.5% against the currencies of its major trading partners, according to the BOE. Officials noted the gains might have been greater still had the outcome of Mayâ€™s general election not been so unusually uncertain. A strong currency bears down on prices for imported goods and services, a key component of overall inflation in open economies like the U.K. that are particularly sensitive to world trade and currents in the global economy. Mark Carney, the BOEâ€™s Canadian governor, in a recent speech signaled that sterlingâ€™s ascent and low inflation worldwide might put the brakes on BOE plans to slowly ratchet up interest rates over the next few years. Separately, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentâ€™s top economist told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday the dollarâ€™s strength may prompt the Fed to delay its first rate hike , expected in June. The strength of the dollar and the pound reflect not only the relatively robust economic prospects of the U.S. and U.K., but also the European Central Bank’s decision to embark on large-scale asset purchases to revive growth and stoke inflation in the 19-nation currency union, a move that is weakening the euro. Such divergences in central bank policies have reignited concerns over so-called currency wars, when nations seek to weaken their exchange rates to gain an edge in trade. British policy makers tend to avoid interfering in currency markets to influence the sterling exchange rate after an attempt to shadow the Deutsche mark in the 1990s went badly wrong. But that doesnâ€™t stop them talking about their concerns. Expect sterling to feature heavily in BOE officialsâ€™ pronouncements as long as the poundâ€™s strength persists. Fedâ€™s Bid for Flexibility on Rates Sets Stage for Market Volatility. After years of reassuring the public that interest rates would stay low, the Federal Reserve is about to create some uncertainty by veering away from such promises. The central bank has provided strong verbal guidance about the likely level and direction of short-term rates for more than a decade, making it a key policy tool for influencing other borrowing costs in the economy. Such signals have been particularly important since December 2008, when officials began promising to hold their benchmark short-term rate near zero for a long time. Five Things to Watch in the Fed’s March Meeting. The Fed is widely expected to take a small step Wednesday toward raising short-term interest rates later this year by dropping its promise to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to start. Here are a few things to keep an eye on . Economic Data Complicate Fed Rate Deliberations. A number of signals in recent daysâ€”including industrial production, retail sales and housing startsâ€”point to sluggishness, and have led private economists to downgrade forecasts for first-quarter growth. The downbeat shift in economic data complicates matters for Fed policy makers, who have been burned by faltering growth several times during the recovery and want to be convinced the economy is sound before boosting interest rates.

In the century the Fed has been in business, itâ€™s safe to say only one official has lamented that aggressive monetary-policy actions have slipped the equivalent of â€œbeer gogglesâ€? on market participants. That official was Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who retires Thursday. He spent much of his time at the Fed at odds with its policy choices. But he will be remembered as much for an extremely colorful speaking style that contrasted delightfully with the formal, jargon-filled and sometimes turgid talk of many other central bankers. OECD Sees Fed Delaying First Rate Rise.Â The Organization for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentÂ said the U.S. dollarâ€™s appreciation against other major currencies is contributing to low inflation in the worldâ€™s largest economy and could weaken growth by damping exports.
