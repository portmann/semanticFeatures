Grand Central: U.S. Consumers are a Wildcard in Yellenâ€™s Midyear Outlook - Real Time Economics - WSJ BOJ Lowers Price Forecasts, Stands Pat on Policy Behind Chinaâ€™s Dwindling Forex Reserves, A Plan to Boost the Yuan In a speech in Cleveland last week, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen pointed hopefully to an upturn on retail and motor vehicle sales early in the second quarter as a sign that consumer spending might be picking up. On Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that sales by U.S. retailers dropped in June after a rebound the prior month. The underlying trend of retailers has looked anemic since January. Sales excluding gasoline â€“ which are way down because of falling prices â€“ were up 3.2% in June from a year earlier. That represents a sharp slowdown from year-on-year gains of 5.5% in the second half of 2014. The anemic consumer is a big conundrum for the Fed. Officials have pinned a forecast for economic rebound in 2015 on expectations that consumer spending will pick up. Households appear to have some wind at their backs after years of exceptionally slow and disappointing economic expansion. Hiring is expanding, unemployment is falling, gasoline prices are down, and stock and real estate prices are up. â€œMany of the fundamental factors underlying U.S. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic growth in the coming years,â€? Ms. Yellen said Friday. Government retail sales data are volatile and hard to read, but the latest data donâ€™t help this case. Perhaps Ms. Yellen will address the problem Wednesday in her first of two days of congressional testimony. Five Things to Watch in Janet Yellenâ€™s Congressional Testimony.

That is not something to shrink from,â€? Mr. Miles said.
