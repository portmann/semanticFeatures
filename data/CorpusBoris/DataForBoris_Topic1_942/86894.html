Fedspeak Cheatsheet: Fed Officials a Bit More Upbeat Ahead of Policy Meeting This Week - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting this week, central bank officials have made clear they won’t raise short-term interest rates. Federal Reserve officials heading into this weekâ€™s policy meeting have recently offered nuanced guidance about the outlook for interest rates. Theyâ€™ve made clear they wonâ€™t raise their benchmark short-term rate from near zero this week, and many indicated they still expect to move some time this year. But they havenâ€™t provided much guidance on when exactly that first rate increase is likely to occur, other than to say it will depend on the economyâ€™s health. Their recent comments reflect a modestly more optimistic view than at their April meeting, when many were troubled by the economyâ€™s dreadful start to the year and uncertain about whether it would give way to a decent rebound. Notably, no policy makers have recently called for a rate rise this week, heralding what could be a snoozer of a meeting. Chairwoman Janet Yellen (voter), May 22 in Providence, R.I. : “I think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal-funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.” Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer (voter), May 25 in Herzliya, Israel : “We will wait and see what happens. If the economy is moving slow weâ€™ll wait. If fast, weâ€™ll do it earlier.” Gov. Daniel Tarullo (voter), June 4 in New York : No direct comment on rate policy, but says heâ€™s watching the state of the economy: “There are more questions at this point in 2015 than there were at this point in 2014.” Gov. Lael Brainard (voter), June 2 in Washington, D.C. : “But while the case for liftoff may not be immediate, it is coming into clearer view. If continued labor market strengthening is confirmed and inflation readings continue to improve, liftoff could come before the end of the year.” Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , June 1 in Hartford, Conn. : Would like to raise rates “as soon as possible, but it has to be because the economic conditions are right. The economic conditions havenâ€™t been right to date.” New York Fed President William Dudley (voter), June 5 in Minneapolis : “If the labor market continues to improve and inflation expectations remain well-anchored, then I would expectâ€“in the absence of some dark cloud gathering over the growth outlookâ€“to support a decision to begin normalizing monetary policy later this year.” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, May 1 in Philadelphia : “Iâ€™m going to be data-dependent, Iâ€™m going to look at the data, and go into each meeting with an assessment of the data that comes in. So Iâ€™m not taking any of the meetings off the table.” Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker (voter), May 26 in Baton Rouge, La. : â€œI havenâ€™t made up my mind yet about June…I am going to wait and see what the data reveals.â€? Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart (voter), May 6 in Baton Rouge, La. : “Probabilities as reflected in forward markets, or futures markets for fed funds, seem to have moved from December toward September. I think thatâ€™s a reasonable alignment with what I think to be the likely policy outlookâ€? for short-term rates. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans (voter), June 3 in Chicago : St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , June 3 in St. Louis : “I would like to move on the back of good news, basically, and I think itâ€™s very difficult to say that youâ€™re trying to normalize interest rates just at the moment where the economy looks a little bit weaker.” Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, May 28 in Helena, Mont. : “Under my current outlook, I continue to believe that it would be a mistake to raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015.” San Francisco Fed President John Williams (voter), May 28 in Singapore : â€œIâ€™ve gotten myself into trouble there [on the likely timing of a rate increase]. I said at one point that we will do something in summer, and I found out that my definition of summer was not the right definition of summer….So, Iâ€™ve got to be very careful about these things. I would say sometime [in] the remainder of the year.â€?
