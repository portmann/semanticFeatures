5 Things to Watch in the Fed’s March Minutes - WSJ The Federal Reserve last month gave itself the option of raising interest rates in June, but also signaled it will remain cautious about actually pulling the trigger. More clues about the debate inside the U.S. central bank could be revealed Wednesday, when the Fed releases minutes of its March 17-18 policy meeting. Hereâ€™s what to watch when they come out at 2 p.m. EDT. The Fed in March dropped its pledge that it could be â€œpatientâ€? Â in beginning to raise short-term interest rates from near zero. Since â€œpatientâ€? signaled a rate increase was unlikely at the next two policy meetings , eliminating the word opened the door to a rate increase as soon as June. But Chairwoman Janet Yellen, at her postmeeting press conference, said a June rate increase isnâ€™t necessarily in the cards. â€œJust because we removed the word patient from the statement doesnâ€™t mean we are going to be impatient,â€? she said. The minutes should give more details on the internal balancing act behind the diction shift. In lieu of patience, the Fed said it would raise rates when there has been â€œ further improvement in the labor market â€? and when officials are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that U.S. inflation will move back toward the central bankâ€™s 2% target. The minutes could give more details on what officials meant by â€œreasonably confident.â€? Ms. Yellen, for her part, said there was no â€œ mechanical answer â€? and that policy makers will look at a â€œwide array of dataâ€? including inflation expectations and wage growth. When the Fed does start raising rates, it doesnâ€™t plan to move too fast. Officials released updated projections in March that showed a less-aggressive path for interest rates in the coming years. And in late March, Ms. Yellen said the central bank likely will take a â€œ gradualist approach â€? to rate increases. The minutes could give details on why policy makers increasingly see a gradual tightening process ahead. For a second straight winter, the U.S. is seeing an apparent slowdown in economic growth , underscored by weak hiring during March. The economyâ€™s surprise contraction during the first quarter of 2014 proved fleeting, and the Fed must decide if this time is different . A number of indicators were already weakening Â ahead of the March policy meeting , so the minutes could show how officials sorted through those signals. New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday that he saw harsh winter weather Â behind much of the recent weakness. The Fed added a reference to â€œ international developments â€? in January, and in March noted that â€œ export growth has weakened .â€? Otherwise, the central bankâ€™s policy statements have avoided discussing foreign developments or the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. But officials arenâ€™t avoiding those topics behind closed doors, based on prominent references in the January minutes to China, Greece, â€œglobal disinflationary pressureâ€? and the dollar. The March minutes could offer an update on what the Fed is watching overseas. Fed Puts Interest-Rate Hikes in Play • You must enter the verification code below to send.
