Ben Bernanke: The Fed Is â€˜Gropingâ€™ to Find the Full Employment Rate - Real Time Economics - WSJ Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said he doesnâ€™t know where the so-called full-employment level is now, saying the Fed â€œis in some sense gropingâ€? to determine it. Full employment is the point at which joblessness has fallen as low as it can go without fueling inflation pressures. Itâ€™s a point that changes over time as the economy evolves and can be hard to identify. â€œItâ€™s even more complicated than it was before,â€? Mr. Bernanke said in a question-and-answer session following remarks at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International StudiesÂ on Monday. â€œThe unemployment rate used to be the only number you had to look at. Now of course there are many dimensions.â€? The comments come as the central bank is weighing whether the economyâ€“and the labor market in particularâ€“is healthy enough to withstand interest rate increases. Fed officials indicated at their latest policy meeting they donâ€™t think the U.S. has reached full employment just yet. In December, officials pegged the economyâ€™s long-run unemployment rate, somewhere between 5.2% and 5.5%. But in updated projections released earlier this month, they lowered their estimate to a range between 5 and 5.2%. The U.S. jobless rate was 5.5% in February. Mr. Bernanke said of the full employment rate, â€œNobody really knows that number with any precision,â€? adding, â€œand the Fed will continue to grope to find out what the right number is.â€? The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen steadily in recent years, but broader measures suggest the labor market isnâ€™t so healthy. Wages remain stagnant and a historically small share of Americans are working or looking for work. Also, a broader unemployment measure from the Labor Department, including people who have given up looking for work or are stuck in part-time jobs, remains elevated. If the economy is already at full employment and officials wait too long to raise rates, that could push inflation unacceptably high. If they move too soon, they risk crimping the economic recovery. At a press conference earlier this month , Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said, â€œso far we havenâ€™t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is running well below our objective, and by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market.â€?
