The FOMC expects the transitory effects of a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices to continue to weigh on prices a while longer.

Robin Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Economist, Principal Global Investors The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided not to raise the fed funds rate at their September meeting; members were concerned about not only global developments but also inflation, or maybe rather lack of inflation. The FOMC expects the transitory effects of a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices to continue to weigh on prices a while longer. In fact, the FOMC downgraded their inflation projections and now anticipates that inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator, will reach 2% in 2018 versus 2017. This view stands somewhat in contrast to Fed vice-chair Stanley Fischer's relatively hawkish remarks at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole meeting in late August. What gives? First off, Mr. Fischer is perhaps not as concerned about the drop in market-based inflation expectations as other FOMC members. In fact, he cites the stability in survey-based inflation expectations, such as that from the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, as reason to believe this year's drop in core inflation is transitory. Second, and somewhat "wonkish," Mr. Fischer assumes that the pass-through drags from a stronger dollar onto inflation are sharp and end quickly. He relies on one macroeconomic model (SIGMA) for this assumption.[1] There are lots of models economists rely on to estimate the impacts of macroeconomic shocks such as the recent significant appreciation of the dollar. In a recent note, Goldman Sach's U.S. economics team shows that other macro models predict shallower, but longer-lasting, drags on inflation than the SIGMA model.[2] According to their estimates, the SIGMA model suggested that the 17% appreciation in the dollar over the last year explained all of core PCE's deviation from its 2% target, 0.8 percentage points. In contrast, other models revealed that the dollar's rise explained around 0.4 percentage points of core PCE inflation's deviation from 2%, or half the drag of the SIGMA model. The broad range of the dollar's estimated impacts on inflation, not only in magnitude but duration, highlight the tremendous uncertainty in economic forecasting. The Fed and Mr. Fischer know this; that's probably one reason why the FOMC decided to delay the hike in interest rates. Lastly, while Mr. Fischer stated that both the dollar's and oil prices' drag on inflation should end soon, the broader FOMC is likely worried about how transitory the strength in the dollar and weakness in commodity prices may be. For example, oil prices have dropped sharply, down over 50% in the last year. With West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at around $45 per barrel, it's hard to imagine a further 50% drop. However, if oil prices dropped to say $30 a barrel, that would be another nearly 33% fall from today's price. This seems pretty unlikely, but not outside of a downside-risk scenario. The broad trade-weighted dollar seemed to stabilize this spring after rapidly appreciating since late last year. However, it moved up again starting in May as growth concerns for China made headlines. The Fed is carefully watching emerging market currencies, especially after the recent yuan devaluation. Let's face it, the Fed is in a tough spot - labor market indicators like job growth and the unemployment rate are signaling that the U.S. economy is ready for higher interest rates. However, the signals from inflation are much murkier; that explains the mixed messages from the FOMC. There may be some good news on those developments from abroad (and their impacts on the dollar and oil) at some point. Investor sentiment around China has gotten extremely negative. At some point, investors will realize the negative sentiment was overblown, that will help the dollar and commodities somewhat. More importantly, as Mr. Fischer puts it, the effects of monetary policy come at a significant lag and tightening should begin well ahead of when an economy starts to overheat. It is likely far better for markets and for the U.S. economy if the Fed slowly starts to raise rates this year, instead of being forced to raise rates quickly in the coming year.
