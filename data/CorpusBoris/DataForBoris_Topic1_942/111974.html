Fed’s Evans Favors Mid-2016 for Interest-Rate Increase - Real Time Economics - WSJ CHICAGO — Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the U.S. central bank should hold off on an interest-rate increase until mid-2016 as concerns remain over low inflation, risks abroad and the strength of the economy at home. Mr. Evans said risks overseas risks have grown since the Federal Open Market Committee met last month, cautioning that acting too soon may only heighten challenges the Federal Reserve faces. The central banker remains concerned about inflation continuing to trail the Fed’s 2% target rate and wants to see more evidence it’s rising toward that level. “I just don’t see why we should be in a hurry with all of the risks we face. A little more time doesn’t hurt,” Mr. Evans said during a media briefing here Thursday. Mr. Evans, who is a voting member of the Fed’s rate-setting committee this year, in remarks last month said he won’t support a rate increase before early 2016. His views on timing continue to put him at odds with most of his colleagues, who at the June meeting signaled the Fed is moving toward a rate increase later this year. The central bank has held its benchmark rate near zero since December 2008. Mr. Evans continued to argue Thursday a move this year would be premature because inflation continues to underperform the bank’s 2% target. He expects inflation at 1.3% by the end of the year and only to reach 1.7% in 2017. Mr. Evans said he has concerns about inflation forecasting and sees low rates as a global issue that central bankers are struggling to address. “What worries me is some of the risks we might be facing with Europe, with China, with emerging markets, we’re not quite as close to that as a lot of people think. There is a worldwide low inflation issue that no one right now is able to address with their monetary policies,” he said. In the Fed minutes from the June meeting released Wednesday, officials said to act on interest rates they would need to see additional information showing a strengthening economy and inflation moving upward to the 2% target. The minutes also highlighted concerns over Greece reaching an agreement with its creditors and the pace of economic growth abroad, particularly China. In recent weeks, Greece has defaulted on a loan to the International Monetary Fund and voters there rejected policy changes seen as critical to a new deal in the region. Mr. Evans said direct exposure of the U.S. to Greece and the larger European continent is relatively small and reasonable, but the uncertainty it creates can heighten the risks that central bankers face. “Undoubtedly the risks are somewhat higher than they were just a few weeks ago,” Mr. Evans said As for China, Mr. Evans said economic growth shows signs of a continuing a step down from what has occurred in recent years. He described the gyrations in the Chinese stock market including a sharp recent sell off as an added dimension to risks that were already present. At home, Mr. Evans is forecasting GDP at 2% for this year, and 2.75% and 2.5% for 2016 and 2017, respectively. He sees the U.S. job market continuing to make progress, particularly this year, as the unemployment rate reached 5.3% in June. Still, he said there is likely more slack in the labor market than the current unemployment rate suggests. Mr. Evans said he sees the natural rate of unemployment at 5%, while adding there are good arguments that it should be even lower. He also continues to see the economy relying heavily on consumers to sustain growth. “As I see the data, I need as much accommodation as we have in place in order to generate those good growth numbers. Perhaps other people see more fundamentals,” Mr. Evans said. Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
