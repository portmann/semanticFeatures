Grand Central: Lockhart and Powell Donâ€™t Sound Too Far Apart on Economy - Real Time Economics - WSJ Key Japan Adviser Warns of Deflation Risk In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in June , Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell said he expected the central bank to begin raising short-term interest rates in September and to increase rates a second time in December of this year. In an interview with CNBC Wednesday , Mr. Powell was non-committal about whether he would support a Fed move in September as he had earlier stated. The economy has been performing about as he had been forecasting, Mr. Powell told CNBC. â€œWe are on the same path of reasonable growth, better than reasonable job growth and inflation which is still well below our target,â€? he said, adding. â€œMy approach hasnâ€™t changed. My thinking hasnâ€™t changed.â€? Some market participants took Mr. Powellâ€™s unwillingness to signal a September move as a push back against Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. Mr. Lockhart told The Wall Street Journal earlier this week he was inclined to move rates in September as long as economic data didnâ€™t disappoint before then. Mr. Powell said Wednesday, â€œnothing has been decided.â€? While they are taking different approaches at the moment about what they are prepared to signal on policy, the two donâ€™t sound too far apart in terms of how they are reading the economy. Both are especially focused on labor market developments. Mr. Lockhart told the Journal that reduced labor market slack was giving him confidence that inflation would eventually start rising toward the Fedâ€™s 2% objective. Mr. Powell said the labor market had been strong and he would be particularly focused on the next two Labor Department employment reports in assessing the economyâ€™s progress. The departmentâ€™s July jobs report will be released Friday, when the Fedâ€™s thinking on September will come more clearly into focus.

Mr. Powell told CNBC that â€œnothing has been decidedâ€? regarding the timing of the first rate increase. Lockhart Interview Excerpts, Part 2.

Key Japan Adviser Warns of Deflation Risk. The Bank of Japan should unleash fresh monetary easing if the closely watched core inflation rate falls into negative territory over the summer or autumn, says Mitsubishi UFJ chief economist Goshi Kataoka, the right-hand man of Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s economic advisers.

Hungary’s Rate-Cutting Cycle Over, Central Bank Minutes Show.Â Hungary’s central bank rate-setters agreed in July to put an end to rate cutting as the policy rate is at a record low and keeping monetary conditions loose for an extended period will ensure meeting the medium-term inflation target. “The overwhelming majority of decision-makers agreed that the policy rate had reached a level that ensures the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and corresponds to an appropriate degree of support to the economy,” the minutes of the July 21 rate meeting, published on Wednesday, show. â€“Dow Jones Newswires China Snaps Up Share of Asia Trade as U.S., Japan Lag.Â The share of Asian countriesâ€™ imports from China more than doubled from 2000 to 2014 , while the share of Japan and the U.S. in Asian imports approximately halved, according to a study by Third Way, a centrist think tank in Washington that backs trade liberalization. New York Fed: Gender Pay Gap Doesn’t Start Until Mid-Career. New research by the New York Fed finds women outearn men at the start of their careers Â – especially under certain majors such as engineering or art history. But “as workers approach mid-career, the wage premium that young women enjoy in these majors completely disappears and males earn a more-substantial premium in nearly every major.” Macroprudential Regulation ‘Cannot Afford Imprudence and Negligence’ –VoxEU. Macroprudential measures, together with higher capital requirements, could be used to tame the build-up of leverage and credit booms in order to prevent financial crises, Xavier Freixas, Luc Laeven, JosÃ©-Luis PeydrÃ³ write in a posting on VoxEU.org, summarizing the findings of their new book on the subject, â€œSystemic Risk, Crises and Macroprudential Regulation.â€?

Suggestion for Greece: No Growth, No Debt Repayments.Â Lightening Greeceâ€™s debt burden is key to restoring confidence and growth in the Greek economy, the Max Planck Instituteâ€™s Armin von Bogdandy, DIWâ€™s Marcel Fratzscher, and Bruegelâ€™s Guntram Wolff write in a blogpost on Bruegelâ€™s website . They suggest tying the interest rates on Greeceâ€™s loans to the growth rate of its economy, together with a conditional debt moratorium. â€œA Greece without growth should not pay any interest or make any repayments. The stronger the growth rate, the higher the interest and repayments to European creditors,â€? they write. â€œSuch an approach would not reduce the incentives for reform. It is in the self-interest of any Greek government to pursue growth-friendly reforms,â€? they add. -The U.S. trade gap expanded 7% in June , according to the Commerce Department, as the strong dollar pushed down demand for American-made goods overseas and imports climbed steadily. -The Czech central bank on Thursday maintained its loose monetary policy, keeping its weak-koruna policy intact and interest rates near zero. â€“Dow Jones Newswires -Canada’s trade deficit narrowed markedly in June as exports to the U.S. rose at the fastest pace in six years, offering a positive reading on a Canadian economy that has struggled so far this year.
