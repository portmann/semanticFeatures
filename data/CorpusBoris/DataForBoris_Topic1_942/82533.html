Iceland Raises Interest Rates as Central Bank Eyes Price Stability - Real Time Economics - WSJ A logo sits on display outside the offices of the Sedlabanki in Reykjavik, Iceland. Icelandic authorities earlier this week announced plans to gradually lift restrictions on capital flows imposed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008. Iceland’s central bank raised its key interest rates on Wednesday and said it may have to hike rates even further to ensure price stability, as the country starts to phase out strict capital controls while juggling higher than expected wage settlements. Sedlabanki, the central bank, raised its main lending rate to 5.75% from 5.25% and its seven-day deposit rate to 5% from 4.5%, where they have been since being cut in December. “The outlook for developments in wage costs, the increase in inflation expectations, and indicators of robust demand growth make it unavoidable to respond to the worsening inflation outlook now, even though inflation is still below target,” the central bank said in a statement. “Furthermore, it seems apparent that a sizeable rate increase will be necessary in August, followed by further rate hikes in the coming term, so as to ensure price stability over the medium term,” it added. Average consumer prices rose 1.6% on the year in May, up from 1.4% in April and 0.8% around the turn of the year but still short of the central bank’s 2.5% target. Icelandic authorities earlier this week announced plans to gradually lift restrictions on capital flows imposed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008. The removal of capital controls poses a dilemma for the central bank, as the decision could put pressure on the Icelandic krona and could see consumer prices rising further. The government has said they will ask creditors to either pay a steep tax or make a contribution to a government-run stability fund before repatriating their assets.
