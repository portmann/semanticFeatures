Recap: Fed Chief Janet Yellen’s Report to Congress - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet YellenÂ visits lawmakers Wednesday and Thursday for two days of congressional testimony, offering her views publicly for the first time since the central bank raised interest rates in December. InvestorsÂ will be watching for signs that the Fed will hold offâ€”at least until after Marchâ€”on any further rate increasesÂ amid mounting unease in financial markets and worries about global growth. Here’s a recap of her appearance Wednesday before theÂ House Financial ServicesÂ Committee.Â Be sure toÂ  visit us Thursday , and followÂ  @WSJCentralBanks Â andÂ  @WSJecon Â for coverage of Ms. Yellenâ€™s on Day 2, before theÂ Â Senate Banking Committee. WELCOME: Itâ€™s a big day for Janet Yellen. The economic outlook is cloudy and financial markets are stormy. Tossing politicians into the mix, in an election year, isnâ€™t usually what youâ€™d consider a recipe for clarity. The Federal Reserve chairwoman starts her two days of Capitol Hill testimony with a visit to the House Financial Services Committee. Her biggest task will be to soothe the public (particularly those ever-anxious investors) without boxing herself in about the central bankâ€™s next move on interest rates. The next Fed policy meeting is more than a month away. A lot can happen between now and then. The job market is in good shape with low unemployment, moderate payroll growth and faster wage growth. But economic growth is rather unremarkable, with an annualized 0.7% expansion in the fourth quarter. Inflation remains the weakest link. Headline inflation is proving to be lower than Fed officials expected, due to oil prices that seem to never stop dropping. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is a bit more stable. But inflation expectations â€” a core piece of central bankersâ€™ inflation outlooks â€” are slipping. Thatâ€™s not a good sign for their quest to lift inflation to healthier levels. FINANCIAL FEARS? The biggest item on the Fed’s worry list must be financial conditions. The sharp swings in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities cannot inspire confidence in any business trying to make sense of the economic outlook. Are markets flashing warning signs about the global economic outlook? Or are they just doing their usual thing, looking for reassurance about economic stimulus from central bankers? Ms. Yellen will have plenty of opportunities to weigh in. PROGRAMMING NOTES: The action gets started early today. Ms. Yellenâ€™s written testimony and the Fedâ€™s semi-annual monetary policy report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. That gives lawmakers a bit of time to digest it â€” even though few of them will â€” before the 10 a.m. hearing. Based on experience, weâ€™re likely in store for about three hours of Chair Yellen sitting in her chair and listening to speeches (with a few questions thrown in). YELLEN TO THE RESCUE?Â The testimony is out, and itâ€™s a lot of what markets wanted. No promises but lots of reassurances. In other words, the Fed wants you to know a March rate increase is far from a certainty. Ms. YellenÂ says financial conditions â€œhave recently become less supportive of growthâ€? and reiterates that the Fed expects â€œgradualâ€? rate increases. It hits the key notes about stresses in China and elsewhere overseas, weakening inflation expectations and more. A couple ofÂ key lines: â€œFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they persist, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.â€? A FED NOT ON AUTOPILOT: The Fed continues to expect a gradual pace of interest-rate increases, Ms. Yellen says in her congressional testimony. But â€œby no meansâ€? is monetary policy â€œon a preset course,â€? she adds. â€œThe actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2% inflation.â€? She also defends the Fedâ€™s December decision to begin boosting rates in familiar language, saying policy remains accommodative and that delaying the start of the process for too long might have led to an â€œabrupt tighteningâ€? that â€œcould increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.â€? FAITH IN THE PHILLIPS CURVE: U.S. inflation â€œis expected to remain low in the near term,â€? Ms. Yellen says. But downward pressure from declining energy prices and a strengthening dollar should wane â€œonce oil and import prices stop falling.â€? Ms. Yellen continues to emphasize the central role of the labor market in inflation dynamics, noting that inflation should rise gradually to the Fedâ€™s 2% annual goal â€œas the labor market strengthens further.â€? On that front, she highlights â€œsolid improvementâ€? in key measures of job-market health, but notes some slack likely remains. â€œThere is still room for further sustainable improvement,â€? she says. On inflation expectations, she says market-based measures of inflation compensation â€œhave moved down to historically low levelsâ€? although â€œchanges in risk and liquidity premiums over the past year and a halfâ€? appear to be a significant contributor to that trend. She also noted that some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are â€œat the low end of their recent rangesâ€? though she described them as â€œreasonable stableâ€? on the whole. DOWNSIDES OF A STRONG DOLLAR: The Fed’s monetary policy report delves into some of the implications of a particularly strong U.S. currency. The report said a stronger dollar has reduced import prices, pushing down core inflation by 0.5 percentage point. Likewise, falling oil prices have held down firmsâ€™ production and distribution costs and weighed on core consumer price inflation â€œsomewhat.â€? Once oil prices stabilize and the dollar stops rising, the Fed expects both core and overall inflation to move up towards its 2% target â€œover the medium term.â€? The report also notes how divergence among central banks of the worldâ€™s developed economies is contributing to the dollarâ€™s strength and cutting into U.S. exports in a way that could delay the Fedâ€™s rate increases. â€œAll else being equal, a smaller contribution to the U.S. economy from the external sector likely points to a more gradual pace of policy normalization in the United States,â€? the report said. Likewise, the strong dollar will boost other developed countries exports by making their currencies relatively weaker. That, the report said, could allow central banks in Europe or Japan â€œto provide less monetary accommodation â€“ or to start removing it earlier â€“ than would otherwise be the case.â€? THEÂ OIL OUTLOOK:Â Nothing has confounded economic forecasters more over the past year than what’s happened with oil prices, so it’s interesting to see Ms. Yellen weigh in on the topic too. She seems skeptical of the view that low oil prices are a negative for the U.S. economy .Â Her key remarks on oil are spread throughout the speech, but here’s a compilation of them: Minus: “In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year.” Plus: “Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income–aided in part by the declines in oil prices.” Plus: Bad financial conditions “could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.” Minus:Â “Low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries.” Plus: “Economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect.” On balance she sees the negatives from oil as primarily focused on the oil sector and commodity-producing countries. By contrast, the positives she mentions apply to the broader economy. This suggests Ms. Yellen and the Fed still sees low oil prices as primarily a good thing. THE FED VS. THE MARKET: The funny thing about these standoffs is how markets want certainty in a world that provides little of it. Looking at markets this morning (not exactly excited by the Fedâ€™s testimony) makes that clear. Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony goes about as far as the head of a committee can go if she wants to maintain the notion that the Fed is still run by a committee. The central bank started the year expecting to raise interest rates four times. Investors are betting itâ€™ll be zero times and seemed to want Ms. Yellen to at least rule out the first one in March. She did not, but she went pretty far considering the fact that the Fed just started raising rates two months ago. If the March meeting were held today, the words in her testimony make it clear the Fed would not be raising rates today. But sheâ€™s not going to say that without the committee agreeing. THE NEXT FIVE WEEKS:Â Â The Federal Reserveâ€™s next opportunity for action comes at its March 15-16 meeting, just over a month away. ButÂ there are more big economic reports in between now and then than you might think: The Feb. 19 and March 16 consumer-price index report The Feb. 17 and March 16 industrial production report The Feb. 12 and March 15 retail sales report 25 days of trading in financial markets (perhaps most important of all) AÂ lot of major economic reports are going to hit twice inÂ the next five weeks. Things could look a lot differentâ€”a lot worse or a lot betterâ€”once that much information has arrived. This helps explain why Ms. Yellen isnâ€™t providing a clearer signal about the Fedâ€™s March meeting. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, listens as Janet Yellen testifies. He read a letter Wednesday from several economists arguing a rules-based approach would be appropriate and would not threaten the Fedâ€™s independence. YELLEN VS. POLICY RULES: Hereâ€™sÂ a preview of one debate likely to crop up at todayâ€™s hearing. The Financial Services Committee has shared a letter fromÂ economists who support a Â recent bill that would require the Fed to follow a rules-based monetary policy. The letter has some very prominent signatories, including Nobel Prize winners Lars Peter Hansen, Robert Lucas and Ed Prescott. Also on the list are a handful of former Fed policy makers, including former Fed governor Robert Heller, former Cleveland Fed President Jerry Jordan and former St. Louis Fed President William Poole. The letter has also been signed by most members of the group known as the Shadow Open Market Committeeâ€”a collection of prominent economists tasked with second-guessing the central bankâ€™s decisions.Â  Ms. Yellen has opposed the legislation on the grounds that it would jeopardize the Fedâ€™s independence from political pressures. The signatories have the opposite view: â€œIn no way would the legislation compromise the Fedâ€™s independence,â€? they write. â€œOn the contrary, publically reporting a strategy helps prevent policy makers from bending under pressure and sacrificing independence. It strengthens independence by reducing or removing pressures from markets and governments to finance budget deficits or deviate from policies that enhance economic stability.â€? Weâ€™re about to get treated to a couple of rounds of opening statements from the committeeâ€™s top lawmakers. And then weâ€™ll get the opposite of a dramatic reading: Ms. Yellen delivering her oral testimony , which you already have read, digested and discarded by now. Then we get the questions where the Fed chief will find a dozen ways to say the same thing over and over and over. QUESTION TIME: Now that the dramatic reading is out of the way, weâ€™ve got Q&A. And go figure,Â investors are now excitedâ€”stocks are surgingâ€”even though they were initially underwhelmed. And Ms. Yellen hasnâ€™t conveyed any new informationÂ from the 8:30 text release . FED RULES: The House Financial Services Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), isÂ using much of his time to make a point. Heâ€™s reciting numerous economists who signed aÂ letter pushing for legislation backing rules-based monetary policy (among many other things). Ms. Yellen hasÂ a different view. Mr. Hensarling is no fan of the Fed â€”at least the Fed we have nowâ€”and he made his point. INTEREST ON RESERVES:Â Both Republican Jeb Hensarling and Democrat Maxine Waters, the leaders of the Financial Services Committee, questioned Ms. Yellen about interest on reserves in their initial bout of questions. It’s remarkable that this policyÂ is receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle. The members seem to see this policy as a handout to banks. Ms. Yellen responded that “if we were denied that tool at the present time we would not be able to easily raise the level of short-term rates.” But the Fed is clearly going to face an uphill battle explaining and defending this policy to Congress. PAYING THE BANKS: Mr.Â Hensarling questions why the FedÂ is paying commercial banks an above-market interest rate of 0.5% for their reserves. Ms.Â Yellen reminds lawmakers that it was Congress that gave the Fed the power to pay banks interest on reserves in 2006. Moreover, if the Fed didnâ€™t have the power, it wouldnâ€™t be able to raise interest rates right now â€” which Republicans including Mr. Hensarling have been urging the Fed to do for years. Rep. Hensarling to Yellen: Fed interest on reserves â€œappears to be a subsidyâ€? to banks, â€œappears to distort real asset allocation.â€? SMALL TALK:Â The top of the hearing has given us a robust discussion of rules-based monetary policy,Â tools for the Fedâ€™s exit strategy and now regulatory pressures on community banks. That is a remarkable way to start a hearing in whichÂ Ms. Yellen probably thought sheâ€™d be discussing why the Fed is in a tightening mode andÂ whether the U.S. economy would be walloped by the turmoil all around us. ARE NEGATIVE RATES LEGAL? Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) opened with a very direct question to Ms. Yellen: Are negative interest rates legal? The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have recently pushed their interest rates into negative territory, and this has prompted speculation about whether the Fed would ever follow course. But itâ€™s not clear that the Fed has the legal authority to pay negative interest rates. Ms. Yellen declined to state definitively whether the policy is legal in the U.S. and a 2010 memo from the central bank that was posted on its website last month said that the situation was ambiguous. â€œThat remains a question we still would need to investigate more thoroughly,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œI am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it, but Iâ€™m saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues. That still needs to be done.â€? For now, this is largely an academic discussion, however. Thereâ€™s no indication today that the Fed is considering reversing course. Right now, the Fed is still in the mindset of raising rates, not cutting them, let alone into negative territory. RATE TALK: You can always count on Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.) to ask investorsâ€™ key questions about monetary policy. Hers: Has the turmoil in global markets changed your view about the pace of interest-rate increases, or will you wait to see what happens? This is Ms. Yellenâ€™s chance to find a lot of new ways to repeat the message from her testimony. â€œWe are watching very carefully whatâ€™s happening in global financial markets,â€? she says. Some of the stresses areÂ tied to uncertainty around Chinese exchange-rate policies and the price of oil. WhileÂ fears about a recession have increased, â€œweâ€™ve not yet seen a sharp drop-off in growth eitherÂ globally or in the United States,â€? she says. But global financial developments â€œbear close watchingâ€? and â€œmay have implications for the outlook.â€? TheÂ followup questions Rep. Maloney is reading showÂ us that she has a few good eggs on her staff: What would it take to cut rates again? Â A severe downturn or just weak inflation? Ms. Yellen says she doesnâ€™t expect the Fed to â€œsoonâ€? be in the situation where it would need to cut rates. But thereâ€™s â€œalways some risk of a recessionâ€? and global developments could slow the economy. So hereâ€™s the verdict fromÂ your Fed chief: If it turned out to be necessary, the FOMC would â€œdo what is neededâ€? to meet its congressional mandate. ABOUT THOSE PAYMENTS ON EXCESS RESERVES: Hereâ€™s some key context around the debate at todayâ€™s hearing over the Fedâ€™s ability to pay interest on excess reserves: When Congress passed the legislation authorizing this power, there were very few excess reserves in the banking system. Interest payments of 5%â€”roughly the prevailing rate at the timeâ€”would have amounted to about $84 million in interest. Today, there are more than $2 trillion in reserves, which means that payments of even 0.5% would amount to around $11.5 billion in payments. Now, when the Fed raised rates the old-fashioned way, that also boosted the money that banks can earn risk-free. But clearly the political environment has shifted since the financial crisis and something that looks like a handout to banksâ€”even when itâ€™s a standard tool in international monetary policyâ€”faces a tough audience from Congress. FED VS. FED: Rep.Â Randy Neugebauer (R., Texas) seems to get at the heart of the challenges regulators face, particularly those at the Fed. One side of the Fed (dealing with monetary policy) needs to boost the economy while another needs to regulateÂ the financial system. The regulatory piece, he says, can kill jobs and increase the cost of capital, among other things. Ms. Yellen has heard this before and quickly invokes 2008: â€œWe have to remember that financial crises are immensely costly to well-being. Itâ€™s important to make sure we do almost everything we can to reduce the odds of another devastating financial crisis.â€? BAILOUT POWERS: Ms. YellenÂ defended the central bankâ€™s rule limiting its emergency lending powers, a key requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law meant to limit the Fedâ€™s ability to rescue individual financial firms as it did during the financial crisis. Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.) argued the ruleâ€“finalized in Novemberâ€“isnâ€™t tough enough, and doesnâ€™t go as far as Congress intended. â€œA lot has changed,â€? Ms. Yellen argued, noting the Fed can no longer lend to insolvent borrowers, or provide assistance to a single firm. â€œOur rule does implement those restrictionsâ€¦Congress has clearly changed what the Fed can do.â€? Fed officials have warned further restrictions to its emergency lending powers could harm its ability to support the financial system in a future crisis. FED GOVERNANCE: Congressman Brad Sherman (D.-Calif.) got into a testy exchange with Ms. Yellen over attempts to change the way that regional Reserve Bank presidents are appointed. The 12 Reserve Bank presidents are currently selected through a convoluted process in which the Washington-based Board of Governors (appointed by the U.S. president) votes to accept or reject candidates that are selected by boards of directors at the regional Fed banks. Some members of Congress would prefer a system in which the Fedâ€™s regional presidents are also appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Asked if she would oppose those efforts, Ms. Yellen said, â€œI think the current structure of the Fed is something Congress decided after a long debate and weighing of a whole variety of considerations. I would say it works pretty well â€“â€? Here Mr. Sherman interrupted: â€œYou would say the Fed, having just lived through 2008â€¦itÂ has been working well.â€? â€œI thought you were asking about governance â€“,â€? Ms. Yellen started before another interjection. LOOK IN THE MIRROR: An hour and a half into her testimony, Ms. Yellen is taking shots from both sides of the aisle about flaws and limits in Fed monetary and regulatory policies. It’s striking that so far she hasn’t shot back at lawmakers about their role in driving fiscal policy, which has been ill-suited for a weak economy facing long-run deficits. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke often gently reminded lawmakers that an ideal fiscal policy would be stimulative to the weak economy in the short-run but more restrictive in the long-run to address deficits. Instead in the post-recession period it has been just the opposite. Ms. Yellen isn’t going there, and is taking the shots instead. REAL TALK: Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) Â is trying to bringÂ some of this hearing back to the real world. He wants answers about the Fed dodging his quest for details onÂ  a leak of sensitive information . Mr. Duffy wants to know why the Fed still has not complied with its requests or its subpoenas. Ms. Yellen, who can filibuster much better than your average lawmaker, is clearly trying to run out the clock here. She cites a letter exchange with Mr. Hensarling (the committee chairman)Â and a note she got back after the close of business last night. â€œWe will consider it and get back to you as soon as we can,â€? she says. Ouch. Mr. Duffy is, uh, not being polite. He wants pieces of transcripts from Fed discussions. This is not about monetary policy, he says, itâ€™s about a congressional investigation â€œThis institution is entitled to those documents, wouldnâ€™t you agree?â€? he asks. â€œI will get back to you with a formal answer,â€? Ms. Yellen says, adding that she believes the Fed has deliveredÂ the appropriate documents. â€œI will need some time to discuss this matter with my staff before I give you a final answer,â€? she says. Mr. Duffy is clearly not happy, about both the answer and the clock running down. He wants the Fed to justify why it is not providing the documents the Fed wants. These are serious questions, but weâ€™re not going to be getting any real answers here. INEQUALITY:Â Ms. Yellen was asked what the Fed is doing about inequality. Itâ€™s surprising it took so long to get a question on this, given how much inequality has animated the political process on both sides of the aisle this year. Ms. Yellen responded that â€œthe main contribution that the Fed can make to inequality, given that we donâ€™t have policies that target particular groups in the labor force, the main contribution we can make is to make sure the labor market is performing well and we obtain Congressâ€™s maximum employment objective.â€? MORE NEGATIVE RATES:Â Ms. Yellen just faced another round of questions on negative rates, this time from Congressman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) who noted that the Fed has asked banks to consider what would happen to their balance sheets if rates were negative. After all, this would be an unusual scenario to ask banks to consider if the Fed had really ruled out negative rates. Ms. Yellenâ€™s reply took two parts, first: â€œThis is something that could happen without the Fed actually setting negative interest rates,â€™ Ms. Yellen said. â€œWeâ€™ve seen it happen for limited periods of time in stressful situations.â€? Second, the issueÂ is worth considering as a planning exercise, even if the Fed doesnâ€™t plan to take rates negative any time soon. â€œIn the spirit of prudent planning it is something that, in light of European experience, we will look at and should look atâ€¦ to know what could potentially be availableâ€? as a tool for policy, Ms. Yellen said. Barriers to implementing negative rates remain in place, she suggested. â€œItâ€™s also a question of whether the plumbing of the payment system in the U.S. could handle it,â€? she said. â€œWeâ€™ve not determined that.â€? DIVERSITYÂ AND THE FED: Rep.Â David Scott (D.,Â Ga.), citingÂ shockinglyÂ high jobless rates amongÂ black Americans (particularly working-age men), notes that the Fed has never had an African-American president of a regional Fed bank. And he wants Ms. Yellen to make it happen. Ms. Yellen expresses her â€œregretâ€? that it hasnâ€™t happened. â€œItâ€™s our job to make sure that every search for those jobs assembles a broad and diverseâ€? group of candidates,â€? she says. â€œRight now is an example,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œThe Taylor Rule would recommend a short-term interest rate that would be close to 2.5%.â€? Ms. Yellen noted â€œthe fact weâ€™ve needed to hold the fed funds rate for almost seven years at zero to achieve the progress weâ€™ve made.â€? Setting a rate at 2.5% would be â€œhighly damaging to the economic situation.â€? Itâ€™s worth considering that the policy wouldÂ be very challenging for the Fed right now for other reasons as well. For one thing, the central bank is only at 0.5% and already facing aggressive criticism that it has moved too soon to raise rates and should slow things down. More from WSJ’s Kate Davidson today on Ms. Yellen’s opposition to a rules-based approach: “ Yellen Objects to Proposed Rule for Rate Formula .”Â And hereâ€™sÂ WSJ chief economics commentator Greg Ip on the challenges of rules-based policy . NEGATIVE RATES: Rep. Keith Rothfus (R., Pa.) , reading from an op-ed by former St. Louis Fed president William Poole,Â wants Ms. Yellen to admit that negative rates wonâ€™t solve problems for economies around the world (including ours) facingÂ structural issues. Of course, she tosses this one right back at Congress. â€œI agree that there are structural factors that have restrained U.S. growthâ€? and Congress could take steps to address them, she says. But the Fed also must try to achieve its own mandate for the economy. As for negative rates around the world, Ms. Yellen keeps it simple: Given the stressed situations in Europe and Japan, â€œitâ€™s a tool that has proven useful to them,â€? she says. CLEAVERâ€™S POEM:Â Congressman Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) delivered a critique of Fed policy that does too little to address unemployment for minorities and too much to help the big banks. Not sure if his rhyming was intentional but itâ€™s a nice little poem either way: â€œWeâ€™re declaring minority employment too big to curtail. The Wall Street and the Big Six banks are too big to jail. You rob a convenience store you go to jail. Ms. Yellen explains that the European Central Bank has been addressing high unemployment and inflation that slipped below its 2% goal. “We have divergent monetary policies. It’s put upward pressure on the dollar over a long period of time,” harming manufacturing and net exports and hitting the U.S. economy. WAGES:Â Ms. Yellen saysÂ there are signs of stronger wage growth in the U.S. job market, but nothing definite yet. â€œIâ€™d say the signs of wage growth increasing, theyâ€™re tentative at this point,â€? she says. â€œThere are some hopeful signs, but I think if the labor market continues to progress, we are very hopeful we will see faster progress on wages. And weâ€™ll try to keep that progress going, thatâ€™s our objective.â€? $1,000 A YEAR:Â Asked to weigh the pros and cons of falling oil prices, Ms. Yellen offered the following analysis that builds off what she said in her written testimony. â€œThe energy sector is very hard hit. Weâ€™re losing jobs there but with respect to employment, although there are very severe losses itâ€™s a pretty small sector of the workforce overall.â€? â€œWeâ€™re seeing massive cutbacks in drilling activity. Thatâ€™s rippling through to manufacturing generally where output is depressed.â€? On the other hand, compared to the prices of 2014, â€œfor the average American household weâ€™re looking at savings of $1,000 a year.â€? RACE AND JOBS: ContinuingÂ a hot topic of this hearing, Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.) cites former Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakotaâ€˜s recentÂ observation that the central bankâ€™s policy committee did not discussÂ African-American unemployment in 2010. Ms. Yellen says sheâ€™s surprised there was no specific reference to race that year, but says it may be because the committee was focused onÂ the broad issue of unemployment. â€œI suppose because our tools are not ones that can be targeted at particular groups in the labor market, it was clear what we needed to doâ€? and support a stronger labor market, she says. She also says â€œitâ€™s important that we look at different groupsâ€¦and those that are suffering most in the labor market.â€? EDGE OF HER SEAT: Â With the hearing stretching past the 1 p.m.Â ending that was expected, weâ€™re treated to the sight of Ms. Yellen picking up her papers and putting them into her bagâ€”while answering questions from the second-to-last questioner. For the final questioner, the bag has moved from her lap to her desk. We donâ€™t know about her, but this is how we were feeling a half-hour ago: POLITICAL CHALLENGES:Â A brief concluding thought:Â two new and distinct political challenges emerged from this hearing. The first is the Fed’s interest on reserves tool. It’s clear that a number of members of Congress have reservations about how this policy works as well as some misunderstandings about it. The second is the potential for negative interest rates. Members of Congress tried to pin the Fed down on whether it actually has the legal authority to do this, which suggests there’s concern about this policy. The irony here is that IOER is a tool for tightening policy while negative rates are a tool for loosening it and the sentiment from Congress seems to be leaning toward constraining the Fed in both directions. It’s clear the Fed has its work cut out for it in explaining its policies here. THE END: We came into this expecting lots of chatter about a global economic slowdown and a potential Fed pause. The hearing somehow turned out to be more about the Fedâ€™s tools, bank regulation and people left behind in the labor market. There were certainly some key questions about the shaky economic outlook and negative interest rates. But, as usual, Ms. Yellen found a way to deal with them without backing herself into a corner. Saying the same thing over and over again may derail a presidential candidate trying to win a popularity contest. But it works pretty well for a central banker. (Yes, ahem, Janet Yellen knows exactly what sheâ€™s doing.) Thatâ€™s all from here. Thanks for joining us.

Monetary policy has become the ultimate crutch of modern but unresponsive political power. It buys time with fiat money and time is power in the politics game of win the day. And since win the day is very much a courtroom game too, it extends to all facets life and rule making. It helps to have useful expert witness idiots like Krugman on call to periodically reinforce the game rationale with the powerless class. So much for Fed independence. Janet appears to have graduated from the same Obama boot camp on dismissing inconvenient Congressional requests for information and FOIA requests as all the other political appointees at IRS, EPA, and others. Mrs Yellen taking shots from both sides of the aisle...  Congress expects her to fix the negative impacts of bad tax and regulatory policy by instituting even worse monetary policy.  Won't work. Did race just get involved in this conversation?  Pathetic joke.  Al Sharpton as Fed Chair.  Does this moron know what the Fed does?  This guy is so out of his depth. Requesting an African American being one of the regional governors on the spot?  WTF.  If you want to break the financial system, go for it! Feckless Fed should have never robbed retirees in the first place, now has no choice but to continue the stupid zero interest policies.
