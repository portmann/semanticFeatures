Grand Central: What Weâ€™ve Learned from Yellen and Fischer  - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserveâ€™s top two leaders â€“ Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer â€“ have spoken extensively in the past few days about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. Here is a quick summation of what we have learned: THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY: Ms. Yellen in her comments in Rhode Island last week said, â€œgrowth in many other parts of the global economy, including China and some other emerging market economies, has slowed. Weak growth abroad, together with its accompanying implications for exchange rates, has dented U.S. exports and weighed on our economy.â€? She expects the headwind to abate, but Mr. Fischer, in his comments in Tel Aviv, Israel acknowledged slow global growth could have implications for U.S. monetary policy. â€œIf foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise,â€? he said. THEY STILL SEE THE FED RAISING RATES THIS YEAR, BUT THEYâ€™RE IN NO HURRY TO START OR TO FOLLOW-THROUGH ONCE STARTED: Ms. Yellen said she still expected to raise rates this year, but this would be a slow-moving process. â€œThe (Fedâ€™s) objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be achieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several years before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer-run level,â€? Ms. Yellen said. Mr. Fischer appears quite focused on getting monetary policy back to the way it used to be. â€œThe cumulative effects over half of a decade of the extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks will need to be unwound in the coming years as the U.S. and other economies make progress toward economic recovery,â€? he said. Still, in separate comments in Herzliya, Israel, he emphasized the gradual, go-slow message. THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS AND WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THEY START RAISING SHORT-TERM RATES:Â  Mr. Fischer spoke at length about the 2013 â€œtaper tantrumâ€? when markets went into spasms globally â€“ marked by rising interest rates and falling stock prices â€“ as the Fed openly talked about ending its bond buying programs. â€œThe actual raising of policy rates could trigger further bouts of volatility,â€? he warned in Tel Aviv. The best antidote to another market tantrum, they hope, is telegraphing their thinking. â€œWe have done everything we can, within the limits of forecast uncertainty, to prepare market participants for what lies ahead.â€? LIKE SOME OF THE REST OF US, THEY ARE TIRING OF THE MARKETâ€™S OBSESSION WITH THE DATE OF THE FIRST MOVE: Mr. Fischer said observers focus too much on when the FedÂ will start raising its benchmark short-term rate from near zero, and instead should think more about where interest rates are headed over time. â€œThere is so much importance given to the first move. But I think itâ€™s misleading,â€? he said at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. â€œYou say liftoff and you think of rocketsâ€? that go into orbit after 10 seconds, he said. â€œThatâ€™s not what weâ€™re talking about.â€? Fischer: Weak Growth Could Delay Rate Increases. The Federal Reserve could take a slower approach to raising interest rates if weaker-than-expected growth overseas affects the U.S. economy, Fed Vice ChairmanÂ  Stanley Fischer Â said in remarks prepared for a speech in Tel Aviv. Â Mr. Fischer also said the Fed isnâ€™t the worldâ€™s central bank and must first and foremost pursue its domestic objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Fed Regional Banks Run in Place on Discount Rate. The primary credit rate, the interest rate on short-term loans offered to sound banks through the Fedâ€™s discount window, has been 0.75% since February 2010. Most of the 12 regional reserve banks want to keep it there, according to minutes released Tuesday. Ahead of Fed Board of Governors meetings on March 30, April 13 and April 27, directors at four regional reserve banksâ€“Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and Philadelphiaâ€“ called for raising the rate to 1% while Minneapolis Fed directors called for a cut to 0.5%. Itâ€™s the latest sign that opinions within the Fed are divided as the debate heats up over whether to begin raising the broader federal funds rate. â€“Dow Jones Newswires. Fedâ€™s Yellen Plans to Skip This Yearâ€™s Jackson Hole Conference. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen plans to skip the central bankâ€™s high-profile conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this year. Ms. Yellen â€œdoes not plan to attend the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas Cityâ€™s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in August,â€? a Fed spokesperson said Tuesday. â€œHowever, she looks forward to participating in the symposium from time to time in future years as part of a public speaking schedule that includes a wide variety of venues and events.â€? Fedâ€™s Jeffrey Lacker Still Undecided on June Rate Rise. Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said Tuesday he still hasnâ€™t decided whether to vote for an interest-rate increase at the central bankâ€™s June 16-17 meeting. Weak economic data during the first quarterâ€”and a shaky start to the secondâ€”have pushed back market expectations for Fed rate rises toward the end of the year, with estimates converging around September . Mr. Lacker also said theÂ Federal Reserve and other financial regulators have yet to adequately deal with the problem of banks that are viewed as too big to fail . Hansson: QE Could Delay Government Reforms. Large-scale bond purchases by the European Central Bank may spur governments to build up debt without taking needed steps to overhaul their economies, Ardo Hansson, a member of the European Central Bankâ€™s governing council said Tuesday. He added that he was mostly talking about so-called moral hazard risks: in a situation where interest rates are low, some governments may feel less motivated to go through with reforms that are necessary to ensure long-term economic growth. Greece Didnâ€™t Ask for Increase in ECB Emergency Liquidity.Â Greeceâ€™s central bank did not request an increase to the amount of money Greek banks can borrow under an emergency lending program by the European Central Bank, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as tense negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors continue. BOJ Minutes Show Continued Rift Among Board Members. Debate heated up among the Bank of Japanâ€™s policy board members in late April over the BOJâ€™s 2.0% inflation target and commitment to defeat deflation, highlighting a lingering rift among the members as the inflation rate has sagged to around 0%. Canadian Central Bank Expected to Hold Rates Steady. Canadaâ€™s central bank is likely to keep interest rates steady through the next several months as it waits to see if its expectations for a stronger second half come to fruition, according to economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal. Brazil Central Bank President Vows to Lower Inflation. Brazilâ€™s Central Bank PresidentÂ Alexandre Tombini reaffirmed on Tuesday his pledge to drive down inflation to the official target by December 2016. The bank will keep trying to bring the inflation rate to 4.5%, from the current 8.2% level, Mr. Tombini said in opening remarks at his twice-a-year hearing at the congressional Budget Committee. Hungaryâ€™s Central Bank Cuts Rate. The National Bank of Hungary lowered its main monetary policy rate to 1.65% from 1.80% and reiterated its pledge to keep reducing rates. “Cautious easing of the policy rate may continue as long as it supports the achievement of the medium-term inflation target,” the nine-member rate-setting panel said in a statement after the decision.â€“Dow Jones Newswires Bank of Russia Committed to Make Further Rate Cuts. Russia is committed to make further reductions in interest rates, the central bank’s First Deputy Chairman said Tuesday. “We hope that the circumstances will allow us to do it [cut rates] further,” Dmitry Tulin said, Interfax news agency reported. The central bank has cut rates three times this year, bringing the key rate to 12.5%.â€“Dow Jones Newswires Home Prices Continue to Climb. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 4.1% in the 12 months ended in March, slightly weaker than a 4.2% increase in February. The 10-city and 20-city indexes saw similar year-over-year increases in March as in February. -10 a.m. EDT: Bank of Canada releases a policy statement RESEARCH Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Inequality Between and Within Firms. Earnings inequality has increased greatly in the U.S. over the past three decades, but primarily because of rising differences in pay between firms , not growing gaps within them, according toÂ  a new working paper Â published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.Â In other words, the pay gap is rising not because the top earners within a firm are being paid so much more than their lower-paid colleagues. Itâ€™s climbing because some firms pay a lot more than others, and the employees at those firms get paid a lot more than the workers at lower-paying firms. Donâ€™t Blame the Millenials. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta â€™s Elora Raymond and Jessica Dill argue that the drop in first-time home purchases is not due to the younger generationâ€™s reluctance to buy a home. â€œIn general, we find that the age distribution of first-time homebuyers has become younger, not older, since the crisis. We also found that the dramatic fall in purchases varies much more strongly across states than by age. The preliminary figures suggest that housing market and local economic conditions may explain as much or more of the decline in first-time homebuyers than a generational divide.â€? The New Normal for Monetary Policy. Olivier Blanchard , the International Monetary Fundâ€™s outgoing chief economist , reports in VoxEU on the lessons from last monthâ€™s IMF monetary policy conference. Among the many takeaways are his thoughts on the recent low equilibrium real interest rates. â€œIf equilibrium real interest rates really are going to be negative, the zero lower bound (or, as we have learned, the â€˜nearly zeroâ€™ lower bound) may make this impossible to achieve,â€? he writes. â€œEven if they are positive but close to zero, and if low interest rates lead to excessive risk taking, this may create very tough trade-offs for monetary policy. Instead, fiscal policy may be a more appropriate tool for dealing with the new normal.â€? Are prices higher today than a year ago or lower? That depends on who you are . Business Spending Picks Up. Orders for durable goodsâ€”products such as power saws and hot tubs designed to last at least three yearsâ€” declined a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in April from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, overall orders declined 1.3% in April. Portugal Central Bank Warns of Low Interest Rate Risks. Portugal’s central bank on Tuesday said policies to keep interest rates low could backfire, leading banks and investors to take more risk than they can handle.â€”Dow Jones Newswires Slovak Central Bank Orders Extra Capital Buffers on Five Big Lenders. Slovakia’s central bank Tuesday said that five local lenders, including units of Belgium KBC NV Group (KBC.BT), Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), Austria’s Raiffeisenbank Bank International (RBI.VI) and Erste Group Bank (EBS.VI) are key for the country’s financial market and set individual capital buffers for them against potential risks.â€“Dow Jones Newswires. CORRECTION: Goldman Sachs economist Jan HatziusÂ argues growth and productivity statistics have been understated, and inflation overstated. An early version of the Take in Tuesdayâ€™s newsletter incorrectly said he argues inflation had been understated. SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
