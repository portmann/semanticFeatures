Riksbank Sees Increased Risks to Swedish Financial System - Real Time Economics - WSJ Risks to the health of the Swedish economy and financial system have increased as a result of households’ continued debt buildup, and authorities urgently need to implement reforms to reverse the trend, the Swedish central bank said in its twice yearly financial stability report. Sweden’s financial system is currently working well but the risks of external shocks have grown recently as low interest rates have fueled investors’ demand for more high-risk assets and encouraged households to continue borrowing, the central bank, known as the Riksbank, said. The country’s four largest banks are all closely interlinked and highly dependent on market funding, with a small share of capital in relation to assets, making them vulnerable to outside pressures. The Riksbank said the resilience of Swedish banks needs to be strengthened and proposed that the financial regulator further tighten capital requirements and that banks reduce their liquidity risks. Lawmakers should also take steps to discourage household borrowing, including changes to tax relief, reforms to increase the supply of housing and the introduction of an amortization requirement, the bank said. Limiting the amount of debt borrowers can take on in relation to their level of income may also complement the current 85% loan cap on the value of a home, it said. Sweden’s central bank has long sought to prevent a housing bubble by keeping interest rates higher than many economists said were justified, given the county’s lackluster inflation. Changing course, it began slashing rates sharply about a year ago, hitting minus 0.25% in March–a level that’s no longer keeping a brake on household borrowing. In April, property prices rose 13% on the year. The ratio of household debt to disposable income is currently above 170%, a historically high level.
