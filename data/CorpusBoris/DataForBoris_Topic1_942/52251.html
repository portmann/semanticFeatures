Malaysia Central Bank Keeps Overnight Policy Rate Unchanged - Real Time Economics - WSJ Malaysia’s central bank Thursday kept its overnight policy rate unchanged at 3.25%, as resilient domestic demand continued to power economic growth while inflation remained contained. All 13 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted the decision by Bank Negara Malaysia’s monetary-policy committee at the third of its scheduled six meetings this year. The central bank has kept the benchmark rate steady since July 2014, when it was raised by 0.25 percentage point. “At the current level of the overnight policy rate, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity,” Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement. While the risks of destabilizing “financial imbalances are contained,” the central bank said it will continue to monitor these riks, including external and domestic developments that could impact inflation and the Malaysian economy. “Looking ahead, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand remaining as the key driver of growth,” it said. Gross domestic product is set to expand 4.5%-5.5% this year, according to an official government forecast, slowing from 6.0% in 2014. On inflation, the central bank said lower global commodity and energy prices could partially offset any impact from the so-called goods and services tax enforced last month. Still, headline inflation is expected to “trend higher,” the central bank said. The government expects inflation to range between 2.5% and 3.5% compared with 2014?s 3.2%.
