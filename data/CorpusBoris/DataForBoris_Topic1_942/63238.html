A New, Lower Normal for Fed Rates? Fed Officials’ Lively Debate - Real Time Economics - WSJ Fed officials debated whether there is a lower, ‘new normal’ level of neutral interest rates at their April meeting, minutes showed.Â  J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/ASSOCIATED PRESS Did the financial crisis and Great Recession permanently slow the U.S. economyâ€™s growth potential, thereby lowering the point at which the Federal Reserveâ€™s benchmark interest rate should be considered neutral? Fed officials waded into this debate at their April policy meeting, but there was little agreement, according to minutes of the discussions released Wednesday. The concept of the â€œequilibriumâ€? rate of interest is esoteric but important for Fed officials as they consider how much to raise their benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, from near zero in coming years. The minutes defined the equilibrium rate as the level of the fed funds rate, adjusted for inflation, â€œrate consistent with the economy achieving, over a specified time horizon, maximum employment and price stability.â€? Fed officials admitted that estimating the equilibrium rate is a highly uncertain exercise. â€œSome participants reported that their estimates were currently unusually low by historical standards, reflecting, for example, factors weighing persistently on aggregate demand,â€? the minutes said. Some of the officials at the meeting suggested that if the equilibrium rate were indeed lower than in the past, that might justify more Fed measures to stimulate the economy, and provide a reason for waiting longer before raising the benchmark rate, the minutes showed. â€œIn light of their low estimates, a few of these participants questioned whether the Committee was providing sufficient accommodation at the present time and cautioned against initiating policy firming in the near future,â€? they said.
