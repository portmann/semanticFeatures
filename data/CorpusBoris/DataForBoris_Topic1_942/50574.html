Kocherlakota: First-Quarter Economic Softness Is ‘Matter for Concern’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ MARSHALL, Minn. â€”Soft economic data in the first three months of 2015 should give Federal Reserve officials pause when it comes to raising interest rates, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said Tuesday. “It’s only one quarter, and you don’t make policy based on three months of data, but it is a matter for concern,” Mr. Kocherlakota said at a public forum here. The Commerce Department earlier on Tuesday reported that the U.S. trade deficit widened in March . “Once those [numbers] are folded into estimates for real gross domestic product, we’re probably going to be in a negative situation in the first quarter, meaning that real gross domestic product actually contracted in the first quarter,” Mr. Kocherlakota said. The Commerce Department in April said GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, expanded in the first quarter at a weak 0.2% annual rate . The agency will release a revised GDP estimate in late May. Most Fed officials expect to begin raising their benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been pinned near zero since December 2008, sometime this year. The central bank in April cited “transitory factors” in explaining the economy’s winter slowdown. Mr. Kocherlakota, however, has repeatedly argued that the Fed shouldn’t raise rates in 2015, often pointing to subdued U.S. inflation that has undershot the Fed’s 2% annual target for nearly three years. The U.S. central bank “can best achieve its objectives…by keeping the fed-funds rate target at its current level during this calendar year,” Mr. Kocherlakota said. In April, he specifically said that the Fed should instead begin to raise rates in the second half of 2016 .
