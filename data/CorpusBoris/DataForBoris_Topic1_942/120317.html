Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s Report to Congress â€” Live Analysis - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet YellenÂ started two days of hearings with lawmakers WednesdayÂ to deliver the central bank’s semiannual report to Congress. On deck for the Fed chief: a discussion of the first rate increase since 2006, expected later this year, and perhaps some tension with Congress as lawmakers grumble about the central bank. Ms. Yellen’s testimony was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, followed by a gathering of the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. See our recap below. Yellen Sees U.S. on Path to Raise Interest Rates This Year Janet Yellen opens two days of testimony on Capitol Hill facing two difficult environments: a U.S. economy that is not fully cooperating with the Fedâ€™s hopes, and many U.S. lawmakers who feel the Fed is not fully cooperating with Congress. Weâ€™re here to track how the Fed chief navigates through those two fronts today. We get Ms.Â  Yellenâ€™s testimony at 8:30 a.m., along with the Fedâ€™s semi-annual monetary policy report . A hearing of the House Financial Services Committee follows at 10 a.m. (Sheâ€™ll head to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday afternoon for an encore performance.)Â  THE TESTIMONY IS OUT:Â  The key headline is simple. Ms. Yellen says economic conditions are â€œlikelyâ€? to justify a rate increase later this year. Itâ€™s not all that different from her speech in Cleveland last week. Hereâ€™s the money line: â€œIf the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.â€?Â  The main story by our Fed team:Â  Yellen Sees U.S. on Path to Raise Interest Rates This Year WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT CHAOS OVERSEAS?Â Those developments â€œpose some risks to U.S. growth.,â€? Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony says. While the eurozone recovery â€œappears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains difficult,â€? she said. China, she said, â€œcontinues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets and volatile financial conditions.â€? On the bright side, Ms. Yellen said growth overseas â€œcould also pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for U.S. economy activity.â€? The discussion of foreign affairs came after Ms. Yellen glossed over overseas developments in her speech last Friday in Cleveland.Â  WHATâ€™S THE FED WORRIED ABOUT IN THE U.S.?Â Officials used the opportunity, in their semi-annual monetary policy report, to highlight rapidly rising commercial real estate prices as an area of concern amid broadly moderating risks to the U.S. financial system.Â  â€œValuation pressures in commercial real estate are rising as commercial property prices continue to increase rapidly, and underwriting standards at banks and in commercial mortgage-backed securities have been loosening,â€? the central bank said in a semiannual report to Congress.Â Overall, financial vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system have moderated since the start of the year, the Fed report said.Â  ITâ€™S THE PATH THAT MATTERS: In her 18 months at the top of your central bank, Ms. Yellen has tried to be particularly disciplined in communicating for her colleagues. She also has tried to avoid spooking markets. The key section of her testimony on the Fedâ€™s monetary-policy outlook shows that, where she emphasized (as she did in her press conference last month) that you should stop worrying about that first rate increase. Itâ€™s all about that path that matters. And the path should go down much more easily for markets. The full paragraph from her testimony (bolding is ours): A decision by the Committee to raise its target range for the federal funds rate will signal how much progress the economy has made in healing from the trauma of the financial crisis. That said, the importance of the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target should not be overemphasized. What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire expected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the federal funds rate. Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In the projections prepared for our June meeting, most FOMC participants anticipated that economic conditions would evolve over time in a way that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the headwinds that still restrain real activity continue to diminish and inflation rises. Of course, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a higher and steeper trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep than currently projected. As always, we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining the Committeeâ€™s dual mandate. OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN OPTIMISM:Â Tuesdayâ€™s weak reading on U.S. retail sales didnâ€™t seem to dent Ms. Yellenâ€™s optimism about American consumers and broader growth. In her prepared testimony, she said GDP appears to have rebounded to a moderate growth pace in the second quarter. â€œNotably, consumer spending has picked up, and sales of motor vehicles in May and June were strong, suggesting that many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items,â€? she said. In general, she said, â€œprospects are favorable for further improvement in the U.S. labor market and the economy more broadly.â€?Â  INFLATION STAYING LOW FOR NOW:Â  Ms. Yellen acknowledged that inflation continues to undershoot the central bankâ€™s 2% annual target. She cited the Fedâ€™s preferred measure, the personal-consumption expenditures price index. â€œTo a significant extent, the recent low readings on total PCE inflation reflect influences that are likely to be transitory, particularly the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of non-energy imported goods,â€? she said. But while energy prices â€œappear to have stabilized recently,â€? she said the annual change in the PCE price index â€œis likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term.â€? YELLEN ON TRANSPARENCY:Â Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony includes three large paragraphs under the heading â€œFederal Reserve transparency and accountability,â€? making the case to Congress that the Fed is not an opaque and uncontrollable institution.Â As our colleagues Kate Davidson and Victoria McGrane explained in yesterdayâ€™s paper, the Fedâ€™sÂ  relationship with Congress is really tense right now . Close watchers of the Fed will notice that the name of this section of her speech resembles the name of a piece of legislation: the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act or FRAT Act. The FRAT Act is just one of the current congressional proposals that the Fed views as a threat to its independence.Â  When it comes to transparency, Ms. Yellenâ€™s bottom line is this: â€œEfforts to further increase transparency, no matter how well intentioned, must avoid unintended consequences that could undermine the Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to make policy in the long-run best interest of American families and businesses.â€? Itâ€™s a safe bet Congress wonâ€™t be satisfied with Ms. Yellenâ€™s remarks here. Her testimony didnâ€™t address a possible leak of confidential information from a September 2012 policy meeting. Republicans have been pushing the Fed to reveal more information about its internal probe into the leak. If Ms. Yellen has anything new to share today, she didnâ€™t put it in her written remarks. THE EVOLUTION OF VULNERABILITY:Â Last year, the Fed began using its monetary policy report to offer an overall assessment of U.S. vulnerability. Hereâ€™s how that statement has evolved over the past four reports. Today: Â â€?Financial vulnerabilities in the United States overall have remained moderate since the previous Monetary Policy Report.â€? February 24, 2015: â€œThe vulnerability of the U.S. financial system to financial instability has remained moderate, primarily reflecting low-to-moderate levels of leverage and maturity transformation.â€? July 15, 2014: â€œWith respect to financial stability, signs of risk-taking that could leave segments of the U.S. financial sector vulnerable to possible adverse events have increased modestly this year, albeit from a subdued level.â€? WHY ARE YOU SO LUCKY? Â You might be asking yourself why youâ€™re being treated to this exciting written testimony from Ms. Yellen at 8:30 a.m., a full 90 minutes before the gavel strikes to open the hearing. (You were asking yourself that, right? Just say yes.) A number of events over the years have brought us to this point. The big one: Lawmakers and their aides have complained about not having time to read the testimony and monetary policy report when itâ€™s released at 10 a.m. for the hearing. That means their staffs may have written questions to prep them based on old information. (If youâ€™ve seen lawmakers reading questions from a script, thatâ€™s the result of pure staff work.) So now, if you see lawmakers with terrible questions based on old information, that means they (or their aides) werenâ€™t doing their homework in this 90-minute span.Â  LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION:Â In recent years, the labor-force participation rate has shriveled, and economists have hotly debated the reasons why. The massive baby boomer generationâ€”the children born after the end of World War IIâ€”have been entering retirement age, pushing down the share of the population in the labor force. But some workers have also been giving up on the labor force because the economy is simply so bad. Last year, a group of Fed economists estimated the demographic trend: Thatâ€™s displayed in the red line in this interesting little chart from todayâ€™sÂ  Monetary Policy Report . The actual labor-force participation rate is displayed in blue. In 2013 and 2014, this blue line was further below the red line, but in 2015 the two have gotten much closer. That means the Fed believes the labor-force participation rate is getting closer to normal. The lower level of participation is starting to mostly reflect the nationâ€™s aging demographics, according to this chart. The chart also includes an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, suggesting that labor-force participation should be a bit higher than the Fedâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed too, but not by as much. To be clear, Fed officials donâ€™t think itâ€™s back to normal yet. â€œThere is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of any additional labor market slack represented by each of these elements. However, it seems likely that they do reflect additional slack not measured by the unemployment rate, which should also be considered when judging how far employment is from its maximum sustainable level,â€? the report says. DOWNPLAYING AT LEAST ONE RISK: Fed officials arenâ€™t too concerned about risks in global bond markets, which some investors and banks have been warning are prone to shocks because decreased trading volumes could make it harder to clear big transactions. In the Fedâ€™s monetary policy report to Congress, the central bank published a review of bond-market liquidity and concluded that it hadnâ€™t seen â€œnotable deteriorationâ€? in U.S. Treasury or corporate bond markets. It is the second report out on bond market liquidity this week. The Fed joined other financial regulatory agenciesâ€“including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Treasury Departmentâ€“earlier in the week in signing off on a review of bond markets with similar conclusions . Still, the Fed said it was watching developments in bond markets closely.Â  DIRECT VS. INDIRECT RISKS FROM GREECE:Â As the Greek government tries to secure a new bailout, the Fed said in its report to Congress thatÂ U.S. banksâ€™ exposure to the crisis in Greece is limitedâ€”though theyâ€™re not without risk. â€œLarge banking firmsâ€™ direct net exposures to Greece are low, although financial vulnerabilities from the situation could become more concerning if large European counterparties were weakened by a significant deterioration in peripheral European countries,â€? the central bank said. At 10 a.m., youâ€™d normally see a wave of market excitement off the testimony. But the testimony came at 8:30 a.m., for reasons we explained earlier. The 10 a.m. start gets the lawmakers and Ms. Yellen in their seats. First, weâ€™ll get opening remarks from a number of top members of the House Financial Services Committee. A couple of them will have some sharp words, for reasons weâ€™ve explained in recent days . Then weâ€™ll see Ms. Yellen read the testimony youâ€™ve already seen. Then hours of fun back-and-forth from your lawmakers. ITâ€™S ON: The hearing is opening with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) diving right in. He has some sharp words about the Dodd-Frank law and Fed monetary policy that he callsÂ â€?amorphous, opaque and improvisational.â€? THE VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HEARING ROOM: The Republican side of the aisle is heavily populated, not so many Democrats. This has the making for a hearing with fireworks and tension. YELLENâ€™S READING VOICE: Weâ€™ve had the joy of sitting here over the years listening to three Fed chairs. Ms. Yellen seems the least bored in reading her written testimony. Alan Greenspan had a whole strategy around it, as we saw with the impenetrable language he often used. Ben Bernanke never embraced the theater of it allâ€”one reason lawmakers liked him personallyâ€”and just read it because he had to actually utter the words he wrote. Ms. Yellen looks like sheâ€™s trying to bring in pauses and emphasis at the right moments, even when sheâ€™s discussing PCE inflation. WHEREâ€™S THE VICE CHAIR OF SUPERVISION?Â The chair of the Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, started out todayâ€™s question-and-answer session by asking Ms. Yellen about why thereâ€™s not a Fed vice chairman of supervision. This job was created by the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, but President Barack Obama has never attempted to appoint anyone to the seat. So Mr. Hensarling asked Ms. Yellen if sheâ€™d be willing to testify on regulation and supervision until that seat is filled. Ms. Yellen said she would, which is good news for Fed reporters: that means we could be in for twice as much testimony from Ms. Yellen before these committees! REP. HENSARLING TO YELLEN: IGNORING SUBPOENA IS â€˜INEXCUSABLEâ€™: Read more from the comments of the committee chair Â this morning criticizing the Fedâ€™s response to his committeeâ€™s subpoena related to an allegedÂ leak of confidential information and a subsequent internal Fed investigation. PREDATORY LENDING: Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Ms. Yellen about the higher interest rates charged to minority borrowers, even with similar credit scores.Â  In response, Ms. Yellen pointed to the Fedâ€™s bank supervision role. The downturn â€œwas particularly punishing to African-Americans and to lower-skilled workers more broadly,â€? she said, adding that a stronger economy would benefit black workers and other minority groups. A YELLEN RULE? Â Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.) pressed Ms. Yellen on why the Fed isnâ€™t adopting a policy rule to guide its monetary policy decisions. The most famous of these rules, the Taylor Rule, uses the rate of inflation and the output gap, to calculate where interest rates should be. Mr. Huizenga wants the Fed to adopt a rule, like the Taylor Rule, to make policy more predictable. He even suggested she call it the â€œYellen Rule.â€? â€œI do not agree a rules-based policy is a better way to go,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œThereâ€™s not a single central bank in the world that would follow a rule that relies on only two variables.â€? Ms. Yellen argued that Fed policy is systematic. The Fed is systematically trying to fulfill its dual mandate of stable prices (that is, 2% inflation) and full employment (currently estimated as an unemployment rate about 5% to 5.2%). But an uncomplicated policy rule, Ms. Yellen said, is too simplistic for all the variables in the economy faced by the Fed. LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS. Rep. Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, pressed Ms.Â Yellen on market liquidity. He pointed to an analysis saying a problem is developing in liquidity. Ms. Yellen demurred. â€œItâ€™s not clear whether there is or is not a problem,â€? she said, adding that itâ€™s a question that needs further study. GOLD STAR: Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.) wins the award today for going straight for actual questions about actual monetary policy.Â  She also wins the award for efficiency, getting more out of her five minutes than any other member. Hereâ€™s how Ms. Yellen weighed in on some of the questions. â€¢ Troubles in Greece and China: The Fed looks at international developments â€œvery carefully in developing our forecasts.â€? If something changes the Fedâ€™s forecast, then it would affect monetary policy. â€¢ The rate path: Earlier rate increases mean a more gradual rate path. Waiting longer means the Fed might have to raise them faster.Â â€?The entire path of rate increases does matter,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€¢ Does the Fed need a press conference to raise rates? No!Â â€?Iâ€™ve tried to emphasize that every meeting is a live meeting,â€? Ms. Yellen said, noting that the central bank has prepped the media for procedures to do a phone briefing if necessary after a meeting that does not include a press conference. MORTGAGES: Ms.Â Yellen told Rep. Lacy Clay (D., Mo.) that the Dodd-Frank law has â€œcertainlyâ€? tightened mortgage standards and suggested that may be excluding some people from homeownership. â€œIt may be that the steps weâ€™ve taken are having some unintended consequences and we need to work on that,â€? she said. OPERATION CHOKE POINT: Missouri Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer just hit Ms. Yellen with a series of questions about Operation Choke Point, a Justice Department-led initiative that seeks to crack down on payday lenders in particular.Â  Ms. Yellen was noncommittal about the Fedâ€™s involvement. Some background on the issue is available here . If anything, the exchange serves as a reminder that Congress is not really that interested in the details of monetary policy. More parochial regulatory issues are much more interesting to many in Congress. STOP BEING POLITE AND START GETTING REAL: Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) heads the oversight subcommittee, and he jumped straight into it on the Fed leak investigation. He wanted to know why Ms. Yellen and the Fed think theyâ€™re allowed to withhold documents sought by the House committee. â€œI would like to know the legal authority that you have,â€? Mr. Duffy said. This got a bit testy (at least for the Fed world), a remarkable use of five minutes by the congressman to make a point and attempt to get answers. Ms. Yellen stuck to her script here, of course. â€œThis matter is the subject of an open criminal investigation,â€? she said. The Fed will give the documents later, but not during the Justice Department investigation. Seeing a lawmaker and a Fed chair try to dissect an incredibly dense set of details in a matter of seconds â€” about what the Fedâ€™s inspector general and general counsel did years ago â€” is not all that productive from an information-gathering perspective. But the point was being made. â€œYouâ€™re not bound by the IG,â€? Mr. Duffy said. â€œYouâ€™re not bound by the DOJ.â€? They walked through every step of this â€” a remarkable use of a five-minute exchange â€” but neither one yielded any ground about the documents or anything else. â€œWeâ€™ve said we plan to give them to you as soon as weâ€™re able to do so and not compromise an open criminal investigation,â€? Ms. Yellen said. Mr. Duffy said the Fed is the one jeopardizing an investigation here. â€œIf anyone is trying to sweep this under the rug, it is the Fed.â€? A RISING TIDE:Â Asked when the Fedâ€™s policies will be more broadly felt in wages, Ms. Yellen said, essentially, itâ€™s just a matter of time before that rising tide lifts more and more people in the labor market. So far there are â€œtentative signs that wage growth is increasing,â€? she said. â€œItâ€™s been running at a very slow pace but there are often lags between improvement in the labor market and a pickup in wage growth.â€? Asked if thereâ€™s any policies from Congress that could be a big help, Ms. Yellen was quick to identify one in particular: education. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES:Â Rep. Stephen Fincher (R., Tenn.) asked Ms. Yellen about doing a cost-benefit analysis on the Dodd-Frank law. Requiring regulators to conduct cost-benefit analyses before putting rules in place is a favorite request among Republicans. Ms. Yellen, however, was not convinced. â€œIt would be difficult to do that,â€? she said. Â Mr. Fincher also asked about raising rates in a weakening economy. Here, Ms. Yellen tried to put him at ease. â€œWeâ€™re not going to raise rates if we think itâ€™s going to tip the economy into a recession,â€? she said. NO â€˜CONTEMPTâ€™: The Hillâ€™s Pete Schroeder notes on Twitter that while Reps. Hensarling and Duffy got very aggressive with Ms. Yellen on the leak probe, neither uttered the word â€œcontemptâ€? â€“ that is whether their next step is to push to hold Ms. Yellen in contempt of Congress. When asked in an interview last week about this possibility, Mr.Â  Hensarling declined to directly answer , saying instead, â€œWe want the chair to tell the truth. We want the Federal Reserve to produce the documents they are legally obligated to produce.â€?Â  So Duffy and Hensarling lay into Yellen for refusing to comply with subpoena, but no one has uttered the “contempt” word yet. CURRENCY MANIPULATION: Â Rep. Bill Foster (D., Ill.) dug into an important issue, around currency provisions tied to trade, but one that gets into the black hole of international monetary policy. He asked Ms. Yellen: Is there anything you did that would have triggered the definition of currency manipulation from the International Monetary Fund? Ms. Yellen had a whole answer on this stuff, built around the background of the G-7 and G-20. This is where U.S. officials often get tied into knots. But their point is simple: Actions designed to move currencies simply for boosting international trade (through a weaker currency) probably is currency manipulation. Actions designed to benefit a domestic economy more broadly is not. She danced around the IMF language (perhaps because the IMFâ€™s language is hardly clear-cut), but she had a larger point for Congress. â€œI would worry about any type of legislation that could cripple monetary policy from achieving the objectives that Congress has assigned us.â€?Â  REFORM FANNIE AND FREDDIE:Â The financial crisis and the collapse of several major Wall Street banks led Congress to take up the Dodd-Frank Act that substantially overhauled the nationâ€™s banking regulations. But the housing crisis and collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac never led to Congress actually passing any reforms or overhauls of these so-called government-sponsored enterprises that underpin the entire U.S. mortgage system. Ms. Yellen said Fannie and Freddie need to be addressed. â€œIt would be desirable to see Congress address GSE reform and decide explicitly, self-consciously, what is the role of the government ,â€? she said. One goal, she said, should be to â€œtry to bring private capital back in the mortgage market.â€? AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT:Â Ohio Democrat Joyce Beatty pointed to the continuing high unemployment rate among African-Americans , which stood at 9.5% in June, higher than the national average of 5.3%. â€œThere isnâ€™t anything directly that the Federal Reserve can do to affect unemployment among groups,â€? Ms. Yellen replied. The Fedâ€™s role, she said, is â€œto achieve a situation where jobs are broadly available in the economy to those who want to work.â€? And the Fed canâ€™t push too hard on employment, she added, or it risks pushing up inflation. Beatty also asked Ms. Yellen to follow up on her earlier comment that Congress could take more action to address inequality. Ms. Yellen, however, did not take the opportunity to give lawmakers a to-do list, instead sticking to generalities. â€œCertainly education and training are matters that are within Congressâ€™ domain,â€? she said. â€œInfrastructure, capital formation, entrepreneurship affect trends in inequality.â€? THE U.S. vs. GREECE : Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.) did one of those local news-style segues, using Greeceâ€™s incredibly crazy situation to raise questions about U.S. debt. But apart from that, the questions are good. Ms. Yellen is on board with the GOP here in at least one way, if you look at the longer run. â€œThe nation faces a very serious debt problem in the years ahead,â€? she said. The debt is on an unsustainable path, partly due to programs such as Social Security and Medicare and related matters. â€œWeâ€™ve known about this for decades and there remains a need for action on that front.â€? The consequences down the road if no action is taken: Higher interest rates along with diminished investment and productivity growth. And that would mean tighter monetary policy to offset that environment. (Weâ€™ll note that Yellen is basically making the same argument Bernanke made for years. A lot of good that did!) SOONER RATHER THAN LATER? Ms.Â Yellen, in an important sequence today, tipped her hand to the benefit of raising short-term interest rates sooner rather than later. If the Fed waits much longer to raise ratesâ€“as some institutions like the IMF want it to doâ€“it might be forced to move aggressively once it starts. However, if it moves sooner, that could allow it to proceed gradually and observe how the economy and markets respond. â€œAn advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases.â€? A gradual path, she added, is a â€œprudent approach to take.â€? That adds weight to the argument the Fed might move rates for the first time in September. THE FASTEST-DYING CITIES:Â Dan Kildee (D.-Mich.) filed a research request to Ms. Yellen: Please have Fed economists look at why so many U.S. cities face so much budget trouble. â€œMunicipal governments of all types are facing enormous stress,â€? he said. Fed researchers should â€œtake a look at the potential employment impacts of the failure of dozens of American cities.â€? Â Mr. Kildee (who represents many beleaguered Michigan manufacturing towns) said having the Fedâ€™s regional banks look at the issue is not enough. â€œWhen itâ€™s looked at from the perspective of a region itâ€™s seen as an anomaly,â€? he said. WHAT IS A CAVEAT?Â Ms. Yellen stuck to her guns in an entertaining back-and-forth with Kentucky Republican Andy Barr on raising interest rates, even though the unemployment rate has dropped below the all-important 6.5% level. â€œDoesnâ€™t the fact that we are below 6.5% unemployment now for almost a year and a half and we still have raised rates, doesnâ€™t that undermine the commitment to transparency and the commitment to communication?â€? Mr. Barr asked. â€œWe never said we intended to raise rates when unemployment fell to 6.5%,â€? Ms. Yellen replied. â€œInstead we said it was a threshold.â€? Mr. Barr: â€œI appreciate the caveats. Youâ€™re very good at caveats.â€? WHEREâ€™S THE WAGE GROWTH: Rep. Patrick Murphy (D., Fla.) gets some credit here for knowing his U-3 from his U-6 measures. He gets Ms. Yellen to discuss why wage growth remains so weak. Itâ€™s slack, through a large number of involuntarily part-time workers and other under-utilization. So that 5.3% unemployment rate is less than meets the eye. ON PUERTO RICO:Â Ms. YellenÂ said the central bank â€œ canâ€™t and shouldnâ€™t be involved inâ€? Puerto Ricoâ€™s municipal debt crisis. â€œI think itâ€™s appropriate for Congress to consider whatâ€™s best to do in this case,â€? she said. Â HOW TO READ CHARTS:Â Keith RothfusÂ (R.-Penn.) used a good chunk of his time questioning Janet Yellen over how to read a chart of GDP. Mr. Rothfus noted that in the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, the nationâ€™s GDP actually shrank. Thatâ€™s trueâ€” GDP declined by 0.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, from the previous quarter. It declined by 2.1% in the first quarter of 2014 from the previous quarter. How, then, Mr. Rothfus asked, could Ms. Yellen explain a chart in which GDP growth was positive over this period? Unfortunately, Mr. Rothfus missed the fact that the chart was clearly labeled â€œyear-over-year.â€? The negative quarters of economic growth were quarterly declines, not annual ones. Those declines were not so enormous that they canceled out the growth of the surrounding quarters. Ms. Yellen suggested she sleeps well. â€œThe economy has improved a great deal and in a way Iâ€™m focused on the economyâ€™s strength, its good performance rather than lying away at night and worrying about another downturn.â€? She did, however, note the â€œdisappointingâ€? productivity growth numbers, which have contributed to the softening of the Fedâ€™s economic growth projections. LETâ€™S TALK ABOUT THE MEANING OF MONEY: Â â€?I have an interest in the distortion in the price of moneyâ€? is a wonderful way to dive into a fascinating topic that cannot possibly be discussed in five minutes. But thatâ€™s what Rep. David Schweikert (R., Ariz.) did.Â  Ms. Yellen took a stab at it: Whether itâ€™s a student or a business or a household looking at the cost of debt or borrowing, they look at the interest theyâ€™ll have to pay but also the other elements. But heâ€™s getting at an even larger issue around disincentives toward saving.Â  The congressman is onto something, but unfortunately the U.S. Congress is not equipped politically to get much done on this front.Â  HOW TO MAKE RETIREES DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY:Â No questions for Ms. Yellen from Brad Sherman (D.-Calif.) who instead told her that he had five minutes to convince her not to raise interest rates until next spring. Many of his reasons were familiar: unemployment is higher than it looks, inflation is too low, and so on. But then he noted that waiting to raise rates could pave the way to make retirees â€œdeliriously happy.â€? If youâ€™re a retiree and you have 0% inflation and 1% interest rates, then â€œyouâ€™re living on 1% because you psychologically cannot invade your principal,â€? he said. But imagine taking that same retiree, waiting to raise rates until inflation rises, and giving them a world with 3% inflation and 4% interest rates. Yes, to an economist or accountant, the purchasing power of your money is rising by exactly the same amount, Mr. Sherman said, but â€œeveryone else lives in a nominal world.â€? If retirees have 4% interest rates and 3% inflation rates they will be â€œdeliriously happy,â€? he said. And donâ€™t forget, as Mr. Sherman highlighted, it may not be in the Fedâ€™s dual mandate, but it is in the Declaration of Independence: â€œA desire for happiness.â€? â€˜OUR ECONOMY STINKSâ€™:Â Rep. Scott Tipton (R., Colo.), like several Republicans before him, sounded concerned about the continued low interest rate regime. â€œWhat youâ€™re really saying is our economy stinks right now,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™re just not seeing more movement.â€? Ms. Yellen, in response, noted that rates are about to rise. â€œA decision on our part to raise rates will say no, the economy doesnâ€™t stink. Weâ€™re close to where we want to be.â€? SOFTBALL TIME: Â Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.) had some fun here with a few softballs. Is regulation the economyâ€™s problem? Â What about Dodd-Frank? (Ms. Yellen, with a long answer about regulation and financial stability, of course essentially says no.) Â Is the CFPB the problem? Â (No, itâ€™s designed to enhance consumer protection.) STUDENT-DEBT WOES: Ms. Yellen said sheâ€™s worried about high levels of student debt, which she noted canâ€™t be written off in bankruptcy. On the other hand, Ms. Yellen said it is â€œcritically importantâ€? to make sure students have access to quality education to get aheadâ€“but they should know what theyâ€™re getting into. â€œThey need good information about programs and their success rates in order to avoid mistakes,â€? Ms. Yellen said. The Obama administration has moved to forgive debt taken on by students who were lured to colleges by fraudulent recruiting, including lying about graduatesâ€™ job success.Â  WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE DEFICIT.Â Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a freshman Republican from Maine, used a big chunk of his five minutes with Ms. Yellen to talk about the federal debt. The Federal Reserve, of course, has no power over the deficit. Thatâ€™s Congressâ€™ job. But Mr. Poliquin wasnâ€™t ready to let Yellen off the hook, referring to earlier concerns sheâ€™s aired about the countryâ€™s debt level. â€œCanâ€™t we agree itâ€™s about time you help usâ€? make the case that the federal debt needs to be reduced, he asked. â€œI did indicate my concern with the sustainability of the debt path,â€? Ms. Yellen ventured. Thatâ€™s likely as far as sheâ€™ll be willing to go on the issue, however. As a monetary policy official, Ms. Yellen will probably not want to wade too far into politically charged fiscal policy questions. Thatâ€™s OK with Mr. Poliquin, it seemed. All he wants, he said, is for Ms. Yellen â€œto use your influence in this town.â€? The federal deficit has been dropping as the economy improves, but CBO expects it to rise in the coming years as retiring baby boomers start weighing on Social Security and Medicare. LIQUIDITY CONCERNS: Â Rep. French Hill (R., Ark.) thinks regulation is to blame for liquidity issues in the Treasury market . Heâ€™s not the only one in the GOP or the markets, of course, though some officials have downplayed that factor. Â  Â Ms. Yellen remains open-minded. â€œI am not ruling out the possibility that regulations could play a role here. There are a lot of different factorsâ€? and the Fed needs to sort out the differences. THATâ€™S ALL, FOLKS: Just three hours. Remember when Ms. YellenÂ  stuck around for almost six hours ? (A lot ofÂ  good that did her !) After 18 months of this, Ms. Yellen is really perfecting her filibustering skills in front lawmakers who have tremendous expertise in filibustering. She wonâ€™t doÂ let anyone push her into a yes-or-no answer, or a brief one, when she wants to explain her view patiently. Chairman Hensarling helped her out with only very light tapping of the gavel to keep the time. previous Grand Central: U.S. Consumers are a Wildcard in Yellenâ€™s Midyear Outlook We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

Mrs. Yelling, isnt fed out to screw all poor pepole to steal money to feed the polations,and starive them so you all can spend to throw money away on your watch. This is a debacle plain and simple, they won't raise rates and they are lying to us so the stock market won't tank like China's did last week. This is also a waste of taxpayers dollars to hear rhetoric once again from the Fed, Best thing to do people is put your money into precious metal commidities, which actually never lose their value like the dollar will. The Fed is insolvent and is overleveraged, whats to stop the next crisis....mmmmm...nothing, the fed will print out wealth out of existence. Even the IMF urged the Fed to refrain from raising rates until 2016!  But as Barry Eichengreen pointed out (in Hall of Mirrors) the Fed is sensitive to criticism from politicians and in the media, not really all that independent.  It would not be the first time the Fed erred. If the executive and legislative branches would invest in much needed infrastructure refurbishment that would provide demand that in turn would motivate corporate investment and hiring and help shake off the Great Recession.  As Larry Summers rhetorically stated, if the government cannot invest in infrastructure refurbishment now with rates at the zero bound, when can it? Based on a large amount of the questions above its clear that all Congress wants is the Fed to do their job for them, report to them, then take the blame for them when everything doesn't go as planned.   What does Congress do again? For crissakes, just raise interest rates and stop blabbing about it.  Go ahead.  Make my day. The Fed is afraid that raising rates will tank the economy and they don't want to be blamed.  Instead, Yellen and the other clueless clowns on the Fed keep yapping about it.  They got themselves stuck in a corner and don't whether to s#it or go blind. previous Grand Central: U.S. Consumers are a Wildcard in Yellenâ€™s Midyear Outlook Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
