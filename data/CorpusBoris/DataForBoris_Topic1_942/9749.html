Persistent Low Inflation Hurts Fed Credibility, Evans Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserveâ€™s persistent failure to hit its 2% inflation target in recent years raises the concern that objective will lose credibility with the public and financial markets, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Friday. Mr. Evans was asked by economists and monetary policy experts at the Brookings Institution about the possibility of raising the central bank’s inflation target to give the Federal Open Market Committee more policy wiggle room. He said a higher target was not necessary as long as policy makers managed to prove they were just as serious about fighting too-low inflation, which points to a weak economy, as they are about too-high inflation, which signals growth may be running too hot. The Fed has held its benchmark short-term rate near zero since December 2008. Most Fed officials have indicated they expect to raise the rate this year , with some saying they want to consider a move as soon as June. Mr. Evans argued in a paper presented at the Brookings conference that heightened uncertainty about the Fed’s ability to meet its 2% inflation target calls for waiting longer than usual to raising borrowing costs. â€œWhat goes hand in hand with this is whether or not the FOMC demonstrates its commitment to a symmetric inflation objective,â€? Mr. Evans said. â€œWe ought to spend sort of half of the time above 2% and half the time below, and over the last six years, weâ€™ve averaged 1.5% and forecasts say weâ€™re going to spend two to four years below 2% if things play out the wayâ€?Â Fed officials see them playing out. Mr. Evans also pushed back against the notion that, while inflation may be low, keeping interest rates near zero for a prolonged period creates risks of financial instability, particularly in the form of asset bubbles. He acknowledged the possibility exists, but argued he doesnâ€™t see any worrisome trends in markets currently and said the Fed and others should use regulations and other targeted tools to tamp down excess risks in specific sectors.
