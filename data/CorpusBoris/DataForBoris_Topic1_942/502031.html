The Taper Tantrum And The Central Bank Schism | Seeking Alpha Larry Summers has made his big market call based on the cognitive dissonance at the Fed. Lael Brainard's new normal thesis will be tested very soon. Narayana Kocherlakota has also noted the risks building from cognitive dissonance at the Fed. Fed policy is diverging from the BOJ and ECB with potentially dangerous consequences. Ben Bernanke's original criticism of the Fed's amateurish handling of the data and its poor forecasting has been followed in these reports as he progresses, to his latest tactic of leading Chairman Yellen to the conclusion that the Fed's balance sheet should remain permanently expanded. The story recently opened another chapter, authored by Larry Summers. Summers has effectively criticized both Bernanke and Yellen; and trumped them by making the big market and policy call that may define his attempts to rehabilitate his reputation and career prospects. Opining on the subject of Jackson Hole, Summers graded Yellen's speech an A* for delivery but and F for its content. In his opinion , she failed primarily because she did not use her speech as an opportunity to strongly signal that a rate hike is not imminent because she intends to press on with the job of sustaining the rise of inflation above the 2% target level. Secondly, she failed because she had her own Bernanke moment. This moment was first seen in 2007, when Bernanke failed to acknowledge that the developing sub-prime crisis was about to go viral. This time around Yellen has failed in a similar way, because she has perjured herself, by announcing that the Fed has sufficient conventional tools available to deal with next downturn which he senses is with us already. Said downturn is a symptom of the secular stagnation which he believes has not been expunged by the central banks thus far. For Summers, the inflection point came with the recent August employment situation report. The Fed is therefore now going to tighten as it did under Bernanke and trigger the crisis that it lacks the tools to deal with. Despite the risk of triggering the next crisis, Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker is still insistent upon a rate hike at the next meeting. San Francisco Fed President John Williams is also happy to court disaster with an early hike rate, because he is of the opinion that gradualism will mitigate any sudden resulting risk-off environment that will undermine the US economy. Williams' view is shared by Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who has fully embraced the risk mitigation angle of gradualism that Williams promotes. Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart are not yet prepared to embrace the risk, of what may turn out to be a premature rate hike at the next FOMC meeting. Lockhart also announced that he will retire next year. The space he creates will be an interesting one; especially if anti-Yellen President Trump is in the White House. Kaplan opined that in his opinion the Fed has only signaled its intentions and capabilities to tighten; and that even though the pace and trajectory of rate increases will be gradual there is no imminence about the decision to go. Lockhart concedes that tightening must come but sees no need to rush, given the weak inflation picture despite the obvious wage pressure signals. The lack of follow through from wages to general price inflation seems to worry him. Minnesota Fed President Kashkari also sees the inertia in inflation allowing for inertia in the Fed's rate hike timing. His take on the Fed's ability to enact further monetary stimulus is perhaps of more interest. He sees the Fed's monetary stimulus abilities as limited and is therefore looking for the combination of fiscal stimulus and supply side reform to do the next phase of heavy lifting. (Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ) Fed Governor Lael Brainard was instrumental in averting/postponing the previous rate hike earlier in the year; the anticipation of which had created its own Taper Tantrum. A potential re-run of the situation recently appeared, when she was given the dubious honor of being the last Fed speaker before the quiet period leading to the next FOMC meeting started. Whilst accepting the inevitability of future rate hikes, in response to a strengthening domestic economy, she however signaled that there should be no rush to hike at the next meeting since the external economic headwinds are growing. She also suggested that Fed policy has an asymmetric bias, tending towards the ZIRP zone going forwards, because of what she calls the "new normal" of low inflation, low growth and a lower neutral rate all put into a global context of higher uncertainty. Any eventual and gradual tightening should thus be viewed as anomalous through Brainard's frame of understanding. Recent reports in this series have observed San Francisco Fed president John Williams making the case for the new lower neutral rate. His thesis does not seem to carry any weight with the founder of the Taylor Rule. John Taylor sees no basis for a lower neutral rate, nor does he think that negative interest rates are any solution to the current global problems of weak growth and low inflation. The chaos surrounding the FOMC's true intentions and capabilities in relation to tightening has taken its toll on the bond market. This has not been helped by the FOMC's own forecasting ability or lack thereof, which has created a strong case of cognitive dissonance. This failure was highlighted and criticized by Ben Bernanke. In short the Dot Plots keep getting lowered whilst the tightening moves closer in tandem. From his vantage point, on the grassy knoll over at Bloomberg, former Minnesota Fed president Kocherlakota has joined Bernanke in picking off his former colleagues. He already told Yellen what to say and how to say it at Jackson Hole. Evidently he was less than impressed with what she said. In his latest critique , he pointed out the absurdity of the Fed's projections and conflicting guidance. He views this as a lack of "vigor" in trying to achieve its 2% inflation target. The Fed's forecasts are predicting a recession-like environment and yet Yellen says that it will tighten going into said recession. The forecasts then say that the Fed will do nothing about this predicament. As a consequence of the falling/failing Dot Plots and a general global economic slowdown, the interest rate risk premium had been taken out of US Treasuries. Perversely, expectations of a strengthening US Dollar based on higher interest rates and a flight to quality in safe assets have eroded this interest rate premium even further. The US bond market was therefore discounting the next wave of monetary easing, following the tightening. The Fed has yet to convincingly sell the upcoming tightening as a normalization, for the simple reason that the likes of Williams and his lower neutral rate are making the normalization look like a tightening. From his position at the ECB, Mario Draghi has observed this problem and opted for a communication strategy that is clear and backed up with a study that is now in process until December. The BOJ similarly is undergoing a "comprehensive assessment". The Dallas Fed has even warned the FOMC to speak with clarity, less frequently and with deep meaning when it does. Janet Yellen only went as far as justifying the Fed's actions thus far at Jackson; and therefore fell well short of guiding the markets. The uncertainty created by the dissonance at the Fed is rational, but unfortunately understood and expressed emotionally. The previous report on the Jackson Hole conference observed a curious nostalgic longing for orthodox monetary policy amongst some of the attendees. The context for this nostalgia was initially thought to be related to the Fed's latest attempt to build an orthodox interest rate cushion with which to address the next economic slowdown. This nostalgia has seen a painful steepening of the US yield curve as it gets discounted. The nostalgia however appears to be more nuanced than this. The Austrian Central Bank recently held a conference which was focused on the slippage of central banks into political agency roles as a result of policies in reaction to the Credit Crunch. The policies have been decidedly unconventional. As a consequence, these policies have also received violent opposition from those, such as depositors and the structurally unemployed, who have not benefited from them. The rise of populism can also be collocated with this aversion to politicized central bankers. Fearful of the consequences, the central bankers got together in Austria to discuss survival tactics. The BIS warned them that being political by monetizing deficits, risks a return the chaos that shook the economic and political system in the late 1970's. The BIS believes that the central banks should just accept that it will take much longer, for them to ignite inflation, than they had initially thought; rather than double down on their stimulus plans and double up the risks. Evidently the ECB and BOJ are pressing on with unconventional policies, under the cover of research, whilst the Fed and the Bank of England are hoping for a return to orthodox conventional monetary policy. Stanley Fischer recently highlighted this schism, when he opined that although negative interest rates appear to work in some countries they will not be applied by the Fed. Chair Yellen has also been similarly dismissive of negative interest rates in the Fed's toolbox. This sentiment has also been echoed by Bank of England Governor Carney and Chief Economist Andy Haldane. This policy schism should be put into the context of the fact that all the developed nation central banks are continuing to fail to meet their inflation mandates. Observing this schism, the growing presence and commentary from Ben Bernanke was swift to offer criticism again. This time his criticism was aimed at his former colleagues who rule out the potential of negative interest rates. To give all central bankers a fighting chance, back in Bernanke's day, a seemingly achievable 2% inflation target was created by fiat. Thus far they have failed to achieve it. The Fed seems to be giving up the ghost however, whilst its peers plow on with their quest. The conference in Vienna sought to defuse the tension between the Fed and its peers; and the havoc that this may create in the global capital markets. Whilst affirming that the 2% inflation target is still appropriate, in order to give the Bank of England, ECB and the BOJ room to ease further, the attendees compromised by saying that the interpretation of respective inflation mandates and targets is a subjective prerogative of each central bank. The Fed was thus let off the hook to disengage and follow its own divergent course from its peers. The disingenuous equivocation performed by the attendees, whilst squaring the circle for the sake of a neat set of minutes, did nothing to mitigate the unfolding Taper Tantrum in the markets.
