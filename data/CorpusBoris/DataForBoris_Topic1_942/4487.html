Fedspeak Cheatsheet: What Are Fed Policy Makers Saying? - Real Time Economics - WSJ As Federal Reserve officials approach their March 17-18 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, several indicated in public remarks and interviews they want to consider raising short-term interest rates in June. This implies a readiness to drop the pledge in their statement to be â€œpatientâ€? in deciding when to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, from near zero. One official said they are already late in considering a rate increase, while at least two donâ€™t favor lifting rates any time this year because inflation remains well under their 2% target. Chairwoman Janet Yellen (voter), Feb. 24 in Washington : “If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance.” Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer (voter), Feb. 26 in New York : â€œWe are getting closerâ€? to rate rises, but â€œI donâ€™t know whether we will or whether we wonâ€™t” raise rates over the summer. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , Feb. 5 in Frankfurt : “Given how low total and core inflation have fallen in most developed countries, a policy of patience in the United States continues to be appropriate.” New York Fed President William Dudley (voter), Feb. 27 in New York : “I believe that the risks of lifting the federal funds rate off of the zero lower bound a bit early are higher than the risks of lifting off a bit late.” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, March 9 in Washington : â€œIf incoming economic information continues to support my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff in the first half of this year.” Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker (voter), March 6 in a SiriusXM radio interview : Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart (voter), Feb. 27 in a WSJ interview : Chicago Fed President Charles Evans (voter), March 4 in Lake Forest, Ill. : â€œI think economic conditions will evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to delay normalizing monetary policyâ€“that is, to hold off on raising short-term ratesâ€“until 2016.” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , Feb. 27 in a Financial Times interview : â€œWe are a little bit too late in this process,â€? of raising rates. â€œI think we have to move now or soon.â€? Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, Feb. 3 in St. Paul, Minn .: â€œGiven my current outlook for inflation, I anticipate that, under a goal-oriented approach, the FOMC would not raise the fed funds rate target this year.” Kansas City Fed President Esther George, March 5 in Kansas City, Mo. : â€œI continue to support liftoff towards the middle of this year due to improvement in the labor market, expectations of firmer inflation, and the balance of risks over the medium and longer run.” San Francisco Fed President John Williams (voter), Feb. 26 in a WSJ interview : â€œMaybe in June it would be the time to contemplate raising rates. Maybe weâ€™ll want to wait longer, but at least it will be an option to decide on.” We welcome thoughtful comments from readers. Please comply with our guidelines .
