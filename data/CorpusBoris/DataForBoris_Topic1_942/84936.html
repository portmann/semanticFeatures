BOE’s McCafferty Says Downside Risks to Inflation Diminishing - Real Time Economics - WSJ LONDON–The forces keeping a lid on inflation in the U.K. appear to be diminishing, meaning interest rates in the U.K. may soon need to rise, according to a Bank of England official. Ian McCafferty, one of the nine members of the BOEâ€™s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, told teachers and students in a speech Thursday that the current low level of inflation in the U.K. is unlikely to last, according to a text of his remarks published by the central bank on Friday. Consumer prices fell in the year to April by 0.1% , the first year-on-year decline in prices for more than 50 years. Mr. McCafferty said the effects of the forces bearing down on inflation, including a decline in oil and food prices and a strong pound, are likely to fade over the next year or so. The BOEâ€™s latest forecasts show annual inflation rising to around 1.7% by the end of next year, only a little below the BOEâ€™s 2% target. â€œWe are approaching the time when monetary policy will need to begin its journey back to more normal settings,â€? Mr. McCafferty said. Investors currently expect the BOE to begin slowly raising borrowing costs in the U.K. in mid-2016. Mr. McCafferty is generally viewed as one of the more hawkish members of the rate-setting panel, having voted for an interest rate rise several times last year. But he and fellow MPC member Martin Weale dropped their call for higher rates in January, when it became clear that inflation was set to tumble. Mr. McCaffertyâ€™s remarks suggest he may soon revive his call for a small rise in the BOEâ€™s benchmark rate to keep inflation in check, particularly if wage growth starts to accelerate.
