BOE Official Sees Possibility of Rate Cut  - Real Time Economics - WSJ A top official at the Bank of England said Thursday the central bank may need to cut interest rates in the U.K. to steer annual inflation back to its 2% target. Andrew Haldane, the BOEâ€™s chief economist, said in a speech that the current spell of low inflation in the U.K. may prove more persistent than the central bankâ€™s forecasts imply if wage growth remains subdued or global price pressures continue to wane. â€œI do not currently see an immediate case for a policy change in either direction,â€? Mr. Haldane said, according to a text of his remarks. But he added the chances of a rate rise or a rate cut are â€œbroadly evenly balanced,â€? and that a case could even be made for easing policy immediately to prevent expectations of weak inflation becoming entrenched among households and businesses, which risks dragging down actual inflation in the future. â€œMy view would be that policy may need to move off either foot in the immediate period ahead, depending on which way risks break.â€? Mr. Haldaneâ€™s remarks put him at odds with the rest of the BOEâ€™s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, who have repeatedly signaled that they believe their next move will almost certainly be to raise the BOEâ€™s benchmark rate from its 321-year low of 0.5%, where it has been pegged since March 2009. Annual inflation in the U.K. was 0.3% in February but BOE officials expect it to rise back to its 2% target over the next two years. Investors currently expect the central bank to make its first rate increase early next year and ratchet up rates slowly and incrementally in the years ahead, according to interest-rate derivatives that hug the BOEâ€™s benchmark.
