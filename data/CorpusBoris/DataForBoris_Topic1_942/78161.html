Fed’s Dudley Says Rate-Rise Still Likely on Track for This Year - Real Time Economics - WSJ MINNEAPOLIS–Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Friday he continues to believe the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year , in comments that welcomed the release of what he saw as a report showing healthy job gains in May . “If the labor market continues to improve and inflation expectations remain well-anchored, then I would expect–in the absence of some dark cloud gathering over the growth outlook–to support a decision to begin normalizing monetary policy later this year,” Mr. Dudley said. But he declined to say exactly when the central bank would act. “The likelihood and timing will depend on the economic outlook, and that will be largely shaped by the incoming economic data.” Mr. Dudley said there are considerable uncertainties surrounding his outlook. While he expects growth to accelerate over the remainder of the year, he isn’t entirely confident that will happen. Meanwhile, the official said he was becoming “more confident” the Fed will get inflation back to the 2% target it has failed to meet over the last three years. Mr. Dudley’s comments came from the text of a speech prepared for delivery before a meeting of the Economic Club of Minneapolis. The official, who also serves as vice chairman of the monetary-policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, spoke in the wake of the release of the May jobs report earlier in the day. The government reported a robust rate of hiring , with payrolls expanding by 280,000 jobs. The jobless rate ticked up to 5.5% from 5.4% in April, but that increase was tied in part to workers returning to the labor force. Also in the plus category for the employment sector, wage gains picked up. “Today’s payroll and household employment reports indicate that this progress continued into May,” Mr. Dudley said. But he added, “there is still some ways to go. The unemployment rate has changed little in the past four months at about 5 [1/2]%.” The strength of hiring came as significant questions have arisen about the state of growth after activity stalled out over the start of the year. Many economists and policymakers are uncertain how much of that weakness is due to extreme winter weather or something more enduring. The vigor seen in hiring suggests the economy may have picked up after its first quarter swoon. But the gains may also be driven by tepid productivity gains. “Recent solid job gains and a further decline in the unemployment rate have occurred only because productivity growth has slowed markedly,” Mr. Dudley said. “It seems unlikely that productivity growth will remain as weak as it has been over the past year,” and that suggests that future payroll gains will be more of an unambiguous positive for the outlook. Mr. Dudley also spoke amid notable uncertainty about the timing of interest-rate rises. The FOMC next meets on June 16 and 17 and it is very unlikely to raise its short-term interest rate target off of what are currently near zero levels. Most officials have hoped to do that this year, and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated this desire in a recent speech. That said, if the economy’s growth rate doesn’t accelerate from what was seen at the start of the year, it could call into question the timing of rate rises. Mr. Dudley said the Fed can only provide limited guidance about the rate outlook right now. He reiterated his belief that the central bank has described its economic objectives clearly enough that officials don’t have to provide extensive guidance, saying “if you pay attention to the incoming economic news and listen to our assessment about how the outlook is evolving, then I think you will be able to judge for yourself when lift-off is likely.” Mr. Dudley repeated his view that how markets react to Fed policy changes will be very important to how future rate rises happen. He believes future rate rises will happen on a “shallow” path, but if markets don’t react to the Fed’s desire to raise borrowing costs, that could make the Fed more aggressive with subsequent rate rises. Meanwhile, if markets get too far ahead of the Fed, that could slow the pace of rate rises, he said. Mr. Dudley also said that he expects some “turbulence” in markets when the Fed begins raising rates given how long rates have been pinned at rock-bottom levels. He said that means the Fed needs to provide as much clarity as it can about the outlook. On the economy, Mr. Dudley said weakness over the start of the year was driven by weather, cuts in energy investment, a rising trade deficit, sluggish foreign demand and a strong dollar. So far, the rebound from the first quarter has been “muted,” but he said “my view is that growth will likely pick up further during the remainder of this year.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
