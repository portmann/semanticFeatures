Fed’s Rosengren Says Dollar Strength Crimping U.S. Growth - Real Time Economics - WSJ A top Federal Reserve official said Thursday the dollar’s strength is crimping growth in the U.S. and may require the central bank to delay raising interest rates. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren told an audience in London that the greenback’s rise is hitting exports and manufacturing and risks slowing growth overall. “The United States won’t grow quite as strongly as it would have if we didn’t have this kind of exchange-rate movement,” he said while answering questions following a speech at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, also known as Chatham House. He said that may require Fed officials to delay raising borrowing costs. A strong dollar “has implications for how quickly we might have to raise rates when it starts becoming appropriate to raise rates.” Mr. Rosengren, who isn’t currently a voting member of the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, spoke amid brewing uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy. Although Mr. Rosengren has been hesitant to embrace a push toward higher borrowing costs, most officials have been on board with a boost in short-term rates this year. A number of them had indicated the conversation over rate rises would start with the FOMC’s mid-June policy meeting. Mr. Rosengren added it may be “several years” before annual inflation in the U.S. reaches the Fed’s 2% goal. And he said he is sympathetic to the idea of delaying interest-rate increases to make it less likely an unexpected shock upsets the Fed’s plans and requires it to change course. “We don’t want to be in a position where we are tightening rates and have to reverse our policy.” Highlighting one such risk, the official warned that analysts and investors may have become too complacent about what might happen if struggling Greece defaults on its debts and leaves the eurozone, although he stressed he doesn’t think that’s the most likely outcome. “I wouldn’t be overly confident that just because the Greek economy is small relative to the size of the European economy that something like that wouldn’t be a major dislocation,” he said.
