ECB’s Constancio: Program of Quantitative Easing is Working  - Real Time Economics - WSJ LONDONâ€”The European Central Bankâ€™s program of quantitative easing is working as planned, and will aid, rather than threaten, the stability of the financial system, Vice President Vitor Constancio said Friday. In March, the ECB launched a program under which it will buy more than â‚¬1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) of mostly government bonds by September 2016, using freshly created money. In advance of its launch, and in the weeks since, equity prices have risen, while bond yields have fallen, in some cases going below zero. That has led to concerns that QE may have inspired investors to take on too much risk, as they did Â in advance of the financial crisis. But in a speech, Mr. Constancio said that on balance, QE is beneficial for the stability of the financial system. He said the low market interest rates that have inspired a â€œsearch for yieldâ€? among investors have been a consequence of weak economic growth and low inflation, rather than the central bankâ€™s purchases of government bonds. He said that as QE moves the inflation rate back towards the central banks inflation target of just under 2%, market interest rates should rise. He also said higher inflation would make it easier for governments, households and businesses to repay their debts, while higher asset prices will improve the credit worthiness of borrowers and improve the flow of fresh credit, all developments that are beneficial for financial stability. But while he said the threats to financial stability in the eurozone are â€œcontained,â€? he said further regulatory measures should be taken to limit the potential for a buildup of risks in the financial system â€œOur current monetary policy setting is beneficial for financial stability,â€? Mr. Constancio said. â€œNevertheless, a buildup of risks can arise in a situation of low interest rates and abundant liquidity. Monetary policy needs to be complemented by more targeted macroprudential policy.â€? In recent days, some of the declines in eurozone bond yields that followed the launch of QE have reversed sharply. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Constancio said he viewed that move as a “correction,” an indication that the central bank doesn’t see it as the start of a sustained shift. “As such, we don’t have problems with recent developments,” he said. Mr. Constancio said non-bank financial institutionsâ€”known collectively as the â€œshadow bankingâ€? systemâ€”is playing an increased role in providing credit to the real economy, and that the same kinds of problems can arise as did in the banking system ahead of the financial crisis. He said the behavior of non-bank institutions therefore â€œwarrants closer scrutiny, including for risks to financial stability.â€? Mr. Constancio also said he doesn’t expect that Greece will be forced to leave the eurozone. Greece’s leftist-led government is currently locked in negotiations with its international creditorsâ€”the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commissionâ€”over its next slice of financial aid as part of a â‚¬245 billion rescue package.
