Grand Central: U.S. Productivity Slowdown Lurks as Wildcard on Fed Meeting Day  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hilsenrathâ€™s Take: U.S. Productivity Slowdown Lurks as Wildcard on Fed Meeting Day Fed Seeks Feedback on â€˜Stress Testsâ€™ Bank of England Sees Faster Wage Growth The outlook for U.S. worker productivity growth is becoming increasingly important in U.S. monetary policy planning. Since the recession ended, output-per-hour worked has expanded at an annual rate of 1.4%, the worst performance over a six year stretch since the early-to-mid 1980s, which were marked by back-to-back recessions. During the past two years, productivity growth has been downright abysmal, at an annual rate of 0.5%. That is the kind of performance you tend to see right after a recession ends and business hiring is ramping up, not in the seventh year of an expansion. The Fed has two problems to resolve in assessing the productivity slowdown. The first is determining what is driving it and whether the slowdown will be sustained. Several narratives are at play. One view is that productivity growth was hurt by the devastating 2007-2009 recession, which squeezed business investment in productivity-enhancing equipment and technologies. If this view is right, productivity ought to start growing faster as business confidence improves. Another view is that the slowdown was in place long before the recession and was the result of a real and lasting slowdown in the advancement of U.S. innovation and technological gains. If this view is right, productivity wonâ€™t bounce back. A third view is that U.S. output and productivity statistics are plagued by mismeasurement and there is, in fact, no productivity slowdown at all. The second problem for the Fed is determining how to adjust monetary policy to a shifting productivity backdrop. If the productivity slowdown is real, that means slack in the job market is getting eaten up quickly, a diagnosis which seems to be confirmed by falling measures of unemployment. Companies are hiring, but the workers theyâ€™re hiring arenâ€™t producing much. Less slack means wage and inflation pressures are building and it is time for the Fed to start raising short-term interest rates. However, a lasting productivity slowdown also means that the economyâ€™s growth potential is diminished, and rates wonâ€™t need to go very high after the Fed does start moving rates up. In other words, if the Fed believes this productivity slowdown is real, it calls for a â€œsoon and shallowâ€? rate cycle, starting to move rates up now and stopping the process before they get very high. The Fedâ€™s policy announcement today will contain important clues about how officials are reading the slowdown. If they think the productivity slowdown is real, they will stick to plans to start raising short-term interest rates later this year, but their projections for rates in 2016 and beyond could come down, as might their projections for the economyâ€™s long-run growth potential. Beyond these projections, donâ€™t be surprised if the issue comes up in Janet Yellenâ€™s post-meeting discussion of the economy or in the question-and-answer session with reporters that follows, because the issue is sure to get plenty of airing in the Fedâ€™s behind-the-scenes discussions. Some of the Fedâ€™s Dots Will Be More Equal Than Others. Federal Reserve-watchers on Wednesday will dissect policy makersâ€™ latest economic projections for clues to the path of interest rates in the coming months and years. But divining meaning from the so-called â€œdot plotâ€? of interest-rate estimates can be difficult. One complication: Two sets of projections were submitted by interim policy makers â€”D. Blake Prichard and Helen E. Holcombâ€” from regional reserve banks where the presidency is vacant. Fed Seeks Feedback on â€˜Stress Testsâ€™.Â A top Federal Reserve official is reaching out to a variety of bank executives to discuss how the central bank might make its annual â€œstress testsâ€? less stressful .Â The discussions between Fed governor Daniel Tarullo and bank executives comes as Washington and Wall Street debate whether postcrisis rulesâ€”including the annual tests of banksâ€™ ability to withstand tough timesâ€”should be scaled back for smaller banks. Some banks say the burden of complying with the tests far outstrips the benefit to regulators or the financial system. Fed Faulted BofA Regarding Its Foresight. Â Bank of America Corp.Â earlier this year was chastised by the Federal Reserve for not anticipating problems with its â€œstress testâ€? submission, a rebuke that led the firm to hire a bevy of consultants to help address the issue, according to people familiar with the matter. Top White House Economists Looks to Consumers. Jason Furman, chairman of the White Houseâ€™s Council of Economic said he expects U.S. households to spend more and save less in the coming months, helping fuel the economy. Mr. Furman noted consumersâ€”who account for about 70% of economic outputâ€”have paid down debt, are confident and have received an income boost from cheaper gasoline prices. Greenberg Will Appeal Damages Ruling in AIG Case. AIGâ€™s former chief executive, Maurice R. â€œHankâ€? Greenberg said he would appeal the decision not to award shareholders any of the $40 billion in damages they were seeking. In a Monday ruling, a judge concluded that federal law didnâ€™t permit the government to take a 79.9% equity stake in exchange for providing an $85 billion emergency loan to AIG in September 2008, during the darkest days of the financial crisis. That was a central element of Mr. Greenbergâ€™s lawsuit. But Judge Wheeler said â€œzero damagesâ€? were being awarded because he had to take into consideration that AIGâ€™s alternative to the governmentâ€™s harsh deal terms was to file for bankruptcy, an outcome that likely would have left shareholders with nothing. No Agreement on Productivity Slowdown Causes. Jan Hatzius, the chief economist ofÂ Goldman Sachs, andÂ Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist ofÂ J.P. Morgan Chase, offer dueling views on the productivity slump. In a research note in May, Mr. Hatzius and fellow Goldman economistÂ Kris Dawsey argued productivity might not be so bad. They argue the statistics miss improvements in technological quality and may fail to capture the value of new products.Â Mr. Feroli of J.P. MorganÂ and his fellow economist Jesse EdgertonÂ disagree. In a research piece last week, they note these arguments have been around for so long that in 1996, the government created a commissionâ€“the Boskin Commissionâ€“to study the measurement problems of quality-change and new products. Slower Productivity Growth Ahead. The U.S. could be in forÂ a stretch of low productivity growth, which would have the counterintuitive effect of tightening the labor market, raising wages and forcingÂ FedÂ officials to raise rates more rapidly than they otherwise would, says a new analysis from a trio of Deutsche Bank economists. But higher wages would also push up inflation, which means we would hit the central bankâ€™s 2% inflation target sooner than anticipated. That, the economists note, would likely mean that the Fed would end up with a slightly lower federal fund rate than anticipated, once the process of tightening is completed. Greek Central Bank Warns of â€˜Uncontrollable Crisisâ€™ if Bailout Talks Fail.Â Greeceâ€™s central bank warned Wednesday that failure to clinch a deal with international creditors on its future funding needs could lead the country into an â€œuncontrollable crisis,â€? describing the issue as being of historical significance for the nation. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras Blasts Creditors as Clock Ticks. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras lambasted creditors for their handling of his countryâ€™s debt crisis on Tuesday, but suggested that a coming summit of European leaders could be the decisive moment in the drawn-out negotiations. Noyer: Too Much Regulation Could Hurt Economy. Christian Noyer, a member of the ECBâ€™s governing council, warned policymakers Tuesday against piling more banking rules on top of regulations implemented in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In an address at Sciences Po University in Paris, Mr. Noyer warned that heftier regulations “could create uncertainties and obstacles to financing the economy.” â€“ Dow Jones Newswires. Bank of England Sees Faster Wage Growth. Wages in the U.K. may be rising at a faster pace than official figures suggest, Bank of England officials concluded this month, one of a handful of signs that rate-setters have become less concerned about the risk of a prolonged spell of falling prices. Greeks Brace for More Pain. The heavy loss of private-sector jobs and the pressure on the social fabricâ€”including rises in poverty, homelessness, mental illness and suicidesâ€”have eroded initially broad hopes that the bailout would provide a chance to correct long-standing economic and political failings. Since 2010 Greece has put in place spending cuts and tax-revenue increases totaling around 30% of gross domestic product, according to EU figures. That scale far exceeds Europeâ€™s other crisis-hit countries and has been a major factor in Greeceâ€™s loss of a quarter of its economic output . -1730 GMT (1:30 p.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Forbes speaks in London -2 p.m. EDT: Federal Reserve releases a policy statement and updated economic projections -2:30 p.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Yellen speaks at a press conference in Washington How Networks Help Job Seekers. Judith K. Hellerstein, Mark J. Kutzbach and David Neumark look at labor market networks and find that people who lose their jobs tend to get new ones through referrals. â€œThese effects are substantially stronger for low-earners than for high earners,â€? they write. They also look at how these networks helped laid off workers during the recent recession. â€œWe find slower re-employment rates (and hence larger earnings losses) for those displaced during the Great Recession. We also find clear evidence that network connections â€“ especially those that provide information about vacancies to job searchers â€“ became less useful in the recovery of employment during the Great Recession,â€? they write. Look for September. On Bloomberg View, Mohamed El-Erian says to expect the Fed to signal a September rate hike today even as it builds itself some wiggle room. â€œLook for the signaling of higher rates to come with a notable qualification: At this meeting and over the next few weeks, Fed officials are likely to make remarks aimed at conveying both the still-tentative nature of the schedule for the first rate rise and to emphasize that the subsequent journey will be shallow and conditional, and will end with unusually low rates from a historical perspective,â€? he writes. Greece Has Given Enough. James K. Galbraith speaks up for Greece on Project Syndicate. â€œThe Greeks have already made tough choices. Now it is the IMFâ€™s turn, beginning with the decision to admit that the policies it has imposed for five long years created a disaster. For the other creditors, the toughest choice is to admit â€“ as the IMF knows â€“ that their Greek debts must be restructured. New loans for failed policies â€“ the current joint creditor proposal â€“ is, for them, no adjustment at all,â€? he writes. Will Congress Now Rein In the Fed? Writing in the Journal, Seth Lipsky asks how lawmakers should respond to a court ruling thatÂ federal law didnâ€™t permit the government to take a 79.9% equity stake in exchange for providing an $85 billion emergency loan to AIG in September 2008. “Now that the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has concluded that the Federal Reserve violated federal law and the Constitution when it nationalized insurer AIGÂ Â in September 2008, the big question is this: What is Congress going to do about it?,” he writes. CBO Drops Projections on Interest Rates. The Congressional Budget Office now projects the real interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes to stand at 2.3% over the long term , down from a projection of 2.5% last year and 3% in 2013. Housing Starts Pull Back but Permits Show Strength. Groundbreakings surged to a seven-year high in April before falling 11% last month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.Â And permits to build new homes surged 12% last month to an annual rate of 1.275 million, the highest since August 2007. Namibia’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 6.5% from 6.25% in an effort to rein in rapid credit growth , which it said was “primarily used to finance unproductive imported luxury goods, hence putting additional pressure on the international reserves of the country.” FEEDBACK LOOP: Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.
