Fed’s Eric Rosengren Says It Isn’t the Right Time to Raise Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ Icicles hang from buildings on Beacon Street in Boston in February. Many have blamed severe winter weather for weak first-quarter economic figures, but Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren said data suggest weakness came before and after some of the most notable chapters of snow and cold. Worried a weak economy over the start of the year may signal deeper problems, the leader of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said Monday that the time hasn’t arrived to raise short-term interest rates. Now is the time for â€œcontinued patience in monetary policyâ€? to ensure that growth gets back on track and drives tepid levels of inflation back to 2%, while helping to further lower the unemployment rate, Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren said. While he didn’t say when he would like to see the U.S. central bank lift rates off of current near-zero rates, he said he is worried that surprisingly weak growth over the start of the year could be a harbinger of future trouble, and that argues in favor of caution on the part of Fed policy makers. â€œThe conditions for beginning the tightening of monetary policy have not yet been met,â€? Mr. Rosengren said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery before a local group in Hartford, Conn. Mr. Rosengren spoke as anxiety is rising over the state of growth so far this year. As reported Friday, the U.S. economyÂ contracted at a 0.7% annual rate over the first three months of the year. Many forecasters see only modest gains coming in the second quarter. This surprisingly weak performance has called into question central bankersâ€™ broad desire to raise rates this year. If growth is slow, it will make it hard for the unemployment rate to fall further, and for price pressures that have been short of the Fedâ€™s official mandate for nearly three years to achieve the levels sought by Fed officials. Mr. Rosengren isn’t currently a voting member of the monetary-policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. He has been a steadfast proponent of holding off on rate increases, even as many of his colleagues believe the time to act likely will arrive in the coming months. In a speech on May 22 , Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said â€œI think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal-funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.â€? In his speech, Mr. Rosengren said it isn’t clear what waylaid growth this year. While many have blamed bad winter weather for the slowdown, he said data suggest weakness came before and after some of the most notable chapters of snow and cold. â€œIt is too soon to know whether this is driven primarily by temporary factors like the severe winter, or is a reflection of broader changes in the economy,â€? Mr. Rosengren said. The official said the Fed needs to change policy primary in reaction to real changes in the economy. â€œThe data have disappointed before, and an appropriately data-dependent monetary policy requires confirmation in the numbers, not just in forecasts of better times,â€? he said. Mr. Rosengren also said the Fed should be cautious because, with short-term rates already at levels that can be cut no further, it has little room to respond to a new economic shock. Meanwhile, if the economy suddenly picked up, there would be ample room to respond with rate rises.
