Bank of Japan to Provide Price, Growth Information More Often  - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of Japan said Friday it would provide more information, more often on the price and growth views of its policy-setting members to help improve public understanding of its efforts to tackle deflation. After leaving its main policy unchanged at its latest board meeting, the central bank also said it would hold fewer policy-fixing meetings, bringing it in line with other major central banks. The BOJ said it would start releasing its outlook reports for growth and prices on a quarterly basis instead of twice a year, adding that it would also include the views of each member. The semiannual outlook report attracts close market attention and often sets the tone for monetary policy decisions. The bank’s last move to expand its easing measures came in October on the same day it released its outlook report. The change, which will come into effect in January, comes at a time when the BOJ is struggling to achieve its 2% inflation target at the earliest possible time. The central bank so far has failed to meet its initial goal of hitting the target in about two years, with consumer inflation hovering close to zero. In response to long-held criticism that the BOJ’s meetings are too frequent, the bank will also reduce the number of policy-setting meetings to eight from the current 14, and on par with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan said the change was “a step in the right direction” because the current number of meetings was unnecessarily large. But Mr. Kanno also expressed concern that fewer meetings may mean the release of the minutes would be further delayed. Currently the minutes are released about a month after each meet. The former BOJ official called for the time needed for publication of informative minutes to be shortened, citing the example of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which issues its minutes three weeks after each policy-setting meeting. In an apparent move to allay such criticism, the BOJ said it would release a summary of discussion about a week after each meeting. But it remains unclear how the summary will convey important remarks and information suggesting further changes in policy, Mr. Kanno said. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute said the changes will likely put a spotlight on policy meetings that come with the release of the outlook report, considering the bank’s tendency to adjust policy when it changes its price and growth projections. Wrapping up a two-day meeting, the central bank’s board voted 8-1 to stick with its asset purchases at an annual pace of Y80 trillion, in a sign that the bank remains confident of hitting its 2% inflation target by autumn of next year.
