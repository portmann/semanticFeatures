BOJ Expects New Inflation Measure to Rise - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of Japan expects a new measure of consumer price inflation to rise above 1% over the summer, adding to evidence that the economy is escaping more than a decade of deflation, people close to the central bank said. Officials recently began to release a consumer price index that strips out energy and fresh food prices in the central bank’s monthly economic report. The new index is an attempt to show the public that inflation is returning and that overall price growth is simply being masked by cheaper global oil costs. The new measure rose 0.7% in May. The reading of the BOJ price gauge is expected to go above 1% in the three months through September and keep climbing in the following quarters, the people said. Market analysts are already keeping an eye on the “BOJ core inflation” figure. HSBC economist Izumi Devalier said in a note that the new measure offers “a better read on trend inflation” than the government’s core inflation indicator, which excludes fresh food but includes energy. The BOJ metric also supports the bank’s view that “the underlying trend in prices remains intact,” she said. The broader core CPI index released by the government, meanwhile, is likely to “decisively” surpass 1% around the first quarter of next year, one of the people added, noting that the base effects of oil price falls will likely fade by then. The core index rose 0.1% in May. The internal projections underline confidence–and hopes–among central bank policy makers that the BOJ will achieve its 2% inflation target by the early autumn of next year, as it has promised to. That means the BOJ is nowhere closer to adding to its aggressive monetary easing program, which pumps Y80 trillion of new money every year into Japan’s banking system. The people rejected suggestions from private economists that wage growth is too modest to bring about sustainable 2% inflation within the bank’s time frame. The rate of base salary raises will reach around 1% next year compared with this year’s figure just below 0.7%, and hourly wage growth could get close to 2% in 2016, the people said. The concern is a decelerating Japanese economy. Economists slashed their April-June growth projections for Japan recently in light of ever-lackluster domestic consumption and weakening exports to China. The BOJ too thinks it “quite possible” that the economy contracted in the second quarter, one of the people said. Slowing Chinese growth is also chipping away at the BOJ’s confidence that Japan’s economy is going to regain its momentum in the third quarter partly on the back of exports, the people said.
