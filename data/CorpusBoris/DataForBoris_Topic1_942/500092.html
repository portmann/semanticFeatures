What The Lael Is Going On Here? - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha But important criteria for transparency to be meaningfully useful is that the information provided must be at least be somewhat organized and coherent. The Fed's effort at transparency is an utter mess thanks to their disorganized communications effort. I'm all for transparency. The more information that investors and the general public has as its disposal, the better. But important criteria for transparency to be meaningfully useful is that the information provided must be at least be somewhat organized and coherent. Otherwise, it can cause more harm and confusion than good. And when it comes to the Fed and their ongoing efforts at monetary policy transparency, it is an utter mess that is further damaging the confidence of already wildly distorted financial markets. So let's recap the events of the last two business days. On Friday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren took to the podium in Massachusetts at a breakfast speech to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce and voiced his support for an interest rate increase, as "a reasonable case can be made for a gradual normalization of monetary policy". These sentiments jived with comments recently voiced by Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. And for some reason, the market apparently decided to wake up to the fact that all of this talk about an interest rate hike and September "being on the table" might actually mean that the Fed might follow through with what some on the Fed have been saying that they would do. In response, the U.S. stock market woke violently from its slumber and made its first 1% move in either direction since the early summer, plunging by -2.45% and slicing below the bottom end of its tight sideways trading range since the immediate aftermath of the 'Brexit' vote. To this point, the communications transparency is reasonably OK. Not great and certainly lacking efficacy if they wanted to at least keep open the possibility of a September rate hike as the odds still lingered at a notably low one in four, but somewhat understandable nonetheless. And the cost of delivering this sentiment to the market was a -2.45% decline in the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA: SPY ), but it is widely understood by now that today's overinflated and distorted financial markets are going to have to endure an adjustment once the Fed finally musters the courage to make a move. But then we fast forward to Monday. Just late last week it was revealed that Fed Governor Lael Brainard would be speaking to The Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Monday, which marked the last day that Fed members would be available to speak publicly before the start of the blackout period leading up to their next FOMC meeting on September 20-21. The fact that one of the Fed's most dovish members was suddenly taking to the podium to effectively run the two-minute jawboning drill for the Fed had many investors speculating that she was being sent out to deliver the final set up for a September rate hike with a more hawkish message. The markets waited with baited breath to hear what she had to say. When her speech finally came, Ms. Brainard not only stood her dovish ground, she was arguably even more dovish than she had been in the recent past. And in some respects, her words ran in notable contradiction to the recent views expressed by other voting members at the Fed including Ms. Yellen and Mr. Fischer. The markets, which were already in rally mode, rejoiced at the supportive tones from Ms. Brainard as the Fed's speaking clock ran out and regained much of the ground lost during Friday's trading. All of this raises a number of important questions about exactly what the Fed is doing here with their hash of a communications policy. First, what exactly has been the point of allowing all of these Fed officials to trot out in front of their various audiences to express their views on monetary policy? You had Mr. Rosengren out on Friday, and his hawkish words helped spark the market to a -53 point plunge on the S&P 500 Index. The next trading day on Monday, you had Ms. Brainard with notably contrasting dovish sentiments that helped to spark the market to a +31 point rebound on the S&P 500 Index. What good did having these two speakers talk do at the end of the day? I am all for economists expressing their views on monetary policy and the future direction of interest rates. But these folks have the unusual power of having direct control over setting what future interest rates are going to be. And over the last several years, the Fed officials have supplanted normal market fundamentals through their repeated policy actions and interventions. As a result, they have left us with a market today that hangs on their every word about what might come next. So what exactly is the benefit then to have these two voting members of the FOMC on the last two days before the blackout period go out and express such widely different views on the future direction of interest rates? Were Rosengren's sentiments a trial balloon? Most likely not, as he did not say anything different than what other officials have been saying since late July. But if it was a trial balloon, is the reaction over a single trading day a sufficiently long time period to gauge how the market might actually handle a rate hike in September or even December? Were Brainard's comments designed to put a lid on any speculation that the Fed might raise rates in September? Perhaps, and more than understandable given the fact that the Fed's credibility is increasingly on the line. But why then would the Fed allow so many other members trot out in front of their respective audiences in recent days to talk up the possibility of a rate hike sooner rather than later? And what about the Fed keeping their options open for a rate hike in September? Despite all of their pontifications about higher rates since late July, the market still did not really believe they were going to raise interest rates on September 20-21 anyway, as the odds were still a notably low 25%. As a result, all of their heavy lifting through Rosengren's speech on Friday had at least left the Fed in the ideal spot where the market did not expect a rate hike but still left the door open enough of crack so that it would not be a complete surprise if they did decide at the end of the day to move in September. Thanks to Brainard's speech, they have effectively taken September off of the table despite their repeated proclamations to the contrary and eliminated their flexibility as a result. The Fed Needs To Fix Its Broken Communications Problem The endless contractions from the cacophony of Fed speakers is a communications problem that the Fed needs to fix immediately. They through their endless policy interventions have made themselves the only game in town. This fact alone is fraught with tremendous problems, but it is the reality that investors must now navigate. And given the powerful position they have assumed, the least that they could do is to communicate as a group with much greater organization, cohesion and purpose around their message. If they must be allowed to go in front of audiences and speak at all, and I for one genuinely wish that they were not allowed to do so, at least stop causing unnecessary confusion by having your individual members spew views that are widely disconnected from one another. At a minimum, come together as a group, form a consensus around the direction of policy in the short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term, and then send out your members to speak to this organized message in a more purposeful and structured way. Also, for the love of humanity, please figure out what the direction of policy is going to be going forward and stick to a disciplined plan. In other words, stop, stop, STOP reacting to what is taking place in capital markets on a daily basis. You are not day traders but members of the U.S. Federal Reserve with 14-year appointed terms intended by design to insulate you from the capriciousness that can sometimes come with the day-to-day headlines. Ignore a -53 point plunge in the S&P 500 Index on any given trading day or a -7% decline in the S&P over a handful of weeks for that matter and take the long-term view once and for all to finally fix the underlying structural problems that continue to plague our economy after so many years. Despite my ongoing protestations, ours is not to reason why but to execute in the market environment with which we are left to navigate. And now that the Fed has been muzzled until their next policy meeting (the silence will end all too quickly), we are left with the following. First, despite Monday's bounce, the sideways trading range on the S&P 500 Index remains broken to the downside. Monday's rally brought stocks back to the very bottom of this range, but it appears support has become resistance as the market has failed at this level and has fallen back to the downside on Tuesday morning. The longer that the S&P 500 goes without reclaiming the 2057 range, the more likely stocks will continue to the downside. Second, the Fed through their latest pontifications has once again painted themselves into a corner. If they do not raise interest rates as expected in September, the market may rally but it has the potential to be fleeting at best. On the other hand, if the Fed decides that it wants to regain credibility and raise interest rates with a degree of surprise a la December 2013 when the Fed surprised the market by starting to taper QE3, they have increased the probability that the market will be shocked by this outcome thanks to Brainard's dovish kneel down to run out the Fed's speaking clock on Monday. As a result, stock investors are now confronted with greater risks to the downside than the upside resulting from Fed policy in the coming days. Lastly, it is important to remember that whether the Fed raises in September, December or looks to 2017, they continue to have a hawkish bias. And this hawkish bias exists in an economy that is increasingly showing signs of peaking and slowly weakening after a now tired and lackluster expansion during the post crisis period. Put simply, this is no longer a Fed that is definitively supportive of higher asset prices but instead one that is reluctantly working toward being less supportive of asset prices. Given the existing backdrop of declining corporate earnings growth and historically high valuations, such an environment is negative for stocks and supportive of bonds including U.S. Treasuries. More defensive stocks that have been highly correlated with U.S. Treasuries such as utilities and consumer staples also stand to benefit, although all will be prone to short-term pressures during periods when the market is actively contemplating the possibility that the Fed might actually raise interest rates such as in recent days. Overall, most everything outside of commodities and precious metals are expensive in the current market environment. The importance of diversification and risk control are as great as ever today. And the Fed is not helping in this regard thanks to their steady parade of contradictory speakers. The least they could do is help manage their communications better to reduce this risk for investors. Disclosure: This article is for information purposes only.
