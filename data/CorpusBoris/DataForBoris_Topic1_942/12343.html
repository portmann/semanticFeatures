Fed’s Evans: Central Bank Shouldn’t Raise Rates This Year - Real Time Economics - WSJ Overly weak inflation and a lack of evidence suggesting price pressures are about to heat up means the Fed shouldn’t raise interest rates this year, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said in a speech Wednesday. “I think economic conditions are likely to evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to hold off on raising short-term rates until 2016,” Mr. Evans said. While the economy is growing and adding jobs at a very healthy clip, inflation remains well under the 2% level targeted by the Fed, and that argues for caution, he said. Mr. Evans’ comments came from the text of a speech prepared for delivery in London. The official is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC met last week in a gathering that continued to prepare the way for an increase in what are now near-zero short-term rates. Most central bankers support such a move this year, believing that growth is likely to continue and that inflation, currently weighed down by temporary factors like a sharp drop in oil, will rise back to the desired level over time. While a number of Fed officials share Mr. Evans’s worry about inflation, most officials appear to agree the door to rate rises comes with the Fed’s mid-June policy meeting. In a speech Monday evening, San Francisco Fed President John Williams, also an FOMC voter, said, “I think that by midyear it will be the time to have a discussion about starting to raise rates.” In his speech, Mr. Evans shared the optimism his colleagues have about the economy. But he again cautioned the Fed faces serious problems if it raises rates too soon. “Given uncomfortably low inflation and an uncertain global environment, there are significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely,” Mr. Evans said. “A prudent risk-management and goal-oriented approach to U.S. monetary policy dictates that we continue to assess inflation developments for some time before generating more restrictive financial conditions,” he said. Mr. Evans believes the Fed will see inflation back at 2% in 2018. He said to be confident inflation is moving in the right direction, he needs to see some pick up in core price measures that strip out food and energy prices, accelerating wage gains, as well as firmer public and market expectations that prices are going to rise from current levels. “It would be very surprising if inflation did not pick up to 2%,” Mr. Evans told reporters after his speech. “I don’t have the same confidence in the time frame. It would pay off to look at a little more data.” He said the fact that inflation remains low raises questions about whether the Fed’s monetary policy is “as accommodative as we think.” The official expects to see 3% U.S. growth over the next couple of years, and he said above-trend monthly job gains of over 200,000 will likely persist for some time. He said the current 5.5% jobless rate remains above the 5% level he views as signaling full employment, or the point at which further job gains will start creating mounting price pressures. Mr. Evans said the fact that wage growth remains low “makes you wonder if slack isn’t larger” than unemployment rates indicate. Mr. Evans fretted about the effect of the rising dollar on inflation. A strong dollar makes import prices lower and dampens inflation, and this situation has been a point of concern for some. “The stronger dollar presents a clear disinflationary pressure,” at a time where “dramatic” declines in oil prices are also leading to lower inflation, Mr. Evans said. The key is whether these two forces leave a lasting mark on inflation, he said. Mr. Evans said developments outside the U.S. pose the greatest threat to sustained economic growth. “The global environment is uncertain,” he warned. Mr. Evans also said that while low interest rates may pose some risks for the stability of the financial system, it would be “very costly” to mitigate those risks by raising short-term rates.
