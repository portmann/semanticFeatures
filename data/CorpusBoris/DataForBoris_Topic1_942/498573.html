Federal Reserve Not Ready For September Rate Increase | Seeking Alpha Various Federal Reserve officials continue to talk about the possibility of increasing the Fed's policy rate at its September FOMC meeting. In terms of the Fed's balance sheet, nothing has been done to prepare the market for such an increase. The Fed reduced "excess reserves" in the banking system in the two months before such an increase in the policy rate last December. The Federal Reserve, in my mind, has not prepared itself for an increase in their policy rate of interest at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. I think that such a raise was highly unlikely anyway, coming right before a presidential election, but, Fed officials have kept up "the talk" about the possibility of such an increase. I just don't think that these Fed officials are "walking the walk." As I wrote last December, before the Fed did raise the rate at their December meeting, the Federal Reserve had prepared for such an increase by reducing the "excess reserves" that were in the banking system. The Federal Reserve efforts, in viewing their balance sheet, began to prepare for such an increase in the middle of October. Thus, the Fed's move in December was not a hasty move, but one that Fed officials had prepared for over the two months that preceded the meeting. No such preparation is being done at this time. In fact, excess reserves in the banking system have actually increased by $46 billion over the past three weeks. They have also risen by $183 billion since June 30, 2016. The Federal Reserve does not publish a number for excess reserves in the banking system anymore, but the statistic "Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks" which can be obtained from the Fed's H.4.1 statistical release can, and has, served as a proxy for these excess reserves. The only thing missing is vault cash held by banks, which is generally minimal. In the past week alone, these reserve balances have risen by $151 billion, primarily due to the Fed's reduction in its use of the reverse repurchase agreements. Reverse repos dropped $103 billion in the latest banking week. They are down $84 billion since June 30. The other factor impacting bank reserve balances, is the reduction in the Treasury's General Account at the Fed. In the past banking week, this account fell by $51 billion. Since June 30, the General Account has fallen by $117 billion. This is not a balance sheet that is showing Fed preparations for a rise in its policy rate of interest. During the month of August, the effective Federal Funds rate, the interest rate the Fed targets, averaged 40 basis points. In May, the rate averaged 37 basis points; in June, 38 basis points; and in July, 39 basis points. Thus, the Fed's target rate of interest has remained, roughly, in the middle of the range set of it at the December meeting of the FOMC. In summary, I don't believe that the Fed is going to make a change in its policy rate of interest at its September meeting. Federal Reserve officials, in my mind, would be doing more to prepare for a rate increase at its September meeting than just "talking" about such an increase. Furthermore, the economic data don't really seem to be that strong. Consequently, I don't see another rate increase coming this year.
