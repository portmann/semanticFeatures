Fed’s Mester Comfortable With Raising Rates ‘Relatively Soon’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ The U.S. economy has improved to a point where the risks of delaying policy tightening by the Federal Reserve could soon outweigh the benefits of keeping rates near zero, a top Fed official said Thursday, suggesting a June liftoff in rates is possible if incoming data allow. “If it turns out that the incoming information shows that growth is regaining momentum after the first-quarter slowdown and more broadly supports my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff relatively soon,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said in remarks prepared for delivery before the Forecasters Club of New York. Responding to media questions, the central banker said “relatively soon” means any of the upcoming policy gatherings beyond the April 28-29 meeting is fair game, stressing that her view will depend on how the economy evolves. The Fed’s most recent policy statement has already ruled out taking action in April. In March, Ms. Mester said she considered June to be “a viable option” for the Fed to kick off its tightening process. The Fed in March removed language from its policy statement that the central bank would remain “patient” about raising interest rates. Ms. Mester said Thursday she supported that wording change, which has given the Fed flexibility to act. Ms. Mester on Thursday acknowledged the disappointing data on economic activity in the first quarter, but said she views the slowdown as “temporary,” driven by factors such as harsh winter weather. The official expects the U.S. economy to bounce back with an average 3% growth for the balance of the year and through 2016, which she expects to help lift inflation toward the Fed’s 2% long-run goal by late 2016. The official also acknowledged the U.S. dollar’s strength is likely to weigh on exports. But she views the dollar’s moves as an inherent part of how the U.S. economy evolves, noting that a stronger greenback can come around to help the U.S. economy in the long run. Ms. Mester’s comments come in contrast to remarks on Thursday from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , who said the strong dollar may require the Fed to delay raising rates. In assessing the broader trends in the economy since the recession, Ms. Mester said the U.S. has made significant strides with the help of highly accommodative policy from the Fed. But the central bank should soon gradually back away from its extraordinarily easy stance, which she believes the economy can handle. “Although the [Federal Open Market] Committee has been appropriately cautious, the improvement in underlying economic fundamentals consistent with my outlook indicates that the expansion would not be adversely affected by a gradual increase in the policy rate from zero,” said Ms. Mester, who doesn’t hold a voting slot this year on the Fed’s policy-setting panel. “Liftoff means a reduction in the degree of extraordinary policy accommodation; it doesn’t mean tight policy.” The central banker added that the sooner the Fed pulls the trigger on raising rates, the easier it would be for the Fed to implement a gradual tightening process. “A delay [to liftoff] that’s too long might risk having to move rates up more steeply in order to promote attainment of our goals over time,” she said. Longer term, Ms. Mester said holding off on raising rates would also pose risks to financial stability. Of course, the Fed’s policy decisions will depend on incoming economic data, Ms. Mester reiterated, echoing a message all Fed officials have been stressing in recent months. She said she isn’t reading too much into the latest employment report, which showed just 126,000 jobs added in March, noting there are two more monthly employment reports to help the Fed decide how to act in June.
