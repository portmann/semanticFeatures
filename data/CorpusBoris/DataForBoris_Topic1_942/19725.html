Grand Central: Ben Bernanke Unchained Takes on Larry Summers  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Congress Wants More Answers on Possible Fed Leaks Earlier this week, Ben Bernanke challenged critics who blame the Fed for forcing senior citizens and savers to live with low returns on fixed income investments. Now he is going after Lawrence Summers , the Harvard University professor and former Obama administration economist who was a rival for the Fed job when Mr. Bernanke was being considered for a second term in 2009. Mr. Summers has been arguing that the U.S. is experiencing low interest rates because the U.S. economy is stuck in a long period of slow economic growth known as â€œsecular stagnationâ€? and marked by very low investment and consumption . Mr. Bernanke doesnâ€™t buy the argument. Exceptionally low interest rates ought to make almost any kind of investment more attractive, he argues. Speaking figuratively, he says it would even pay to knock down the Rocky Mountains to lower the fuel costs of driving across them. (He borrows this argument from Mr. Summers own uncle, the late Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson.) Moreover, in a world of secular stagnation, weak growth prospects would put downward pressure on the currency and spur exports, he says. In short, Mr. Bernanke argues rates canâ€™t stay low forever, because they eventually spur the kind of investment and spending that drive growth higher and warrant higher interest. Instead, Mr. Bernanke sides with economists who believe slow U.S. growth since the 2007-2009 financial crisis is the result of â€œtemporary headwinds.â€? This argument about secular stagnation is a test of faith for many economists. Nobody knows how fast the economy can grow in the long-run. But few can accept the idea that the economic engine that is the U.S. has been permanently idled. Mr. Bernanke notes that the idea of secular stagnation was popular after the Great Depression as well, and proved wrong. Eventually growth will pick up â€“ Mr. Summersâ€™ critics believe â€“ and rates in turn will go higher. Fed’s Lacker Sees â€˜Strong Caseâ€™ for June Rate Increase. â€œI expect that, unless incoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will remain strong at the June meeting,â€? Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said Tuesday. Once rates begin to rise, Mr. Lacker said, the Fed â€œneeds to be ready for the possibility that we could need to tighten more rapidly than people expect.â€? Fedâ€™s George Says Itâ€™s Time to Discuss Rate Increases. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said Tuesday that given the improvements in U.S. economic growth and apparently relatively stable prices, itâ€™s entirely appropriate to talk about raising short-term interest rates from near zero. â€œThe sooner we do it the better,â€? Ms. George said during an appearance in New York. Congress Wants More Answers on Possible Fed Leaks.Â U.S. lawmakers want additional answers from the Federal Reserve about published reports on the details of market-sensitive policy deliberations in 2012. Fed Officials Say Shadow-Bank Risk Worth Watching. Fed officials are continuing to fret about the growing role of non-banks in providing credit in the global economy. At a conference in Georgia, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart noted so-called shadow banksâ€™ â€œlarge, growing presenceâ€? and pointed out that sector is â€œmuch less regulated than banks.â€? Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said regulators should be focused on regulatory gaps, noting there are no longer â€œbright linesâ€? between banks and non-banks, but instead â€œ50 Shades of Grey.â€? She quipped, â€œAnd as you know with â€˜50 Shades of Grey,â€™ it can be painful.â€? â€“Dow Jones Newswires. ECB Will Want to See Inflation Hardening Around 2% Mark, Draghi Says. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said in remarks published Wednesday that in assessing the path of inflation, the ECB will not only want to see inflation approach the 2% mark, but also hardening around that level . Eurozone Bank Supervisor Outlines Priorities for Year. Teams made up of European Central Bank employees and staff from national authorities â€œare checking that banks are taking those findings on board, and that they are effectively and consistently implementing other remedial actions arising from the exercise and properly addressing any residual shortcomings ,â€? said Daniele Nouy, the chairwoman of the ECBâ€™s supervisory arm, the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Irish Central Banker Absolves the Euro of Blame. Currency regimes matter less to the success or failure of economies than the quality of the policies pursued by governments and central banks, the governor of Irelandâ€™s central bank said. Chinaâ€™s Small Businesses Lose Out on Cheaper Loans.Â When Chinese businessman Howard Wang wanted to borrow cash to open a new factory making chemical fibers in the eastern province of Jiangsu, he found local banks too expensive and turned elsewhere. â€œSmall, risk-prone businesses like mine can basically forget about getting loans from banks,â€™â€™ said 42-year-old Mr. Wang, whose small company mostly exports its products. â€œTheir loans are either unavailable or way too expensive, despite the recent interest-rate cuts by the central bank. â€? Japanese Banker Says New Basel Capital Rule Would Hurt Economy. A tougher capital requirement meant to protect banks from losses due to rising interest rates could weigh on the global economy , said Yasuhiro Sato, the newly appointed chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association. Viewing the U.K.â€™s GDP Numbers in a Less Favorable Light. The Office for National Statistics, in its third and final review of Britainâ€™s economic performance, said the U.K. economy grew 2.8% in 2014, which is more than their previous estimate of 2.6% annual growth for the year. But a look at economic output per head, reached by dividing GDP by the number of people living in the country, growth was less robust. On that basis, Britain grew just 2.2% in 2014 . -Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart chairs a panel at a conference in Stone Mountain, Ga. at 10:30 a.m. EDT RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Boston Fed Knows How Many Dollar Bills You Have. How many one-dollar bills are on you, right now? You might need to check your purse, pocket or wallet to get that answer. But if you are the average American, a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has an answer: three. The Youngest Baby Boomers Got Their Biggest Raises Early. The youngest boomers saw rapid wage growth when they were young, even though for many this period occurred during the recession of the early 1980s, according to a Labor Department survey . As the boomers continued to age, they mostly saw steady wage growth in their late 20s and early 30s, a period that mostly coincided with the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s. But their 40s were rough on the youngest baby boomers. More College Degrees Arenâ€™t Enough to Wipe Out Inequality. Better education would lift the earnings of men in the bottom half of the income scale but wouldnâ€™t be enough to erase inequality between the rich and poor, according to a new paper by economists Brad Hershbein, Melissa Kearney and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers . Why Ben Bernanke Isnâ€™t Buying the Secular Stagnation Thesis. Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman , outlined three reasons why heâ€™s skeptical of the secular stagnation thesis in a blog post on Tuesday. Those reasons â€œgo beyond the fact that the U.S. economy looks to be well on the way to full employment today,â€? he writes. The Fed Needs to Step Up Its Pace of Rate Increases. “The Fedâ€¦wants to bring the overall unemployment rate substantially below 5.5% because of concern about part-time workers, or those too discouraged even to look for work — a group not traditionally counted as unemployed,” economist Martin Feldstein writes in a Journal op-ed. “There is no doubt real hardship among this group — but it is wrong to think that this group can be helped by monetary policy without triggering an inflationary spiral.” Missing Deflation and the Argument for Inflation. “Matthew Klein has been going through Fed transcripts from 2009, and notes that the Fed was surprised at the persistence of inflation despite the Great Recession,” Paul Krugman writes on his New York Times blog. “Oddly, however, he seems to suggest that this episode weakens the case I and others have been making for a higher inflation target. Actually, it strengthens that case.” -The U.S. Treasury said Tuesday it imposed sanctions on an official at the Syrian central bank, as well as three front companies linked to a Syrian government agency involved in weapons production. -U.S. home prices started 2015 registering modest growth, but home values are still growing far faster than average wages are. -Manufacturing activity in the eurozone grew more rapidly during March than first estimated and at the fastest pace in 10 months, according to surveys of purchasing managers, while the weaker euro boosted new orders from overseas buyers. -Two measures of Chinaâ€™s factory outlook registered an improvement in March, suggesting that government moves to boost the worldâ€™s second-largest economy are having an impact . -Sentiment among Japan’s big manufacturers barely changed in the three months to January, the Bank of Japan’s quarterly tankan survey showed Wednesday, despite expectations that the weak yen would improve their mood.
