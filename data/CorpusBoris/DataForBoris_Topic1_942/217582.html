5 Things to Watch at This Weekâ€™s Fed Meeting - WSJ TheÂ Federal ReserveÂ will likely lay low this week after Septemberâ€™s nail-biter of a meetingÂ  ended with a decision to hold short-term interest rates near zero . The two-day policy meeting that begins Tuesday isnâ€™t expected to generate the Fedâ€™s first rate increase in nearly a decade, Chairwoman Janet Yellen isnâ€™t scheduled to hold a press conference and officials wonâ€™t release updated economic projections. The central bankâ€™s new policy statement could offer clues about whether officials expect a rate increase in December, orÂ  if theyâ€™re leaning toward another delay . But donâ€™t expect any definitive signals as Ms. Yellen and her colleagues await more data on the state of the U.S. economy. Hereâ€™s what to watch Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT. A rate increase this week would shock forecasters and financial markets, which have all but written off the possibility of an October liftoff in the face of weakness overseas and slower hiring at home . A move may come in December , when officials will have more data on hand to assess the economy. Plus, the Fedâ€™s Dec. 15-16 meeting will be followed by Ms. Yellenâ€™s quarterly news conference. The Fed is concerned about the global economy, so itsÂ  September statement said the central bank was â€œmonitoring developments abroad.â€? The Fed also worries about stubbornly sluggish U.S. inflation, so the statement said it â€œcontinues to monitor inflation developments closely.â€? Watch those sentences closely for any changes on Wednesday. If the Fed stopped saying it was monitoring developments abroad or inflation developments, it could be a sign that those concerns have faded and lower the bar for a rate increase in December. The September policy statement featured a new sentence that reflected growing worries about overseas weakness and the dollarâ€™s rise: â€œRecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.â€? If those 25 words stay in the October statement, it couldÂ signal continued trepidation that mightÂ make a December liftoff less likely. The Fed has said it wonâ€™t raise rates until officials are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that inflation will rise toward the central bankâ€™s 2% annual target. Key officials appear divided on the question. Ms. Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer Â have said inflation is likely poised to accelerate as the labor market continues to improve, requiring higher interest rates to keep it in check. But two Fed governors, Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo, recently aired doubts about the inflation outlook and argued for a cautious approach to raising rates. Keep an eye on the references to inflation in the first and second paragraphs of the policy statement for any tweaks that could reflect evolving views within the Fed. The most likely source of public dissent on Wednesday is Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker. He was on the losing side of Septemberâ€™s 9-1 vote and might again defy the rest of the rate-setting Federal Open Market CommitteeÂ toÂ support an immediate rate increase. â€œMy views havenâ€™t changed much since September,â€? Mr. Lacker said earlier this month . • You must enter the verification code below to send.
