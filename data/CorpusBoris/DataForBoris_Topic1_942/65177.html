BOEâ€™s Shafik: UKâ€™s Prospects Not As Gloomy As Interest Rates Imply  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of England Deputy Governor Minouche Shafik said she expects wage growth and productivity growth to resume in the U.K. and for the recent weakness of inflation to pass. LONDONâ€”A top Bank of England official on Friday painted an upbeat picture of the U.K. economyâ€™s prospects , saying the outlook isnâ€™t as gloomy as some financial market signals imply. Minouche Shafik, in her first major speech on monetary policy since joining the BOE as deputy governor for markets and banking in August, said that low long-term interest rates in the U.K. shouldnâ€™t be taken as evidence that Britainâ€™s future prospects have dramatically deteriorated. She said that she expects wage growth and productivity growth to resume in the U.K. and for the recent weakness of inflation to pass. Her remarks suggest she is comfortable with expectations that Â BOE officials will begin slowly raising their benchmark interest rates from a record low of 0.5% in the middle of next year. Long-term interest rates in the U.K., as measured by the yield on 20-year government bonds, have been on a long decline, falling from around 17% in the 1970s to around 2% currently, Ms. Shafik told the Association of Corporate Treasurersâ€™ annual conference in Manchester, England, according to a text of her remarks. Those rates imply that investors doubt the BOEâ€™s benchmark interest rate will rise any higher than 2.5% for the next 20 years, about half its average level precrisis. â€œFrom that it would be easy to infer that financial markets are expecting either very low investment or very low inflation, or both,â€? Ms. Shafik said. But she said there are a variety of reasons why long-term rates are so low and that this decline in long-term borrowing costs â€œshould not be mistaken for a gloomy prognosis of long-term growth and inflation prospects in the U.K.â€? Ms. Shafik said long-term rates have been driven down worldwide by factors including a global savings glut, exacerbated by government, business and household efforts to pay down debts. In the U.K., feeble wage growth, poor productivity and low inflation have all been taken as signs the economy may struggle to recover its prerecession verve. But Ms. Shafik said she expects productivity growth to recover â€œover the next year or so,â€? and for wage growth to accelerate as workers become more confident about demanding pay rises. She added she expects annual inflation to pick up also as factors bearing down on price growth, such as a slump in the oil price, start to fade. Ms. Shafik cautioned there is a risk that the damaging effects of the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008 and 2009 prove more persistent than forecast. She explained that caution is behind her decision to keep the BOEâ€™s benchmark rate unchanged for now.
