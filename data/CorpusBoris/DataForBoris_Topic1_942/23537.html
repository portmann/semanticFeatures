Fed’s Powell: Gradual Rate Increases Could Help Heal Lasting Damage From the Financial Crisis - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve is on track to raise short-term interest rates later this year, though the central bank should increase rates at a gradual pace to help the U.S. economy heal at least some of the structural damage left by the financial crisis, Fed governor Jerome Powell said Wednesday. “The financial crisis did significant damage to the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent and duration that cannot be fully known today,” Mr. Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “Given this uncertainty, it is even more difficult than usual to assess how much slack remains. It seems plausible that at least part of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.” Most Fed policy makers, including Mr. Powell, expect to begin raising interest rates in 2015 as the economy improves, though the precise timing of the first increase remains uncertain. “I expect that economic conditions will support the first rate increase later this year,” he said. “I do not expect that such an increase or the associated market reaction will materially restrain the progress of the economy.” There have been signs of a recent slowdown in U.S. economic growth, including a sharp deceleration in hiring during March. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley on Monday shrugged off the first-quarter weakness, saying it largely reflects “temporary factors” like harsh winter weather in the Northeast and Midwest “to a significant degree.” Mr. Powell on Wednesday offered a generally upbeat assessment of economic conditions: “We have already seen a great deal of progress in the labor market,” he said, “and I expect that progress to continue.” Despite March’s slowdown, he added, “job creation has been particularly strong over the past two years.” The unemployment rate also has declined, though Mr. Powell noted it “probably understates the amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.” He also said he expects U.S. inflation will begin to rebound once “two transient shocks” — a plunge in global oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar, which makes imports cheaper — begin to fade. Inflation has undershot the Fed’s 2% annual target for nearly three years, but Mr. Powell said he expects price gains will rise toward that goal “over the medium term” as the economy improves. A number of top officials have signaled that the central bank, once it begins to raise interest rates, will probably move slowly on tightening policy. Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month that the Fed would likely take a “gradualist approach” in the years ahead. Mr. Powell on Wednesday said he expects rates will rise “fairly gradually” in part because of “the unusually high level of uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.” The financial crisis dealt substantial damage to the supply side of the economy, he said, and much of it may prove permanent. “Nonetheless, it seems plausible that at least part of the damage can be reversed,” he said. “As business confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with an extended spell of unemployment. A stronger job market and rising wages may encourage more potential workers to join the labor force. Over a longer period, stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity.” Most of the policies needed to promote that healing are outside the Fed’s responsibility, Mr. Powell said, but the central bank “has a role to play by continuing to support the expansion,” so long as inflation remains in check. A gradual increase in rates, he said, “would, among other benefits, give our economy the best chance to make up lost ground.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
