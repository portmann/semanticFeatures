U.S. Inflation Undershoots Fedâ€™s 2% Target for 37th Consecutive Month  - Real Time Economics - WSJ The personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fedâ€™s preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.2% last month Â from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was unchanged from Aprilâ€™s revised annual reading and down from 0.3% annual growth in March. Price gains have undershot the Fedâ€™s goal for 37 straight months, the longest stretch of sub-2% inflation since the first half of the 1960s. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, prices rose 1.2% in May from a year earlier, slipping from revised annual gains of 1.3% in April and 1.4% in March. Core inflation in May posted its smallest annual growth since February 2014. Two other broad gauges of U.S. prices jumped in May. The Labor Departmentâ€™s closely watched consumer-price index posted its largest one-month gain in more than two years and the agencyâ€™s producer-price index saw its sharpest increase in nearly three years . Still, annual inflation remained subdued in both reports. The consumer-price index was unchanged in May from a year earlier, and producer prices fell 1.1% on the year. Monroe, Mich.-based furniture company La-Z Boy Inc. isn’t feeling much pinch from rising prices right now. “Last year we did have raw material price pressures and we took some price increases to cover that,” Chief Executive Kurt Darrow told analysts last week. “This year, as we look out sitting here today, we don’t see much of that on the horizon and we haven’t done anything pricing-wise to mitigate that.” The Fed has said it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been pinned near zero since December 2008, when the labor market has improved further and officials are â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that inflation will soon move back to 2%. The plunge in oil prices since mid-2014 has dragged down overall inflation, while the strong dollar has made imports into the U.S. cheaper. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen last week noted that â€œenergy prices appear to have stabilized recently.â€? But she also said non-oil import prices have continued to fall , â€œand I think thatâ€™s serving to push down core inflation a little bit. Eventually I expect that impact to ebb, but it is a factor affecting the outlook.â€?
