5 Things to Watch in the Fedâ€™s July Meeting Minutes - WSJ The Federal Reserve on Wednesday releases minutes of its July 28-29 policy meeting, a fresh opportunity to send a signal about how close it is to raising short-term interest rates from near zero. The minutes come just four weeks before the central bank’sÂ  Sept. 16-17 policy meeting. Several officials have indicated they are considering a move in September, but the Fed was careful to keep its options open in its July policy statement. The minutes could reveal more details of the internal discussions at last month’s meeting. Here are five things to watch in the minutes to be released at 2 p.m. EDT. Fed officials earlier this year decided not to provide anÂ â€œexplicit indicationâ€? in their policy statement when a rate increase became imminent, according to the April meeting minutes . Still, theÂ July minutes could serve as the vehicle for some message about the likelihood of a move at the Sept. 16-17Â meeting. Most private economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this monthÂ  already expected a September liftoff , but some policy makers have indicated the decision could go either way.Â â€œNothing has been decided,” Fed governor Jerome Powell said two weeks ago . While the FedÂ wants toÂ  avoid any surprises that could unsettle financial markets , it also may seekÂ to retain flexibility andÂ  keep its options open . Financial markets see September as a tossup . There was a subtle but significant change in the July policy statement: The Fed continued to say it would wait to raise rates until officials were â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will return to the central bankâ€™s 2% target, but it also said it wanted to see â€œsome further improvementâ€? in the labor market instead of simply â€œfurther improvement.â€? The minutes might explain why officials made the tweak, andÂ what it means going forward. Inflation has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target for more than three years and market expectations for inflation appear to be dropping . But Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart told the Journal this month there are some signs that price gains â€œseem to be firmingâ€? in recent months. The minutes could provide an update onÂ theÂ Fed’s internal debate aboutÂ the inflation outlook, a key factor in their looming decision on interest rates. Key passagesÂ are often foundÂ toward the end of the minutes, in the sections describing the participants’ discussion of the economy and policy. Both offer direct insight into officials’ thinking. Several key clues have emerged there in recent months, including a line in the April minutes that said a June rate increase was unlikely Â and the June minutes’ revelation that one member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee â€œindicated a readinessâ€? to raise rates â€œbut also expressed a willingness to wait another meeting or two for additional data.” It’s important to keep in mindÂ that since the minutes are released with a three-week lag, they don’t capture how theÂ landscape has changed since the Fed’s July meeting. There have been quite a few economic developments in recent weeks that will factor intoÂ the Fed’s decision in September. China’s currency devaluation and a continued slide in oil prices seem to weigh against raising rates, while solid hiring during July supports the case for moving. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
