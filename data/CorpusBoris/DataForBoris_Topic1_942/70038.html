Fed Should Consider New Ways to Counter Weak Growth, Bullard Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ James Bullard says it’s time for the Fed to consider adopting a nominal gross domestic product target–and he’s got a model to prove it. The Federal Reserve should consider new policy options, including directly targeting a non-inflation-adjusted level of economic growth, after more than six years of sustained monetary easing failed to spur a boom, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Thursday. â€œItâ€™s time to question the current theory and explore other models about whatâ€™s going on at the zero lower bound,â€? Mr. Bullard said, referring to the Fedâ€™s zero-rates policy that has been in place since December 2008. Mr. Bullard was presenting new research conducted with three other economists that he says shows â€œthe monetary authority may credibly promise to increase the price levelâ€¦to maintain a smoothly functioning credit market.â€? The model could be â€œbroadly viewed as a version of nominal GDP targeting,â€? the paper says, referring to a policy in which a central bank would set a target for gross domestic product growth without an inflation adjustment. The idea would be to signal to markets and the public that the Fed is serious about generating a recovery, thereby spurring investment and spending. The work, which questions the effectiveness of asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates undertaken by the Fed during the recession and its aftermath, represents a shift for Mr. Bullard, who had long been a strong supporter of bond purchases. â€œIt is unclear how the central bank could use such an intervention to maintain complete credit markets,â€? the paper suggests. The Fed has more than quintupled its balance sheet to $4.5 trillion since before the recession through purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds aimed at keeping long-term rates down. Mr. Bullard, speaking to reporters in a teleconference press briefing, said his paper was meant to stimulate long-term research and policy debate, not inform immediate policy decisions as the central bankâ€™s June meeting looms. â€œThereâ€™s a long way to go here to sort this out intellectually about what the profession thinks aboutâ€¦all this.â€? He said his model is consistent with the Fed maintaining its 2% inflation target, but would simply mean the central bank would work more aggressively to counter any undershooting or overshooting of that objective. For instance, a nominal GDP target would have likely prescribed even more aggressive Fed monetary easing during the crisis-ridden 2007-2009 period, Mr. Bullard said. â€œIf you took this paper seriously we should have done even more in 2007-2009,â€? he said. â€œSomething like nominal GDP targeting, if itâ€™s appropriately formulated, does look like optimal policy.â€? previous EU Official Requests ‘Detailed Account’ of ECB Coeure’s Comments We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

The only way to counter weak economic Growth is to increase aggregate demand. That will require competing in the global marketplace and the disposable income and wealth of Americans to rise. But realizing that goal will require a combination of: (a) decreasing big Government, regulation, (b) requiring that individual Americans exercise personal responsibility by putting off short term gratification long enough to prepare themselves with an advanced education, a specialized skill or starting a new business to provide themselves and their families with a measure of financial security and (c) restarting the mighty engines of free enterprise by keeping government from determining economic winners and losers! Whose kidding who?  NEVER HAPPEN! â€œpromise to increase the price levelâ€¦to maintain a smoothly functioning credit market.â€? Its hard to increase price levels with Central Banks stimulus inflating capacity bubbles.  Look at the over-capacity in oil, steel, coal, retail, manufacturing, autos, and agriculture. The hubris of FED officials is astounding: â€œIf you took this paper seriously we should have done even more in 2007-2009,â€? he said. â€œSomething like nominal GDP targeting, if itâ€™s appropriately formulated, does look like optimal policy.â€? The problem with what we did, is that we didn't do enough. Mind blowing with a $4.5 trillion balance sheet. US monetary policy has done what it can to stimulate our economy; its done a great job but can only go so far. Now, fiscal policy is needed to really stimulate growth. The Government needs to invest more in infrastructure, education, and R&D -and less on our inflated defense budget; all of the first 3 investments have proven to have a high government multiplier on GDP (FDR's New Deal). The only problem to solve is: how do we pay for this? The answer: not with Christie's new 3-tiered tax system. previous EU Official Requests ‘Detailed Account’ of ECB Coeure’s Comments Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
