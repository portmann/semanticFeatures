BOJ Lowers Price Forecasts, Stands Pat on Policy - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Bank of Japan tempered its optimism on prices in a quarterly projection released Wednesday that may reignite talk of additional easing measures, although the central bank kept its policy unchanged this time. Japan’s primary inflation gauge will likely rise 0.7% in the year ending March 2016, the BOJ said in its latest quarterly review of three-year growth and price projections. The figure for the current fiscal year was down from April’s forecast that the core consumer price index would rise 0.8%. The BOJ has lowered its forecast for this year for four straight quarters. It started revising the figure down in October, when it expanded its annual asset purchase target to the current Y80 trillion a year. The bank also cut its price forecasts for the following two years to 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Japan’s inflation fell to around zero in recent months, in a blow to the credibility of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda who launched the easing measures about two years ago with a promise to achieve 2% inflation relatively quickly. The latest price projections remain uncertain at best, as concerns remain over Greece’s debt problems and slowing global growth that is threatening Japan’s already slowing export-led recovery. At its latest policy meeting, the BOJ policy board voted 8-1 to keep its annual asset purchase target unchanged, as was widely expected by the market. But pressure for fresh action could mount over the coming months if inflation doesn’t stage a sharp recovery as promised by the BOJ. The BOJ cut its growth projection for this year to 1.7% from 2.0%, the second straight quarterly downgrade. For the year through March 2017, the BOJ predicted 1.5% growth compared, unchanged. The bank projected a 0.2% rise in the following year, also unchanged.
