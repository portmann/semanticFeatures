Thoughts On The Fed Decision: No Change In Rates | Seeking Alpha Manning & Napier , Manning & Napier: Independent Perspective (84 clicks) Thoughts On The Fed Decision: No Change In Rates Following their two-day meeting in mid-September, members of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided not to adjust the federal funds policy interest rate. Policymakers expressed concern about global market uncertainty and highlighted recent global economic and financial developments, which they said could weigh on growth and put downward pressure on inflation in the near term. Looking ahead, we remain of the view that the Fed is not far away from beginning the process of policy normalization - which should include lifting policy interest rates - likely before year-end. Following their two-day meeting in mid-September, members of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided not to adjust the federal funds policy interest rate. The rate will remain within the current 0% to 0.25% range, where it has been since December 2008. In a press release accompanying the committee's decision, policymakers expressed concern about global market uncertainty and highlighted recent global economic and financial developments, which they said could weigh on growth and put downward pressure on inflation in the near term. While they acknowledged the healthy economic underpinnings in the U.S. economy, specifically noting that the "labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment," the decision to leave policy rates at present levels for now appears mostly predicated on the FOMC's desire to allow more time for "monitoring developments abroad." Immediately following the rate hike decision, markets experienced some volatility. Major domestic indices traded higher for a brief period, but the S&P 500 Index finished the day down about a quarter of a percent. In U.S. fixed income markets, yields declined across the Treasury yield curve with the short end dipping more so than the long end. Looking ahead, we remain of the view that the Fed is not far away from beginning the process of policy normalization - which should include lifting policy interest rates - likely before year-end. If the Fed begins the process soon, they can then have the flexibility to proceed slowly with small increases in the Fed funds rate that do not follow a well-defined schedule, rather than a sharp increase in rates over a short period of time, which would likely be highly disruptive to markets and economies. It is important to point out that setting policy rates at historic lows is representative of emergency levels of monetary policy accommodation. We believe the domestic economy is far from a crisis situation that would require such intense support. Indeed, labor markets are clearly tightening, underscored by strong job growth in recent years and the unemployment rate descending to 5.1% in August. This suggests that the Fed is close to achieving the full employment aspect of its dual mandate. With regard to the price stability goal of the Fed mandate, inflation measures continue to fall short of policymakers' 2% annual target, and measures of inflation expectations remain stable. However, tighter labor markets should manifest in quicker wage growth in the future, which could feed inflation and inflation expectations. Moreover, the strong U.S. dollar and weak commodity prices represent transitory factors that are keeping headline inflation low in the near term, but are expected to abate with time. While the Fed's dual mandate does not include driving economic growth in foreign countries or supporting equity markets, both of these factor into the outlook for the U.S. economy. Furthermore, given the change in the composition of the U.S. economy over the past several decades, monetary policy has significantly flowed into financial assets (as opposed to the real economy) and the Fed has become increasingly concerned with the potential presence of asset bubbles. We believe a rate hike decision before year-end would reflect policymakers' sensitivity to preventing any unintended influence from monetary policy on asset prices and financial markets, while also reflecting the economic reality that conditions are much stronger today than during the financial crisis and emergency levels of accommodation are no longer required.
