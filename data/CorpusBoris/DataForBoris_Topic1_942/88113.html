5 Things to Watch at This Weekâ€™s Fed Meeting - WSJ The Federal Reserve appears to be getting closer to raising short-term interest rates, but it isnâ€™t likely to get there when officials gather this week for a two-day policy meeting. While few outside economists expect Wednesday will see the first rate increase in nine years, the Fed will offer plenty to monitor: a policy statement and updated economic projections at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s quarterly press conference at 2:30 p.m. The Fed last raised rates in June 2006. It has kept its benchmark federal funds rate pinned near zero since December 2008. In March, officials put a June rate increase in play . While that remains an option this week , several months of mixed economic data have made an imminent move unlikely. â€œI would like to move on the back of good news, basically, and I think itâ€™s very difficult to say that youâ€™re trying to normalize interest rates just at the moment where the economy looks a little bit weaker,â€? St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said earlier this month . Ms. Yellen may offer more hints about what to expect in coming months. Ms. Yellen and other top officials have emphasized caution in recent months, saying rate increasesâ€“once they beginâ€“ will likely be gradual . But just how gradual is gradual? Clues will come in the new â€œdot plotâ€? of policy makersâ€™ predictions for the level of the benchmark federal funds rate over the next few years. In March, officials signaled a less aggressive path for rates by lowering those estimates. The median forecast in March for the end of 2015 was 0.625%, implying two rate increases this yearâ€“from the current range of zero to 0.25%, to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, and then up to 0.5% to 0.75%. A significant shift down in the 2015 dots could instead imply more support for a single rate increase this year . U.S. gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter , according to the Commerce Departmentâ€™s latest estimate, though much of the decline could get revised away later this month . Job growth has picked up and so have retail sales , a closely watched metric of consumer spending. The Fedâ€™s April statement said the winter slowdown partly reflected â€œtransitory factors.â€? With more data now in hand, officials could tweak their description of the economy to acknowledge the growth pickup and sturdier hiring. Policy makers will release updated projections for GDP growth, inflation and the U.S. unemployment rate through 2017 and in the long run. Officials may downgrade their expectations for GDP growth in 2015 due to the weak first quarter. But the Fedâ€™s mandated goals are maximum employment and stable prices, so the inflation and unemployment projections are important to watch. Price growth has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target for three years, and the Fed has said one condition for raising rates is that officials feel â€œreasonably confidentâ€? inflation will return to 2% soon. And in March, the Fed moved the full-employment goalposts by lowering its estimate for the long-run unemployment rate to 5% to 5.2%. If projections by private economists are any guide, Fed officialsâ€™ forecasts for the jobless rate and inflation may see little change this week. The January, March and April policy decisions all were unanimous, the Fedâ€™s longest run without a dissenting vote since 2011 . But Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker might dissent on Wednesday if the Fed doesnâ€™t raise rates and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans might dissent if it does. Policy disagreements within the Fed should come into sharper relief as the debate over rates heats up. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
