North Dakota’s Jobless Rate Is the Lowest No Longer - Real Time Economics - WSJ North Dakotaâ€™s jobless rate rose to 2.9% in February from 2.8% in what the Bureau of Labor Statistics called â€œthe only significant over-the-month rate increaseâ€? for any state.Â  For the first time since the depths of the U.S. financial crisis, North Dakota no longer boasts the nationâ€™s lowest jobless rate, a potential hint of trouble for energy-rich states bolstered by an oil boom that has since gone bust. The shale-rich state was replaced by Nebraska, whose unemployment rate fell to 2.7%. North Dakotaâ€™s rate rose to 2.9% from 2.8% in what the Bureau of Labor Statistics called â€œ the only significant over-the-month rate increase â€? for any state. The last time the state did not have the lowest rate in the nation was October 2008, the Labor Department said. Recent data on metro area unemployment showed jobs in the oil patch are still resistant to the 60% plunge in oil prices that began last summer, with Midland, Texas, showing the lowest jobless rate at 2.6% . At the opposite extreme among states, Nevada had the highest jobless rate in February at 7.1%, while the nation’s capital suffered even worse employment conditions with an unemployment rate of 7.8%. Broader trends mirrored the national data showing an improved but still mixed picture. Nonfarm payroll employment in February increased in 36 states, fell in 13 states and was unchanged in Wyoming, the report said. The Midwest had the lowest regional jobless rate at 5.1%, while the West had the highest at 6.1%. The national jobless rate stood at 5.5% in February , down from 6.7% a year earlier and from a postrecession peak of 10% in late 2009.
