WSJ Survey: Economists Think Fed Will Wait Until September to Raise Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen this month. She said in late MarchÂ the Fed would likely take a â€œgradualist approachâ€? to raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve will likely start raising short-term interest rates in September, according to most private economists polled in recent days by The Wall Street Journal –a significant shift away from earlier predictions of liftoff in June. Some 65% of the economists in the latest survey expected a September rate increase, while just 18% saw the first move coming in June. Just a month earlier, economists were more evenly split, with 48% predicting a first rate rise in June while 38% expected it in September. The latest survey was conducted Friday through Tuesday; 60 analysts offered predictions for the timing of the central bankâ€™s initial rate increase. Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, shifted his prediction from June to September, though he said a June rate increase is still a real possibility. â€œFed officials themselves seem to be incredibly cautiousâ€? about raising rates, he said, and recent economic data have come in â€œa little bit weaker,â€? though harsh winter weather may be the primary culprit. The Journalâ€™s March survey came on the heels of a strong February jobs report . A few weeks later, the Fed opened the door to raising rates as soon as June by dropping its pledge to remain â€œpatient.â€? But Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled caution was still the central bankâ€™s watchword. â€œJust because we removed the word patient from the statement doesnâ€™t mean we are going to be impatient,â€? Ms. Yellen told reporters on March 18. Then, in a March 27 speech, Ms. Yellen said the Fed would likely take a â€œgradualist approachâ€? to raising interest rates . The Labor Department reported Friday that hiring slowed sharply in March . Measures of consumer spending, capital investment and manufacturing output have all slumped in recent months, pointing to a broader slowdown in the early months of 2015. All that appears to have reduced the chances for a Fed rate increase in June , though more data could change the picture once again in the coming months. â€œIf you look at the broad set of data that weâ€™ve gotten in recent months, data has very much surprised to the downside,â€? New York Fed PresidentÂ  William Dudley said Wednesday. â€œItâ€™d be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fedâ€™s first rate hike might be a little further off in time. I can imagine a situation where a June rate hike could still be in play…but obviously itâ€™s a bigger hurdle because weâ€™ve had a lot of weak data. Now you have to see sufficient data on the other side. Now the bar is a little higher.â€? Many economists think the Fed will wait longer to raise its benchmark short-term rate, which has been pinned near zero since December 2008, but most of those surveyed also fear the central bank will wait too long to act. Some 61% in the April survey said the risk that the Fed will raise rates too late is greater than the risk they will raise rates too soon, down only a little from 66% in March.
