Bank Reliance on Short-Term Funds a Harbinger of Crisis - Real Time Economics - WSJ Banks that depend heavily on short-term sources of cash to fund longer-term operations and investments open themselves up to the risk of runs, and potentially a full-blown crisis, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas that identifies such â€œliquidity mismatchesâ€? as an early sign of impending trouble. â€œLiquidity mismatch helps predict bank failure and distress one or two years ahead,â€? write Dallas Fed staffers J.B. Cooke, Christoffer Koch and Anthony Murphy in the regional bankâ€™s May Economic Letter. â€œLiquidity mismatch rose significantly before the financial crisis, especially at large banks,â€? the authors write. â€œThe rise in mismatch contributed to the rise in bank failures and cases of distress.â€? The model indicates a five percentage point increase in liquidity mismatches raises the chances of â€œfailure or distressâ€? in the following 12 months by about a quarter of a percentage point. â€œThese effects may appear small, but they should be gauged against the average failure or distress rate of 1.4 percentage points per quarter in 2007â€“11,â€? the authors say. Last year, the Fed adopted a rule requiring more than 30 of the biggest U.S. banks to add a combined $100 billion more in cash or cash-like assets than they currently hold for very short-term financing needs. â€œNew rules to reduce 12-month liquidity mismatches will take effect in the next few years,â€? the Dallas Fed said. Still, despite the new regulations, reliance on short-term funding that is susceptible to runs remains a concern for top Fed officials.
