5 Things to Watch in the Fed’s December Minutes - WSJ The Federal Reserve ended months of feverish speculation Dec. 16 when it announced plans to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, bringing an end to seven years of near-zero rates. Markets and economists had widely predicted the move but are eager for clues about happens next. Some may appear Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST when the Fed releases the minutes of the Dec. 15-16 meeting. Here are five things to watch for. Fed officials have emphasized they plan to raise interest rates in a â€œgradualâ€? manner. The word featured in speeches leading up to the meeting, in the statement released after the meetingÂ and in Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s postmeeting press conference . Officialsâ€™ median estimate for the appropriate path of interest rates released after the meeting suggests they could raise them by a full percentage point by the end of next year. But they didnâ€™t say when the increases might occur, or how big each might be. Pressed by reporters, Ms. Yellen would only say, â€œ gradual does not mean mechanical , evenly timed, equally sized interest rate changes.â€? The December minutes might provide some more details about officialsâ€™ expectations for rate rises. The message from Ms. Yellenâ€™sÂ  Dec. 3 Â appearance before Congressâ€™s Joint Economic Committee was that she had looked closely at the wobbly international picture and determined it had not held back the U.S. economy .Â She reiterated that position in her comments following the December Fed meeting, saying the economic threats from abroad â€œhave lessened since last summer.â€? The minutes could offer a clearer window into the Fedâ€™s analysis of the foreign situation and could explain how Fed officials judge the threat from abroad. The October minutes included a discussion of the natural interest rate , otherwise known as r*, which represents the rate at which inflation and unemployment are balanced.Â Right now, Fed officials say the rate is hovering around zero and they do not expect it to rise very rapidly. Since the meeting, officials have indicated this is a key concern .Â The October minutes suggested that a prolonged period of low natural rates could limit policy makersâ€™ ability to boost the economy through interest rate cuts, forcing them to rely on other methods. The December minutes could offer hints about the Fedâ€™s policy approach in a world of persistently lower natural interest rates. Ms. Yellen scored an important victory on Dec. 16 by securing a unanimous vote to begin raising rates.Â But that does not necessarily mean Fed officials were all on the same page. After all, vote counts following the September and October meetings suggested near-consensus, with only Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker dissenting. But officials subsequently described those meetings as close calls . The December minutes could pull back the curtain on the internal debate at the meeting.Â  Inflation has stubbornly stuck below the Fedâ€™s 2% target for more than three years but officials say low inflation readings are transitory effects of a strong dollar and low oil prices. At her December press conference, Ms. Yellen sounded confident in her prediction that inflation would move back to the target, which she said justified a preemptive increase in interest rates. But Fed officials slightly lowered their median inflation estimate for 2016 between the September and December meetings. The minutes could help explain how Fed officials see inflation behaving in the years ahead and how they can simultaneously support higher interest rates while projecting lower short-term inflation readings. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
