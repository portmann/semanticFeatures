WSJ Survey: Most Economists See Fed Raising Rates in September - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve will wait until September to begin raising short-term interest rates, according to a growing majority of private economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. About 73% of economists in the survey, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday, said the U.S. central bank will start lifting rates in September. Thatâ€™s up from 65% in the April survey and 38% in Marchâ€™s poll . â€œThe Fed needs to see the whites of the eyes of a self-sustaining and more healing recovery in employment before moving,â€? Mesirow Financial Inc. chief economist Diane Swonk said. Fed officials have said they expect to begin raising their benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, sometime this year .Â  The fed funds rate has been pinned near zero since December 2008. Expectations for the first rate increase have solidified around the Fedâ€™s Sept. 16-17 policy meeting after a run of weak economic data in the early months of 2015 made a move at the June 16-17 meeting appear unlikely. Just 7% of economists in the latest survey predicted a June liftoff, down from 18% in April and 48% in March. Fed officials have indicated the economy should rebound from its sluggish winter, blaming â€œtransitory factorsâ€? in their April 29 policy statement . â€œWeâ€™ve seen this movie before,â€? Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said last week . U.S. hiring bounced back in April following a weak March, according to the Labor Department. But other indicators, such asÂ  retail sales , have pointed to sluggish spring growth . Fed officials have insisted they are prepared to raise rates at any meeting, not just at the June, September and December meetings when Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at her quarterly news conferences. In April, the Fed tested a teleconference system that could be used for an unscheduled press briefing. Even so, few economists expect the Fed will start to raise rates at a meeting without a scheduled news conference. In the latest survey, 5% predicted the Fed would move in July and 3% predicted a first rate increase in October. Some 7% saw the Fed waiting until next year. â€œIf data is driving the timing, 2015 won’t even open the garage door,â€? said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith, who predicted a first rate increase in early 2016. Still, 70% of economists said the risk is greater that the Fed will in the end wait too long to raise interest rates, while 30% said the greater risk is that the central bank will tighten too soon. The Journal polls business and academic economists monthly; 62 responded to the May survey , though not every economist answered every question. previous The U.S. Economy Just Had Its Worst Month Since the Recession We welcome thoughtful comments from readers. Please comply with our guidelines . Our blogs do not require the use of your real name. Your "economists" have been consistently wrong.  I recognize some of the names of your "economists."  Most of them are the employees of the PR departments of various financial institutions.  There are very few TRAINED macroeconomists among them.  Your panel is to real economists as vitamin salesmen are to medical doctors.  You should be talking to real ones like John Lindauer and Vernon Smith. According to the article, the fed is waiting to see a more self sustaining, "healing" recovery before raising rates. The very next article in the feed  states the economy just had the worst month since '08. Seems like the fed and many of these economists are working with old, outdated, pre-'08 models that just aren't relevant anymore. The "employment" figures fail to take into account the new part-time labor force, and the profound effect this is having on our economy. Real household wages have fallen, even while they have been trumpeting this "recovery" mantra. No matter how low they push interest rates ( even going into negative territory as some of our European neighbors have done ) the economy cannot experience real growth without an increase in real wages. Debt spending has sustained the illusion for a long time, but that ship has sailed. The Fed is NOT raising rates this year or anytime soon, don't believe this PROPAGANDA. The only reason they keep saying this is for GREED and PROFIT = Bill Gross's 'Short of a Lifetime'. These bass turds should be prosecute along with those who orchestrated the financial crisis in 2008. The Fed is NOT raising rates this year or anytime soon, don't believe this PROPAGANDA. The only reason they keep saying this is for GREED and PROFIT = Bill Gross's 'Short of a Lifetime'. These bass turds should be prosecute along with those who orchestrated the financial crisis in 2008. I'd like to see an article on economist's view of the SIZE of the first increase.  ZQV5 (Oct'15) is at 99.78 today, and has been around 99.75 since retail data came in, suggesting September may just be an official move out of the current fed funds rate RANGE of 0-.25% to a set rate of 0.25%, while ZQF6 (Jan'16) is at 99.64, suggesting mixed feelings about a second increase by December to 0.5%.  That's assuming I'm interpreting them right. Anyone with more knowledge please feel free to weigh in.  It sure seems that if September is just an official move away from the 0 end of the range (which I've read is closer to what's actually being used in practice) to 0.25%, then it's hardly worthy of a major bond selloff.  But even so, I'm seriously considering a short UB position if bonds bounce back one more time this summer.  That's assuming the recent rate rally doesn't spike into something much larger in the coming weeks.  Then I'd just pass on the idea entirely. previous The U.S. Economy Just Had Its Worst Month Since the Recession Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
