Kocherlakota: Fed Should Be ‘Extraordinarily Patient’ About Raising Rates - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve should be “extraordinarily patient” and hold off on raising interest rates until the second half of 2016, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said Tuesday. The U.S. central bank “can only achieve its congressionally mandated price and employment goals by being extraordinarily patient in reducing the level of monetary accommodation,” Mr. Kocherlakota said in remarks prepared for delivery in Bismarck, N.D. “Under my current outlook, I continue to believe that it would be a mistake to raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015.” Most Fed officials expect to begin raising interest rates in 2015 as the economy improves, though the precise timing of the first increase remains uncertain . But Mr. Kocherlakota, a vocal advocate for aggressive stimulus who is set to leave office in early 2016 , has repeatedly argued against raising interest rates this year. In his remarks on Tuesday, he said it would be “appropriate” for the Fed to “defer the initial interest-rate increase until the second half of 2016,” and then raise the benchmark federal funds rate to roughly 2% by the end of 2017. That is a more gradual rise than most officials expect; in March, the median of policy makers’ projection for the fed-funds rate at the end of 2017 was 3.125%. The Fed’s legal mandate is to pursue maximum employment and price stability. Mr. Kocherlakota said he believes it will take several years for the Fed to achieve either goal. On the bright side, he said, the labor market’s “tremendous improvement” during 2014 defeated the idea that the economy was “trapped in some kind of dismal ‘new normal’ in the wake of the Great Recession.” But to return to the healthy job-market conditions seen in the prerecession year of 2006, Mr. Kocherlakota said it would take “at least three more years like 2014.” When it comes to prices, “I don’t see inflation returning to 2 percent in a sustained way for three years–possibly longer,” Mr. Kocherlakota said. U.S. price gains have already undershot the Fed’s 2% annual inflation target for nearly three years. “The [policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee] is charged with making monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment and price stability,” Mr. Kocherlakota said. “There is no tension between these two objectives at the current time.” He also dismissed the argument that interest rates should be raised to head off excessive risk-taking in the financial system. “The good news is that Federal Reserve staff carefully monitors the financial system for exactly these kinds of vulnerabilities,” he said. “I see little evidence in their analysis to suggest that a monetary policy maker should see financial stability risks as being in any way material.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
