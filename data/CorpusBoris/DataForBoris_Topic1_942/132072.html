Hilsenrathâ€™s Take: A Split Decision Looms from Fed on Job and Inflation Goals BOJ Expects New Inflation Measure to Rise The Federal Reserve has framed its decision about raising interest rates around the progress it sees in achieving its dual mandate goals of maximum employment and 2% inflation. Officials could emerge from their policy meeting today with a split decision â€“ progress on the employment side of their mandate and continued uncertainty on the inflation side. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in testimony to Congress earlier this month that the economy is â€œdemonstrably closerâ€? to reaching the Fedâ€™s full employment goal. Since the Fed last met in June, the jobless rate has notched down further from 5.5% to 5.3%, its lowest level since April 2008, hiring appears to have returned to a path of steady gains in excess of 200,000 per month after stumbling in March and wages show tentative signs of moving higher. Fed officials will need to acknowledge these advances in their post-meeting policy statement, a sign that a rate increase is approaching. Still it is hard to see how officials derive great confidence that inflation is surely returning to their 2% goal. Oil prices and commodities more broadly have resumed their march down and the dollar its movement higher, factors that have weighed on inflation all year. The Fed has described these developments as transitory before, but slow growth in China could give them some pause about that conclusion. Broad measures of inflation show little sign of breaking out of the sub-2% trend which has been in place for more than three years. Meantime, inflation compensation in bond marketsÂ has notched lower after stabilizing earlier this year.Â And though wages show signs of picking up, a breakout isnâ€™t yet obvious and the links between wages and broader inflation are tentative. It potentially sets up the Fed and markets for a cliffhanger policy meeting in September. The jobs part of their mandate â€“ so important to Ms. Yellen â€“ is signaling a rate increase is due. But the inflation part of the mandate signals continued patience. Officials wonâ€™t want to lock themselves in until they see more data on the economyâ€™s performance. Janet Yellenâ€™s First 18 Months Running the Fedâ€”By the Numbers. As she approaches the 18-month mark, how has Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s time at the helm compared with the early experience of her predecessor,Â Ben Bernanke?

Fed and FDIC Give First Feedback on â€˜Living Wills.â€™ The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. gave three large nonbank financial firms initial feedback on the â€œliving willsâ€? they must create to describe how they would go through bankruptcy without causing broader economic damage. The firmsâ€”Â American International Group,Â Inc.,Â Prudential FinancialÂ Inc.,Â and General Electric Capital Corp.â€”have been designated â€œsystemically important,â€? a label that comes with a requirement to draft credible plans for their own demise. The regulators said the three firms need to make improvements before they submit new versions of the plans at the end of this year. Critics Of Fed On Left And Right Prepare To Head To Jackson Hole. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen may be skipping the Kansas City Fedâ€™s high-profile conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. this year, but the central bankâ€™s critics are not.

IMF: Demand Troubles Risk Cementing Decade of Anemic Growth. The failure of the worldâ€™s largest economies to boost demandâ€”despite central-bank effortsâ€”is setting the stage for weak global growth for years to come. That is a key message in theÂ International Monetary Fundâ€™sÂ latest reportÂ detailing distortions in the global economy Â caused by too much saving in some countries and not enough demand in others. RBNZ’s Wheeler Says Further Monetary-Policy Easing Likely Needed.Â Reserve Bank of New Zealand Gov. Graeme Wheeler reiterated Wednesday that further rate cuts are likely needed to spur economic growth and generate inflation . Â ”We think the economy is currently growing at an annual rate of around 2.5%.

Rahul Anand, Eswar Prasad and Boyang Zhang develop a model of inflation designed specifically for the central banks of emerging economies, â€œwhere a large proportion of households are credit constrained and the share of food expenditures in total consumption expenditures are high.â€? They say their model shows â€œheadline inflation targeting improves welfare outcomes.â€? Real Interest Rates Likely to Remain Low. In a posting on the Bank of England’s Bank Underground blog,Â Lukasz Rachel and Thomas Smith provide evidence that changing demographics, rising income inequality and a “glut” of savings in emerging markets account for much of the decline in theÂ Â the global real interest rate to around 1%. Declines in the relative prices of capital goods and public investment have also contributed. “We think these secular trends are likely to persist,” they write. Why Using Fed Dividends to Pay for Highways is a Bad Ideas. Analysts at the Bipartisan Policy Center argue against cutting into the dividends the regional Fed banks pay their stock-holding member banks. â€œTinkering with the Federal Reserveâ€™s system to fund current congressional spending initiatives, without public debate or thought on its ramifications, sets a dangerous precedent and is bad policy,â€? they write. â€œProposals to thoughtfully examine its structure, such as the idea put forth by Senate Banking Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL) to create a special commission to study and produce recommendations to change the Federal Reserve System, deserve public debate and potential congressional action.â€? Market Manipulation Goes Global. Stephen S. Roach writes thereâ€™s not much difference between the Chinese governmentâ€™s intervention in equity markets and western central banks efforts. â€œTake quantitative easing, first used in Japan in the early 2000s, then in the United States after 2008, then in Japan again beginning in 2013, and now in Europe. In all of these cases, QE essentially has been an aggressive effort to manipulate asset prices.Â It works primarily through direct central-bank purchases of long-dated sovereign securities, thereby reducing long-term interest rates, which, in turn, makes equities more attractive.â€?
