Fed Officials See Slower Inflation Pickup Than Private Economists Do - Real Time Economics - WSJ On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released its latest set of forecasts compiled from various central bank officials. According to the range of all forecasts, real gross domestic product could grow between 2.1% and 3.1% this year and 2.2% and 3.0% in 2016. The unemployment rate could be anywhere between 4.8% and 5.3% by the end of 2015 and 4.5% to 5.2% by the end of next year. The Fedâ€™s span ofÂ  growth and unemployment forecasts fits squarely into the middle of the forecasts of private economists Â compiled earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal. Â Within the WSJ survey,Â  the GDP forecasts range from 1.9% to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.8% and 4.3% in 2016. The private forecasters think unemployment will run between 4.5% and 5.6% by yearâ€™s end and 3.9% and 5.9% by the end of 2016. On inflation (as measured by the price index personal consumption expenditures), both groups think the end of falling energy prices means inflation should edge higher during this year and the next. Yearly PCE inflation stood at 0.2% in January. The Fedâ€™s outlook, however, expects a slower pickup in inflation than the private group. For 2015, the highest Fed forecast calls for inflation to hit a tepid 1.5%; the highest private forecast expects a steamy 3.4%.Â  No Fed forecaster expects inflation to reach the bankâ€™s target Â of 2% until 2016, while about 15% of private economists think the rate will be 2% or higher by the end of this year. Of course, both sets of forecasters started 2014 feeling upbeat about last yearâ€™s prospects, onlyÂ  to have to scale them back . Shocks, such as the horrible weather of early 2014, cannot be programmed into economic models.Â  As more data become available, expect the Fed’s and private economists to change their expectations for the economy.
