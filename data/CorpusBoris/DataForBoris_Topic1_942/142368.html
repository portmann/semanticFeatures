BOJ Gov Kuroda Acknowledges Possible Delay in Achieving 2% Inflation - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Friday that the central bank could fall behind its schedule to generate 2% inflation if oil prices fail to recover, acknowledging uncertainties over his bullish projections. “Depending on movements in crude oil prices–particularly oil futures prices–I think it is possible that we will achieve the goal a little earlier or later” than currently planned, Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference in response to questions over sliding global petroleum costs. Mr. Kuroda had said that the BOJ would achieve 2% inflation by the early autumn of next year if oil prices go back up gradually. But he also suggested that even in that case, the bank may hold its fire if he judges that the trend of inflation remains solid. “We will probably consider making policy adjustments if movements in crude oil prices begin to affect inflation expectations and the underlying price trend,” Mr. Kuroda said. Speaking after a two-day meeting, where the central bank kept its policy on hold, Mr. Kuroda brushed aside growing pessimism over Japan’s economy. Overseas economies are expected to regain steam, rejuvenating Japan’s exports and factory output, while households are expected to spend more because of rising wages and hot summer weather, he said. Many economists expect that Japan’s economy shrank over the April-June quarter on weaker exports, industrial output and consumer spending, and may remain sluggish over the following quarter.
