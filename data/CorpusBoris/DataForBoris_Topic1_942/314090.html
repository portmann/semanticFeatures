5 Things to Watch in Janet Yellenâ€™s Congressional Testimony - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday for two days of congressional testimony, her first public appearance since her press conference in December following the central bankâ€™s hotly debated interest-rate increase . A lot has changed since then: The Fed is confronting fresh uncertainty about the economic outlook amid global financial market tumult, and many investors assume further rate increases are on hold for now . Ms. Yellen’s remarks will be parsed for fresh guidance on the Fedâ€™s plans. She goes before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST, but her testimony and the Fedâ€™s monetary policy report are scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. EST. She appears before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday morning. Here are five things to watch. Recent market volatility could be a passing phenomenon with few implications for the real economy . Then again, it could signalâ€”or causeâ€”bigger problems. Some economists are even warning, based on financial and other indicators, that the risk of a recession is rising . The Fed signaled in its last policy statement it was in a wait-and-see mode when it came to judging whether the U.S. faces danger as a result of â€œglobal economic and financial developments.â€? If Ms. Yellen doesnâ€™t say in her opening statement whether sheâ€™s worried about whatâ€™s happening in markets, a lawmaker might ask her about it. Back in December, Fed policy makers penciled in four quarter-percentage-point rate increases for 2016. That now looks optimistic, and futures markets suggest investors see little chance of a rate increase at the Fedâ€™s next policy meeting, March 15-16. It could be a tough call for the Fed, which must balance some soft economic data and financial-market volatility against evidence of continued strength in the job market , including signs of stronger wage growth. A lot could happen over the next few weeks and Ms. Yellen may look to keep her options open by reiterating the Fedâ€™s guidance that officials expect to raise rates at a gradual pace. The Fed faces mixed signals on the inflation front as it pursues its long-elusive goal of 2% annual price growth. Some measures of inflation expectations are eroding and oil prices have continued to fall, which will weigh down broad price measures. But measures of so-called core prices, which exclude food and energy and can reveal underlying inflation pressures, are stable or rising . The inflation outlook is a critical consideration for Fed decisions on interest rates, so take note of which data points Ms. Yellen emphasizesâ€”or downplays. Ms. Yellen is on Capitol Hill to testify about the economy and monetary policy, but she usually faces questions about the Fedâ€™s supervisory and regulatory responsibilities as well. The House panel had a chance to quiz her on those subjects in November, so she may face more questions when she goes before senators on Thursday. Possible topics includeÂ the â€œliving willsâ€? that large financial firms must provide to regulators and this yearâ€™s round of bank â€œstress tests.â€? Recently adopted limits on the Fedâ€™s emergency lending powers could come up, too. The focus on Wednesday will be Ms. Yellenâ€™s prepared testimony and her answers to lawmakersâ€™ questions. But donâ€™t overlook the Fedâ€™s semiannual Monetary Policy Report , the document she is presenting to lawmakers. It often contains insight into the topics on Fed officialsâ€™ minds. Among the subjects addressed inÂ  Julyâ€™s report : the amount of slack left in the labor market, bond-market liquidity and the stability of the financial system. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
