Fed’s Lacker: ‘Strong Case’ to Be Made for June Rate Increase  - Real Time Economics - WSJ RICHMOND, Va.â€“Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said Tuesday the Fed should be prepared to tighten policy faster than expected once it starts to raise short-term interest rates. In a speech to the Greater Richmond Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Lacker said there is a â€œstrong caseâ€? for the Fed to begin raising short-term interest rates at its June policy meeting. â€œI expect that, unless incoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will remain strong at the June meeting,â€? he said. Mr. Lacker, who is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said he hasn’t yet decided whether he will dissent if the Fed’s policy-setting committee decides not to raise rates in June. “I’ll wait and see what my colleagues have to say,” he told reporters following the speech. Once rates begin to rise, Mr. Lacker told reporters the Fed “needs to be ready for the possibility that we could need to tighten more rapidly than people expect.” In his prepared remarks, Mr. Lacker said improvements in labor market conditions and strong business investment should contribute to economic growth this year, despite the slow housing-market recovery and the challenge to exports from the stronger U.S. dollar. The dollarâ€™s surge has made imports more attractive in the U.S. and domestic producers less competitive globally, which can be expected to increase the U.S. trade deficit and slow the growth of overall U.S. production â€œfor a time,â€? Mr. Lacker said. If the dollar peaks this year and oil prices bottom out, Mr. Lacker said he remains confident inflation will move back toward 2% this year. He said the effects of the dollar appreciation are transitory. â€œA year from now, hopefully the dust will have settled,â€? he told audience members. The Fedâ€™s policy-setting committee will meet in April, but Fed officials have made clear they donâ€™t intend to raise rates at the coming meeting. Mr. Lacker said it is important to note that the Fed will still be supplying â€œquite a bit of stimulus to economy activityâ€? even after rate increases begin. â€œIn current circumstances, raising the funds rate target a notch or two is less like taking away the punch bowl and more like just slowing down the refills,â€? he said. â€œWe will still be spiking the punchâ€“just not quite as rapidly as we have been.â€? Most Fed officials favor raising rates this year, with a number of policymakers pointing to the June Federal Open Market Committee gathering as the point at which officials will begin actively considering rate rises.
