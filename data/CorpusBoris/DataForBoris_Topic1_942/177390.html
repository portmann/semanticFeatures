Fed's Bullard: Why I argued against the Fed rate hold | Seeking Alpha Sep 19 2015, 17:42 ET | By: Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Below are snippets from St. Louis Fed president James Bullard's speech today. Full deck here . "The FOMC met amid heavy speculation this past Wednesday and Thursday. The Committee decided not to begin policy normalization at this time. Committee participants continue to expect normalization to commence shortly. Once normalization begins, policy will remain extremely accommodative through the medium term. The market reaction to the decision seems to be that it created rather than reduced global macroeconomic uncertainty. I argued against the decision at the FOMC meeting and I will lay out some of my views here." "The case for normalization is simple: The Committee’s goals have essentially been met, but the Committee’s policy settings remain stuck in emergency mode. The Committee wants unemployment at its long-run level and inflation of 2%. The Committee is about as close to meeting these objectives as it has ever been in the past 50 years. Why do the Committee’s policy settings remain so far from normal when the objectives have essentially been met? The Committee has not, in my view, provided a satisfactory answer to this question." Bullard, nobody cares why or what you think. Rates will go up when they go up, 'nough said. Please could we stop the Fed watching insanity!? Pretty compelling argument by Mr. Bullard here. Just see no credible reasons why FED failed to hike rates last week.  Oct is looking sine qua non. The economy is limping along on deficit spending. Rate hikes can only occur after the dolt in the whitehouse and the retards in congress make a deal. That deal will include at least $500B in additional stimulus/spending it may have to do with the fact that they raised rates too early in the depression, didn't they?  now they'd bide their time to pull the trigger. I think they want to make  sure that the stock market problems in China have stabilized as much possible before raising rates in the next one to three months I think more important they wanna see lower US dollar with attendant rise in commodity prices. Aka well anchoring of short to medium term inflation.
