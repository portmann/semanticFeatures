The Fedâ€™s Zero-Rate Policy Boosts Inequality, Nobel Economist Joseph Stiglitz Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prize-winning economist and professor of economics at Columbia University, says the Fed’s aggressive monetary policies may have further boosted U.S. inequality. The Federal Reserveâ€™s prolonged policies of near-zero interest rates and asset purchases have further widened the already large gap between the rich and poor in the United States, says Nobel prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz. â€œContrary to the presumption in the nineteenth century, where lower interest rates favored debtors over creditors and thus increased equality, we show thatâ€¦lower interest rates may actually increase inequality ,â€? Mr. Stiglitz, a long-time inequality scholar, argues in the fourth of a four-part working paper series published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Thatâ€™s because rich individuals tend to hold much of their wealth in a stock market that benefits disproportionately from such policies, which included purchases of government and mortgage bonds, a program known as quantitative easing or QE. â€œThe composition of wealth-holdings will differ between the capitalists and life cycle savers, so that any policy which differentially benefits those assets held by capitalists leads to greater inequality. Quantitative easing did that,â€? he says. Today, he said, â€œworkers and capitalists are both owners of capital, but different kinds of capital,â€? with lower- and middle-income Americans rely primarily on fixed-income assets while upper-income individuals tend to invest more in stocks and other riskier assets offering higher returns. â€œA lowering of the interest rate helps owners of equity and hurts those who hold government debt. This model seems to be a better description of the modern economy, and in this model, lowering interest rates unambiguously contributes to growing inequality,â€? he concludes. In his critique of U.S. central bank policy, Mr. Stiglitz is breaking ranks with many of his liberal colleagues , who have been strong advocates of continued Fed support for the economy given a lack of fiscal policy stimulus from the U.S. Congress. In response to a historic recession and deep financial crisis, Fed officials have kept official borrowing costs at effectively zero since December 2008, and bought more than $3 trillion in mortgage and Treasury bonds. U.S. economic growth has been modest since the recession, while inflation continues to serially undershoot the Fedâ€™s 2% target and wage growth remains subdued. Â The stock market, in contrast, has rallied to repeated records .
