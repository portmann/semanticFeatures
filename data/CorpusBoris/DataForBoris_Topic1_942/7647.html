5 Highlights From Janet Yellenâ€™s Press Conference - WSJ Fed ChairwomanÂ Janet YellenÂ answered questions on theÂ  economy, monetary policy and congressional proposals Â duringÂ  her hourlong press conference Â Wednesday. She repeated the main message ofÂ  the Fed statement , that an interest rate increase is unlikely at the April meeting but could be considered at any central bank policy meeting after that. Here are five highlights from her remarks. On what would make the Fed feel â€œreasonably confidentâ€? about inflation moving higher: No one factor. â€œ I donâ€™t have a mechanical answer for you ,â€? she said, adding officials will be looking at â€œa wide array of data.â€? On why Fed officials have marked down their expectations for the path of interest rates : She noted they have lowered their forecasts for inflation and also their view of the long-run unemployment rate. The latter revision implies more slack in the labor market, less inflation pressure and a need to hold rates low for longer. On the effect of the surging dollar on the economy: The higher dollar is weighing on inflation and exports. â€œExport growth has weakened. Probably the strong dollar is one reason for that,â€? she said. â€œOn the other hand, the strength of the dollar also in part reflects the strength of the U.S. economy.â€? A strong dollar also â€œis holding down import prices and, at least on a transitory basis, at this point pushing inflation down,â€? she said. On the threat of low interest rates fueling asset bubbles: Not so worrisome. â€œOverall measures of equity valuations are on the high side but not outside of historical ranges,â€? she said. â€œIn some corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually low spreads.â€? Looking at overall financial stability, she added, â€œOur overall assessment at this point is that threats are moderate .â€? On proposals to alter the Fedâ€™s structure or allow more congressional scrutiny of monetary policy: Â She is not in favor of them. â€œ I donâ€™t think the system is broken , I think itâ€™s working well,â€? she said. â€œSo I donâ€™t see a need for changes but of course itâ€™s up to Congress to review that.â€? • You must enter the verification code below to send.
