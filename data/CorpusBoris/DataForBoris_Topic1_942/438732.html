Federal ReserveÂ ChairwomanÂ Janet YellenÂ visits lawmakers Tuesday and Wednesday forÂ  two days of semiannual monetary policy testimony , where she is likely to faceÂ questions about bank regulation, cybersecurity, and Brexit, or theÂ U.K. referendum on whether to the leave the European Union. The appearances come just days after the Fedâ€™s latest policy meeting and before the Brexit vote on Thursday . They also are the last scheduled chance lawmakers, many of whom face re-election, will have to publicly question the Fed chief before voters head to the polls in November. On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen appears before the Senate Banking Committee and on Wednesday, she returns to the Hill to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. Yellen Points to Slow Growth and Low Rates in the Long Run Fed Chair Janet Yellen Says Minorities Have Yet to Benefit From Economic Recovery Wary Fed Rethinks Pace of Hikes Â (June 15) Greg Ip: World Isnâ€™t Ready for Another Fed Increase Â (June 15) BREXIT > YELLEN: The market is, of course, watching Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony. It is not, however, reacting. Hard to believe, but the market is less interested in the Fed chair’s carefully sculpted words, and more interested in the messy run-up to the Brexit vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 22 points. It was up about 25 points before her testimony was released. Nymex crude was down about 2% before the testimony, and is now down 1.7%. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note is at 1.68%. It was at 1.67% before testimony began. For one thing, she isn’t really saying anything new. “There is nothing new here that is any different than the FOMC statement and press conference last week,” Lindsey Group’s Peter Boockvar wrote. Ultimately, though, there is only one “event-risk” on the market’s mind. “All traders will be focusing on one particularly acute threat to the market’s calm: the U.K.’s Brexit vote,” the team at DailyFX wrote. FED BACKGROUNDS: Ms. Yellen had a back and forth with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) about the backgrounds of the people that have been selected as Federal Reserve bank presidents. If youâ€™re interested in taking a deep dive on this topic, hereâ€™s a really cool interactive that we did late last year that shows how the backgrounds of these officials has changed over time: THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES: Ms. Yellen said the countryâ€™s five largest Wall Street banks will face â€œconsequencesâ€? if they fail to correct fixes in so-called living will plans. She stopped short of committing how policy makers would respond if those banks don’t sufficiently address weaknesses. Regulators can consider imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on those firms under the 2010 regulatory overhaul law. Ms. Yellen said both the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are â€œvery seriousâ€? that institutions remedy deficiencies in their plans, which were rejected in April. MORE ON BREXIT: Asked again about the risks to the U.S. economy from a “Brexit,” Ms. Yellen cited a specific risk that could impact the U.S. “The financial market reaction,” she said, “could result in a kind of risk-off sentiment that we would see impact on financial markets. We might see flight-to-safety flows that could push up the dollar or other save haven currencies.” In other words, turmoil in the U.K. could prompt global investors to buy more U.S. assets, which would strengthen the dollar. This would make it even more expensive for U.S. manufacturers and exporters — who are already struggling — to make sales around the world. Asked if the Brexit risks were large enough that the U.S. could be knocked into recession, Ms. Yellen said â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the most likely case but we just donâ€™t really know what will happen.â€œ THE R WORD: Â Whatâ€™s the chance of a U.S. recession this year? â€œI think itâ€™s quite low. The U.S. economy is doing well,â€? Ms. Yellen said.Â Despite the latest jobs slowdown, â€œmy expectation is that the U.S. economy will continue to grow. We have seen a strong pickup in consumer spending and growth in the economy.â€? Ms. Yellen is not buying any of the classic recession signs. â€œI remain quite optimistic,â€? she said. â€œThe kinds of conditions that have been associated in the past with U.S. recessions, often that occurs when an economy overheatedâ€? with high inflation and the Fed havingÂ to tighten monetary policy as a result. SHORT-TERMISM: Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) raises an important issue:Â theÂ shift toward financial investments overÂ real economic investments. Think about all those companies using their profits forÂ buybacks rather than R&D or investment in plant and equipment.Â  Ms. Yellen says at the Fed, “we have looked very closely at investment spending and tried to understand why it has been so very depressed in the aftermath of the crisis.” Among the drivers she cites areÂ slow overall economic growth and sales, leading firms to believe they don’t need to expand. Slower expansion in the workforce means many firms realized they don’t need to invest as much, she said. It was a short discussion, but clearly a hugely important topic that does not work well in a corporate quarter or an election cycle. YELLEN WONâ€™T BE RESCUING PUERTO RICO: Â Thereâ€™s a somewhatÂ  obscure provision of the Federal Reserve Act that allows the Fed to buy certain types of municipal debt. Some people (though not at the Fed) have suggested that the Fed could use this authority to conduct some sort of bailout of Puerto Rico, to help alleviate its ongoing debt crisis .Â  â€œI think our authority is extremely limited and it wouldnâ€™t be appropriate for us to give loans to Puerto Rico,â€? Ms. Yellen said when asked about this possibility. â€œWe have very limited authority to buy municipal debt and the authority we have to buy eligible debt â€¦ I do not think it would be helpful to Puerto Rico.â€? she said. â€œThis is inherently a matter for Congress and is not something thatâ€™s appropriate for the Federal Reserve,â€? she said of Puerto Ricoâ€™s crisis. TOO LATE: Lindsey Group managing director Peter Boockvar tried to sift through the tea leaves, and came away with this: the Fed missed the boat. He dissected Ms. Yellenâ€™s prepared statement, in which she noted the bankâ€™s made progress on its goals of maximum employment and pushing inflation back to 2%. But she also called out the labor market, which is showing signs of slowing down. Her conclusion was that the â€œcautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.â€? Mr. Boockvarâ€™s take on that? â€œSince they havenâ€™t normalized policy at this late point in the economic cycle, she believes itâ€™s too late to do so now.â€? Stocks are moving a bit higher, but not enough to point to any real reason. Could be oil, Brexit, or Yellen, or noise. Dow’s up 45 points, The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note is immobile at 1.67%. A WARNING TO BANKS: Ms. Yellen raised the possibility regulators could impose higher capital and liquidity requirements on banks if they fail to address deficiencies in their so-called â€œliving willâ€? plans. The 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law gives both the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that option if policy makers find banks have been unable to addresses weaknesses in the plans used to safely unwind in the event of a failure. Ms. Yellen said all five banks, whose plans were rejected by regulators in April, have until the summer of 2017 to make changes. She said she doesnâ€™t expect regulators will have â€œto go there.â€? FISCAL VS. MONETARY POLICY: Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.) offers a freebie to the Fed chief, noting that fiscal policy hasnâ€™t been helping the Fed at its job. Ms. Yellen, of course, agrees. â€œCentral banks have been carrying the load in many parts of the world,â€? she said. Fiscal policy, due to concerns about debt or deficits, has â€œnot played a supportive role.â€? â€œIf there were to be a negative shock to the economyâ€¦ starting with very low levels of interest rates, we donâ€™t have a lot of room using our traditional tried-and-true methods to respond,â€? she said. More responsive fiscal policy would giveÂ the Fed a higher level of rates to start from. Now itâ€™s left with its usual tool box from recent years including asset purchases and forward guidance, she said. NEGATIVE RATES:Â Here’s Ms. Yellen’s view on negative interest rates: they’re legal but they’re not happening. There’s been a debate this year about whether the Federal Reserve should consider negative interest rates Â and there’s even a complex legal debateÂ  about whether the Fed has the legal authority to try to take interest rates into negative territory (like central banks in Europe and Japan have). In response to a direct question from Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), Ms. Yellen said she does think the Fed has the legal authority, but noted that for now the Fed anticipates further monetary tightening, not easing. “I donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to have to provide accommodation but, if we do, I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s on our list,â€? Ms. Yellen said. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED? More than 30 minutes into Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony, and the markets have barely moved. The DJIA is up about 25 points â€“ it was up about 25 points before her testimony was released. The S&P 500 is up 3, and the Nasdaq is up 2 points. So, sheâ€™s at least achieved the goal of not spooking the markets. The larger quest, according to UBSâ€™ Art Cashin, is to restore the Fedâ€™s credibility with the markets. â€œOver the past several months, the Fed has seen its economic projections miss their results by a mile, over and over again,â€? he wrote early this morning. â€œIts outlines on the direction and timing of interest rate changes have been reversed so many times that they are now dismissed, offhand. In short, from the chair on down the Fed has a festering credibility problem.â€? FED DIVERSITY:Â Central bankÂ officials are increasing their efforts to promote diversity within their ranks, Ms.Â Yellen said. â€œWeâ€™re making some progress but I want us to make greater progress,â€? she said. Advocacy groups such as the Center For Popular Democracyâ€™s Fed Up campaignÂ have pushed the central bank to promote more diversity, particularly among its regional banks. On Monday, the group released a slate of candidates it said it would like the Fed to consider for regional bank boards of directors. Ms. Yellen said about 24% of reserve bank and branch board directors belong to minority groups and about 30% are women. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY JOB OPENINGS? One of the biggest mysteries in the U.S. economy in recent years has been a slow pace of hiring even though employers have a record number of job openings . Ms. Yellen said that she believes part of the problem here is not simply a weak labor market, but “mismatch” between employers and the skills of workers. She cited training programs that would help workers develop the necessary skills to fill these jobs. “Obviously our job at the Fed is to make sure we have a strong job market that there are enough jobs that are being created,” she said. But she adding that she thinks “looking at training programs and educational opportunities, I think thatâ€™s a piece of the puzzle as well.” UNEMPLOYMENT GAPS: Sen. Brown notes the Fed chiefâ€™s acknowledgement of lower minority unemployment rates and wants to know more. Ms. Yellen says the Fedâ€™s job is to seek maximum employment and widely distributed gains in the labor market. â€œI believe itâ€™s very important for us to monitor how different groups in the labor market are doing to see if what we perceive as broad-based labor market improvement is being widely shared,â€? she said. Understanding the differences is important for the Fedâ€™s monetary policy work and broader work the Fed does in community development and financial services, she said. DEMOGRAPHICS OF JOBLESSNESS:Â Ms. Yellen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) are discussing the demographics of unemployment. You can see a chart of unemployment rate for different race and gender groups here: BREXIT RISKS: Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.)Â asked about the risks to the U.S. if the United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union. Ms. Yellen said the key risk is not through direct economic ties, but rather through what could happenÂ in financial markets. “It would be significant for the United Kingdom and for Europe as a whole,” Ms. Yellen said. “It would usher in a period of uncertainty and itâ€™s very hard to predict. There could be a period of financial market volatility that would negatively affect financial conditions.” FADING GUIDANCE:Â In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Fed used explicit communication to help guide the public and markets. That “forward guidance,” in some cases, included calendar dates and timelines for future Fed action, Ms. Yellen says in response to a question. Nowadays, as the economy has improved, officials are not leaning as heavily on communication, she said. â€œWeâ€™re not relying very much on forward guidance,â€? Ms. Yellen said. GOLD STANDARD:Â In his opening remarks, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) took a shot at the idea of returning the U.S. to the gold standard. In his remarks, he cited a Wall Street Journal story about a poll of economists who disagreed about the gold standard â€” some thought it was a bad idea; the rest strongly thought it was a bad idea. POLICY STILL EASY: At two points inÂ Ms. Yellen’s testimony she said something that’s an important component of how the Fed views its policy: “Monetary policy remains accommodative.” Because the Fed has begun the process of raising interest rates, many observers talk about “tightening Fed policy” and the risk that this tightening will hurt the economy. Â But this is key to understanding the Fed’s world view: they believe their target interest rate — which is being kept in a range of 0.25% to 0.5% — is still low enough to stimulate the economy. This isn’t new, but it’s often overlooked. In the Fed’s world view, they have reduced the amount of pressure that they are putting on the gas pedal. But they do not view themselves as putting a foot on the brake. A WORLD OF WORRY: Ms. Yellen has plenty of worries on her mind about the U.S. But itâ€™s the global outlook thatâ€™s probably weighing on her the most thisÂ week. Hereâ€™s what she said in her testimony about the risks from Europe and China: Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. For all of these reasons, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets, and inflation. AN UNEVEN RECOVERY:Â Last time she was up on Capitol Hill, Ms. Yellen got sharp questions from Democrats on why African-Americans and Hispanics havenâ€™t been feeling the full effects of the economic expansion, and what the Fed could be doing to help. Perhaps getting a jump on those concerns, Ms. Yellen raised the issue early in her prepared testimony today, noting â€œit is troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African American household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households.â€? STILL STRONG: The Fed’sÂ  Monetary Policy Report , released alongside Ms.Â Yellen’s testimony, pointed to an economy that was continuing to strengthen despite recent “mixed” signals from the labor market. The report pointed to firming inflation measures as well as a “noticeable step-up” in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of this year. Household and business credit remains available, mortgage rates have fallen and financial vulnerabilities remain “moderate,” the report said. The report said short-term interest rates would see only “gradual future increases.” SLOW GROWTH AHEAD: One of the keyÂ takeaways from Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony is an acknowledgementÂ that subpar growth could be here to stay. Of course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside riskâ€“that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future. Vulnerabilities in the global economy also remain.Â  HEREâ€™S YELLEN: The prepared testimony is out. No big surprises. Ms. YellenÂ offersÂ a brief, six-page overview of pretty much everything she said at her recent speech in Philadelphia and at a press conference last week. She flagged a number of long-run headwinds to economic growth, and said considerable uncertainties remain for the economic outlook, including risks from China and the so-called Brexit vote in the European Union, set for Thursday. Still, she offered a dose of optimism, noting a considerable step-up in second-quarter growth and strong consumer spending in recent months. PROGRAMMING NOTE: Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimonyÂ will be outÂ in just a couple of minutes, at 10 a.m., and then sheâ€™ll appear beforeÂ the Senate Banking Committee to deliver a dramatic reading of the text.Â  After that, weâ€™ll get a couple of hours of Q&A from the committee members, including a handfulÂ of prominent ones onÂ 2016 VP shortlists.Â  Ms. Yellen visits the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. It’s an election year for everyone on that panel, so you can count onÂ an even bigger circus there. MARKETS UPDATE: Stock traders are taking a far more measured approach to todayâ€™s session than they did on Monday. U.S. stocks are up marginally in early trading, with the Brexit vote and Ms. Yellenâ€™s testimony on everybodyâ€™s minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up only about 25 points, the S&P 500 is up 4 points, and the Nasdaq Composite is up about 13 points. Itâ€™s a marked slowdown from Mondayâ€™s rally, but thatâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing. â€œpanic-driven, one-day moves like we saw on Monday are typically not a characteristic of a â€œhealthy” market,â€? said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet. â€œThe largest up days routinely appear during the most volatile and fragile trading environments.â€? Another thing traders are watching is oil. Nymex crude is down nearly 2% this morning, at $49.07. Stock prices arenâ€™t tied at the hip to oil prices, but the one does tend to affect the other, and that appears to be happening now. Elsewhere, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note is flat at 1.67%, gold is down 1.1%, and the euro is down 0.7% against the dollar at 1.1247. FED OVERLOAD? Â It was less than a week ago thatÂ Ms. Yellen got toÂ spend two days sitting down with her colleagues to discuss all of these worries, and an hour beforeÂ reporters and the live cameras sharing her views. Not much has changed in the world since then, so you can catch up on her core views at our live blog from last week .Â  Just remember, this is the United States Congress in an election year. So there will be plenty of ground to cover that might not have come up from the brilliant journalistic minds in the room last week. FED FRENZY: Welcome to today’s big event. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is in the hot seat for the next two days, delivering her semiannual testimony to Congress. Is the economy in great shape or terrible condition? Will the global economy stabilize or go down the gutter? Is financial regulation protecting Americans or destroying the economy? "Accommodative" is not the first word that comes to mind: irresponsible, tin-eared, ignorant, lackeyed, and destructive are fine candidates that could. Â  Just keep printing money until it's worthless and keep interest rates so low that pension plans, insurance companies, etc. collapse.Â  Some plan! Ms. Yellin is pretty forthright, patient, but she's too accommodating of congressmen and a bubble in asset values with such low rates.Â  Nobody speaks up for the bondholder.Â Â  Watching the ignorant comments and questions by various Senators this morning makes it clear that they should not be involved in making monetary policy.Â  It amazes me that these people get elected. Only tool left is negative interest rates so they can continue to expand debt. Â Negative interest rates mean that debt is more valuable than cash. Â If the European Union unravels then the dollar will be paired with gold. Â Gold at some point will go parabolic.Â  The Fed is in a tough spot these days. If it raises rates, the global economy awash with debt could come crashing down. If it doesn't raise rates, the mountain of debt encouraged by easy money will continue to grow.Â How to predict a crisis, part two http://www.blackgolddisease.com/2016/06/predicting-crash-part-two.html What is Yellen going to say? Â The circus is much bigger than her alone and the cast of characters is too vast to move the needle at all. Â  BUT...one of these days something totally trivial (seemingly) is going to result in a big mess, like a mosquito popping an over inflated balloon. Â That's how these things work.
