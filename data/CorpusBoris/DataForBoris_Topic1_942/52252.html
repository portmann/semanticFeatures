Norwayâ€™s Central Bank Holds Rates, Krone Strengthens - Real Time Economics - WSJ OSLOâ€”Norway’s central bank on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged at 1.25%, sending the krone to heights not seen since last October. Though Norges Bank signaled a rate cut is still possible next month, it disappointed those who had hoped a slowing economy would prompt monetary easing sooner. Speaking at a news conference Governor Oystein Olsen said an interest rate cut had been discussed but the executive board had decided against it. â€œThere are still prospects that the key policy rate will be lowered in June,â€? he said. The decision to stand pat was expected by just over half of the analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal with the rest forecasting a cut to 1%. After the announcement, the Norwegian krone strengthened to a six and a half-month high against the euro, which fell to 8.31 krone from 8.45 krone. Norges Bank is in a rare position in Europe today of a central bank that is close to hitting its inflation rate target. Prices rose 2.3% in March, near a target of 2.5% and well above levels of around zero in Sweden and the eurozone. Norway rode out the worst of the European debt crisis but the outlook has darkened as lower oil prices have sapped the economy of some of its momentum. The unemployment rate has ticked up while a closely watched recent survey of businesses by the central bank showed growth expectations falling. While these factors would suggest easier monetary policy is needed, there are concerns that lower borrowing costs could push an already high level of household debt to a point where it could destabilize the economy. The level of the currency is also a factor and Norges Bank will be wary of the kroneâ€™s recent rise. A key interest rate of 1.25% leaves Norway far ahead of the eurozone and neighboring Sweden and that could attract foreign investors, pushing the currency higher and easing inflation by making imports cheaper. The bank referred to all these competing factors in its Thursday statement but gave little indication of how much weight it is placing on each. Phyllis Papdavid, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas , said that an increase in household debt was the most likely reason why Norges Bank decided not to cut rates. “Whether we see a cut in June is now going to depend very much on the data over the next few weeks,” she said.
