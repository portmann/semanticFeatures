Polish Rates Can Stay Unchanged, Says Rate-Setter Hausner - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Polish currency briefly strengthened past the psychological level of four zlotys to the euro last weekÂ (JANEK SKARZYNSKI/AFP/Getty Images) WARSAWâ€”Poland’s main interest rate may remain at 1.5%, the lowest level on record, for a prolonged period of time because the country’s economic prospects are good, a central banker said in an interview. Even the prospect of a stronger zloty, pushed higher to the euro by the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program, shouldn’t trigger a monetary-policy reaction in Poland, Jerzy Hausner told The Wall Street Journal over the weekend. “Looking at the current economic situation and taking into account that we approach the end of the council’s term, the scenario of keeping rates at the current level for a prolonged period of time seems probable to me,” Mr. Hausner said. Poland’s 10-strong monetary panel, of which nine members will depart next year, cut the benchmark rate to 1.5% in March because of stubborn price decreases since July 2014. It said that the easing cycle was over even as consumer-price inflation persisted in negative territory, with prices falling 1.5% in annual terms in March. The Polish currency briefly strengthened past the psychological level of four zlotys to the euro last week, with many economists expressing hope that the central bank could return to talk of lower borrowing costs, which would reduce the disparity between interest rates in Poland and the eurozone, making investing in the zloty less attractive. Mr. Hausner said he doesn’t share any concerns about the relatively strong Polish currency, seeing “no problem with the zloty at the moment” and adding that the rate panel “treats the foreign exchange rate as a variable it isn’t affecting.” Although current strengthening does affect factors the council is interested in, the rising trend of the zloty might reverse in the future, Mr. Hausner said. With the latest rate cut the “council has done its part” to stave off excessive capital inflows and there are other instruments and other institutions, such as fiscal policy and the finance ministry, that can also act to prevent this from happening, Mr. Hausner said. Largely ignoring the separatist conflict in Ukraine and a reciprocal trade ban between the West and Russia that ensued, Poland continued to grow at a robust 3.4% in 2014, driven by domestic demand and foreign trade. Mr. Hausner said that recent data show the Polish economy may once again deliver a positive surprise this year, when the central bank expects the growth rate to remain at 3.4%, which would help stoke inflation. “It is possible the economy will grow faster than the latest projection showed, meaning inflation will return to the target range we see as optimal at a faster pace,” Mr. Hausner said, referring to the central bank’s 1.5%-3.5% tolerance band for CPI. Declines in global oil and food prices have kept Poland’s CPI depressed for much longer than originally expected. Deflation likely bottomed out in February when CPI declined by 1.6% in annual terms, although the return to the 2.5% target will be very gradual, Mr. Hausner said. Most analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal have said Poland’s CPI will remain negative well into the third quarter of 2015 while the central bank sees inflation returning to its 1.5%-3.5% tolerance range in 2017.
