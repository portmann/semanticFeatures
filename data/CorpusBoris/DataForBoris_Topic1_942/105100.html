Economists React to the June Jobs Report: ‘Certainly Disappointing’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ U.S. employers added 223,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3%. U.S. employment has now increased for 57 consecutive months and the unemployment rate isÂ the lowest since April 2008.Â But labor-force participation has slipped to its lowest level since October 1977 and wages appear stagnant, offering a mixed picture for Federal Reserve officials as they contemplate raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. Here’s what economists had to say about Thursday’s report: “This isn’t a terrible report by any means but itâ€™s certainly disappointing. The lack of wage growth continues for another month while the labor marketâ€™s improvement certainly stalled. In terms of the Federal Reserve, one report never really changes the general narrative and this one certainly does not. We still think the Fed is on track to raise rates later this year but broadly speaking, the data is not coincident with a more rapid pace of tightening than is currently envisioned.” –Dan Greenhaus, BTIG “The jobs report was solid, but still a bit of a disappointment, starting with the gauge of job creation. The economy created 223,000 jobs during June, which was modestly below expectations. Perhaps the greater disappointment was the downward revision to estimated job creation in prior months, which trimmed 60,000 off the cumulative number. That net increase of 163,000 for the month represented a shortfall of nearly 70,000 relative to expectations.” –Jim Baird, Plante Moran Financial Advisors “The 223,000 increase in U.S. payrolls in June was a bit weaker than we had expected but is offset to some degree by the fall in the unemployment rate, to 5.3% from 5.5%. As such, we still think thereâ€™s a good chance that the Fed will hike rates in September.” –Paul Dales, Capital Economics “The net read on the economy from the monthly labor market data is that the economy is stuck on the same shallow growth trajectory that has been in place for the past several years. Even the decline in the jobless rate was a reflection of a weaker labor market.” –Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities USA “What counts is the trend in unemployment,Â which continues to fall rapidly. The headline rate is now inside the Fed’s forecast range for [the fourth quarter], 5.2% to 5.3%, and just two-tenths above the top of their range for fourth quarter next year, so policy makers are now set up nicely to tighten soon on the basis that the labor market is normalizing faster than they expected.” –Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics “The June employment report was solid. On the upside, the unemployment rate fell more than expected and job gains were again above 200,000. On the downside, the labor-force participation rate fell and there were downward revisions to April and May job numbers. Today’s employment report is within a band of expectations that could engender mixed market trading today–especially before the U.S. holiday weekend and Greek referendum.” –Jason Schenker, Prestige Economics “As has been the case with some many economic data points in the last few years, the headlines are decent, but most of the underlying details are deeply disappointing….Federal Reserve policy makers are counting on continued job growth towards full employment and wage gains to take up more labor market slack. June’s job reports might deliver on one count, but certainly not both. Inflation numbers appear to have stabilized, but the 2% mark remains elusive. It’s hard, based on that common sense assessment, to conclude that the Fed’s economic criteria for liftoff have actually been met–and the markets seem to agree.” –Guy LeBas, Janney Montgomery Scott “Overall, this is a solid but not spectacular report. The most important statistic, however, is the unemployment rate, which at 5.3% has already attained the [Federal Open Market Committee's] median projection for the fourth quarter of this year. Yet again the U.S. labor market is showing a limitation in supply whereby even moderate job growth is clearly absorbing what little slack remains. The lack of wage growth should be enough to prevent a Fed tightening at the end of this month (although some Fed officials may vote in favor of one). However, this jobs report clearly shows â€œfurther tightening in labor market conditionsâ€? and so supports the idea of a first rate hike by September.” –David Kelly, J.P. Morgan Funds “The labor market narrative…is essentially unchanged: Job creation runs faster than labor-force growth and the economy continues to approach full employment but wage increases (in these data) remain muted. All this, in our judgment, keeps the Fed on course for a September liftoff on rates and an unemployment rate that declines to around 5% by the end of the year.” –John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, RDQ Economics “While the June nonfarm payroll report earned a â€œ5/10â€? rating in our book following last monthâ€™s stellar print, the 223,000 headline gain shows a labor market that continues to add jobs at a well above-trend pace. In fact, the 12-month average growth rate of payrolls remains strong at 245,000 even as the six-month trend has shown moderation to 208,000. Given the stronger labor market trends seen during recent months, the Fed [is] unlikely to take the payroll report as a reason to take September rate hikes off the table.” –Gennadiy Goldberg, TD Securities “The trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate…trending down, which should eventually lead to more clear-cut acceleration in wages, but the hourly earnings series is back to showing no pick-up….We believe this report keeps the Fed on track for tightening at the September meeting, but there will be two more employment reports between now and then.” — Jim O’Sullivan, High Frequency Economics Jobs Report: U.S. Payrolls Climb by 223,000 Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
