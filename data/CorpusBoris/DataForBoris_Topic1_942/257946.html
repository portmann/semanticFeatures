Central Banks Must Reject The Urge To Provide 'Forward Guidance' | Seeking Alpha Over the past decade, central banks have attempted to use "forward guidance" to provide financial markets will a signal about where the central bank is leading. Last week, the European Central Bank, showed us what can happen if policy decisions don't match up with the expectations a central bank creates through "forward guidance". The Federal Reserve has faced this problem all year as it attempted to provide financial markets with "forward guidance" about when it would raise its policy rate. Central banks around the world must take note of the debacle that surrounded last weeks' policy decisions by the European Central Bank. Central Banks actions cannot afford news releases like the following. In the December 3, 2015 Financial Times we read: " Modest ECB Moves Dash Investor's Hope and Wrongfoot Markets ." And on December 4 we read: " Market Forecasts Revisited After ECB Springs Surprise ." The governing body of the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to a minus 0.3 percent and "pledged" to extend its asset purchase program by six months to at least the end of March 2017. Investors were expecting stronger action on the part of Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, and the central bank. This Mario Draghi who, in the past, had promised the he would do everything possible to maintain the Euro. These expectations had taken hold in the markets and the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar fell to just over $1.06 on Tuesday night. Longer-term interest rates dropped in Europe and in the United States in anticipation of more aggressive ECB action, and U.S. and European stock markets rose. After ECB's decision, the value of the Euro rose from around $1.06 to almost $1.10, a massive change. The yield on the 10-year German bund, which closed at 0.48% on Tuesday, rose to close at 0.68% on Wednesday as European yields rose substantially across the board. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which closed at 2.18% on Tuesday, rose to close to over 2.32% Wednesday. On Friday, Mr. Draghi attempted to regain some of the ground lost as he assured a Wall Street crowd that "there was no 'limit' to what his policymakers could do to hit their inflation targets." But, the European Central Bank is not the only central bank to suffer from the emphasis it has put on "forward guidance." The Federal Reserve System is another central bank that has gone overboard in the past eight or nine years in its emphasis upon "forward guidance." In fact, Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has emphasized in his new book, "The Courage to Act," the role he played in initiating and then sustaining the use of "forward guidance" while he was the head of the Fed. The problem with the use of "forward guidance" is that you must be able to predict the state of the economy and the state of financial markets in the future in order to be able to provide "accurate" forward guidance. In being able to forecast the future of the economy and the future of financial markets, the Federal Reserve is no better…or, no worse…than any other forecaster. And, like other forecasters, if it gets locked into its economic models it can do a lot worse than other prognosticators. Over the past twelve months or so, the Federal Reserve has particularly suffered from its efforts to provide "forward guidance." Since the Federal Reserve ended the "tapering" of its third round of quantitative easing, it has been promising a rise in its short-term, policy, interest rate. This rate has not been raised in over six years. The caveat that the Fed put into its "forward guidance" statements was that an ultimate decision to raise the rate would remain "data driven." "Forward guidance" was always couched in the terms that the policy rate would be increased as the economy picked up steam and the employment situation continued to improve. And, at first, it was expected that the policy rate would be raised in March…then June…then September…and now on December 16. But, we are now being cautioned, as a part of the Fed's forward guidance, that even though the policy rate might be increased in December, investors should not expect further increases to come along too quickly in the future. Still, as we are experiencing now, expectations build up. Markets are indicating that investors believe that the probability of an increase in the policy rate in December is now substantially more than 50 percent. It should be noted that last Wednesday, the day before the meeting of the European Central Bank, the market held relatively high expectations that the ECB would act more aggressively. "Forward guidance," in my mind, does not work and cannot work. The primary reason is that the world is too uncertain. As a consequence, the forecasting of economic activity, let along financial markets, is a highly tenuous profession. It is something the Federal Reserve has to do, but should not be so arrogant and bold as to think it can do better than everyone else. Conducting monetary policy requires some humility on the part of the officials of the central bank. Policymakers always get into trouble when they think that they know more than anyone else. Mr. Draghi, in New York on Friday, made an effort, according to the Financial Times to "regain his magic touch." Unfortunately, current Fed chair Janet Yellen, attempted last Wednesday, in a speech before the Washington Economic Club, and on Thursday, in testimony before the US Congress, to build some confidence that the Fed knows what it is doing. These efforts were basically more of the same old stuff we had been hearing and did little to raise confidence in the Fed. In fact, I don't remember a time in my professional career when the confidence in the Federal Reserve has been so low. And, I don't think that one interest rate move, even if it comes at the Fed's December meeting, will change the current attitudes about the Fed. "Forward guidance," to me, is something that can only do harm to the Fed, it cannot help it over time. No one, in my mind, can predict the economy and predict financial markets well enough to construct an economic policy that will make a policymaking institute look good.
