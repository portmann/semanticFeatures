Kocherlakota: ‘Mistake’ for Fed to Raise Rates in 2015 - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota reiterated Thursday that he thinks it would be a mistake for the Fed to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate this year. The Fed â€œcan only achieve its congressionally mandated price and employment goals by being extraordinarily patient in reducing the level of monetary accommodation,â€? Mr. Kocherlakota said in remarks prepared for delivery in Helena, Mont. â€œUnder my current outlook, I continue to believe that it would be a mistake to raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015.â€? Most Fed officials have said they expect to begin raising the benchmark federal funds rate, which has been pinned near zero since December 2008, this year as the labor market heals and as they gain confidence that still-sluggish inflation will soon firm. Chairwoman Janet Yellen last week said she expected â€œit will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.â€? Mr. Kocherlakota, however, has repeatedly argued the U.S. central bank should hold off on raising rates. In April, he said the central bank should instead wait until the second half of 2016 . He has pointed to still-subdued inflation, which has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target for three years, as one reason for patience . Earlier this month, he also called the economyâ€™s first-quarter slowdown a â€œmatter for concern.” On Thursday, Mr. Kocherlakota cited last yearâ€™s robust labor-market improvement as proof that the U.S. economy is not â€œstuck in a post-recession â€˜new normal.â€™ The pessimists were wrongâ€”and so the [Fed] should be aiming to facilitate a continuation of the 2014 improvement in the labor marketâ€? by keeping rates near zero. Mr. Kocherlakota noted that â€œeconomic activity was subduedâ€? in the first quarter of 2015, and said he believes real gross domestic product â€œmay well have contracted.â€? (The Commerce Department on Friday is expected to downgrade its initial estimate that GDP grew at a 0.2% annual pace in the first three months of the year.) Still, he said, â€œkey labor market metrics continued to improve, although at a slightly slower rate than what we observed in 2014. The message from 2015 labor market data is the same as from 2014: There is no reason to think of the Great Recession as leading to some kind of â€˜new normalâ€™ with weak labor market outcomes.â€?
