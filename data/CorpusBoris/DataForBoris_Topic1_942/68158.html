Fed’s Yellen Plans to Skip This Year’s Jackson Hole Conference - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen plans to skip the central bankâ€™s high-profile conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this year. Ms. Yellen â€œdoes not plan to attend the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas Cityâ€™s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in August,â€? a Fed spokesperson said Tuesday. â€œHowever, she looks forward to participating in the symposium from time to time in future years as part of a public speaking schedule that includes a wide variety of venues and events.â€? The Jackson Hole conference, hosted by the Kansas City Fed, typically is attended by the Fed chief and other top central bankers. Last yearâ€™s conference featured Ms. Yellen as well as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi Â  and Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda. This is the second time in three years that the Fedâ€™s top official wonâ€™t travel to Wyoming, which could take some luster off the closely watched event. Ms. Yellenâ€™s predecessor, Ben Bernanke , skipped the 2013 conference . The 2015 Jackson Hole conclave is scheduled for Aug. 27-29, just three weeks before the Fedâ€™s Sept. 16-17 policy meeting.
