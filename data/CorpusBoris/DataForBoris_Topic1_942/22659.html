Dudley: Rate-Rise Timing Data-Dependent, Uncertain in Nature - Real Time Economics - WSJ William Dudley expects the Fedâ€™s rate increases to follow a â€œshallowâ€? path, but said that reaction in the short-term rates market could alter that process. As the Federal Reserve watches economic developments in considering when best to raise rates, how interest-rate markets respond will be just as important in determining the policy path, a top U.S. central bank official said Monday. â€œHow fast the normalization process will proceed depends mainly on two factors: how the economy evolves and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate,â€? according to the text of prepared remarks to be made by William Dudley , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, N.J. While Mr. Dudley said he expects the Fedâ€™s rate increases to follow a â€œshallowâ€? path, he added that reaction in the short-term rates market could alter that process. If short-term rates stay low, the Fed may have to lift the policy rate more quickly to â€œexert some restraint on financial market conditions.â€? If short-term rates respond by rising quickly, the Fed could slow down the rate-increase process, or even pause. The central banker wasn’t as focused on the exact timing of the initial rate hike, saying it hinges on how the U.S. economy evolves. â€œThe timing of normalization will be data dependent and remains uncertain because the future evolution of the economy cannot be fully anticipated,â€? he said. Mr. Dudley said he sees the U.S. economy growing at a similar pace seen in the past two years, which would help bring the unemployment rate toward 5% by the second half of the year from the current 5.5%. While he acknowledged Marchâ€™s weak payrolls data reported last Friday and estimates the first quarter likely grew a disappointing 1%, the official said the weakness was likely caused in large part by temporary factor such as the harsh winter in the Northeast and Midwest. The central banker holds a more optimistic outlook on the economy, saying the jobless rates is at a point where wages may start to increase and lend further support to the economy. He sees inflation firming later this year.
