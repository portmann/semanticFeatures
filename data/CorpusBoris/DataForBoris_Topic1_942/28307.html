Fed’s Kocherlakota Worried Too-Low Inflation Could Persist for Years - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said Tuesday he is worried undesirably low levels of inflation could be embedded in the U.S. economy for years to come. “I’m much more worried about the downside” of having inflation stay persistently under the Fed’s 2% target, Mr. Kocherlakota said. “We’ve see in Europe and Japan, that when inflation gets stuck at low levels, it’s very hard to get it back up,” he said. The policymaker’s warning came in remarks that reiterated his belief that raising short-term interest rates this year would be a mistake given tepid inflation and evidence the job market still has more ground to gain. With inflation well under the Fed’s official 2% target and the strong chance it will stay that way for several more years, “raising the Fed funds rate in 2015 would be inappropriate, because such an action would serve to further delay the return of inflation to target.” The official said while the job market had a good year in 2014, it is still trying to climb out of a deep hole. Because of that, the Fed should be doing all it can to aid further job market gains, which would in turn help push inflation back to desired levels. “The data on inflation and employment show that we could produce and consume more as a country by utilizing more of our available human resources,” Mr. Kocherlakota said. “Monetary policy can–and should–be used to help make that desirable outcome happen,” he said. Mr. Kocherlakota’s comments came from the text of a speech prepared for a town-hall event held by his bank in Winona, Minn. He isn’t currently a voting member of the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. The official is due to leave the bank in early 2016. Mr. Kocherlakota has been a steadfast opponent of any move to raise interest rates this year, something many of his colleagues would like to see. Almost all central bank officials see rates moving up off of current near-zero levels at some point over 2015. A number of central bankers had been gravitating toward favoring the move at some point between June and September, but weak data over the start of the year has introduced new uncertainty into the outlook, and suggests Fed officials may be viewing an increase more cautiously. For some time now, Mr. Kocherlakota has argued any rate raise should be delayed until next year. Faced with falling short of its 2% inflation target for nearly three years, the official sees no need to boost borrowing costs when the Fed is falling so short on this key mandate. Most Fed officials expect to see a slow rise in inflation, and attribute much of the current weakness to the sharp drop in oil prices seen over recent months.
