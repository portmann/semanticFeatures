Fed’s Lockhart Says Dollar Rise Becoming More of an Issue for Fed - Real Time Economics - WSJ DETROITâ€”Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said Thursday he’s paying increased attention to what has been a rising dollar to see if it’s weighing on the economy at a time where the central bank is getting closer to raising interest rates. The dollar’s value is “part of that picture” the Fed will consider as it decides what to do with monetary policy, Mr. Lockhart said. Given its robust rise so far, “the dollar can be a slight drag on our economy going forward,” most notably for exporters who will find their wares harder to sell overseas, he said. Mr. Lockhart noted that when the dollar started to gain ground, “I was more prepared at the beginning to assume it would be a small factor” for the economy. But as the currency has continued to go up, evidence has mounted that it is pulling in capital from overseas that is pushing borrowing costs down at a time when the Fed is getting ready to have them go the other way. Actions by other major central banks that are providing stimulus are helping drive that process, he said. The international climate seems to be “dampening interest rates. I think we have to be a little concerned the longer rates will rise in concert” with any Fed move to push short-term rates higher, Mr. Lockhart said. Mr. Lockhart’s comments came from an appearance at the Engage International Investment Education Symposium held in Detroit. The official repeated that the Fed’s meetings this summer are in play for possible rate rises. “The economy is sufficiently strong and resilient that we can begin to cycle out of what was clearly an extraordinary set of measures to something more normal,” he said. Fed meetings from June onward are “in play” he said, but he added he was “agnostic” about the exact timing of the move. Speaking with reporters after his speech, Mr. Lockhart expressed his sympathy for an argument made by New York Fed President William Dudley. Flagging the importance of market conditions in conveying changes in Fed policy to the broader economy, Mr. Dudley has said that if the Fed raises rates and the market does not react, it could make a case for more aggressive action in the future. Conversely, a rate rise that brings a notable boost in longer-term borrowing costs could allow the Fed to proceed more slowly with rate increases. Mr. Lockhart emphasized his first order of business was thinking about the outlook for short-term rates. But he told reporters “there could be conditions when fighting the Fed is a real circumstance,” and the officials may need to be more aggressive if rate rises don’t affect longer-term borrowing costs found in the bond market. Mr. Lockhart is a voting member of the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and many view the official as a bellwether of the consensus outlook. His comments follow in the wake of last week’s policy meeting. Then, officials continued to prepare the way for interest-rate increases. They ended their pledge to be “patient” on the timing of action, and in a press conference held after the meeting, Chairwoman Janet Yellen emphasized officials will start actively debating lifting rates off of currently near-zero starting with the mid-June FOMC meeting. Mr. Lockhart noted at the event that while he continues to expect 2.5% to 3% gains in overall economic activity, recent evidence points to a weak start to the year. But he cautioned against reading too much into this potential weakness given the limited nature of the data available. The central banker also noted that he’s revised his estimate of the jobless rate the economy needs to generate an accelerating level of wage gains. Along with many of his colleagues, he now thinks this level is lower, at around 5%, or perhaps even lower. The current jobless rate is at 5.5%.
