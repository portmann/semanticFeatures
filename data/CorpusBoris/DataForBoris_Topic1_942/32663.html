Canadaâ€™s Poloz Sees â€˜Positiveâ€™ Risk That U.S. Grows Better Than Expected - Real Time Economics - WSJ Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said Monday he isn’t worried about the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate rises on his country. Canadaâ€™s central bank chief said Monday one of most notable risks facing his outlook is unexpected vigor in the U.S. economy. Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, speaking at the Bloomberg Americas Monetary Summit in New York, sounded a rare note of optimism for the U.S. as many worry whether an unexpected cooling at the start of the year will hold sway over the rest of the year. The slowdown is enough that many Federal Reserve officials appear open to delaying until later in the year an increase in what are now near-zero rates. Speaking ahead of Mr. Poloz, Federal Reserve Bank ofÂ New York President William Dudley said that â€œhopefully,â€? rates can rise this year, in remarks that expressed optimism the weakness seen in the first quarter will be temporary. Mr. Poloz said the U.S. continues to have very strong fundamentals. â€œItâ€™s a positive risk,â€? but all the same, one of the biggest uncertainties facing the Bank of Canada outlook is a better-than-expected outcome for the U.S. economy, he said. Mr. Poloz said he isn’t worried about the impact of Fed interest rate rises on his country. â€œWhenever liftoff happens, it will be in a context thatâ€™s helpful to usâ€? because it will signal strength in the U.S. economy, he said. A Fed rate rise â€œwould be a positive for usâ€? and the Bank of Canada would monitor markets for any turbulence related to changes in American monetary policy. More broadly, Mr. Poloz said aggressive Fed actions over recent years are something everyone should praise. â€œWe lose sight of the fact we could still be in the second Great Depression right nowâ€? if the Fed hadnâ€™t pursued its aggressive bond-buying campaigns. â€œWe owe a debt to U.S. policy makers who stepped upâ€? and took strong action, he said. In the rest of his remarks, Mr. Poloz noted the Bank of Canada doesn’t want to surprise markets with policy changes. He said the policy outlook is firmly data-dependent, explaining â€œI donâ€™t have a biasâ€? about the current level of rates. Mr. Poloz said the policy stance put in place in January, with short-term rates at 0.75%, is at an â€œappropriate level.â€?
