Fed runs out of patience, risk rally runs out of road: James Saft March 6 (Reuters) – The Fed is going to run out of patience, which means the equity rally may run out of road. Job creation blew through expectations in February, with 295,000 positions added, as the U.S. jobless rate sank to a 6-1/2-year low of 5.5 percent. Average hourly earnings are rising at a 2 percent annual clip, slightly down from the month before but well in excess of consumer inflation. Now neither the trend nor the absolute numbers are consistent with zero interest rates, especially given that an The most likely course: the Federal Reserve moves “We expect monetary policymakers to drop ‘patient’ from the communiquÃ© following the March meeting, setting the stage for an initial liftoff in rates in June,” Brian Jones, economist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note to clients. While there is still disagreement within the Fed, even John the doves, is making impatient noises. “Overshooting our target would force us into a much more dramatic rate hike to reverse course, which could have a destabilizing effect on the markets and possibly damage the And while markets moved to narrow the gap on Friday, there is still a startling disconnect between their expectations of the rate of ascent in rates and those of the Fed’s own forecasts. Before six weeks or so ago, the market had it pretty much its own way, but if that tension is going to be resolved in favor of the central bank, as these things usually are, the clear risks for most financial assets are to the downside. The next FOMC meeting on March 17-18, ending with an interest rate decision, statement, new forecasts and a press conference by Janet Yellen, is the most likely venue for the resolution. If the Fed drops “patience,” the reality of a rate Between now and March 18 we can expect the financial markets to focus not on the good news of the moderate strength of the Equities got a start on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling 1.5 percent, leaving it clinging to about a half a percent gain for 2015. Ten-year Treasuries sold off even more strikingly, sending yields up 13.5 basis points to 2.25 percent, a rise of more than 6 percent. Ten-year yields have risen by more than a third since Feb. 2. If the bond market move is sustained and extended, or perhaps more to the point, if nothing dramatic happens in the economy to change the apparent direction of travel, investors The strong performance of equities in the U.S. has benefited from two strong tailwinds. First monetary policy, up until now, has been designed to shake money out of safety and into riskier assets. Higher interest rates don’t just diminish the value of the stream of future cashflows which a share in a business The second equity tailwind has been high corporate profitability, based in part on the long-term fall in the share Wages may now be on the rise. Wal-Mart recently said it would spend about $1 billion raising wages and improving schedules for 500,000 of its lowest-paid employees. Others like retailer T.J. Maxx have made similar moves. The Fed’s Beige Book also noted employers in the Atlanta and Chicago Fed districts were raising wages for unskilled and entry-level workers. The Rising wages are welcome but imply falling margins. Falling margins and rising interest rates are an unlovely combination for riskier assets, even in a recovery.
