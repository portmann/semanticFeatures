Fed's Stanley Fischer Continues To Cheerlead For Inflation | Seeking Alpha Stanley Fischer, Fed vice-chair continues to see "green shoots" or in his current description "first stirrings" of a return of greater inflation. Mr. Fischer seems to have been supported in recent days by the inflationary expectations that are built into the financial markets. Still, one must be very careful to rely on one or just a few new pieces of information because the future of the economy is quite uncertain. Stanley Fischer, vice-chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System continues to lead the crowd that sees inflation in the United States returning toward the Fed's 2.0 inflation target. In a speech given before the National Association for Business Economics Economic Policy Conference in Washington, D. C. yesterday, Mr. Fischer talked about the "first stirrings" of a rise in inflation. I believe that "first stirrings" must now be the official Federal Reserve description of what former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke referred to as "green shoots." That is, the first piece of information that points to whatever it is that the policy official wants to see happening. Mr. Fischer referenced how the strong job market numbers may work their way through the economy to produce higher rates of inflation in the future. Apparently, a significant number of investors have taken the job numbers, along with other, as a sign of the expectation of rising inflation and have put this belief into their actions. As I posted yesterday, " Inflationary Expectation are Rising ." Interestingly, this morning, the Financial Times had a similar article, " Inflation Expectations Gather Pace in US ." The problem with "green shoots" or with "first stirrings" is how fragile one…or just a few pieces of information…might be. The leading edge of the financial market inflationary expectations is the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Yesterday, the 10-year note closed to 1.91 percent yield. At 9:45 this morning the 10-year note was trading to yield 1.82 percent. The implication is that the calculated value for inflationary expectations has dropped by almost 10 basis points. I wrote my post yesterday in an attempt to show just how volatile are the financial markets and how they are reacting…or, over-reacting…to this piece of information…or, that piece of information. The timing of this post was also ironic because former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers had an op-ed article in the Financial Times yesterday " A World Stumped by Stubbornly Low Inflation " in which he wrote about currently low and falling inflationary expectations. Stanley Fischer is an economist I highly respect and he has done very well both in economic research and as a real-world policy maker. However, in this case on his viewpoint on the future of inflation, I believe that he has become locked in his forecast and has stayed with this expectation too long. As a consequence, he is searching for any piece of data that might support his viewpoint, regardless of all else that is going on. The problem is that he seems to hanging onto his ties with "the Phillips Curve," the idea that there is a relationship between the rate of unemployment in the economy and the rate of inflation. The theory states that as the rate of unemployment comes down inflation must go up. Mr. Fischer argues that the link between high levels of employment and inflation "has never been very strong, but it exists, and we may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate-something that we would like to see happen." The economist Milton Friedman argued in the 1960s that the relationship between inflation and employment was not a stable one and it bounces around a lot. I believe that over time, Mr. Friedman has been proven correct, yet officials at the Federal Reserve seem to hang onto this idea as the last hope of having any idea that their policies might work. Investors, in my opinion, must stay loose with respect to the future of inflation because there is just so much going on in the world today that statistics released are going to be confusing and that this confusion will cause more market volatility. Just look at the headlines of another Wall Street Journal op-ed piece today, " Rising Global Debt and the Deflation Threat ."
