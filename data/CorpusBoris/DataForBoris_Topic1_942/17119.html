Grand Central: Bernanke to Seniors: Don’t Blame Me for Your Low CD - Real Time Economics - WSJ U.K.â€™s Biggest Banks Subject to Stress Test We tend to give central banks credit and blame for just about every development in financial markets and the broader economy these days. Stock market rallies, commodity price booms and busts, currency movements, real estate crashes, a boom in U.S. subprime auto loans. Ask any market commentator, and you will inevitably be shown a thread that traces back to the people in charge of the money supply. Ben Bernanke â€“ the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve of all people â€“ begs to differ. The Fed doesnâ€™t even set interest rates, he argues in a new blog that heâ€™s launching this morning at the Brookings Institution website. Knute Wicksell, the Swedish economist, posited more than a century ago that an economy has an equilibrium real interest rate â€“ some natural level of interest, adjusted for inflation, which balances savings and investment. The equilibrium real rates changes over time as forces shaping the economy and expectations for its performance shift.Â  The central bank doesnâ€™t decide what this rate is. Its main job is to avoid making mistakes by not pushing the overnight risk-free interest rate that it does set too far away from this equilibrium rate. Senior citizens who blame him for low interest rates thus have it all wrong, the slightly defensive ex-Fed chairman argues in his first blog post. When I was chairman, more than one legislator accused me and my colleagues on the Fedâ€™s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee of â€œthrowing seniors under the busâ€? (to use the words of one senator) by keeping interest rates low. The legislators were concerned about retirees living off their savings and able to obtain only very low rates of return on those savings â€¦ But if the goal was for retirees to enjoy sustainably higher real returns, then the Fedâ€™s raising interest rates prematurely would have been exactly the wrong thing to do. In the weak (but recovering) economy of the past few years, all indications are that the equilibrium real interest rate has been exceptionally low, probably negative. A premature increase in interest rates engineered by the Fed would therefore have likely led after a short time to an economic slowdown and, consequently, lower returns on capital investments. The slowing economy in turn would have forced the Fed to capitulate and reduce market interest rates again. This is hardly a hypothetical scenario: In recent years, several major central banks have prematurely raised interest rates, only to be forced by a worsening economy to backpedal and retract the increases. Ultimately, the best way to improve the returns attainable by savers was to do what the Fed actually did: keep rates low (closer to the low equilibrium rate), so that the economy could recover and more quickly reach the point of producing healthier investment returns. This Bernanke blog post is more than an ex-Fed leader settling some scores. The matter of equilibrium real interest rates is of great import inside central banks today. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen addressed it Friday in a speech in San Francisco . Fed officials have long seen the equilibrium rate in the U.S. at around 2%, a rate that led them toward 4% short-term interest rates when adding in compensation for 2% inflation.Â  After the financial crisis, the equilibrium rate tumbled below zero. Fed officials believe it is recovering as the economy recovers. But they have strong doubts it will return to 2% any time soon. â€œSubstantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest rate,â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œMarket participants appear to be fairly pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time. That is two Fed leaders in two days, both arguing that low rates can’t rise quickly because the economy won’t let them. Fedâ€™s Janet Yellen Pitches Cautious Tack on Rate Increases. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen laid out a case for a â€œgradualist approachâ€? to interest-rate increases in the years ahead, spelling out in greater detail than she has before the risks of moving too aggressively to tighten U.S. credit. â€œLike most of my [Fed] colleagues, I believe the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds target sometime this year,” she said in a speech Friday. Yellen Upbeat On Foreign Central Bank Stimulus For US, Despite Dollar Impact. Ms. Yellen said itâ€™s true that stimulus policies in the European Union and Japan were helping lead to a stronger dollar that will weigh on total U.S. growth by lowering American exports. But she cautioned the actions leading to stronger dollar are also pushing down long-term borrowing costs for the U.S. These rates are â€œalso a positiveâ€? for the outlook, she said.

Forecasters Shrug off Winter Economic Blues. A poll of 50 professional forecasters by the National Association for Business Economics estimated a 3.1% advance for U.S. gross domestic product this year, which would be the best performance in a decade and a marked improvement from the 2.2% to 2.4% range of the prior three years. The stronger economic backdrop is one reason the Fed is expected to start raising interest rates in the second or third quarter of the year. The federal funds rate, pinned near zero since the end of 2008, is seen reaching 0.75% by the end of the year and 2% by the end of 2016. The survey was conducted prior to the latest Fed meeting, at which officials opened the door to raising rates as early as midyear .Â  -Fed’s Fischer speaks on â€œNonbank Financial Intermediation, Financial Stability and the Road Forwardâ€? at a conference in Stone Mountain, Ga. at 7:15 p.m. EDT -ECBâ€™s Makuch speaks in Slovakia at 1200 GMT -Richmond Fed’s Lacker speaks on the economic outlook in Richmond, Va. at 8 a.m. EDT -Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart delivers welcoming remarks at a conference in Stone Mountain, Ga. at 8:50 a.m. EDT -Cleveland Fedâ€™s Mester moderates a policy session at a conference in Stone Mountain, Ga. at 9 a.m. EDT -San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams participates in a policy session at a conference in Stone Mountain, Ga. at 8:30 a.m. EDT -European Central Bank releases minutes of its March 4-5 policy meeting at 1130 GMT -Fedâ€™s Yellen delivers brief welcoming remarks at a conference in Washington at 8:40 a.m. EDT -U.S. Labor Department releases the March jobs report at 8:30 a.m. EDT -Minneapolis Fedâ€™s Kocherlakota speaks in Washington at 8:30 a.m. EDT Securitization and Mortgage Default. “Using a large data set that includes information on both securitized and nonsecuritized mortgages, we have demonstrated robust evidence that private-securitized loans originated during 2005â€“2006 were riskier than comparable nonsecuritized loans,” Ronel Elul wrote in a working paper from the Philadelphia Fed . Low Rates? Get Used to It, writes Barry Ritholtz in a Bloomberg View column. “I have been fairly agnostic on several issues related to where interest rates are heading. It has never been my job to forecast where the 10-year yield will be in six months. Not predicting and not caring are two very different things, however. Rates matter a great deal — to investors, to the economy and most of all to debtors of every kind. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone in finance who would ever admit to believing that rates donâ€™t matter. Despite the importance of bond yields and borrowing costs, few seem to have any idea how to analyze them in a way that provides a helpful conclusion.” -The U.S. economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.2% in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday.Â  - U.S. consumer optimism fell in March as slightly higher gasoline prices and bad weather weighed on lower-income households.
