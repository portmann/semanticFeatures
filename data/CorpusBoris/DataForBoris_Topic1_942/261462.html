Hiring, Firing and Quitting Have Finally Gotten Close to Where Janet Yellen Wants Them - Real Time Economics - WSJ In March 2013, then-Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen saidÂ she was going to be closely monitoring the labor market’s churnâ€”the millions of monthly hirings and firings and quits and retirements that underlie the net job gains reported by the Labor Department each month. Slowly but surely, the three indicators have improved the wayÂ now-Chairwoman Yellen hoped. Layoffs have not risen, the rate of hiring has accelerated, and the share of people voluntarily quitting has climbed, according to anÂ update today from the Labor Department’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as Jolts. The progress of the labor market along these dimensions underscores the central bank’s confidence that the economy isÂ finallyÂ  healthy enough for the Fed to raise its target interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. In March of 2013, about 2.1 million workers quit their jobs, a rate of about 1.5%. Those numbers have improved slowly enough that the improvement is hard to notice from one month to the next (in this month’s report, all the key measures were “little changed”). But over the course of the past two and a half years, the improvement has been considerable. In October, 2.8 million people quit their jobs, a rate of 1.9%â€”roughly the same as in December 2007, the month the economy began to decline into recession. Ms. Yellen had said in her speech “a pickup in the quit rate, which also remains at a low level, would signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good–in other words, that labor demand has strengthened.” Put another way, just under half of the people who left a job in March 2013 did so voluntarily. The majority of job separations were still involuntary layoffs or departures due to retirement, death or disability. Among people who left a job in October, by contrast, 57% did so voluntarily. Layoffs, on the other hand, have remained persistently low: There were 1.8 million layoffs in March 2013 and 1.7 million in October 2015. The rate of layoffs has held steady between 1.1% and 1.3%. The layoff rate skyrockets during recessions, but falls as the economy improves. A layoff rate of 1.1% is the lowest in the history of the series. In her remarks, Ms. Yellen had said “layoffs and discharges as a share of total employment have already returned to their prerecession level, while the hiring rate remains depressed.Â Therefore, going forward, I would look for an increase in the rate of hiring.” Since then, the monthly pace of hiring has climbed to 5.1 million from 4.3 million. The level and rate of hiring is almost exactly where it was in December 2007. That’s not to sayÂ all has been well with the economyâ€”the pace of recovery has been grindingly slow at a time when millions of unemployed workers were desperate. And there are still puzzles in this data. The monthly level of job openings has risen to record highs. Hiring has recovered much more slowly, a sign that something is not quite right: Employers are just not filling all of their available jobs. But over two and a half grinding years, the metrics Ms. Yellen has been watching have, slowly but significantly, improved.

SIU315;  Interest rates will be raised very slowly, a fraction of a percent at a time, so that the effect can be gauged. How much can we expect interest rates to be raised? Have they released what the new target rate will be? The government just got finished last year revising NOMINAL gross domestic product going back 50 years--numbers no one had altered for all that time--to make government look like it was always bigger and the Carter years look about as good as the Reagan second-term growth spurt.  Employment data now are noncomparable with earlier years because so many more people are part-timers.  The labor force participation rate has plummeted.  So of course Yellen is happy now.  She is a socialist Democrat. Based on the Gini coefficient America is a third world country; burdened labour costs have been relentlessly driven down since the early 1970s and especially since 2000.  For millions of Americans the choice is between abject poverty if not homelessness or a job that pays enough to create the illusion of hope even if it is inadequate to live on. The trickle up economy will create create greater instability and investment uncertainty just as it did in the last decades of the 19th and early 20th centuries, a triumph of ideology over growth. it's very unfortunate that the fed still exists in any form,it's a holdover from the fdr days and totally useless,ron paul has advocated to end this market force menace for years(about all I agree with that he's said) if we let the marketplace set rates then the real economy would prevail,PERIOD,yellen and her crew can go back to j hole and spend more taxpayers money jawboning about academia previous What Happened to the Breakout Startup?
