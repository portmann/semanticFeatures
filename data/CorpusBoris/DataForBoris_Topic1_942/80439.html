Fed Policy May Have Widened America’s Wealth Inequality, Philadelphia Fed Paper Says - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Fed’s unconventional monetary policy does not strive at redistribution, but some is hard to avoid, says a new Philadelphia Fed paper. Federal ReserveÂ policies launched in a historic economic slump may have exacerbated wealth disparities in the U.S., according to new research from the Philadelphia Fed. â€œMonetary policy currently implemented by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks is not intended to benefit one segment of the population at the expense of another by redistributing income and wealth,â€? writes economist Makoto Nakajima in the second quarter edition of the regional central bankâ€™s Business Review . Such effects are especially pronounced when the central bank undertakes a concerted monetary stimulus as it did during the financial crisis of 2008 and the weak economic recovery that followed, the report says. Official borrowing costs have been effectively zero for six and a half years, and the Fed purchased more than $3 trillion in mortgage and Treasury bonds in order to further encourage borrowing and investment by keeping long-term rates down. His findings are part of an unsettled debate about the effects, intended and otherwise , of the Fedâ€™s unconventional policies , which came after official rates had already hit zero but the economy and financial markets still neededÂ  additional support. â€œResearch focusing on the redistributive effects of unconventional monetary policy is virtually nonexistent, because policymakers started using forward guidance and quantitative easing only recently,â€? Mr. Nakajima says. Nonetheless, he argues the redistributive consequences are real, and should not be ignored, even if they are hard to measure and often work in opposing directions. For instance, if lower interest rates boost employment and the poor have higher jobless rates, then a loose monetary policy can be seen as redistributive in the direction of lower-income earners. At the same time, QE has been seen as key driving force behind a sharp rally in the stock market, which benefits the wealth disproportionately. â€œWhether and how much a wealthy household gains or loses from monetary policy depends on the relative strength of these different effects on the composition of its portfolio of assets and debt,â€? the Philadelphia Fed report says.
