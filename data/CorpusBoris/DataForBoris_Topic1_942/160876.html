5 Points to Watch in the ECB’s September Meeting - WSJ 5 Points to Watch in the ECB’s September Meeting Is it time to take the European Central Bankâ€™s stimulus off cruise control? This is the key question heading into Thursday’s policy meeting. The ECB has been buying roughly â‚¬60 billion ($67.7 billion) per month in public and private bonds–mostly government bonds–since March. The program, known as quantitative easing or QE, is intended to run at least through September 2016. Until recently, economists expected the ECB to remain steadily on this course, and that any debate on extending the purchases was unlikely until sometime next year. But events in financial markets and China–coupled with lower oil prices–have narrowed that calendar. Annual inflation was 0.2% last month, far below the ECB’s target near 2%. Given the plunge in oil prices last month that has yet to work through the economy, consumer prices are likely to stay super low for months. The ECB can take some comfort from data showing the eurozone economy continues to heal, albeit slowly. Lending to companies and households has improved and unemployment has fallen . Greece, and its high stakes debt negotiations with the rest of Europe, dominated ECB President Mario Draghi’s last press conference on July 16. Things have changed a lot since . Look for Mr. Draghi to be pressed on China’s slowdown, the euro’s recent rise and weak commodity prices–all of which point to near-zero inflation in coming months. The ECB staffâ€™s economic and inflation forecasts are often an afterthought to Mr. Draghi’s press conference. They will be more significant Thursday, particularly the forecast for inflation in 2017. The last estimate, in June, pegged it at 1.8%. If that is reduced by much, Mr. Draghi may have a tough time explaining why the bank isn’t doing more. If the ECB refrains from new measures, Mr. Draghi’s hints on future steps will be key. “Draghi will say that risks to inflation have shifted to the downside and he will emphasize the central bankâ€™s ability and willingness to act,” said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Greg Fuzesi in a research note. One way to do that would be to signal that QE is likely to extend beyond its targeted September 2016 end date or add new types of securities to the pool of available assets, allowing the ECB to eventually crank up QE beyond â‚¬60 billion per month. The ECB’s road to QE, which began in earnest about one year ago, led to a sharp weakening of the euro’s exchange rate, which typically boosts both exports and inflation. It went from over $1.31 against the U.S. dollar last September to as low as $1.05 after QE was launched in March. But recent market turmoil pushed it higher again to about $1.16 in late August before falling again. Central bankers typically shy away from commenting on exchange rates, but Thursday’s press conference gives Mr. Draghi a chance to underscore the divergence between the Federal Reserve–which is expected to raise rates sometime this year–and the ECB’s continued easy money policies. OK, this probably wonâ€™t be high on the agenda Thursday or dominate the press conference. But with Greeks headed to the polls later this month, and opinion surveys signaling a tight race that could throw the country back into political uncertainty, this might just be a one-meeting respite for Mr. Draghi. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
