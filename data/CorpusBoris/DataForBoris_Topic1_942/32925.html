France’s Noyer: ECB Bond Buying ‘Very Effective’ So Far - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORKâ€”Banque de France governor Christian Noyer offered support for the European Central Bank’s bond buying stimulus program. “Unconventional monetary policies are necessary but complex,” Mr. Noyer said at the Paris Europlace International Financial Forum held in New York. Because these policies are challenging, central banks that employ them must weigh the tradeoffs and risks, but at the same time, when circumstances call for action, central banks must not shy away from what must be done, he said. Using a balance sheet “has proven effective,” Mr. Noyer said, adding that bond-buying policies “can and will be deployed all the more efficiently that the rest of the policy environment remains sound.” When it comes to the stimulus now being pursued by the European Central Bank, Mr. Noyer said the signaling influences of ECB bond buying “have been very effective” as shown by market reactions. He added that European officials had weighed the risks of their policies and had found an appropriate balance.
