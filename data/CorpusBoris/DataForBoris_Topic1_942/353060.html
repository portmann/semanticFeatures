The Fed's 2 New Mandates | Seeking Alpha Once, the Fed had two mandates, steady prices and high employment. Now, it has two more, to eliminate business cycles and economic uncertainty. That's why it doesn't raise interest rates though the economy is already at full employment. For years, the Federal Reserve had two clear mandates: price stability and high employment. In practice, these mandates came to mean an inflation target of 2 percent and an unemployment target equal to the natural rate, the unemployment rate consistent with full employment, currently set at around 5 percent. The Fed's explicit targets made it easy for market participants to predict the FOMC's next policy move, by following closely a host of indicators that pointed the direction of the economy. Anytime, these indicators pointed to inflation rates above targets, market participants expected the FOMC to raise interest rates to bring inflation back to the target. Anytime, by contrast, macroeconomic indicators pointed to an unemployment rate edging above the natural rate, market participants expected the FOMC to cut interest rates. Simply, put the Fed tried to tame business cycles and economic uncertainty. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the Fed has two new mandates, at least that's my conclusion by following the speeches of Fed Chair Janet Yellen: to eliminate business cycles and economic uncertainty. That's why the Fed continues to keep both short-term and long-term interest rates at ultra low levels, though the US economy is at full employment. *That's equal to the natural rate of unemployment. That became obvious in Chair Yellen's speech Tuesday where she sited, once again, global uncertainty as the reason for not raising interest rates anytime soon. The Fed's departure from its traditional mandates has left some economic observers confused, but not Wall Street, which raced towards new highs following Chair Yellen's speech. The trouble is that business cycles and economic uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated, not in a market system. Those of us who have been around Wall Street long enough know very well what happens to financial assets when traders and investors become true believers in an omniscient Fed. That's why I'll use the Fed driven rallies to take some money off the table at this point.
