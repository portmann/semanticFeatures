Thailand’s Central Bank Stands Pat - Real Time Economics - WSJ Thailand’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, following two consecutive surprise cuts to help support the economic recovery. The Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to maintain the one-day repurchase rate at 1.5%. The central bank made two back-to-back 25-basis-point cuts at its previous meetings in March and April. “Economic momentum in the first four months of 2015 softened due to sluggish private consumption and continued contraction in exports,” the central bank said in a statement. “Nevertheless, increased disbursement of public investment expenditure and continued improvement in tourism helped shore up the economy.” The bank’s latest decision is in line with the prediction in a poll by The Wall Street Journal, in which 13 of 14 economists forecast no further monetary easing. “Lower interest rates may aggravate the already-high household debt problem in Thailand, while the recent dynamics in oil prices may point to upside surprise,” said UOB in a research note. The country’s household debt stood at 85.9% of gross domestic product at the end of the fourth quarter last year, according to the Bank of Thailand. Thailand’s economy is still subject to downside risks from the global economy and monetary policy will be kept accommodative to support the local economic recovery, Mathee Supapongse, the Monetary Policy Committee’s secretary, said. The committee also said it stands ready to “utilize the available policy space appropriately in order to support the ongoing recovery and maintain long-term financial stability.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
