Fed’s George Says Central Bank Should Implement Modest Rate Rises ‘Now’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ Kansas City Fed President Esther George, shown last year at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, said Thursday, “We would be wise to act modestly but act now.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George renewed her call for the U.S. central bank to raise borrowing costs in the American economy, saying Thursday that “we would be wise to act modestly but act now.” Ms. George, who has long warned the Fed risks creating unstable markets and an inflation surge if it keeps rates too low for too long, said the U.S. economy has been growing and is likely to continue to grow. For her, that renders moot the need for the Fed to keep its short-term target rate at an emergency near-zero setting. “Monetary policy must step back and allow market forces to resume their critical role of pricing risk and allocating capital to its best use,” Ms. George said in the text of a speech to be presented at an event in Stillwater, Okla. She acknowledged that low rates may be needed “for some time.” Ms. George said “starting now to move rates up slowly and deliberately will allow the economy to adjust to a more-normal and, in my view, appropriate stance of monetary policy that will lead to long-term growth.” Keeping rates at rock-bottom levels could create trouble and give policy makers “few and possibly poor options” when it comes to setting short-term rates in the future. Ms. George is not currently a voting member of the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. She spoke at a time where her views have converged to some degree with that of the majority of her Fed colleagues, who largely agree that the Fed will be able to raise rates this year. While her colleagues haven’t offered firm guidance about when the Fed will act, some officials have pointed to the central bank’s September gathering as a possible time. Official Fed forecasts suggested official will raise rates once or twice this year, in quarter percentage point increments. So far, Fed officials who have spoken over recent days have maintained their views on the economy and monetary policy, and have downplayed risks to the U.S. from China’s stock market implosion and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding events in Europe related to Greece. Some observers believe overseas trouble, if it worsens, could delay Fed officials desire to raise rates. Meanwhile, some Fed officials simply see no urgency to raise rates when inflation is so weak. Speaking to reporters Thursday Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he favored a mid-2016 rate rise, saying “I just don’t see why we should be in a hurry with all of the risks we face. A little more time doesn’t hurt.” Ms. George was upbeat on the economy’s outlook in her speech, and downplayed the fact the Fed has failed to achieve its 2% price rise target for three years. “The economic data generally point to an economy that is moving in the right direction and has consistently sustained growth over the past five years,” Ms. George said. “I expect the economy to resume its expansion at an above-trend growth rate through the end of the year and labor market conditions to continue improving,” she said. Ms. George said underlying inflation trends aren’t as weak as they appear and are depressed by temporary factors. And while pockets of weakness still persist in the job market, hiring as by and large made a lot of progress. Ms. George said the Fed can’t wait until it sees a perfect outcome for its inflation and job goals, explaining that keep rates low “is risky” the longer it goes on.
