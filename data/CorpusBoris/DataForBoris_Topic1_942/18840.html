GLD Weakness As Chair Yellen Overrules Chicago Fed - SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD) | Seeking Alpha Yellen is the final voice after various opinions by FOMC members, and she struck a relatively hawkish tone. Yellen had an overall bullish assessment of the economy and delinked wage inflation from the Fed’s price stability mandate due to exogenous factors. Yellen also overruled Chicago Fed’s Evans and asserted that there are costs for ‘gradualist’ approach to monetary tightening such as Fed’s credibility and financial stability. Hawkish Atlanta Fed’s Lockhart interview moved USD into bullish space but it took Yellen’s speech to reverse GLD strength. Data dependency nature of the Fed means we should keep a lookout for 03 April 2015 labor market report and GLD weakness should continue until then. We have seen persistent strength on the price of gold recently ever since the dovish FOMC minutes were released on 18 March 2015 . There were certain confusion over the intent of the FOMC and the speeches of various FOMC members such as Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and San Francisco Fed President John Williams hinted that the FOMC might be more dovish than expected. This is explained in depth in my article, Dove, Hawk, Centrist Reversal Of USD Strength In March 2015 . However, an important change for the price of gold and USD occurred when Fed Chair Janet Yellen appeared on the scene with her defining speech on economic growth, inflation and the labor market last Friday on 27 March 2015 . Before I note the change in the price of gold and USD on their respective charts, I would first go through the gist of Yellen's speech at the San Francisco Fed's event last Friday. Before I go into details of her speech, it should be noted that Yellen gave a relatively bullish speech as compared to previous speakers as noted above. Yellen has finally clarified her position as the FOMC hawk when she cheered on the recovery of the economy. She also noted the recovery of the labor market even as she acknowledged the weakness that exists. Yellen also notably directly countered Evans' assertion that there is no cost for delaying the rate liftoff and she noted that the Fed may overshoot both their mandates and would be encouraging reckless risk taking. Yellen also effectively neutered the argument that wage increases is a precondition for inflation and instead focused her attention to the ever improving labor market conditions. Another point of note is that Chair Yellen used to be the president of San Francisco Fed before her ascendance to Fed Vice Chair and then Fed Chair. Hence she is making a speech where she is likely to be most comfortable with a friendly audience. First let us look at Yellen's assessment of the economic recovery and link it with inflation. It is accepted theory that as the economy expands, there will be inflation as it push against the boundaries of its available resources. The Fed would look at future expected inflation and there are 2 primary tools for it to do so. It could look at the survey-based inflation expectations and the market-based inflation compensation. Currently, the former is stable while the latter is declining. Yellen is accepting the stable survey-based inflation expectations and interprets the latter as due to reducing risk premiums rather than lower inflation expectations. Yellen also put forward her view that the expected economic growth would result in stronger inflation in the medium term. She cited the strong labor market conditions and how the economic headwinds are diminishing. In particular, and despite the somewhat disappointing tone of the recent retail sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of consumer confidence." Yellen also noted that not all sectors of the economy are growing strongly and given the low interest rates environment, the economy should be booming if it is really in a strong state. Yellen also went on to repeat her stance that the current low inflation environment is transitory as low energy prices will pass. My opinion of her economic assessment is that despite pockets of weakness in the economy, Yellen continues to see overall strong economic growth for the United States. This is the first strand of her hawkish speech. Delinking Wage Inflation to Price Stability The second strand of her hawkish speech comes from how she delinks the question of wage inflation to that of the FOMC's 2% inflation target. While Yellen acknowledged that historical examples shows that wage inflation is linked to future inflation, Yellen also noted that wages has not kept up with productivity gains for the past 15 years. Hence Yellen is implying that the historical link between wage inflation (or lackof) and the 2% inflation target may actually be loosening. Yellen explained that this is due to factors beyond the Fed's control as seen in the quote below. With respect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick up to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at its maximum sustainable level. We could see nominal wage growth eventually running notably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace. But the outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected. For example, we cannot be sure about the future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that may also influence the pace of real wage growth over time. These factors, which are outside of the Federal Reserve's control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with productivity growth for at least the past 15 years. For such reasons, we can never be sure what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed's progress in achieving its inflation objective." If the above quote seem contradictory (which is a key feature of Fedspeak), then let me reinterpret in plain English. Yellen is basically saying that wage may or may not keep up with inflation and productivity gains. In other words, 2 years from now, it is entirely possible that the U.S. has seen 2% inflation while nominal wages would stay the same. This could be due to the factors as listed above outside of the Fed's influence. She is reminding the public that the Fed's mandate is price stability (or 2% inflation target) and not wage stability. To put in even more plainly, if wages are stagnating and prices are hitting the 2% inflation target, the Fed's work is done unless Congress changes its mandate. Hence future arguments about the lack of wage inflation would not be taken seriously. Price To Pay For Gradual Approach - Credibility and Financial Stability Yellen's last persuasive argument is that there is a price to pay for delaying the liftoff until it is clear that both the price stability and maximum employment targets are reached. This is in direct conflict with Evans' statement otherwise and we know who is the boss here and whose opinions count the most. Yellen repeated that we have to consider the time lag of monetary policy before its full impact comes into effect for the economy. Second, we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of monetary policy are felt only after long lags. This means that policymakers cannot wait until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy. I would not consider it prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the verge of reaching, our inflation objective." The risk is that the Fed would have to tighten policy abruptly when inflation re-emerges strongly in the future. This will be disruptive to the economy. Yellen went on to challenge the view that just because we don't have inflation now as the labor market tightens, we wouldn't see it in the future. Of course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks. Proceeding too slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the Committee's inflation objective over time, especially if it were to undermine the FOMC's inflation credibility. Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but tight labor markets generate marked upward pressure. If so, a decline in unemployment below its natural rate could cause inflation to quickly rise to an undesirably high level. Rapid increases in short-term interest rates to arrest such an unwelcome development could, in turn, have adverse effects on financial markets and the broader economy." Yellen also rise concern over the Fed's inflation fighting credibility to make the point that the Fed has to be forward looking. Hence, while inflation remains low now, she made the point that the Fed has to consider if and when it would spike higher sharply and pre-empt that from happening as evidence points towards it. For the Fed to correct the pressures of high inflation when it happens, it may already be too late. The other risk is that low interest rates environment will force investors to chase after risky investments, which they are not equipped to handle. This is a fresh lesson as seen in the previous run-up to the 2007 housing bubble as the investors hunt for yield. This would affect financial stability. Yellen made it clear that regulations are the first line of defense but monetary policy have to play its part too. Yellen also made it clear that she does not see any foreseeable danger to financial stability for now, so as to avoid market panic. The impact of Yellen's speech on both the USD and SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ) is clear as seen in the chart below. Yellen had managed to rebut the dovish message of Chicago Fed President Charles Evans even if she did not name him directly. Yellen managed to lift a clear worry of the market and she reminded them not to just look at the date of the first liftoff but to look at the entire tightening process. The fact that she is looking at the entire tightening process is also a welcome development for USD strength. In any case, we can see from the chart above that the USD reversed into strength on account of the bullish interview given by Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart on 25 March 2015 with The New York Times . The USD reversed into strength the next day as the market digested the new information but it was not enough to move the price of gold until Yellen spoke on 26 March 2015 as seen in the GLD chart below. Currently there is no major change in market expectations of inflation to influence the price of GLD. Hence the strength of the USD would weigh adversely on the price of GLD. There is a 1-day delay when the USD strength is transmitted to GLD weakness. It took the voice of Yellen to give the USD strength and drive the price of gold down as Lockhart's words were ignored by the gold market amid other dovish speeches. GLD reversed from strength into weakness on the very same day. Yellen should be seen as the final authoritative figure and if she is biased towards USD strength against the opinions, then we have to assume USD strength going forward and by extension GLD weakness. Before I end this article, I would like to highlight the fact that the Fed is data dependent and what it means to the market. Data dependent means that the Fed will adjust its policy based on new market data even if some data are taken lightly and other more seriously. An important information would be the labor data as published by Department of Labor Statistics for March 2015 on 03 April 2015 at GMT 12:30PM. A strong report would sway the FOMC towards Yellen's outlook. This will strengthen the USD and weaken GLD even if the Fed has ruled out any actions on its April 2015 meeting. The market is forward looking and would reassess the odds of a June 2015 liftoff and the Fed has forced the market to do it on a case-by-case basis as explained by Yellen below: Reflecting such data dependence, as well as some historically unusual policy considerations that I will discuss shortly, the average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years." Hence one can conclude until the labor data comes on Friday, we can expect further GLD weakness and USD strength. You can take this position either by short selling GLD directly or by shorting the XAU/USD forex pair. Both are highly liquid instruments and have minimal transaction costs to them. This means that you can capture the profit opportunity very efficiently.
