Grand Central: A Roadmap for 2015 and Other Takeaways on Fed June Meeting  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Merkel Maintains Tough Stance on Greece as Deadline Looms Norway Cuts Interest Rates, Says Further Reduction Likely After much buildup early in the year about the Federal Reserveâ€™s June policy meeting, the event has now come and gone with no action by the central bank. Short-term interest rates remain pinned near zero and the Fed continues to wait for more evidence of a pickup in inflation and sustained job gains before it is prepared to act. Still, the meeting and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s responses to questions in a press conference left investors and the public with plenty to consider. Here are some takeaways: An Elusive Roadmap for 2015: Two Fed officials see no rate increases this year, five see one interest rate increase, five see two rate increases and five see three rate increases, according to the Fedâ€™s rate projections. Throw out the projections of hawks who want three increases and doves who want none, and a split emerges at the center of the Fed between those who want two and those who want one. If the Fed does two, it seems likely they would come in September and December. If it does just one, it could go in September and then wait to see how the economy responds before acting again in 2016, or it could wait until December. The flow of economic data will dictate which way this plays out. The New Gradualism Mantra: Ms. Yellen is trying to get markets to focus less on when the Fed will make its first interest rate move and more on the path of interest rate increases once the Fed starts raising. Her message is that increases will be gradual and shallow. The commitment to a gradual path didnâ€™t show up in the Fedâ€™s formal policy statement, but Ms. Yellen said the public can effectively interpret the Fedâ€™s policy statement to be saying as much. â€œThe last paragraph of the Federal Open Market Committee statement says the committee currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate consistent levels, economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. That’s kind of a mouth full. It is a long sentence. But I think the spirit of that sentence is consistent with my use of the word gradual.” Believe it When they See It: One quote that got underlined in my notes during the press conference: “My colleagues and I would like to see more decisive evidence that a moderate pace of economic growth can be sustained.” The Fed has been burned many times in this expansion by growth forecasts that didn’t hold up. Ms. Yellen has little inclination to move until she sees strong evidence in the data that it can be justified. Yellenâ€™s One Hawkish Note: New York Fed President William Dudley said in the footnote of a recent speech that in retrospect the central bank should have raised interest rates more aggressively in the 2004-2006 rate cycle than it did. Ms. Yellen said he might be right. â€œConceivably I think with the benefit of hindsight it might have been better to raise rates more rapidly or more during the 2004 to 2006 cycle,â€? she said in response to a question. The lesson she took from that episode was that the Fed shouldnâ€™t, and wonâ€™t, get trapped in a mechanistic path of rate changes this time around as it did then, when it moved rates up in a steady and predictable path of 17 straight quarter percentage point increases. â€˜Leave Us Alone:â€™ Given a chance in the question-and-answer session to stake out some common ground with lawmakers about efforts to reform the Fed in the wake of the financial crisis, Ms. Yellen showed no evidence that she sees much common ground. Lawmakers have tried a number of different approaches including congressional audits of Fed decisions, a blue ribbon panel to evaluate the Fedâ€™s structure, a requirement that it follow a specific monetary policy rule. Ms. Yellen didnâ€™t sound in favor of much of anything. â€œI would ask, what exactly is the problem?â€? Ms. Yellen said. â€œI’m not certain what the problem is that needs to be addressed.â€? Fed Sees Gradual Rate Hike; Leaves Rate Unchanged. The Federal Reserve signaled it was moving toward interest-rate increases later this year now that signs of a slowdown in economic activity are waning, but the path of rate increases could be less steep than officials anticipated. For now, the Fed said a benchmark interest rate near zero â€œremains appropriate.â€? Fed Forecasts Cut. FedÂ officials cut their estimates of 2015 growth in new forecasts that also continued to show most officials favoring one to two interest rate increases this year . The projections show a strong majority of Fed officials continue to believe theyâ€™ll lift interest rates this year from the near zero levels theyâ€™ve occupied since the end of 2008. Fifteen of 17 officials hold that view, while two expect to hold off on rate increases until next year. That matches what officials said inÂ projections released in March. Yellen: Strong Dollar Will Be a Drag on U.S. Economy . House Republicans Press Yellen Over Leak Probe. House Republican leaders investigating the Fed have rejectedÂ Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s reason for not turning over information requested under a subpoena. In a letterÂ to Ms.Â YellenÂ and Fed Inspector General Mark Bialek on Wednesday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) and Rep.Â Sean Duffy(R., Wis.), who heads the committeeâ€™s oversight panel, said the â€œFedâ€™s refusal to comply with the committeeâ€™s subpoena constitutes the willful obstruction of this committeeâ€™s lawful investigation.â€? U.S. Restricts Six Banks Over Mortgage Problems. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Wednesday the six banks had not met all the requirements of consent orders issued in 2011 related to foreclosure-processing mistakes. The 2011 orders triggered a controversial probe into major U.S. banksâ€™ foreclosure files to determine how many borrowers should be compensated and were amended in 2013 when the OCC and the Federal Reserve decided to halt the review before it was finished. The regulators ultimately reached a settlement with 15 banks related to foreclosure problems. Merkel Maintains Tough Stance on Greece as Deadline Looms.Â German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled an uncompromising position as negotiations on Greeceâ€™s international bailout entered their final stretch on Thursday, even as warnings grow of the potential impact of a Greek default and exit from the euro. Greek Exit Would Not Harm European Banking System. European banks and insurers have limited direct exposure to Greece and its banks:Â most were shed during the 2012 crisis. Lending by foreign banks to Greek banks fell to just â‚¬13 billion ($14.6 billion) by April this yearâ€”tiny in the context of European bank assets. Concern is focused instead on the â‚¬83 billion (and growing) emergency funding that Greek banks have taken toÂ cover fleeing deposits and interbank loans . It would be disastrous for Greece but analysis by experts suggests the direct impact on the ECB and European governments would be smaller than some fear. ECB Allots â‚¬73.8 Billion to Banks in Latest Round of Four-Year Loans. Â The European Central Bank said Thursday that 128 eurozone banks borrowed â‚¬73.8 billion ($83.13 billion) of cheap, central bank credit under a four-year lending program that was created last year, an indication that brighter prospects for Europeâ€™s economy are boosting loan demand . Europeâ€™s Economic Growth Could Weigh On Stocks, Says ECB. Despite higher European equity prices since the start of the year, stock prices may be constrained by concerns over the European economyâ€™s growth potential , the European Central Bank said in its economic bulletin released Thursday. Norway Cuts Interest Rates, Says Further Reduction Likely. Norwayâ€™s central bank cut interest rates on Thursday, aiming to keep inflation close to a 2.5% target as the economy loses momentum. Â Norges Bankâ€™s governor said in a statement that the overall picture was slightly weaker than expected, adding the economic outlook had deteriorated. Oystein Olsen said the key policy rate may be reduced further later in the year. Swiss Central Bank Leaves Key Rates Unchanged.Â Switzerlandâ€™s central bank maintained a key deposit rate at -0.75% and reiterated it was prepared to take further measures to blunt the strength of the Swiss franc, which it said remains â€œsignificantlyâ€? over-valued . TheÂ central bank said the country’s big banks had continued to make improvements in their capital positions, but urged the lenders to not to lose momentum in their progress IMF: Cut Income Inequality. International Monetary FundÂ chiefÂ Christine LagardeÂ called on officials around the world to make changes to tax regimes, clamp down on corruption and take other steps to reduce income inequality, which she blamed for weighing on global growth . The IMFâ€™s managing director blamed the oversized role of the financial sector in major economies as well as unequal access to technology and education, and low social mobility around the world for leading to an â€œeconomy of exclusion,â€? citing a term used byÂ Pope FrancisÂ in prepared remarks for a speech in Brussels. Shrink Financial System to Boost Growth, Says OECD. Â Shrinking the financial system would boost growth and reduce income inequality in most developed economies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday. Overtime Pay Proposal Sets White House, Businesses at Odds. The Obama administration is facing off with business groups and some economists over the wisdom of a new rule, set to come out as early as this month, that is expected to make millions more Americans eligible for overtime pay. Debate over the rule echoes the fight over lifting the federal minimum wage, with Democrats citing the need to update worker protections and Republicans warning of another impediment to job growth . How Immigration Affects Trade in Services. Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano, Giovanni Peri and Greg C. Wright use U.K. data to study the effect of immigration on international trade in services and find that more immigration leads to greater service exports. â€œSince trade in services requires the overcoming of cultural and institutional barriers to a much greater extent than trade in goods, the role of immigrants in facilitating services trade may be critical and quantitatively more relevant than in facilitating goods trade. At the same time, we find that for services with important cultural content, immigrants may reduce the offshoring of those services, an important nuance in the immigration-trade link,â€? they conclude. Memo to Fed: Allow the Economy to Overheat. Â Writing in the Journal, Greg Ip says the Fed should keep rates low and allow the economy to run a little hotter than usual. “An overheating economy right now would be welcome: It would help nudge inflation back to more normal levels, restore some of the long-term growth potential lost since the financial crisis, and boost ordinary workers’ wages more effectively than remedies such as big increase in the minimum wage, which can reduce employment for the low-skilled,2 he writes. “While low rates may be fueling speculation in financial markets, that threat doesn’t yet outweigh the many benefits.” How to Fix the Greek Crisis. At Bruegel, Guntram B. Wolff outlines the three principles necessary for Greece to strike a deal with its creditors. â€œA sensible deal would consist of:Â lower primary surplus targets, perhaps as little as 0.75% this year and 1.25% next year and a medium term primary surplus of 2.5%; a delay in the debt repayment schedule to the IMF, but no further additional debt relief,â€? and â€œimplementing concrete steps towards a further institutional transformation of Greece that is suitable in re-establishing trust, confidence and above all market access.â€? A Greek Deal Based on IMF Research. Writing on VoxEU,Â  Ashoka Mody offers a different menu based on three pieces of research by staff at the International Monetary Fund, where he once worked.Â Â ”A suggested programme for Greece includes debt relief (debt equal to 50% of GDP and payable over 40 years), scaling down the banking system, and setting a flat 0.5% of GDP primary surplus over the next three years,” he writes. A Greek Deal is Still Possible. â€œThe apocalypse can still be averted,â€? writes Yannis Palailogo s in the Journal. â€œDespite all the bluster of recent days, a deal is not as hard to envision as many seem to think. Some reforms demanded by creditors, such as dramatically reducing eligibility for early retirement and eliminating state support for supplementary pensions, which in many cases translates into a taxpayer subsidy to some of the more privileged groups of the insured, shouldnâ€™t be controversial for a left-wing government,â€? he writes. â€œIn exchange for such pension reforms, creditors could partly accept Athensâ€™s revenue projections for 2015, on the condition that if Greece fails to meet them, more measures will be required in 2016.â€? Jobs and Wages Up Across U.S. Counties in 2014. More than 94% of large U.S. counties reported employment gains through December compared with a year earlier, and 98% saw average weekly wages increase . Pay growth in the eurozone accelerated sharply in the first three months of 2015, aiding the currency areaâ€™s economic recovery and its emergence from a period of falling consumer prices .
