Fedâ€™s Fischer Sees Gradual Rate Increase - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Tuesday that Fed policy makers are on track to raise interest rates â€œwhen we have seen further improvementâ€? in the labor market and inflation. Mr. Fischer said the U.S. labor market has been slowly improving but still has a way to go before the economy reaches full employment. And, while inflation remains below the Fedâ€™s 2% target, officials believe it will rise to that level â€œwithin about two years,â€? he said. Mr. Fischer, who was born in present-day Zambia and educated in Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, spoke to a group of African central bankers during a conference at the University of Oxford in the U.K. He raised concerns about the strong U.S. dollar, saying it was holding inflation down, but said he expected that pressure to abate as the labor market tightens and as energy prices stabilize. While some Fed officials have said they expect rates to rise in September, Mr. Fischer, in prepared remarks, didn’t specify a month, saying only â€œit will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and are reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2% over the medium term.â€? The central bank stated after its meeting earlier this month that it plans to raise rates at some point this year. Fed officials have kept rates near zero for almost seven years. Once rates do start to move, Mr. Fischer said, the Fed will likely raise them â€œonly gradually.â€? â€œWe expect that the target federal funds rate will remain for some time below levels viewed as normal in the longer run,â€? he said. Mr. Fischer also said he wasn’t concerned that a long period of low rates had caused investors to take on dangerous levels of risk. â€œThe evidence does not indicate that such vulnerabilities pose a significant threat, but we are carefully monitoring developments in this area,â€? he said. Fed officials are aware of â€œpossible spilloversâ€? that a rate increase might bring to emerging markets and are trying to communicate â€œclearly and transparently,â€? Mr. Fischer said. â€œStill, one feature of the era after the first increase of the federal funds rate will, in all likelihood, be higher U.S. and global interest rates compared with their extraordinary low levels of recent years,â€? he said. â€œThe increase in global interest rates could cause investors to adjust their portfolios, triggering capital outflows from emerging market and developing economies.â€?
