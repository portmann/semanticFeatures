Preparing For The Fed Meeting: Absolutely Everything You Need To Know - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha The Fed will complete its meeting on monetary policy today and will release a monetary policy statement shortly after. That statement will provide valuable clues to how the Fed plans on proceeding in the future, which means it will be market moving. In this article, I explain all you need to know to prepare. Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will finish its monthly monetary policy meeting and release its interest rate decision. While it is widely believed that the Fed will hold the Federal Funds interest rate at its current position, the "Monetary Policy Statement," a speech given by Chairwoman Janet Yellen on the proceedings of the meeting, will be a huge clue to markets for how the Fed will proceed with monetary policy into the future. For instance, many investors are anxious to know whether or not the May or June Fed meeting will be a "live meeting;" a meeting in which the Fed Funds rate may be changed. There has not been a live meeting since December of 2015, when the Fed increased the Fed Funds rate by 0.25%. Soon after the raise, economic reports began to show that the U.S. economy was not firming as quickly as had previously been expected. The U.S. has been stalling on global headwinds - especially from a slowdown in Chinese growth. Over the last months, though, things have begun to improve. While China is still slowing, it appears that the emerging economy won't see growth slow as steeply as had been expected at the beginning of the year. Worldwide financial markets collapsed in January, but have now basically returned to the black year-to-date (YTD). Economic research has shown that markets, and by extension the overall economy, are adversely affected by secrecy in monetary policy. For example, if lenders are unsure of how the Fed is going to set monetary policy at any meeting, they may be less willing to lend around the time of the meeting. The Fed has certainly taken this to heart. Between meetings, Fed members are constantly giving hints to the markets about how they believe monetary policy should proceed at future meetings. This allows markets to ascertain the likely outcome of meetings weeks before they even begin. Which is why nobody believes the Fed will change the Fed Funds rate today; the Fed has made it clear that no change should be expected. The real question is whether or not the Fed could move in the next few months. The Fed is, almost always but certainly now, split between two viewpoints. The first group (known as the "doves") believes that we should be cautious about raising interest rates too quickly, which could lead to a recession. With interest rates already at near zero, the Fed could quickly run out of tools to fight a downturn. On the other side, the "hawks" believe that we are setting ourselves up for hyperinflation by continuing to allow the money supply to mushroom, and we need to raise interest rates to quell this threat. The Fed has been continuing to emphasize that it will be "data dependent" in its monetary policy decisions; only raising rates when the data shows that it should. While I'd like to know at what point they weren't data dependent, this statement in essence ties the Fed to economic data releases. Each time an economic data point is released that signals the economy may be heading towards inflation, the Fed becomes more likely to raise rates and vice versa. Every financial market is affected by monetary policy, so how Janet Yellen describes future monetary policy in her statement is likely to have a significant effect on all markets. Not all will necessarily behave in the same way, though. The U.S. stock market (NYSEARCA: SPY ) is likely to be especially vulnerable to signs of an imminent interest rate hike from Yellen's speech. Many public companies depend on loans for financing their day-to-day operations, and any sign that the cost of borrowing may rise will be a definite negative for stocks. Further, many blamed the severe stock market tumble in January on the December rate hike, so a rate hike will make many investors nervous - leading to selling. The Treasury market should have a very straight forward response to Yellen's statement. If interest rates are expected to rise sooner rather than later, all treasuries that will still be around when interest rates rise will see a rise in yield - which leads to a fall in price. The opposite would of course happen if Yellen makes it clear that interest rates will not be risen as quickly as was thought. The U.S. dollar reacts similarly to Treasury yields when interest rates change. If interest rates are expected to rise, the dollar should rise and vice versa. For instance, an especially "hawkish" Fed should cause USD/XXX pairs to rise, XXX/USD pairs to decline, and DXY to rise. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
