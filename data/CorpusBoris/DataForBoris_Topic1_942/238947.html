5 Things to Watch in the Fedâ€™s October Meeting Minutes - WSJ Federal ReserveÂ officials emerged from their Oct. 27-28 policy meeting armed with a clear message: They mightÂ  raise short-term interest rates in mid-December . Itâ€™s not a done deal and some policy makers have sounded cautious notes in recent weeks, but investors and economicÂ  forecasters now expect the Fed will lift off next month Â after holding rates near zero for seven years. The minutes of their pre-Halloween gathering, due out Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST, will shed light on why officials decided to emphatically put the Dec. 15-16 meeting in play in spite of lingering worries about global growth and still-sluggish inflation. Top Fed officials have again and again said they expect to raise rates this year. But when they walked into their meeting last month, financial markets thought it was more likely than not they would keep rates near zero into 2016. That changed after they released a statement saying the central bank would consider raising rates â€œat its next meetingâ€? in December. The minutes may explain why officials decided to send such an explicit signal, and to what extent the decision reflected unease with many investorsâ€™ expectation that a move wasnâ€™t imminent. The Fed in its mid-September policy statement warned that â€œrecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.â€? That sentence disappeared from the late October statement , though it did note officials would be â€œmonitoring global economic and financial developments.â€? The minutes could offer insight into why officials downplayed worries about the dollarâ€™s rise and weakness overseas that had seemed to loom so large just weeks earlier. Â Just ahead of the Fedâ€™s October meeting, the European Central Bank signaled it might rev up its stimulus efforts Â and the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China cut interest rates , moves that could have bolstered the international outlook. Since then, however, t he dollar has strengthened and Japan has slipped into another technical recession as officials there prepare a fiscal stimulus program. Fed officials say they want to be â€œreasonably confidentâ€? that long-sluggish U.S. inflation will rise back to 2% before they begin raising rates. As low oil prices and the strong dollar continue to weigh on overall price growth, some policy makers have sounded more confident than others, a dynamic that may show up in the minutes. â€œWeâ€™re not that far from the 2% targetâ€”when the price of oil stops falling, and when the dollar stops appreciating,â€? Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said earlier this month , while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans last week warned that â€œ the outlook for inflation remains too low .â€? The minutes may reveal if worries about financial stability and potential asset bubbles are starting to play a more prominent role in the Fedâ€™s discussions. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in late September he was â€œstarting to see signs of imbalances emerge in the form of high asset prices , especially in real estate, and that trips the alert system.â€? Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren last week flagged evidence of â€œsearch-for-yieldâ€? behavior in commercial real estate . â€œWhen the number of cranes observed on a short walk in a city such as Boston reaches double digits, as is the case today, it is worth reflecting on the sustainability of such growth,â€? he said. The only formal dissent last month came from Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who wanted to raise rates immediately . But the move to signal a possible December rate increase may not have been welcomed by officials who have argued for a cautious approach including Mr. Evans and Fed governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo . The minutes will offer a snapshot of the Fedâ€™s internal debate over the timing of liftoff and could reveal the extent of disagreement, though the document wonâ€™t identify individual officials by name. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
