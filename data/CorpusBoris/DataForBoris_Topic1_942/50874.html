Grand Central: Two Views Inside Fed on U.S. Productivity Slowdown  - Real Time Economics - WSJ The U.S. Labor Department will report another batch of dismal productivity numbers Wednesday. Itâ€™s already in the numbers â€“ near zero growth in economic output and expanding payrolls in the first quarter meant more workers producing few more goods and services. Productivity contracted at a 2.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter and appears to have done something like that again in the first. In the past quarter century, back-to-back productivity contractions have only happened twice before â€“ once in 2006 and once in 1993. Productivity growth defines how fast an economy can grow without causing inflation, and thus matters a great deal to central banks. By now it is clear that U.S. productivity growth has slowed and an important debate is taking place inside the Fed about exactly when that happened. John Fernald, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in research has argued that the slowdown started before the financial crisis Â and was associated with the end of the information-technology driven boom of the 1990s. David Wilcox, director of the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s research and statistics division, argued with colleagues in a 2013 paper Â that the slowdown was associated with the 2007-2009 recession, and a drop-off in new business formation and in productivity-enhancing investment by firms. The Wilcox story is the more hopeful one. If the productivity slowdown is associated with the recession, then presumably its effects will eventually wear-off and growth can get back on a faster path without causing inflation. The Fernald story is troubling. If productivity was really in a downtrend before the crisis, then Americans might be stuck with an economy prone to serial growth disappointments for the foreseeable future. The two stories call for different monetary policy settings. The Wilcox story calls for easy money to fuel recovery, growth and investment and plays down the risk of inflation. In the Fernald version, the economy might be getting closer to full employment and in need of higher interest rates to forestall inflation. Mr. Wilcox is Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s research director now. Mr. Fernald worked for her when she was president of the San Francisco Fed. Ms. Yellen devours research. Thereâ€™s no doubt sheâ€™s paying careful attention to this debate. Her hopes are likely with Mr. Wilcox, and her fears with Mr. Fernald. Yellen Meetings With Financial Firm Come Under Scrutiny.Â Congressional efforts to press the Federal Reserve for more details about a possible leak have suddenly focused attention on Chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s contacts with financial firms. Ms. Yellen met in 2011 and 2012 with a representative of Medley Global Advisors, the financial consultancy involved in several investigations into its publication of sensitive details of internal Fed policy deliberations. The Fedâ€™s communications policy doesnâ€™t ban contact with financial firms. Some observers say, however, such meetings could appear to give firms a prestige advantage. Kocherlakota: First-Quarter Economic Softness Is â€˜Matter for Concern.â€™ Soft economic data in the first three months of 2015 should give Federal Reserve officials pause when it comes to raising interest rates, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said Tuesday. Unhappiness With Fed May Help Regulatory Relief Bill. Unhappiness with the Fed may be the ingredient needed to bring bipartisan support to a broader regulatory relief bill. Sen. David Vitter (R., La.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) are working on legislation that would place further constraints on the Fedâ€™s emergency lending powers and are discussing how to get their ideas included in a legislative package being readied by Sen. Richard Shelby (R, Ala.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. ECBâ€™s Jazbec Says Too Early to Think About Tapering QE. â€œItâ€™s clear our policies are working,â€? said Bostjan Jazbec, a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council. â€œThere is a revival of inflation.â€? But Mr. Jazbec said it is much too soon to begin to discuss the timing of a reduction or reversal of those stimulus measures. BOC Eyes Changes to Market Operations, Emergency Lending. Canadaâ€™s central bank is proposing changes to how it manages financial-market operations and deploys emergency lending as it seeks to minimize risk and protect taxpayers. Change is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the countryâ€™s financial system in normal times and to prepare for another shock that could freeze credit availability, as occurred during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said. Stronger U.S. Labor Market Helps Mexicans Send More Money Home. No surprise, most of the money Mexicans send home from abroad comes from the north of the border. Of the $5.73 billion transferred home to Mexico in the first quarter, $5.6 billion was from the U.S., according to a new breakdown from the Bank of Mexico. Global Inflation Edges up in March. The annual rate of inflation across the Group of 20 largest economies increased for the second straight month in March, although it was unchanged at a low level in developed economies. Poland’s Central Bank Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged.Â The National Bank of Poland left its interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, in line with expectations and its earlier guidance. The central bank in March cut its main rate to 1.5%, the lowest on record, and said it was unlikely it would return to more easing any time soon–Dow Jones Newswires. Australia Seeks Cure for Its Mining Hangover. A series of rate cuts in the past three years have failed to achieve the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s goal of fostering manufacturing and other businesses that lost out during the era of high commodity prices. Weighed down by high costs, weak consumer demand and other worries, businesses are reluctant to invest. Thatâ€™s left many here wondering what will drive Australiaâ€™s economy now.Â  -9:15 a.m. EDT: Fedâ€™s Yellen speaks on â€œFinance and Societyâ€? in Washington -1:15 p.m. EDT: Kansas City Fedâ€™s George speaks on a panel about â€œCredit Markets: Booms, Busts and Distortionsâ€? in Washington -1:30 p.m. EDT: Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy in Baton Rouge, La.

The adoption of an inflation target leads to stronger economic growth in advanced economies, but â€œwe find that developing economies do not benefit from similar growth increases following inflation targeting adoption, at least not in the first three years,â€? Galina Hale and Alexj Philippov wrote in a San Francisco Fed Economic Letter . â€œIt is likely that these economies have to go through substantially more tightening to achieve their inflation targets than advanced economies, perhaps due to higher inflation expectations.â€? The Effect of Shocks to College Revenues on For-Profit Enrollment: Spillover from the Public Sector. A 10% reduction in public funding for colleges and universities causes tuition to rise by 1% to 2% and reduces faculty resources, “creating substantial bottlenecks for prospective students on both price and quality,” Sarena F. Goodman and Alice M. Henriques wrote in a Federal Reserve staff working paper . That causes students to instead enroll at for-profit colleges: For every 1% increase in public flagship university tuition caused by funding cuts, attendance at for-profit colleges increases by 1.5%. Additional Monetary Easing for China? China’s central bank “should refrain from making it too easy for local governments and leveraged corporations to avoid being confronted with the need to restructure and, therefore, with the need to reform,” Alicia GarcÃ­a-Herrero writes for Bruegel. “Flooded with liquidity, neither [state-owned enterprises] nor local governments will feel the pinch, eliminating market forces. If this concern is generally true, it is even more so for doubtful projects â€“ which is what a potential QE in China would end up supporting. All in all, too much easing from the [People's Bank of China] â€“ let alone full-fledged quantitative easing – can only foster financial fragilities.â€? Are Europeâ€™s GDP Forecasters Still Too Optimistic? “The eurozone economyâ€™s looking up, according to the European Commissionâ€™s forecasters,” Alen Mattich writes for the Journal. “Problem is, theyâ€™ve consistently been too optimistic about both growth and inflation during the past few years.” -A giant widening in the U.S. trade gap, driven by a surge in imports, could signal the nationâ€™s economy contracted in the first quarter . -The Atlanta Fedâ€™s GDPNow model estimated U.S. gross domestic product growth for the second quarter at a 0.8% seasonally adjusted annual rate following Tuesdayâ€™s trade data. - Economic growth in the eurozone eased less sharply than first estimated in April, as pickups in Spain and Italy partly offset slowdowns in Germany and France, according to surveys of purchasing managers. -Romania’s central bank surprised investors by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 1.75% from 2% Wednesday.
