India’s Central Bank Chief Okay With Fed Move Toward Higher Rates  - Real Time Economics - WSJ WASHINGTON–India’s central bank chief signaled Thursday he’s at peace with Federal Reserve rate increases when they arrive, despite past misgivings. “I don’t think we expect the Fed to remain on hold forever,” Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said as part of a panel discussion at the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings in Washington. “At some point the Fed has to decide it’s appropriate and start moving. We have to adjust to that,” he said. For the global economy, “we’ve dug this hole. When we climb out of it has certain effects” and central bankers need to be mindful of that, he said. Mr. Rajan has been critical in the past of Fed policies that caused financial havoc overseas by fueling large capital flows in and out of emerging-markets. He has called on Fed officials to think more about how their moves affect other countries around the world. Fed officials have countered that while they are mindful of the effect of their policies on the global stage, they nevertheless have to act with U.S. domestic concerns at the fore. They also regularly noted other nations need to manage their own economies according to their needs. Mr. Rajan made his comments as many Fed officials say they would like to start raising short-term U.S. interest rates from near zero this year, but are unsure about the timing of the first increase in light of recent weak economic data . His remarks came as part of a discussion about the outlook for Asian economies. He spoke with Harvard University’s Lawrence Summers , in a discussion moderated by Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Mr. Rajan also said Â his economy and others are facing notable challenges to their growth models given slowing economic activity in much of the world. That calls into question the durability of basing strong levels of growth on the ability to export. Mr. Rajan says India must increasingly look to drive its growth based on domestic demand, and he said strong investment in his nation’s infrastructure is one of the most important things his country can do. Messrs. Rajan and Summers both weighed what they thought could drive strong levels of emerging market growth into the future, amid rising problems with China’s economy. Mr. Summers reiterated his views that very strong levels of growth in the future are far from assured, as he emphasized the critical importance of technology, which he said could drive the next wave of strong growth. Mr. Summers zeroed in on the potential benefits of the proliferation of smart phones. The distribution of the devices “is indicative of a degree of connectivity and the ability to achieve convergence the likes of which has never existed before,” he said. This may “lead to a domestic demand-led, very rapid growth of a kind we haven’t seen historically,” Mr. Summers said.
