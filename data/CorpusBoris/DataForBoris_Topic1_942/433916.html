Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday decided to hold the central bank’s benchmark interest rate steady . The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee Â was no surprise, but a statement accompanying that determinationÂ doesÂ help shed new light what the Fed is thinking about the economy and theÂ for rates over the coming months. Here are some early reactions to Wednesday’s news. â€œThe Fed doesn’t seem overly concerned about the recent labor market data. There is no change in their 2016 unemployment forecast and 2016 GDP growth has only been shaved down marginally. It’s clearly premature to conclude firmly that the weakness in GDP in [the first quarter] has been reversed. So the hurdle for a June rate rise set out in the last minutes had not been cleared. But with the Fed’s near term inflation forecasts pushed up a little we still see them hiking in September and December.â€? â€” Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings “We believe the hurdle for a July hike has moved higher and the statement confirms our belief that the committee will feel most comfortable once it has seen several months of solid labor market data, given the extended period of slowing so far this year. We note that one FOMC member moved to no additional hikes over the forecast horizon. This is consistent with our view that a further softening in labor markets could signal a significant shift in Fed policy. This is not our baseline assumption, but we raise the point to say that Fed policy feels bi-modal as labor market data have historically sent a strong signal about expansions and contractions.” â€” Michael Gapen, Barclays “Overall, the statement and projections indicate that the slowing in job growth over the past few months, including the weak May jobs report, has the FOMC more cautious. The pace of fed-funds rate increases over the next few years now looks to be lower than it was a few months ago. But projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are largely the same.” â€” Stuart Hoffman, PNC Financial Services “A July rate hike is still possible, but it would require a meaningful rebound in payroll employment growth in June and a decisive U.K. vote to remain in the European Union. The most likely scenario is that the Fed waits until September to raise interest rates again, to a range of between 0.50% and 0.75%. By that time monthly payroll gains should have accelerated again and we expect to see increasing evidence of a much more rapid rebound in inflation that the Fed’s projections allow for. As a result, we still expect interest rates to rise much more aggressively over the next couple of years.” â€” Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics “The Fedâ€™s communication was more dovish than expected, despite virtually no change in the economic forecasts, implicitly acknowledging increased downside risks (despite no explicit statement on that balance). There was a larger than expected shift down in the 2016 interest rate dots and no hawkish dissent. Six participants now foresee only one hike this year (compared with one participant in March). This suggests a desire for considerably more evidence before the next move. The suite of Fed communication gives us further support to our forecast of no rate hikes this year.” â€” Economists at BNP Paribas “There are too many uncertainties to justify pulling the trigger at the June meeting. It is concerned about the employment picture even though economic growth has picked some steam. The FOMC wants to make sure that the surprisingly weak payroll number for April is a temporary phenomenon and not a harbinger of a weaker economy to come.” â€”Â Sung Won Sohn, California State University Channel Islands “Fed officials expect/hope to be tightening again this year, but some officials have scaled down their tightening projections. Nor did they say much to downplay the weakening in the payrolls data. In any event, they do not sound like they are in a rush, although they are not sending much of a specific signal one way or other. The focus now turns to [Chairwoman Janet Yellen's] press briefing. She will undoubtedly once again note that ‘monetary policy is not on a preset course.’ ” â€”Â Jim O’Sullivan, High Frequency Economics “Policymakers are now projecting that the economy will run beyond full employment for the next 2 Â½ years and the inflation rate will never get above 2%. Thatâ€™s either a very bearish assessment of the economic state affairs in the U.S. or itâ€™s a forecast that will not hold together over time. Once again the Fed has erased/revised/ignored the guideposts that they have offered over the past several months and years. For now, one should expect monetary policy to remain on the easier side and it is unclear how the FOMC will ever be able to guide the market to expect an official rate hike since they have a pattern of never following through on their words or guideposts.” â€”Â Joe Carson, AllianceBernstein “The Fed has consistently noted that its policy is being driven by data, and with unemployment at 4.7% and core CPI at 2.1%, the lack of a rate hike implies that the Fed has significant underlying concerns. Despite Brexit concerns, global growth concerns, and financial market volatility, there was no mention of any international factors or the global economy in the June FOMC statement. We believe the Fed will not raise rates this year, and that it is likely to cut rates or engage in other monetary stimulus in 2017.” â€”Â Jason Schenker, Prestige Economics “The dismal May jobs report and the angst over the possible Brexit keeps the Fed on the sidelines for now. The Fed pointed to diminishing job gains but noted the strengthening of consumer spending and that economic growth appears to have picked up since the first quarter. A majority at the Fed still expect two rate hikes in 2016, so this would suggest July as a possibility as long as economic data cooperates.â€? â€”Â Greg McBride, Bankrate.com “The Committee is heading in the direction of accepting what their staff economists told them at the last meeting, and probably said the same during this one — the risks to the economy is to the downside. With that, the FOMC now drifts further from tightening and has effectively eased by taking down forward guidance.” â€”Â Steve Blitz, M Science “Laughably, the Fed now expects no further decline in the unemployment rate this year, expecting it to remain at 4.7%, the May rate, and then dip by a mere one-tenth next year. For reference, note that the unemployment rate fell by 0.8 percentage point in the year to May. The Fed’s unemployment forecasting record has been abysmal in recent years, but their errors have been costless because inflation has been well-behaved. With wages now accelerating, though, underestimating the downward pressure on unemployment is likely to become much more consequential. We remain of the view that the Fed is now in real danger of falling behind the tightening of the labor market.” â€”Â Ian Shepherdson,Â Pantheon Macroeconomics Parsing the Fed: How the June Statement Changed from April 5 Things to Watch at the June Fed Meeting Â (June 14) Fed Decision Makers Wrestle With So-Called Natural Rate Â (June 12) Itâ€™s a Good Thing the Fed Has Missed its Chance to Raise Rates.
