Don't Expect A Rate Hike In June By The Fed | Seeking Alpha The Fed won’t raise interest rates in June. The Fed will likely let the threat of Brexit pass before moving to tighten financial conditions. U.S. economy just added 38,000 new jobs in May. The U.S. central bank managed to convince the markets that a June rate hike is on the table; however, I do not see such a move by the Fed. I would like to draw investors' attention to a few arguments why the Fed could be reluctant to raise interest rates next month. The FOMC members often talk a lot, but do little. Indeed, they have been talking about the normalization process and interest rate hikes for years, but they managed to raise interest rates just once in almost a decade. The reason behind this is that they prefer to influence the markets by forward guidance, not real actions, since such a strategy gives them more elasticity, and they do not believe that the costs of waiting are really significant. Fed's communications influence markets' expectations, which in turn affect the monetary conditions, shaping the U.S. central bank's ability to conduct a monetary policy. For example, in the recent minutes , the FOMC members explicitly noticed such a mechanism: "Financial market conditions improved further, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with investors appearing to respond to Federal Reserve communications that were viewed as more accommodative than anticipated (…) Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes moved up, on net, likely because of investors' views that monetary policy would be more accommodative than previously expected along with an improvement in risk sentiment (…) In the view of many FOMC participants, Federal Reserve communications after the March FOMC meeting led financial market participants to shift down their expectations concerning the likely path of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate." As one can see, the Fed admitted that the U.S. financial markets are sensitive to the Fed's forward guidance. This is how the catch works. The Fed claims to be data dependent, so it can hike interest rates only when data warrants it. But as the Fed sounds more hawkish, investors respond by shifting up their expectations of the future level of interest rates. In consequence, the market interest rates rise, assets are sold off, and monetary conditions tighten, preventing the Fed from hiking. Recent example of the above statement is that the central bank convinced investors that a rate hike is on the table for June; in consequence, the price of gold declined. The U.S. Federal Reserve, I believe, will be forced to delay a rate hike at its June meeting because of mounting concern over the economic fallout from Britain's vote on whether to leave the European Union. The geopolitical risk likely will push any rate increase until at least July, despite apparent consensus among Fed officials that a hike is warranted by stronger U.S. growth and tight labor markets. The dollar's recent stability is one reason the Fed has become more comfortable with raising rates, and officials may want to let the threat of Brexit pass before moving to tighten financial conditions. I am of the opinion that with the British referendum on the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union scheduled just one week after the FOMC meeting, the Fed will not risk an interest rate hike before such an important event. Friday's disappointing employment report for May, which showed that the U.S. economy added just 38,000 new jobs, adds further to my stance of no rate hike in June by the Fed.
