Don’t Sweat the Fed: A U.S. Rate Increase Won’t Unsettle Markets   - Real Time Economics - WSJ The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates by the end of the year. Even the first quarter growth wobble in the U.S. wonâ€™t prevent the seemingly inevitable. Asian central bankers and investors alike are looking ahead with trepidation. After all, the shock of the â€œtaper tantrumâ€? in 2013, which sent global interest rates soaring and rattled currencies across the region, still sits deep. The episode was triggered by the mere mention that the Fed might begin to reduce the size of its monthly asset purchaseâ€“or gently ease up on the accelerator. No wonder, then, that many are getting nervous at the prospect of the Fed actually hitting the brakes by raising its policy rate in due course. Indiaâ€™s central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, worries about potential damage to emerging markets. Fear not. The first rate increase by the Fed in over a decade wonâ€™t unsettle markets. Itâ€™s been a long time coming, and the expected rarely trips up investors. Sure, to the extent that the Fed is putting on the squeeze signals the end of an era of loose money, one that helped emerging markets, including Asiaâ€™s, to ride out the economic slump in the West. Rising leverage, in turn, exposes many developing countriesâ€“and more advanced ones as well, incidentallyâ€“to climbing interest rates. At the very least, expect growth to slow as debt becomes more costly to service. But, for a while, all this will remain hidden. It will take a series of increases, delivered relentlessly in the face of lingering global vulnerabilities, to put real financial pressure on emerging Asia. And this is what itâ€™s really all about when it comes to the Fed these days. Forget the first rate increase: the question is how quickly U.S. central bank officials will deliver subsequent ones. To be fair, the â€œFed dotsâ€? â€“ the forecasts by individual Federal Open Market Committee membersâ€“promise a fairly sharp ascent (with median expectation of the federal-funds rate just over 3% by the end of 2017). But that seems unlikely. The market, for one, expects a much more subdued path. Â For all the positive news about the U.S., there is still plenty that ails it, not least deleveraging households and tepid wage growth. And then there is the dollar: If the Fed really delivers the increases it has forecast amid a faltering global economy, a soaring greenback alone would risk undoing the progress on growth and inflation made over the past several years. What, then, is the risk? It isnâ€™t that the Fed raises rates later this year: That has been signaled well in advance. Rather, it is that something throws off the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan from their respective easing paths. That, of course, seems quite unlikely, too. But thatâ€™s precisely why a change of course by these central banks, even if incremental, could deliver the â€œfinancial shockâ€? that emerging-market investors and policy makers so dread. In short, the real risk is that ECB President Mario Draghi or BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda unexpectedly whisper â€œtaperâ€? into a microphone at some press conference. Now, that would be unexpected. And it is the unexpected, not the blatantly predictable, that markets tend to dislike.
