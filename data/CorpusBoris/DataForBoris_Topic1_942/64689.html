Ahead of April Fed Meeting, Big Banks Expected First Rate Rise in September - Real Time Economics - WSJ Wall Street’s biggest banks said before the Fed’s April meeting they expected the first interest rate increase in September. Wall Streetâ€™s biggest banks told the Federal Reserve recently they were projecting the central bank would start raising short-term interest rates in September. According to a survey Â  of so-called primary dealer banks conducted ahead of the Fedâ€™s April 28-29 policy meeting, the median expectation of these banks was for a September rate rise, the same as what they expected before the March meeting. The New York Fed polls the primary dealersâ€”banks that do business directly with the Fedâ€”ahead of each gathering of the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. The most recent survey was conducted at a time when central bank officials were providing less guidance than in previous months about the likely timing of rate rises. New York Fed President William Dudley explained in recent remarks that the Fed has said enough about its goals to allow market participants to â€œthink right alongâ€? with officials in attempting to divine the rate outlook. The dealer survey, released Thursday, comes a day after the Fed released minutes of the April meeting showing many officials thought it unlikely they would decide in June to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero. In a recent speech , Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart noted that market forecasts of a September rate rise looked â€œreasonableâ€? to him. Dealers were generally positive in their reviews of the Fedâ€™s communications efforts. They were asked to rate them on a scale of one (â€œineffectiveâ€?) to five (â€œvery effectiveâ€?), and most gave them a three or better. The dealers in April saw a 37% percent chance of a first Fed rate rise coming in September, and a 20% chance of it happening in December. The respondents said then there was a 13% chance of a June rate rise. Dealers also were very confident the Fed wonâ€™t have to cut the benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, back to near zero within two years after the first increase. Dealersâ€™ median expectation was for the fed funds rate to be 0.78% at the end of 2015, 1.13% at the end of 2016 and 1.50% at the close of 2017. If the banks are right, this would be a historically modest path of rate rises.
