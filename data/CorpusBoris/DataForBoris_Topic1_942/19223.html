Fed’s George Says Economy Could Do With Less Fed Stimulus - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORKâ€”Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said Tuesday that steady economic growth calls for the U.S. central bank to pull back on the level of stimulus it has been providing the economy. “You are required to look ahead” when you make interest-rate policy, Ms. George said. Given the improvements in growth and what appears to be relatively stable prices, it is entirely appropriate to talk about raising rates, which she described less as a process of trying to slow the economy down as ending an emergency policy stance. With a rate rise, “it’s more a process of pulling back on some of the accommodation. The sooner we do it the better,” Ms. George said. She added cutting back on stimulus will also reduce risk taking in the financial system and lower the prospect of bubbles that could damage the broader economy. Based on where the economy is now, metrics for setting rate policy suggest short-term rates â€œshould be higher-than-zero, but I donâ€™t think they pretend interest rates should be back to normal.â€? Ms. George’s comments came from an appearance in New York before an event held by the Council for Economic Education. Ms. George, who doesn’t currently hold a voting role on the monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, spoke amid a roiling debate among officials over the timing of interest rate increases. Rapid improvements in the job market and steady growth have been driving officials to talk about raising rates at some point this year. They agreed at their March meeting to open the door to raising their benchmark short-term rate from near zero as soon as their June policy meeting. A few, such as Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, would like to start lifting rates then, but others, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, say it is less clear when the Fed will find the evidence it needs to begin moving interest rates higher. Ms. George has been a relatively infrequent voice lately on monetary policy issues. In past remarks, she welcomed the Fed’s move toward interest rate increases. For some time, Ms. George had been worried ultra-easy Fed policy could fuel a surge in inflation and destabilize financial markets. That said, overly high inflation has been the least of the Fed’s problemsâ€”price rises have fallen short of the central bank’s 2% target for nearly three years. At the same time, expectations of future price rises have generally been stable, while market expectations have weakened. Ms. George rejected fears about inflation and said any weakness is due to transitory factors. “I’m not bothered by where we see inflation today,” she said. The official described prices as low and stable and said they would rise back to the 2% target over time. Ms. George also said the current 5.5% jobless rate is close to the full employment level that once breached, will stir higher price pressures. Ms. George observed it is unusual to see the Fed moving toward higher short-term rates at a time when other major central banks are pursuing stimulus. She said she wasnâ€™t particularly worried what effect that would have on the dollar, because her focus is on the domestic economy.
