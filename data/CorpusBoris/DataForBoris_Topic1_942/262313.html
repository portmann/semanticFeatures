5 Things to Watch on the Economic Calendar - WSJ The Federal Reserve’s last meeting of 2015 will dominate the week’s economic news. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal overwhelmingly expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006, underscoring the slow but steady progress of the U.S. economy. The Fed’s benchmark interest rate has held near zero since December 2008. On Wednesday, the central bank’sÂ policy-making committee is expected to boost the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. As soon as that’s confirmed, the focus will shift to hints on how far and how fast rates will rise. Alongside aÂ formal statement, Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s press conference will likely emphasizeÂ a gradual path. Fed officials will also release quarterly economic projections. Though they’re oftenÂ overshadowed by the mainÂ statement, the projections outline how fast officials think the economy will grow, how low they expect unemployment will get and when inflation will start to pick up. All that informs their assessments of the appropriate path for rates, codified in the somewhat mysterious “dot plot.” Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have lowered their projections for inflation and interest rates , and likely expect the Fed to do the same. One reason the Fed has been so slow to raise rates is low inflation . The central bank targets a 2% rate, a goal it’s consistently missed forÂ years. On Tuesday the Labor Department releases the consumer-price index. While it’s not the Fed’s preferred gauge, it will help showÂ how much–or little–prices have risen for rent, health care and an array of other goods and services. Low commodity prices and a strong dollar have combined to help keep inflation at bay, phenomena the Fed sees as temporary. The housing market has been a relatively strong component of the economy, with new construction this year poised rise to the highest level in eight years. On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders will gauge the mood among construction companies, and on Wednesday the Commerce Department releases housing starts for November. Outside the auto sector, U.S. factories have been struggling amid tepid overseas demand and a strong dollar, while oil and gas companies have been walloped by cheap crude. The Fed’s industrial production numbers on Wednesday will offer the latest details for the sectors. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
