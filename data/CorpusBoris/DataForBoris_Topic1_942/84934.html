BOJ Beat: Did Market Misunderstand Kurodaâ€™s Yen Remarks?  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Many people were caught off guard when the yen began soaring Â during trading in Asia on Wednesday, reacting to what some currency traders interpreted as a verbal intervention by Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda. Among them: central bankers themselves. Aggressive yen buying began the moment Mr. KurodaÂ  spoke of an obscure measure of the currencyâ€™s value during testimony before parliament. The yenâ€™s real-effective rate, as the measure is known, was very weak relative to other currencies and unlikely to fall further, Mr. Kuroda said. The following 15 minutes saw the yen climb sharply, sending the dollar down by roughly one and a half yen to Â¥123. Some BOJ officials were surprised, both by the abrupt move in the market and how the central bank chiefâ€™s words were interpreted, according to people close to the BOJ. Mr. Kuroda himself was puzzled, they said, by the dramatic market reaction his remarks had set off. Some analysts thought that Japan was finally beginning efforts to arrest the yenâ€™s decline , after two and a half years of a downturn, which had accelerated in recent weeks. Others speculated that Mr. Kuroda might avoid adding to the central bankâ€™s aggressive easing measures Â out of fears that it could cause the yenâ€™s further drop. But â€œthere was no such intention at allâ€? in Mr. Kurodaâ€™s comments, one of the people close to the central bank said. Rather, he said, the market â€œmisunderstoodâ€? him. Mr. Kurodaâ€™s remarks were neither about the regular exchange rate in the currency market nor about the yenâ€™s short-term prospects, this person explained. He stressed that the comments had â€œzeroâ€? implications for monetary policy. Mr. Kurodaâ€™s comments were off the cuff in nature, rather than a well-contemplated presentation, the people said. Indeed, the issue of the real exchange rate came out of the blue for the governor while responding to questions from Seiji Maehara, an opposition lawmaker who is known to disregard the widely followed parliamentary custom of submitting questions ahead of time, they said. A former top finance ministry official in charge of currency policy, Mr. Kuroda well understands the consequences of speaking rashly about foreign exchange rates. But at the same time, he is known to be a policy wonk and an avid reader of academic papers. Being thrown such a technical question, Mr. Kuroda was perhaps unable to resist the temptation to speak â€œlike an economist,â€? one of the people said, forgetting for a moment to act like a policy maker.
