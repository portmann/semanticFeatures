Former Fed Governor Warsh Laments Lack of True Fed Debate - Real Time Economics - WSJ PALO ALTO, Calif.–A former U.S. central bank governor opened the kimono on Federal Reserve decision making, saying little real debate happens at the bank’s monetary policy gatherings. Speaking Thursday, Kevin Warsh told a conference held by Stanford University’s Hoover Institution that, by and large, gatherings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee are stylized affairs that end up approving whatever the Fed chair wants. While they are portrayed to the public as being genuine deliberations fueled by open conversations, governors and regional bank presidents instead operate from de facto scripts, he said. Mr. Warsh said that, at most meetings he attended, officials came with “beautifully written statements” they read to their colleagues. After reading them, officials would say “‘Thank you, Mr. Chairman,’ put down their prose and look at their Blackberry.” “It did happen during the crisis an actual deliberation would break out,” Mr. Warsh said, but added that “I view that as somewhat anomalous.” Mr. Warsh said that at any given Fed meeting, the FOMC chair enters the room confident of the outcome, knowing he or she has the votes of all members of the seven-seat board of the governors, which are usually enough by themselves to carry any decision the leadership wants. Mr. Warsh said given the Fed’s true power structure, too much attention is paid to the 12 regional bank presidents, who are far and away the most frequently public speakers at the institution. “The Fed model is largely the model of the dominant chairman,” he said. “The media focus on President X was on television…That means less than what most people think.” “Markets seem to react as if…everyone’s vote matters” on the FOMC, Mr. Warsh said. But that’s not true, he said, claiming that these officials “are moving markets when they are not moving their colleagues.” Mr. Warsh was nominated to be a Fed governor by President George W. Bush, serving at the central bank from 2006 to 2011. Now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institute, Mr. Warsh’s profile at the central bank was defined by his key role working with then-Chairman Ben Bernanke in dealing with financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Warsh said the lack of debate inside the FOMC meeting means the discussion must take place somewhere else. And when that happens, it runs against the openness the Fed says it strives to achieve. Mr. Warsh’s characterization of highly stylized FOMC meetings was not entirely shared by San Francisco Fed President John Williams. While he did not dispute how Mr. Warsh characterized FOMC gatherings, he noted regional bank presidents have personal staffs with whom they spend extensive time ahead of FOMC meetings, hashing out their economic and interest-rate outlooks. Mr. Williams described lively proceedings. “There is no sense you can’t tell a president of a reserve bank he’s completely wrong” in these prep sessions, he said. That’s very different from the Washington-based board, where officials share an economic and policy team staffed by veterans who outlast the governors. “We have all those things you wished you were having” as a governor, Mr. Williams said, explaining that he comes into FOMC meetings with well-formed views about what’s happening and should be done. Former Philadelphia Fed leader Charles Plosser, who stepped down in March, took issue with Mr. Warsh’s view. “The give-and-take doesn’t always happen at one meeting,” he said. Instead, something one official says at a meeting might be answered at another meeting down the road, Mr. Plosser said.
