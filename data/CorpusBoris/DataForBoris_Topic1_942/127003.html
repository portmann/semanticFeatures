Making monetary policy like it’s 1973: James Saft July 23 (Reuters) – The last time unemployment claims were lose control of inflation: Arthur Burns. In Burns’ defense he faced outrageous political pressure from Richard Nixon, not to mention the inflation and economic nightmare of the Arab oil embargo, but still it would be hard to The market does not expect it, and doubtless will hate it, U.S. jobless claims fell by 26,000 last week to 255,000, the lowest such figure in 41-1/2 years. The less volatile four-week moving average fell 4,000 to 278,500 and is just 12,000 above the 15-year low recorded in May. The Conference Board also said its Leading Economic Index rose by 0.6 percent last month, Add to that strong growth in the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow real-time indicator, which is forecasting real economic growth in the second quarter of 2.4 percent. This compares to a readout of less than 1 percent as late as early June. Inflation, of course, remains contained. Core inflation is up 1.8 percent in the year to June.

Federal funds futures, which allow investors to bet on where rates will be in the future, are only pricing in a 17 percent chance of an increase at the September Two excellent and sharply diverging lines of reasoning support raising rates now, one practical and one precautionary. To be safe, Yellen and company need to get out in front of an economy which is doing quite respectably on all fronts save wages and inflation. From a practical standpoint, the Fed should not wait so long that they are overtaken not by inflation but by the next downturn. Remember, exceptionally low levels of jobless claims don’t just tell you about the current economy; they have also often preceded, by not too much, recessions.

Cyclical lows in this indicator occurred not long before, or just at the start, of the “Given the lags in monetary policy transmission, by the time wage and price pressures become obvious to financial market participants and policymakers, it will be too late: The Fed will be forced to play catch-up,” Deutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna wrote in a note to clients. what financial markets currently assume.” This last point, market expectations, is a difficult one for the Fed. It may be unwise, but the central bank has been extremely solicitous of financial market mood since the great recession. As well, longer-term inflation expectations in financial markets have been sinking, indicating that many Expect the Fed to spend the next weeks doing two things: gently hinting that the rate rise is coming, and also stressing that hikes will be gradual, and can be reversed if needed.
