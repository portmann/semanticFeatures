Grand Central: Disappearing Hawks and Other Reasons for Fed Forecast Shift  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Central bank watchers have spent much of the past few days taking measure of the Federal Reserveâ€™s shifting forecasts for the economy and interest rates. At their meeting last week, Fed officials reduced their estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of U.S. unemployment. They also reduced their estimates of where their benchmark interest rate â€“ the federal funds rate — would finish 2015, 2016 and 2017. Both developments pointed toward easier monetary policy than the Fed had been signaling before. Here are a few explanations that might have played into the shifts: DISAPPEARING HAWKS: Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser both retired and missed the March policy meeting. Both are policy hawks who leaned toward higher rates. Instead of submitting their own forecasts for the rate outlook, the forecasts were submitted by staff for the regional Fed banks. (The regional bankâ€™s first vice president traditionally assumes the role of president when there is a vacancy.) It is possible that the staff of the banks had more mainstream estimates than their departed bosses. When you look at the evolution of interest rate forecasts excluding hawks, the shift between December and March was less dramatic than it was with the hawks. The December median of Fed estimates for interest rates at year-end 2015 was 1.125%. It shifted down to 0.625% last week. Excluding two estimates from the hawkish end, the median shifted from 0.875% to 0.625%, less dramatic than with the hawks. DATA DRIVEN: The evolution of economic data forced the hand of many officials. When Fed officials gathered in December, the jobless rate was 5.8% while inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index, was 1.4% and 1.6% excluding food and energy. By the time they gathered last week, the jobless rate had dropped to 5.5% and inflation had dropped to 0.2% and 1.3% excluding food and energy. It was hard to justify an estimate that the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment was between 5.2% and 5.5% when it had reached that level and inflation was falling. In theory inflation should be stable near 2% when the jobless rate reaches the long-run level. As far back as January, Fed officials said they were looking at reducing this estimate of the long-run jobless rate. â€œWe may come up with a lower number than what Iâ€™ve been publicly talking about. Some of the people in the Summary of Economic Projections I think are going through that similar exercise,â€? Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren told The Wall Street Journal in mid-January. Â Other data moved the Fed toward these shifts â€“ including a strengthening dollar, which will hold down inflation, and the need to raise interest rates in the months ahead. CONSENSUS SEEKING: As the WSJ has reported before , Janet Yellen is running the Fed as a consensus builder. Before every policy meeting, she has hour-long conversations with every voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. It is logical that she and her colleagues would discuss the evolution of their forecasts in these conversations and might move in the same direction. That might help explain why interest rate forecasts were more concentrated in the latest forecast round. SQUARING UP WITH THE MARKET: As we reported earlier this month , Fed officials had been puzzled by a divergence between their own interest rate forecasts and expectations in futures markets, where investors saw a much lower path of rates. My colleague Greg Ip noted last week that in lowering their interest rate projections at last weekâ€™s policy meeting, Fed officials were bringing their forecasts more in line with market expectations.

Fedâ€™s Lockhart Sees Rate Increase in June, July or September. Atlanta Fed President said Friday he thinks there is a â€œhigh likelihoodâ€? of a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase at one of its meetings in June, July or September. â€œI think all three of those meetings are in play at the moment,â€? Mr. Lockhart told reporters in Athens, Ga. Fedâ€™s Evans: Persistent Low inflation Hurts Fed Credibility.

Fed is Pushing and Pulling on Rates Riddle. While investors and analysts expect the Fed will have no trouble pushing short-term rates in the bond market higher, some worry that the central bank will have a tougher time nudging longer-term rates up. That would complicate efforts to return the economy to a normal footing. New Regulations May Lower Chance of Another Crisis, Bernanke Says.Â Efforts to strengthen regulatory oversight of financial institutions in the U.S. following the 2008 debacle should make future crises less likely to occur , or less severe if they do, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Friday. ECB’s Noyer: Possible Side-Effects Mustn’t Paralyze Central Bank Action.Â European Central Bank policy maker Christian Noyer said Monday central banks mustn’t shy away from taking unconventional measures to fulfill their mandates because of fears about possible side effects. Â ”The possibility of unintended side effects should not paralyze decision making when required by the situation in order to fulfill their mandates,” Mr. Noyer said at a conference at the Bank of France in Paris — Dow Jones Newswires. Bundesbank Sees Continued German Growth.Â The German economy most likely continued to grow at a robust pace in the early part of this year following its strong expansion at the end of 2014, Germany’s central bank said Monday. Â The Deutsche Bundesbank also foresaw “a continuation of the vigorous economic ascent” in the second quarter of the year. The main drivers of this are foreign demand, private consumption and, to a lesser extent, construction, it said — Dow Jones Newswires.

Denmark Eases Pressure on Banks.Â Denmark’s central bank on Monday moved to manage the impact of its negative interest rate policy on banks by further increasing the amount of money that lenders can hold in its overnight current account. Nationalbanken said banks could now hold 173 billion Danish kroner ($25.12 billion) in excess liquidity in its current account compared with 145 billion kronor previously. The central bank raised the ceiling to 145 billion kroner from 37 billion kroner as recently as last Wednesday. Mexican Central Bank Leaves Door Open to Act Before or After Fed.

Untangling the Alphabet Soup of U.S. Inflation Gauges. The Fedâ€™s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, includes a broader range of expenditures than the more widely known consumer price index. The PCE is weighted according to data provided in business surveys, rather than the less reliable consumer surveys used to weight the CPI. And it uses a formula that adjusts for changes in consumer behavior that occur in the short term, something the standard CPI formula doesnâ€™t do . -ECBâ€™s Draghi speaks in Brussels at 1400 GMT -Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on â€œMonetary Policy Lessons and the Way Aheadâ€? in New York at 12:20 p.m. EDT, introduced by New York Fedâ€™s Dudley -San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on the outlook in Sydney, Australia at 1 p.m. local time -St. Louis Fedâ€™s Bullard speaks on a panel on the future of international monetary policy in London at 1005 GMT -ECBâ€™s Liikanen speaks in Helsinki at 0900 GMT -Chicago Fedâ€™s Evans speaks on monetary policy and the economy in London at 1030 GMT -ECBâ€™s Praet speaks in London at 1125 GMT -St. Louis Fedâ€™s Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy in Frankfurt at 0830 GMT -Atlanta Fedâ€™s Lockhart speaks on monetary policy and the economic outlook in Detroit at 9 a.m. EDT -Czech National Bank releases a policy statement -South African Reserve Bank releases a policy statement -BOEâ€™s Haldane speaks in the Netherlands at 0800 GMT -BOEâ€™s Carney speaks in Frankfurt at 0845 GMT -BOEâ€™s Broadbent speaks in London at 0915 GMT -Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on â€œThe Nonbank Financial Sector: Issues and Regulationâ€? in Frankfurt at 1030 GMT Are Longer-Term Inflation Expectations Stable? “Given no further unexpected declines in energy or food prices, or broader softness in consumer prices causing near-term forecasts to be marked down, the median of longer-term expectations is likely to remain fairly stable,” Brent Bundick and Craig S. Hakkio wrote in a Kansas City Fed paper . COMMENTARYÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It’s High Time to ‘Audit’ the Federal Reserve, writesÂ Alex J. Pollock in the Journal. “The calls in Washington to “audit” the Federal Reserve are not for a narrow, bean-counting review of the institution’s financial statements,” he writes. “The audit’s goal is more fundamental: to assure that the checks and balances in a democratic government also apply to central bankers. It means figuring out how our elected representatives can effectively oversee unelected monetary “experts.”" Fed Forecast: Cloudy With Â A Chance Of Slowdown. Â The Federal Reserve has cut its growth forecasts, but policy makers have yet to realise that low interest rates are part of the problem, rather than the solution, writes David Malpass in the Journal.Â Â ”There was no hint in Wednesday’s statement that the Fed recognizes its policies haven’t worked well,” he writes. “By itself, that mental block adds to the risk of slower growth and further delays in rate hikes.” ECB Faces Tough Task to Revive Securitization. “The European Central Bankâ€™s power to steer markets is undeniable â€” just look at the euro or eurozone-government-bond yields,” Richard Barley writes in the Journal’s Heard on the Street column. “But it is finding it trickier to get a grip on purchases of asset-backed securities. The ECBâ€™s efforts to revitalize Europeâ€™s securitization market are falling short of its rhetoric.” The Fed Needs Some Guidance. “Every central bank tries to steer expectations about monetary policy,” Clive Cook writes in a Bloomberg View column. “If businesses and consumers expect the Federal Reserve to let inflation surge out of control, the chances are fair that inflation will surge out of control. If they expect the Fed to keep inflation on track, inflation is more likely to stay on track. Shaping expectations is nine-tenths of the Fed’s job. That’s why economists are so preoccupied with “forward guidance” — the message Fed policy makers send about their intentions. The Fed’s thinking on this just changed, and in a good way. It ought to change a bit more.” -Chile’s central bank left its monetary policy rate unchanged at 3%, as expected . -Annual inflation in Canada held steady at 1% in February as food and clothing costs rose â€” something economists cautioned could happen as a result of a weaker Canadian dollar .
