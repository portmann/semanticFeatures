Fedâ€™s Mester Says Economy Can Easily Deal With Rate Rise Now - Real Time Economics - WSJ Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said Wednesday the economy â€œcan handleâ€? an increase in the fed-funds rate. The leader of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Wednesday the U.S. economy could easily deal with a rate rise right now, but she didnâ€™t call for short-term rates to be boosted at any specific time period. â€œThe economy can handle an increase in the fed funds rate,â€? Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said. â€œA small increase in interest rates from zero is not tight monetary policy, and with the economic progress weâ€™ve made and that I expect to continue, monetary policy can take a step back from the emergency measure of zero interest rates,â€? she explained in the text of speech to be presented before an audience in Columbus, Ohio. Ms. Mesterâ€™s appearance coincided with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen â€™s trip to Capitol Hill to provide the central bankâ€™s semiannual update on the economy and monetary policy. Ms. Yellen reaffirmed that if the economy plays out as she expects itâ€™s very likely the Fed will raise rates this year. But she declined to say when, explaining itâ€™s more appropriate in any case to think about the path of future rate rises, rather than when the first move up off currently near-zero rates will happen. Still, some Fed officials have pointed to September as a potential starting point for the Fedâ€™s rate rise campaign. Ms. Mester said in her remarks that itâ€™s reasonable Fed officials might have differing views about when to start raising short-term rates.Â  Ms. Mester isn’t currently a voting member of the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. In her remarks, Ms. Mester was upbeat about the economyâ€™s outlook, both in terms of expected job and inflation performance. But she also cast a cautious eye toward overseas events. She also said that while there are risks to financial stability for keeping rates very low for a long time, she doesnâ€™t see right now evidence of brewing trouble. â€œI expect that after a weak first quarter, growth will pick up to an above-trend pace over the rest of this year and next, in the 2.75-3% range,â€? Ms. Mester said. She said she was aware of the risks presented by events in China and Greece, and said trouble in the latter countryâ€™s woes should have a â€œlimited impact on the U.S. economy because our direct exposure via trade and banking is limited.â€? When it comes to the performance of hiring in the U.S., Ms. Mester said â€œthe totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or nearly at the Fedâ€™s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment.â€? Meanwhile, weak price pressures are likely to give way, allowing the Fed achieve its desire to get inflation back up to its 2% target, something that hasnâ€™t happened for three years. â€œWould I like to see higher inflation numbers? The answer is yes. Am I reasonably confident that inflation will move gradually back to the Fedâ€™s 2% objective over time? The answer is also yes,â€? Ms. Mester said.
