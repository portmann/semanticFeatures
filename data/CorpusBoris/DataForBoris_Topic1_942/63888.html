Grand Central: Is the Fedâ€™s 2% Inflation Target Too Low?  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Russia Buys More Dollars to Replenish Currency Reserves Central bankers around the developed world have agreed for much of the past two decades that 2% is a good objective for inflation. They want inflation to be low and stable, but they donâ€™t want it too low. Interest rates move in line with inflation, and they donâ€™t want inflation so low that interest rates are near zero. Then they would have no room to cut rates in a downturn to stimulate economic growth. Thus they have gravitated to 2%, a number born out of pragmatism more than any econometric model or proof. Now, as with so much economic orthodoxy in this post-crisis era, people are starting to wonder if itâ€™s the right number. Minutes of the Federal Reserveâ€™s April 28-29 policy meeting, released Wednesday, shows officials debated whether the 2% objective is too low. One Fed official, unnamed as per tradition in the minutes, suggested the central bank should discuss raising it. In a higher inflation world, the Fed would have more room to maneuver with short-term interest rates, which have been pinned near zero since December 2008. It would have more room to respond if a new downturn were to emerge. It would allow the Fed to avoid another controversial bond buying program as an alternative to cutting rates. This isnâ€™t an entirely new idea. International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard floated the idea of a 4% inflation target in 2010. It is against the odds that the Fed would actually change its inflation target. It would be a shocking move for investors, who have made myriad decisions based on expectations inflation will remain anchored near 2%. Moreover, it took nearly two decades of discussion to formally adopt the 2% goal. The minutes make clear officials donâ€™t take the idea of change lightly. As one official said in the discussion, a decision to raise the goal could undermine the Fedâ€™s credibility and â€œlead to adverse changes in inflation dynamics that could pose significant challenges for policy-makers.â€? Still, the fact that it is getting air-time at a Fed policy meeting four years after Mr. Blanchard broached the idea is noteworthy and testament to the nagging problems that confront central banks in a slow-growing post-crisis global economy. Fed Minutes Show June Rate Hike Unlikely. Federal Reserve officials meeting in late April doubted they would be ready to raise short-term interest rates by midyear, according to minutes released Wednesday. Just a few of them thought they would be ready to move by their June meeting. Many Fed officials began the year believing they might start raising short-term interest rates from near zero by midyear, but the winter slowdown has sidetracked their plans. Many market participants are now looking toward September or even later as the most likely time for a Fed rate increase. A New, Lower Normal for Fed Rates? Did the financial crisis and Great Recession lower the point at which theÂ Federal Reserveâ€™sÂ benchmark interest rate should be considered neutral? The concept of the â€œequilibriumâ€? rate of interest is esoteric but important for Fed officials as they consider how much to raise their benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, from near zero in coming years. Minutes of the Fedâ€™s April meeting showed some officials suggested that if the equilibrium rate were lower than in the past, that might justify more Fed measures to stimulate the economy and provide a reason for waiting longer before raising the fed funds rate. Global Banks to Pay Penalties in FX, Libor Probe. Five global banks agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and plead guilty to criminal charges to resolve a long running U.S. investigation into whether traders at the banks colluded to move foreign currency rates for their own financial benefit. Four of the banks, Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiring to manipulate prices in the $500 billion-a-day market for U.S. dollars and euros, authorities said. The fifth bank, UBS AG, received immunity in the antitrust case , but will pay a fine and plead guilty to manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, benchmark for violating an earlier accord meant to resolve those allegations of misconduct, bringing the total the five banks agreed to pay to $5.6 billion. Republicans Ask Yellen to Testify Four Times More Per Year. The heads of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee are asking Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen to double her appearances before their panels each year. They want her testify twice a year to each committee on bank supervision and regulation until the Fed has a vice chairman of supervision. That would be in addition to her twice yearly appearances before each panel on monetary policy. FRED Hacked. TheÂ St. Louis Fedâ€™s widely used data and research website was hacked in April, but its internal systems were not compromised , it said Wednesday. The regional central bank said in a statement , â€œOn April 24, 2015, computer hackers manipulated routing settings at a domain name service vendor used by the St. Louis Fed so that they could automatically redirect some of the Bankâ€™s web traffic that day to rogue webpages they created to simulate the look of the St. Louis Fedâ€™s research.stlouisfed.org website.â€? A section of the research website, widely known as Fred, is relied on by economists, consultants, journalists and other researchers seeking a comprehensive resource for economic data. Benjamin Lawsky to Step Down as New Yorkâ€™s Top Financial Regulator. Benjamin Lawsky ,Â the New York state banking regulator who earned praise and enmity for hisÂ  persistent pursuit of Wall Street wrongdoing , will leave the Department of Financial Services in June. SchÃ¤uble Wonâ€™t Rule Out a Greek Default. Germanyâ€™s finance minister said he couldnâ€™t rule out a Greek default, a stance that will add pressure on Athens as negotiations over much-needed financing enter their final stretch. In an interview Â with the Journal, Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble showed no willingness to compromise in the negotiations to unlock the final installment of Greeceâ€™s â‚¬245-billion ($272-billion) bailout. Without a deal, the program will expire in six weeks, leaving Greece with no option but to default on billions of euros in debt repayments coming due this summer. ECB Ups Emergency Lending for Greece. The European Central Bank increased the amount of money Greek banks can borrow under an emergency lending program, according to a Greek bank official. The ECB raised the amount the Greek central bank can lend banks to 80.2 billion euros ($89 billion) from â‚¬80 billion the previous week , according to the official. Under the emergency-liquidity assistance program, or ELA, the Greek central bank lends money to its countryâ€™s financial institutions. No More Embargoed ECB Speeches. TheÂ ECBÂ will no longer release the speeches of its executive board members to journalists under embargo. The decision is aimed at ensuring the widest possible access to ECB speeches, a spokesman said, adding that it was becoming increasingly difficult to determine which journalists should have access to embargoed comments. The decision, which takes effect immediately, came one day after the delayed release of comments by executive board memberÂ Benoit CoeurÃ©Â caused a stir in financial markets. Russia Buys More Dollars to Replenish Currency Reserves. The Bank of Russia has intervened again on currency markets to replenish its hard-currency reserves and has indicated it may increase the volume of daily interventions in the near future. The central bankâ€“which reports its currency-market activities with a two-day lagâ€“said on Thursday that it bought $200 million on Tuesday, bringing total purchases to nearly $1 billion since last Wednesday. Income Volatility Widespread. American households across the wealth spectrum increasingly face sharp swings in monthly income and spending, a finding that underscores the unpredictability that has become a hallmark of the U.S. labor market since the recession. A J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. analysis of 100,000 of the bankâ€™s customers found a large and diverse share of Americans with incomes that vary by more than 30% from one month to the next. The study also found the bottom 80% of households by income lack sufficient savings to cover the type of volatility observed in income and spending . -1315 GMT (9:15 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s Weale speaks in London -1730 GMT (1:30 p.m. EDT): Fedâ€™s Fischer speaks on â€œPast, Present, and Future Challenges for the Euro Areaâ€? at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal -7 p.m. EDT: San Francisco Fedâ€™s Williams speaks on a panel about central bank reforms in Stanford, Calif. Where is the Natural Rate of Interest? Marco Del Negro and Marc Giannoni of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York assess the natural rate of interest, â€œthe real interest rate consistent with full employment of labor and capital resources.â€? They conclude that the natural rate fell into negative territory during the recession, from which it has struggled to emerge. Fed policymakers, however, have kept their interest rates above zero, â€œsuggesting that policy is not particularly accommodative.â€? As the economy improves, however, â€œwe expect these headwinds to continue to abate, and the natural rate of interest to return closer to historical levels.â€? Some Statesâ€™ Tax Laws Widen Inequality. New research by a trio ofÂ Federal ReserveÂ staff economists finds that, on average, state taxesÂ increaseÂ income inequality, albeit only slightly. In a few states, Minnesota, Oregon and Wisconsin among them, state taxes reinforce the effects of the federal tax code, further shrinking the income gap between rich and poor beyond what federal taxes do. But in others, Tennessee,Â Mississippi andÂ West VirginiaÂ among them, state taxes undo about one-third of the inequality-reducing force of federal taxes. Spilling ECB Secrets. Why would ECB board member Benoit Coeure reveal the central bankâ€™s intention to frontload bond purchases during a private event, especially in the wake of the investigations over disclosures at the Federal Reserve, asks Mark Gilbert of Bloomberg View. The rest of the world did not get the news until the following morning, after the euro had begun its slide. â€œI canâ€™t prove to you that anyone at the conference traded on what the ECB policymaker announced. But my wordy, doesnâ€™t that look just a bit more than suspicious?â€? Mr. Gilbert writes. â€œCentral bankers shouldnâ€™t be in the business of selectively disclosing market-moving information at closed-door conferences sponsored and attended by hedge funds. Iâ€™d suggest an inquiry is in order.â€? An ECB spokesman blamed an â€œinternal procedural errorâ€? and said the intention had been to publish the speech as it was being delivered. Workforce and Productivity. The Financial Timesâ€™ John Kay asks why productivity has not been rising in the U.K. and suggests the answer might have to do with the composition of the workforce. â€œAverage productivity can fall even though no individual worker becomes less productive. This may happen if the composition of the population changes, and those who join the labor force have lower productivity than those who are in it already,â€? he writes. A Cure for Deflation? Try Reprission. Â In a posting on The Top Note, Stuart Parkinson wonders why central banks have spent so much timeÂ trying to avoid deflation ifÂ is suddenly now so good, a claim made by Â Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and the U.K. government as consumer prices fall for the first time since 1960. He argues new terms are needed to distinguish different kinds of price decline, much as economists now distinguish between depression and recession. “My ever-so-modest a proposal to the world of economics â€“ is calledÂ Reprission,” he writes. “Reprission is the temporary marking-down of consumer goods, not its broader-impacting, longer-lasting cousinÂ Deflation.” -Â The eurozoneâ€™s economy slowed for the second straight month in May, according to surveys of purchasing managers, a sign that it is struggling to quickly recover from the damage inflicted by its long debt crisis . - The City Council of Los Angeles has given preliminary approval to a plan to raise the cityâ€™s minimum wage to $15 from $9 by 2020 . - The U.S. government on Wednesday revealed some of the contents of Osama bin Ladenâ€™s compound.
