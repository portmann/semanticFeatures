Why The Fed Will Not Be Raising Rates | Seeking Alpha Foreign uncertainties are making the Fed resistant when it comes to raising rates. Although the U.S. is currently at promising employment levels, inflation is still well below the 2% target level. It is doubtful that there will be an interest rate hike before the end of 2015, or even before mid 2016. The United States Federal Reserve has held interest rates near zero since December of 2008, and it does not seem as though they are going to raise them anytime before the middle of 2016. The low inflation levels the U.S. is seeing, in addition to the uncertainty in China are reasons to be confident that the Fed will not be raising rates soon- especially not this December. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: ensuring maximum employment while at the same time keeping inflation levels at a target level of two percent. When it comes to unemployment, the Federal Reserve is seeing enormous success. The October jobs report, released in early November, was unexpectedly strong. The unemployment rate now stands at five percent, which is normally considered full employment by many economists. However, the Fed's inflation target of two percent has not been reached. While some may claim that the low inflation is "transitory," the target level has been missed for nearly six years. It seems as though inflation is not a lost cause, however. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer has stated that he suspects U.S. inflation to rebound next year as pressures related to the strong dollar and low energy prices fade, adding that the economy had done reasonably well thanks in part to a delay in interest rate hikes. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, a voting member of the FOMC, also spoke Thursday, saying that the central bank is close to reaching its employment target, but it could be "well into" next year before the goal for inflation is reached to support a rate hike. This new data suggests that it might be in the Fed's best interests to delay the hike until next year, when inflation has reached its target rate. With the possibility of being able to raise rates during a moment where the Fed's dual mandate is fulfilled, I don't see the FOMC raising them this December. Although it is true that the Fed does not manage the United States interest rate policy to what is happening in China, they certainly take into consideration the standings of a country that contributes about 15% of global GDP and close to 50% of global growth. In September we saw a sell off in U.S. stocks because of the weakness in the Chinese economy, the devaluation of the Yuan, and the stock market turmoil in the Asian nation. A delay in raising the rates will give U.S. investors the chance to evaluate China's economic problems and react accordingly. In addition, the global economy remains "lackluster at best," and is even slowing, while rates remain zero. Growth has been so weak that even the IMF and other important economic entities have publicly asked the Fed not to raise rates in 2015. Overall, we must assess the risk/reward of a rate hike. The downside of the Fed waiting is… high inflation? This is extremely doubtful as there is little reason to believe inflation will skyrocket in the near future. Credibility issues? At the end of the day, the Fed will choose what they believe is right for the economy, rather than try to save face with investors. The data suggests that the upside to waiting greatly outweighs the downside- Wall Street may be ready for a rate hike, but Main Street certainly is not. As stated by Lawrence H. Summers, former Treasury secretary: With credit becoming more expensive, the outlook for the Chinese economy clouded at best, emerging markets submerging, the U.S. stock market in a correction, widespread concerns about liquidity, and expected volatility having increased at a near-record rate, markets are themselves dampening any euphoria or over confidence. At this moment of fragility, raising rates risks tipping some part of the financial system into crisis, with unpredictable and dangerous results. So, as an investor, what are the opportunities available? Assuming that a rate hike in December is priced in now, the front end of the yields are higher than they should be. A rate hike would then push them down, and thus push prices up. Thus, I would recommend buying something on the short end- 0 to 5 year treasuries, and selling them after the market prices in the missed rate hike.
