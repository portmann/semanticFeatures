What The World's Best Economists Are Saying About Raising Rates | Seeking Alpha Yesterday, some of the world's brightest economists talked about their take on the economy. Most felt that a rate hike was premature. David Wessel - Director of The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Donald Kohn - Robert S. Kerr Senior Fellow Joseph Gagnon - Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow Julia Coronado - Graham Capital Management, L.P Chief Economist Jon Faust - Louis J. Maccini Professor of Economics at Johns Hopkins University What: Hutchins Center on Fiscal Policy & Education Event, 'What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?' The Federal Reserve, which has been holding interest rates near zero since late 2008, is poised to raise them sometime this year, perhaps in September, perhaps in December. What happens when the Fed finally makes its move-to the U.S. economy, to bond and stock markets, to the rest of the world? What should the Fed's strategy be going forward for raising interest rates? Should it be predictable? Or dependent on data? Should it stick to its vow to move gradually? And what should the Fed do with its $4 trillion bond portfolio? Allow it to shrink gradually? Sell off bonds? Maintain a portfolio bigger than pre-2008 levels? On September 3, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings discussed all these questions and more with four experts: Brookings' Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman; Peterson Institute's Joseph Gagnon, a former top Fed staffer, Johns Hopkins's Jon Faust, and Julia Coronado of Graham Capital. David Wessel moderated the discussion. Question 1: David Wessel - Asks committee to put themselves in the shoes of the FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) to see if they would rates now, end of 2015, or even into 2016. Donald Kohn: opens discussion with urging the general public to look at the economy one to three years in the future. Disagrees with being 'data dependent' and rather be 'outlook/forecast dependent' Sees steady progress in the labor markets Turbulence and volatility in global financial markets, especially given the low probability the market is putting on rising rates Emerging market and Chinese economy outcome is unclear Friday employment report should not change the general long-term outlook of the job growth of the economy; the job market has improved immensely since the last downturn Oil prices should not affect long-term outlook on inflation rates Rather, one most pose a more important question: Will the labor market continue to tighten? If the labor market does indeed tighten, the relationship with inflation is that it will increase (eventually meeting the target 2% inflation rate) The first rate hike does not matter as much as the rate at which interest rates are rising Makes a point that the 'world' did not blow up, but the public markets did Does the volatility of the public markets, however, say something about the underlying economy or will it ultimately not leave a trace in the data? Considers the probability of a rate hike to be considerably higher than 20%, but has no exact number on a rate hike in September Movements in public markets have effects on spending (even if this effect is psychological) A strong dollar has a massive effect on exports, and reduces inflation Recommends waiting to raise rates because of it Whenever the FED moves and how quickly they move, it gives guidance on the FEDs outlook on the economy Shows the weighting of housing strength, FX, labor, and export markets in terms of decision making It would be a very big surprise to the markets if the FED were to raise rates given the probability the markets are currently placing In terms of risk management, the FED would be wise to implement higher probability in the public markets prior to raising Three out of the four BRICs are debatably in a recession, one of which (China) doesn't give a clear look at data 20% of her portfolio managers anticipated a rate hike in September She gives a 10-15% probability that rates raise in September Question 2: David Wessel - We are nearer to the point where zero interest rates do not make sense, but the market is nervous that a repeat event of 1990's raising of rates cause market turbulence, is there a case that at 5.3% unemployment that interest rates are too low? Would it be better if the FED just got on with it? Citing examples from Europe, now we know that zero isn't the lower bound of rates Because of divergence in the monetary policy of the world's central banks, there will be a reaction in an exchange rates that do feed back into the economy in the form of exports when rates are raised The move reflects a global move of lower interest rates, and a trend that as economists we do not know much about and should be wary of Question 3: David Wessel - To what extent should the FED be thinking about the rest of the world? Does it really effect inflation growth in the US? China does in fact effect the US economy, and it represents a material number of US exports - the point is that we are not isolated The declines around the world will reduce consumption and investment The stronger dollar will also hurt exports Trailing indicators regarding exports will not tell us much until a couple of months from now regarding a slowdown The FED must be a pragmatic central bank, this is a global economy where China is at its lowest PMI, Canada is in a recession, and Brazil's abysmal Q2 is now in hard data The FED is trying to make interest rates being the main policy instrument, meanwhile the rest of the world is pulling a page out of America's book and using easing as their main policy - again, this is an aspect of economic policy we do not know much about Outright FED sales would have a substantial effect on rates He does not think the FED will executes sales within its portfolio until the federal funds rate is at 1% FED should not sell its bond for at least 5 years Argues that the FED should maintain a large portfolio ($2 trillion), as opposed to the too large portfolio the FED holds now ($4-5 trillion) The FED should standardize operational procedures, so that they can decide in which direction to head in terms of monetary policy The FED needs to establish 'plumbing questions' Figuring out and establishing answers to long-term monetary policies We are not where we should be on mortgage loan to value metrics, an outright sale of the FEDs MBS (mortgage backed securities) would be a disaster for the market We were at the peak of interest rate cycles when the bubble broke in 2008, meaning that monetary policy doesn't have much effect when bubbles form Question 1: Asker's native language was not English and his question was hard to understand from the webcast. 1. Jon Faust - timing of normalization is not a good question. Rather, the question should be: if they do normalize, will it be a 50 bps (basis point) rise or a 25 bps rise? The framework behind the timing is more important. 2. Julia Coronado - the message with a rate hike is important; data must build the case and the message delivery is about the timing of the rise. Timing matters very much. The vectors, such as international developments, must be taken into account - this is called pragmatic central banking. This is why she sets very low odds on a September rate hike - the rumble in the global markets must be taken into account. Question 2: It looks dangerous for the FOMC to think that the markets are just "transitory", it shows that the market perceives significant risk from EM and global markets. Markets will be extremely sensitive to shock risk. Do the committee members agree with the details coming out of the market reaction? 1 Donald Kohn - this is a good point. The markets are trying to say that the global markets are causing disinflationary factors back onto the US. One would hope that we could wait a little while (to raise rates) and see how this plays out. 2. Jon Faust - we do not want an FOMC that says we're waiting for a specific quiet time in volatility in public markets. The driver of policy, though, should be what the volatility is telling about current market events. What we are learning from the market is the perceived effect of disinflation from global events. Question 3: Can October be a time to raise rates? Everyone is assuming September or December. 1. Donald Kohn - it'd be less likely, because when rates raise the press conference in September/December would give the chance for the FED chair to explain the move and ease the market concern. Question 4: What about not moving rates? Is that worse? 1. Joseph Gagnon - I care less about public market volatility and more about market movement. Because we're down more than 10% since the last FED meeting, this is something the market is telling us about the confidence of the global economy. 2. Julia Coronado - the market is telling us that there is a downside bias to inflation risk; this means that the market is assuming disinflation and most definitely not confidence in rising inflation. Outside of market volatility there is even more risk from the global economy. 3. Jon Faust - at the end of the day, it's a tale of two evils. The FED has experience in moving inflation and deflation. What the FED does not have experience with is operating in this extremely low rate environment if some unknown downturn occurs in the economy. Yes, keeping rates lower for much longer has inherent danger involved. Question 5: Where is China's role in all of this? 1. Donald Kohn - the Chinese devalued their currency on a Monday and Tuesday and did not have a press conference until Friday. Communication is absolutely essential, especially now that China is a major part of the global economy. 2. Julia Coronado - a lot of public market volatility is due to the instability of policy makers out of China. The news is that China does not have a plan, and that the plan changes week to week. I assume a lot of the recent volatility from China is that they really do not have a plan. The full video of the event can be viewed on replay here .
