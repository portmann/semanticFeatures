Grand Central: Have Central Banks Learned to Distinguish “Good” from “Bad” Deflation? - Real Time Economics - WSJ Hannonâ€™s Take: Have Central Banks Learned to Distinguish “Good” from “Bad” Deflation? China Moves to Strengthen Control Over Its Policy Banks Have central banks overestimated the threat of deflation, launching a wave of fresh stimulus to counter a danger that really wasn’t that clear and present? Inflation rates in developed economies have been falling for roughly three years, but took a decisive lurch downward towards the end of 2014 as oil prices collapsed. In Europe, consumer prices started to fall relative to their year-earlier level, and edged closer to that point in a number of other economies. As 2014 drew to a close, it appeared that large parts of the global economy might be heading for a deflationary spiral, or a worst-case scenario in which households and businesses postponed spending as prices fell, lowering economic output at a time of already weak growth, and further reinforcing the decline in prices. The fear of such an outcome largely inspired the European Central Bank’s January announcement of a new asset-buying program, or quantitative easing, as well as an earlier move by the Bank of Japan, and interest rate cuts by a number of smaller central banks. As 2015 has progressed, however, some doubts have emerged about whether central banks should have been quite so alarmed. In March, the Bank for International Settlements published the results of new research Â that suggests there is little to fear from even a persistent fall in the prices of goods and services, and a reinterpretation of both the Great Depression and the long period of gently falling prices that has affected Japan since the late 1990s. But rather than take a pretty large risk by dismissing all deflationary episodes as harmless as an alternative to viewing all deflationary episodes as the supreme threat, it might make sense to take a closer look at exactly what has been driving prices lower, and how that affects the threat level. One recent example is a note authored by Eric Lascelles at RBC Global Asset Management, in which he attempts to identify the disparate forces acting on prices to assess exactly how persistent and dangerous they might be. His conclusion is that globally, the recent move in prices is less threatening that it looks, since it is mostly due to temporary factors–such as oil–that may in fact be good for economic growth, and to a much lesser extent due to more long-lasting and potentially damaging developments, such as aging populations. But to be fair to the ECB, Mr. Lascelles concludes that the eurozone has the largest dose of “bad” deflationary forces, and that’s not a conclusion many would argue with. By contrast, Mr. Lascellesâ€™s analysis suggests the deflationary pressures faced by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are less likely to be persistent and in general are more benign. That helps explain why neither central bank has seen the need to act as inflation rates have fallen. So perhaps central bankers are becoming more nuanced in their responses to deflationary pressures, and they may have broadly gotten it right over the past six months. Richmond Fedâ€™s Lacker Still Sees Strong Case to Raise Rates in June. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker reiterated on Friday that he sees a strong case for the Fed to begin raising short-term interest rates this summer . “I expect that, unless incoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will remain strong at the June meeting.” Minneapolis Fedâ€™s Kocherlakota: Fed Shouldnâ€™t Raise Rates in 2015. The Federal Reserve should continue to support U.S. economic growth by waiting until the second half of 2016 to begin raising short-term interest rates, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said Friday. â€œI think what people want to hear is prospects of higher wages, higher incomes. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to fuel their desire to spend, and thereby boost the economy and boost employment,â€? Mr. Kocherlakota said following a speech in Bloomington, Minn. The Hutchins Center Explains: How the Fed Will Raise Interest Rates. The Federal Reserve, which cut short-term interest rates nearly to zero at the end of 2008, is considering raising them sometime this year. But it canâ€™t move interest rates the way it did before the financial crisis. Hereâ€™s a primer on how the Fed plans to exit from the long period of extraordinarily easy credit. Fed’s George Hears Banking Complaints From Pot Business Owners â€“Denver Post. Kansas City Fed President Esther George last week “listened intently to a group of 20 businessmen, bankers and government officials who talked about the troubling lack of banking services available to the marijuana industry , but offered little indication how it could be resolved,” the Denver Post reported. GE Wants to Lose SIFI Label. General Electric Co.â€™s decision to drastically slim down its GE Capital finance unit poses the first real-world test of whether a â€œsystemically important financial institutionâ€? can ever jettison that label .The designation as a so-called “SIFI” brings with it tougher oversight by the Federal Reserve and GE Capital entered that orbit in 2013, when regulators made their first wave of designations following the 2010 Dodd Frank law. GE wants to lose the SIFI label and said it had discussed its plans with regulators. Germanyâ€™s Rising Wages Bode Well for Global Economy. German workers are getting a raise, which could give a bump to the rest of Europe, and thus the U.S. With unemployment near record lows and Europeâ€™s biggest economy humming, rising wages in Germany should eventually spur higher consumer spending, more imports and a smaller trade surplus . All that would benefit the eurozone and the global economy. Two institutions gathering this weekâ€”the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fundâ€”have a stake in these developments. BOJ Gov Kuroda Says Core CPI to Stay Around Zero.Â Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said in his opening remarks to a meeting of the central bank’s branch managers Monday that the inflation rate will likely stay around zero near-term, although the economy is likely to continue its mild recovery. Â ”As for its outlook, it will likely move around zero for the time being” because of falling energy prices, Mr. Kuroda said, referring to the inflation rate as gauged by the core consumer price index. The core inflation rate, adjusted for a sales tax increase in April 2014, fell to zero in FebruaryÂ – Dow Jones Newswires. BOJ Minutes Show Confidence in BOJ Easing.Â Many members of Bank of Japan’s policy board said at a March meeting that they were confident the central bank’s aggressive easing steps were having a positive effect on the economy, with one member saying those effects would “suppress’ possible negative side effects such as a financial bubble. Current improvements in the economy wouldn’t have occurred without the additional monetary easing action taken in late October, one member said in the minutes of discussions at the board’s March 16-17 meeting released MondayÂ – Dow Jones Newswires. BOJ Raises View of 3 Out of 9 Local Econs in April.Â The Bank of Japan on Monday raised its view of some of the country’s regional economies, brushing aside skepticism of the strength of the economic recovery. In its latest quarterly “Sakura” report , the central bank raised its assessment of economies for three out of the nine regions, including Tokai region in central Japan, the country’s manufacturing hub. That was the largest number of upgrades since January 2014. The assessment for the rest of the regions was left unchanged — Dow Jones Newswires. China Moves to Strengthen Control Over Its Policy Banks.Â Chinaâ€™s government is strengthening control over the countryâ€™s three major policy banks to position them better to support new initiatives to finance projects and corporate expansions abroad and to help stabilize growth at home . Sweden Central Bank Head: Rates to Stay Low for Some Time.Â Sweden’s central bank head, Stefan Ingves, expects the country’s interest rates to stay at low levels for some time and warned against an overheating in the country’s real-estate market. Â In an interview with German weekly WirtschaftsWoche, he also said he doesn’t see Sweden joining the euro. Â ”The issue is currently politically dead,” he said in the interview, published Saturday. “There isn’t a majority in Sweden for joining the euro.”Â – Dow Jones Newswires.

Sanches wrote in a Philadelphia Fed working paper. ” I show that a purely private monetary system is inherently unstable due to the properties of endogenously determined limits on private money creation.” The Fed Can Be Patient About Raising Interest Rates writes Alan S. Blinder in the Journal.Â ”The Federal Reserve will not maintain near-zero interest rates and a $4.5 trillion balance sheet forever,” writes Mr. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed. “Monetary policy will eventually begin to normalize. But not in June, and maybe not in September. Timing, they say, is everything. This is a time for patience.” The Global Secular Savings Stagnation Glut. “The debate is inching toward the right question: what sort of imbalance between saving and investment do we have here, anyway?” Ryan Avent writes for the Economist. “Is the problem that the world has too much saving and too little investment? Or is it that the saving and the investment are stuck in different places?” -Prices fell last month for goods imported into the U.S., suggesting the weak global economy and moves by foreign central banks are holding back inflation . -Falling exports in March and a sharp drop in Chinaâ€™s monthly trade surplus point to weak first-quarter economic results coming this week, heaping more pressure on Beijing to ease fiscal and monetary policy. -China posted another modest rise in consumer inflation in March, giving policy makers room for more aggressive stimulus for a sluggish economy. Factory level prices, however, were firmly stuck in deflation territory, where they have been for more than three years. -Passenger vehicle sales in India grew slightly in the just-ended fiscal year as improving consumer sentiment, declining fuel prices and introduction of more than 90 new or upgraded models helped demand recover.
