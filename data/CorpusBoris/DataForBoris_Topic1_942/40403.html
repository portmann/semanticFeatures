Fedspeak Cheatsheet: Fed Officials Could Wait Longer to Raise Rates  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve officials have made clear they wonâ€™t raise interest rates Â at their policy meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. And theyâ€™ve stopped using phrases such as â€œconsiderable timeâ€? and â€œpatientâ€? to signal how much longer theyâ€™ll wait to start lifting borrowing costs. So the only suspense this week surrounds how their post-meeting statement will characterize the winter slowdown in U.S. growth. Several officials have said recently they think it was probably a temporary soft patch, and they expect to see a rebound in coming months. A small number of policy makers still want to start raising their benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero this summer, but others sound increasingly inclined to wait until the fall or even later to act. Two say they want to wait until next year. Chairwoman Janet Yellen (voter), March 27 in San Francisco : “I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this year.” Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer (voter), April 16 in a CNBC interview : The Fed will aim to raise rates “at the best possible time. Weâ€™d like to see the economy beginning to grow again and grow at a decent rate, and weâ€™d like to see unemployment continue to come down and some signs that inflation isâ€¦heading toward the 2% target.â€? Gov. Jerome Powell (voter), April 8 in New York City : Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , April 22 in a Wall Street Journal interview : “If we get an outcome that is consistent with the forecast of a pickup in the next three quarters, that would be an environment where it may be consistent with raising rates later this year. It is in the forecast. It is not in the data.” New York Fed President William Dudley (voter), April 20 in New York City : â€œHopefullyâ€? the economic data will â€œsupport a decision to lift off later this yearâ€¦Because the economic outlook is uncertain, I canâ€™t tell you when normalization will occur.” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester,Â  April 16 in New York City : â€œIf it turns out that the incoming information shows that growth is regaining momentum after the first-quarter slowdown and more broadly supports my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff relatively soon.” Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker (voter), April 15 in Charleston, S.C. : Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart (voter), April 16 in West Palm Beach, Fla. : Saying a June rate rise is “not my preference,” Mr. Lockhart explained “I think waiting a while longer improves the chances of seeing confirmation from incoming data that the economy is on the desired path.” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans (voter), March 25 in London : â€œI think economic conditions are likely to evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to hold off on raising short-term rates until 2016.” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , April 15 in Washington : â€œNow may be a good time to begin normalizing monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next couple of years.” Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, April 14 in Winona, Minn. : “Raising the Fed funds rate in 2015 would be inappropriate, because such an action would serve to further delay the return of inflation to target.â€? Kansas City Fed President Esther George, March 31 in New York City : With a rate rise, â€œitâ€™s more a process of pulling back on some of the accommodation. The sooner we do it the better.” San Francisco Fed President John Williams (voter), March 23 in a speech delivered to an Australian audience : â€œI think that by mid-year it will be the time to have a discussion about starting to raise rates.” previous Kasich Weighs Odds, Money in Possible Presidential Run We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.
