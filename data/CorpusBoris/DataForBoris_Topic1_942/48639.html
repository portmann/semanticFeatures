Fed’s Evans Continues to Advocate for Early-2016 Rate Increase - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago leader Charles Evans repeated on Monday his belief that raising rates this year would be a bad idea, especially in the wake of data showing a weak start to the year amid persistently weak levels of inflation. “Economic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path, which, on its own, would support a rate hike soon,” Mr. Evans said in a speech in Columbus, Indiana. “However, the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation that they are indeed a transitory aberration,” the official said. Speaking to reporters after his speech, Mr. Evans said he suspects the negligible levels of growth seen during the first quarter reflect weather issues, a slow global economy and lower exports tied to the strength of the dollar. “I tend to believe that most of what we saw in the first quarter was transitory, but we will have to see,” he said. In his speech, he said the uncertain outlook, coupled with very low levels of inflation and the expectation it will only slowly rise over time, means “it likely will not be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate until sometime in early 2016.” “There is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to, and no preset script to follow, other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides,” Mr. Evans said. “I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely,” he said. When it comes to moving too early, “It’s inflation that I worry most about. I think if we top out in this cycle with inflation not getting to 2%, that’s going to be a problem for us longer term,” Mr. Evans told reporters. Mr. Evans holds a voting role on the monetary-policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. His remarks were his first since last week’s FOMC meeting. Then, officials held rates steady at near zero levels and continued to say a rate rise will come when the data support such an action. The meeting came in the wake of data showing very weak levels of growth in the first quarter. While Fed officials believe the trouble will prove transitory, it has created newfound uncertainty for the economic outlook. For many in markets, an expected rate rise is being pushed back from early summer until later in the year. On Friday, the leaders of the Cleveland and San Francisco Fed banks said they weren’t yet willing to change their view that growth should be solid this year. They also both said that rate increases remain on the table at all Fed meetings this year. Mr. Evans, while optimistic about the outlook, has long held one of the most dovish outlooks for rate policy. Only one other official, Narayana Kocherlakota at the Minneapolis Fed, has also argued in favor of refraining from rate rises until next year. As he has said in the past, inflation that has fallen well short of the Fed’s 2% target joined with a labor market that still has more healing to do, underscores Mr. Evans desire to hold steady on rates longer than his colleagues. That fact that inflation has been below the Fed’s 2% target for an extended period is telling, Mr. Evans said in his speech. “One could argue that we currently do not have enough policy accommodation in place,” because “if policy truly were highly accommodative, we’d be getting to our inflation target sooner,” he said. The official believes the Fed won’t get desired levels of inflation until 2018. The strong dollar and the sharp drop in oil prices have created additional risk inflation will struggle to get back to the Fed’s target, he said. Still, Mr. Evans was generally upbeat on growth. Despite the ugly first quarter, he said he sees growth averaging 2.5% to 3% over the next several years. That should keep average monthly job gains over 200,000.
