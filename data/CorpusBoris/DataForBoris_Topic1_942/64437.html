Fed’s Williams Touts Value of Inflation Target  - Real Time Economics - WSJ PALO ALTO, Calif.–Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Thursday inflation targets are important in creating effective monetary policy. Speaking at a conference held by Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, Mr. Williams observed briefly that price targets like the Fed’s 2% inflation goal make the Fed “formally and in fact accountable for the one thing a central bank can do: Control inflation.” Keeping price pressures at desired levels is “the one thing” a central bank “should own,” he said. The Fed adopted its 2% price target at the start of 2012. It has failed to achieve this goal for nearly three years, a shortfall that has motivated it to pursue an aggressively easy money policy. Mr. Williams was speaking at a conference discussing the value of policy-making rules for central banks.
