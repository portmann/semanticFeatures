Grand Central: Fed Doesn’t Demand Wage Growth Before Increasing Interest Rate - Real Time Economics - WSJ Greek Stocks Fall as Trading Resumes After Five-Week Exchange Closure Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press Federal Reserve officials have fuzzy views on how wage growth fits in with their objectives for the economy. They would like to see wages growing faster. It would give them confidence that the economy is closer to their dual goals of producing healthy job growth and modestly rising inflation. But the linkages between wages, jobs and inflation are unclear, and so theyâ€™re not banking on faster wage growth materializing. In classical models of the economy, as the unemployment rate falls, slack in the job market diminishes, producing upward pressure on wages. Because wages are such a large component of business costs, wage pressures in turn get passed on to consumers in the form of higher consumer prices. But a growing body of research suggests the economy hasnâ€™t been working like this for decades. Other factors — including global pressures, in addition to household and business views about the stability of inflation — have large effects that potentially outweigh any impact from domestic wages on prices. A recent paper by Fed board economists Ekaterina Peneva and Jeremy Rudd finds little evidence that the ups and downs of wages had large effects on broader consumer price trends either before or after the 2007-2009 recession. â€œWage developments are unlikely to be an important independent driver of (or an especially good guide to) future price developments,â€? they conclude. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen is well aware of all this research. In a speech in March , she laid out the connections she sees between wages, jobs and inflation and how they fit into her plans for short-term interest rates: â€œThe outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected. For example, we cannot be sure about the future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that may also influence the pace of real wage growth over time. These factors, which are outside of the Federal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with productivity growth for at least the past 15 years. For such reasons, we can never be sure what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress in achieving its inflation objective.â€? Ms. Yellen said last month in semiannual testimony to Congress on the economy that wages showed tentative signs of picking up. Fed officials want to see this because it would imply the job market is getting back toward full health and producing pay gains for workers. The Labor Departmentâ€™s employment cost index had risen 2.6% in the first quarter from a year earlier, it biggest increase since 2008. Then on Friday, the Labor Department reported that the index tumbled down to a 2.0% growth rate in the second quarter, in line with its disappointing pace for most of the post-recession period. An upturn in wage growth seemed to disappear with one single disappointing report. Other measures of wage growth, including Labor Department measures of the average hourly earnings of workers, also are creeping along at a little above 2% per year. This plays in complicated ways into the Fedâ€™s thinking on interest rates. Fed officials expect to raise short-term interest rates this year. Will they proceed in an environment in which wage growth is not materializing? Ms. Yellen said explicitly in that March speech that she is prepared to start moving interest rates up even before she sees sure signs that wages are rising faster. â€œThat said,â€? she added, â€œI would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage growth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were to weaken.â€? Given her stance, Fridayâ€™s employment cost report doesnâ€™t look like a deal breaker for the Fed in its long-running debate about when to raise short-term interest rates. Wages appear to be stagnant but not clearly weakening, which is what she set out as her threshold for not acting. Still, it creates new doubts for officials and doesnâ€™t help them build the confidence theyâ€™re hoping to build that the job market is nearing full employment and inflation rising toward 2%. The September policy meeting is thus shaping up to be a cliffhanger for the Fed and markets. Officials could decide they want to take a bit more time to makes sense of all of this. Still, other evidence could emerge before then that convinces them to look past the report and act on rates. This coming Fridayâ€™s jobs report, and its measures of average hourly earnings of workers, now becomes all the more important for the Fed in its continued search for evidence that the economy is truly on the mend. Bullard: â€œIn Good Shapeâ€? to Raise Rates in September. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis PresidentÂ James BullardÂ said Friday economic data seen since central bankers gathered this week are bolstering the case for raising short-term rates when officials meet in September. â€œWe are in good shapeâ€? for increasing the Fedâ€™s currently near-zero short-term rate target at the Sept. 16-17 central bank gathering, Mr. Bullard said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal . Shelby Points to Another Fed Vacancy. Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee suggested he may hold up President Barack Obamaâ€™s two nominees for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over a lack of action from the White House on another central bank position. At issue is a new post on the Fedâ€™s seven-member board of governors established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The job was created to make the central bank more directly accountable for its duties overseeing the largest U.S. financial firms. Dubbed the vice chairman of supervision, the seat has stood empty for five years because Mr. Obama has never nominated anyone to fill it. As Fed Rate Rise Nears, Traders Obsess Over Data.Â In the race to predict the timing of the Federal Reserveâ€™s anticipated interest-rate rise, traders are digging ever deeper into the slew of economic data points released each day. BOE Appointee Vlieghe to Sell Stake in Brevan Howard. The newest appointee to the Bank of Englandâ€™s interest rate-setting panel said Friday that he will sell his stake in hedge fund firm Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP to avoid any impression of a conflict of interest in his new role. Gertjan Vlieghe,Â who wasÂ appointed to the BOEâ€™s Monetary Policy CommitteeÂ by the U.K. Treasury Tuesday, in a statement denied there would have been a conflict between his new role and his stake in the firm but said he nevertheless decided to sell. Greek Stocks Fall as Trading Resumes After Five-Week Exchange Closure. Â Greeceâ€™s main stock index fell more than 20% early Monday, after opening for the first time in five weeks. The Athex Composite, the countryâ€™s benchmark index, slumped 22.8% in the first few minutes of trading according to FactSet data, with all constituents that were trading tumbling into the red. Tsipras Called For Grexit Contingency Plans. Greeceâ€™s Prime MinisterÂ Alexis TsiprasÂ on Friday acknowledged making contingency plans in case Greece was forced from the euro , but said it was never his aim to leave the common currency. His comments to lawmakers came after a call made public this week suggested his former finance minister wanted to hack government information to set up a system based on IOUs in case Greece could no longer stay afloat using euros. Survey: Big Cities Lead the Way in Economic Recovery. Overall, cities have seen marked improvement in their economic well-being from a couple of years ago. Forty percent of mid-sized cities with a population of 100,000 to 299,999 reported that local economic conditions had greatly improved during the past year. That is compared with just 20% of cities with fewer than 50,000 residents. No big cities with populations over 300,000 reported that economic conditions had worsened over the last year and 23% said they had improved greatly. Meanwhile, 5% of cities with populations under 50,000 said that they had worsened slightly or greatly. -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Commerce Department releases income, consumer spending and inflation data for June -0430 GMT (12:30 a.m. EDT): Reserve Bank of Australia releases a policy statement -0530 GMT (1:30 a.m. EDT): Reserve Bank of India releases a policy statement -10 a.m. EDT: Fed, other regulators hold an Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act outreach session in Kansas City, Mo. -Bank of Thailand releases a policy statement –0800 GMT (4:00 a.m. EDT) Eurozone July services and composite PMI –0900 GMT (5:00 a.m. EDT) Eurozone June retail sales -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Commerce Department releases international-trade data for June -Central Bank of Kenya releases a policy statement -0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT) UK June industrial production -1100 GMT (7:00 a.m. EDT) Bank of England releases a policy statement and minutes -Bank of England releases the August inflation report -Bank of Japan releases a policy statement -0600 GMT (2:00 a.m. EDT) Germany June industrial production -0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT) U.K. June trade balance -8:30 a.m. EDT: U.S. Labor Department releases jobs report for July New Jobs in St. Louis Fed district Concentrated in Low-Paying Industries. St. Louis Fed economists look at the employment recovery in their region, the eighth district. â€œThe Eighth District recovery in employment since the end of the recession has been very heterogeneous, with employment growth more concentrated in low-paying industries than in high-paying industries. The discrepancy in growth rates in the District is different from the discrepancy in the nation, where Kliesen and Ricketts found that jobs in high-paying industries are growing at a faster rate than jobs in low-paying industries.â€? Whatâ€™s the Hurry? Brian Kelly calls for patience in the Fedâ€™s decision to raise interest rates. â€œThe flaw in the Fed’s logic is that it views declining oil prices as temporary and not necessarily a reflection of a larger slowdown in the global economy. Forecasting is a difficult business, especially when it is about the future, but the reality is that neither I nor the Fed can accurately forecast whether price declines are permanent or temporary. Additionally, not even the Chinese government has an idea of how bad the economic slowdown could be â€” it was stunned by the stock-market crash, why should we expect it has a better handle on the Chinese economy?â€? Still Too Big to Fail. Simon Johnson argues that the Dodd-Frank law has not eliminated the risk in the financial industry. â€œThe only reasonable alternative is to make large, complex financial institutions smaller and less complex so that it is possible for them to fail under standard bankruptcy rules. This is the intent of Dodd-Frank. The FDIC has pushed hard in this direction, whereas the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has been less enthusiastic. But the law is the law, and it is time to implement it.â€? The employment-cost index, a broad measure of workersâ€™ wages and benefits, climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in the second quarter from the first quarter, theÂ Labor Department saidÂ Friday, the smallest quarterly gain since record keeping began in 1982. Uncertainty over the countryâ€™s future relationship with the eurozone sent Greek manufacturing into a tailspin in July, but that had little impact on other parts of the currency areaâ€™s economy, as Italian factories had their best month in more than four years . Brazil Posted a 9.3 billion Brazilian reais ($2.8 billion) primary deficit in June, up from 6.9 billion reais in May and bringing the 12-month deficit to 45.7 million reais, or 0.8% of gross domestic product, well off from this yearâ€™s target of a surplus of 0.15% of GDP. Canadaâ€™s economy shrank for a fifth straight month in May, weighed down by weak output in manufacturing, oil and gas extraction and wholesale trade and bolstering the view that Canada experienced a recession in the first half of 2015.
