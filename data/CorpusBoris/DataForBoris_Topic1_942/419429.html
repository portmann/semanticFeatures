Federal Reserves' Reliance On Unemployment Rate Could Be Misguided | Seeking Alpha Federal Reserve voting members have strongly hinted a quarter point rate increase is coming, so long as the unemployment rate stays steady. The U.S. economic data has diverged, with GDP signaling a very weak economy and the jobs situation report signaling a relatively healthy economy. Fed policy could throw the economy into a recession if they use the unemployment report as their key signal and it is somehow flawed. On Friday afternoon before Memorial Day weekend, Barron's reported that Fed Chair Janet Yellen stated : "It's appropriate," Yellen said, "for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time, and probably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate." She is now on board with the more hawkish members of the Federal Reserve Board who want to "normalize" policy and move away from the extraordinary accommodation of the last few years. Fed members have been giving speeches with a common theme that the unemployment number has moved back into a normal range of 5%, down from a Great Recession high of over 10%. Those on the Fed wanting to "normalize" policy have been handed a gift in the headline 5% unemployment number. But that number is based off of a very low participation rate when compared to the last three decades. Going all the way back to 1980 , the participation rate was never less than 63%, despite multiple recessions, until after the Great Recession when it finally fell below 63% in October of 2013. Does that seem normal? The participation rate is based off the total employable workforce 16 years of age and older. It includes retired people, and students, and homemakers. By adding 1% to the current participation rate of 62.8%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics would need to add 2,529,690 people to the unemployment rolls. This would push the headline unemployment number up to 6.5%, which is what economist would expect in a normal recession. Another odd bit of data in the jobs report that does not support a true 5% unemployment rate is the number of people who are self-employed. People who claim to be self-employed in incorporated businesses has held steady in the last few years at around 5.5 million. This despite the headline unemployment number dropping from over 10% down to the current 5%. More odd is the number of people claiming to be self-employed in unincorporated businesses has actually dropped by almost 1 million in the same time frame from over 10 million people to under 10 million people. It is unusual for the unemployment numbers to drop so dramatically and the number of people who are self-employed to actually decline. Has there been a shifting societal change in the last couple of years to push the participation rate below 63%? Or are the jobs just not there? That is the key question. Other economic indicators are not supporting the concept of a healthy economy. Fourth quarter 2015 GDP came in at a weak 1%. It was followed by first quarter 2016 GDP of .8%. Usually such weak economic growth does not correspond with the types of healthy employment number reported over the last few months. Other economic indicators outside of housing are supportive of the GDP reading on the economy and not the Employment Situation reading on the economy. "Normally," the Federal Reserve would not be looking to raise interest rates in such a weak environment. Janet Yellen is a very good economist and has been considered a dove on monetary policy. Is she caving to the more hawkish members of the Fed? Or is she throwing them a bone anticipating that the unemployment data will soon reflect what the GDP data is indicating and the data will push another interest rate increase off the table? Right now economists are left to guess. Barron's goes on to mention the JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) economics team just raised its potential recession forecast for the next 12 months up from 30% to 34%. They highlight the sharp slowdown in corporate profits in the GDP reports as a key indicator of economic weakness. Historically lower profits point to a slowdown in capital expenditures by businesses. If the Fed is misreading the economic situation and pulls the trigger on another rate increase, then the odds of a recession could be a lot higher than 34%. Despite recent market sentiment that banks could continue to do well even in a higher interest rate environment, banks would certainly not do well in a recessionary environment. Slack demand for loans and higher charge-offs would send bank stocks like JPMorgan lower. Hopefully Chair Yellen is just throwing the hawks a bone and has not succumb to pressure.
