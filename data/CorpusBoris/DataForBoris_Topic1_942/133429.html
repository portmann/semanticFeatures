Grand Central: Labor Data is at the Top of The Fedâ€™s Rate Hike Dashboard  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Brazil Central Bank Raises Benchmark Rate, Indicates Tightening to End One of the more important lines in the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy statement Wednesday was its description of the inflation outlook: â€œThe (Fed) expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate.â€? Fed officials want to be reasonably confident that inflation is on a path toward 2% when they start raising short-term interest rates. What will give them that reasonable confidence? It is implied in the above statement: Continued improvement in the jobs market and some stabilization of commodities and import prices. The line underscores the centrality of employment data in the Fedâ€™s thinking. It doesnâ€™t just inform officials on whether they are near meeting the full employment part of their mandate; it also informs their beliefs on getting inflation back to 2% after undershooting it for more than three years. A few more good jobs reports â€“ with continued payroll gains registered at 200,000 or more and further declines in the jobless rate â€“ could well get the Fed off the fence. Commodities and imports is a more complicated subject. Fed officials were prepared to look past earlier declines in commodities and import prices because they saw these declines as transitory. They gained some confidence that this judgment was correct earlier in the year when commodities prices stabilized. A recent downdraft in energy prices raises the question of whether they will look past it again should the drop continue. Chinaâ€™s stock market bust amplifies uncertainty about its growth outlook and raises the question of whether persistent downward pressure on global goods prices might be building. China is the worldâ€™s second largest economy and the shop-floor to the world â€“ a large consumer of commodities and producer of manufactured goods which the U.S. imports. Import prices have dropped in 11 of the past 12 months. Domestic conditions usually trump global disturbances in Fed models and in the minds of officials. U.S. labor data are at the top of its watch list. But commodities and the global setting are wildcards which could give Fed officials pause if a deepening shock overseas emerges. Fed Stays on Track to Raise Rates This Year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key interest rate near zero but cited progress in the U.S. job market, a sign it remains on course to raise interest rates in September or later this year. At the same time, the central bank flagged a nagging concern about low inflation, which is creating caution among officials and could convince them to delay the first interest-rate increase in the benchmark federal funds interest rate in nearly a decade. Parsing the Fed: How the July Statement Changed from June . House Panel Passes Fed Bill. The House Financial Services Committee approved a Federal Reserve overhaul bill Wednesday that would change the way the central bank does business. The bill would require the Fed to adopt a rule to determine where to set interest rates. It would require the Fed to disclose more details about bank street tests. And it would allow members of Congress to ask the Government Accountability Office to review the central bankâ€™s monetary policy decisions. BOJ Ishida Vigilant About Downside Risks To Japan Economy.Â A member of the Bank of Japan’s policy board sounded a vigilant note over the course of the economy Thursday amid lingering concerns about China’s slowing economy that could keep dragging on Japan’s exports and production. Â Lackluster exports and output are likely to have pushed down Japan’s growth rate considerably in the April-June quarter, with private economists predicting a contraction for that period after annualized 3.9% growth in the first quarter. “The focus is on whether the economy will get out of such doldrums and back onto a mild recovery path during and after the summer,” Koji Ishida told a meeting with business executives in Kyoto, western Japan. –Dow Jones Newswires. Lagarde: Creditors Increasingly See Greek Debt Restructuring as Inevitable. There is growing acceptance among Greeceâ€™s creditors a restructuring of the countryâ€™s debt is inevitable, the head of the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, but only if Greece takes ownership of the bailout program by passing tough budget cuts and deep economic overhauls. Both Greeceâ€™s commitment to a controversial bailout program and Europeâ€™s dedication to restructure the countryâ€™s debt are still questionable, keeping anÂ exit from the eurozone still on the table. Lagarde: Chinaâ€™s Economy can Withstand Market Turmoil. The IMF head backed Chinese efforts to stem recent market volatility and downplayed the signals that turbulence might be sending about the broader economy. Â LagardeÂ said no one should be surprised Beijing wants to prevent disorderly movements in markets. â€œThatâ€™s, after all, the duty of such authorities,â€? she said in an online press conference.

Ross Levine, Chen Lin and Wensi Xie ask whether stock markets can help economies during banking crises. â€œSome have argued that the stock market serves as a â€˜spare tireâ€™ during banking crises by providing an alternative corporate financing channel. This column examines the claim using data for 36 countries spanning 20 years. The findings support the three core predictions of the spare tire view, suggesting that countries can insulate parts of their economy from future banking crises by designing appropriate legal frameworks.â€? A Plan for the Next Euro Crisis. Christoph M. Schmidt says European leaders need to clean up their budgets and stop relying on the European Central Bank. â€œWith his pledge to do â€˜whatever it takesâ€™ to save the euro, ECB presidentÂ  Mario Draghi thrust the central bank into a gray area between monetary and fiscal policy. The ECBâ€™s ultralow interest rates and its program to purchase sovereign bonds have reduced the pressure on governments to balance their budgets by reducing the cost of funding deficits. Too many governments are now following that path instead of exploiting easy monetary conditions to cushion the effects of real budget reform.â€? To Fix the Fed, Simplify It. Peter Conti-Brown wants to change the role of regional bank presidents. â€œTheir presidents, who are chosen through a complicated and byzantine process that reflects regional economic interests, should no longer serve on the Federal Open Market Committee. Congress should let the Board of Governors appoint and remove the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, as they may do with other employees of the board. The 12 regional Feds would then become branch offices of our central bank, continuing to do research and data analysis, while leaving policy making to Washington.â€? Pending Home Sales Slip in June.

Falling Prices Were Boon For Eurozone Households. Â Real disposable income per capitaâ€“a measure of how much consumers have to spend on goods and servicesâ€“ jumped by 0.9% in the first quarter, the sharpest rise since the first quarter of 2009. Turkey’s central bank marginally raised its inflation forecast for 2015 on Thursday, retaining its projection for next year on the assumption the impact of the currency’s depreciation will be offset by a slowdown in food prices.Â ”Inflation is poised to slow down until September,” said Governor Erdem Basci during the presentation of the central bank’s quarterly inflation report in Ankara, adding that inflation may fluctuate during the rest of the year due to base effect–Dow Jones Newswires.
