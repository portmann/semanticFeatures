Top Japan Advisers Divided Over Further Monetary Easing - Real Time Economics - WSJ People are reflected in an electronic board displaying the Nikkei stock average in Tokyo Thursday. The Nikkei was at a 15-year high. Two of Japan’s biggest proponents of monetary easing are divided over whether further action is now necessary , as the country flirts with a return to falling prices two years after Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda pledged to generate 2% inflation by this time. The nation’s core consumer-price index, excluding the effects of a sales-tax increase last year, was flat in February from a year earlier , after peaking at 1.5% in April last year. The labor market, though, is the tightest in more than two decades. Koichi Hamada, a Yale University professor and economic adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said in an interview Friday that the BOJ must adapt to the unexpected drop in oil prices since mid-2014 and focus on the labor market, which should guide policy for now. The BOJ should take further action if the labor market weakens, he said. “We shouldn’t aim for 2%. This is a change in circumstances that no one, including the BOJ, could have expected when they set the inflation target,” he said. “Deflation is not as important as unemployment for our economic life, and unemployment is now easing quite quickly. Labor indicators are showing that wages will rise soon.” In Mr. Hamada’s current view, a 1% rise in the ‘core core’ consumer-price index–which excludes energy and food–would be enough to get households spending and improve the job market. This marks something of a shift in his view. In late 2012, he said he supported the newly elected Mr. Abe’s proposal for a 2%-3% inflation target. Another influential adviser to the Abe administration offered a different view. In an interview, ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Kozo Yamamoto said Thursday that any wavering by the BOJ over the 2% inflation target could further damp consumer sentiment and lead to selling of Japanese stocks by overseas investors. “The BOJ needs to aggressively commit to its inflation target and show its resolution,” he said. Mr. Yamamoto said the central bank should increase its asset-purchase program by Y10 trillion annually at its policy meeting April 30, up from Y80 trillion now, explaining that the BOJ’s preferred inflation gauge is likely to turn negative, while production and consumer sentiment remain tepid. Mr. Kuroda said Sunday that the bankâ€™s policies are having their â€œintended effects and the economy is making steady progress in conquering low inflation.â€? Â He told lawmakers in parliament Thursday that he believed 2% inflation would likely be reached between next March and the end of the first half of the fiscal year starting next April. He said the bank still committed to achieve the target as soon as possible.
