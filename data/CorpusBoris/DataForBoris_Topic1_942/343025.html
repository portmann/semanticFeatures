5 Things to Watch at the Fed Meeting - WSJ 5 Things to Watch at the Fed Meeting The Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this week, but the central bank’s read on the economy will shape expectations of what it will do next. The Fed releases its policy statement and economic and interest-rate projections at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, and Chairwoman Janet Yellen holds a news conference at 2:30 p.m. Here are five things to watch for. Fed officials usually say whether they are worried the economy will perform more poorly than expected, or whether they see a chance it will perform better. Officials dropped this so-called balance of risk assessment in the their January statement, an indication of uncertainty about when theyÂ will move rates again.Â Policy makers have expressed differing views on risks to the economic outlook in recent weeks. While economic growth and employment seem to be holding up, some officials aren’t convinced. Fed governor Lael Brainard last week warned that policy makers â€œshould not take the strength in the U.S. labor market and consumption for granted.â€? Inflation has run below the Fed’s 2% goal for nearly four years, but there has been some good news: The New York Fed reportedÂ MondayÂ that its February survey found consumers expected inflationÂ one year from now Â to be 2.7%, up from 2.4% in the January survey.Â Plus the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred gauge, rose 1.3% in January from the previous year, and so-called core inflationÂ was 1.7%. Nonetheless, other measures of expected inflation have been soft. It will be important to watch whether the Fed expresses heightened concern about soft inflation expectations. Officialsâ€™ projections for the fed-funds rate in the quarterly chart known as the â€œdot plotâ€? will beÂ scrutinized for clues about when the Fed will next raise rates.Â At their December meeting, officials implied there would be four quarter-percentage-point rate increases over the course of the year. Market expectations have thrown that projection into doubt.Â A recent Wall Street Journal survey of 64 business and academic economists found they expectÂ just two quarter-percentage-point increases this year, down from the three increases they predicted in December.Â The economists now overwhelmingly expect the Fed to next raise rates again inÂ June . Commodity prices remain low and overseas economies are weak, leading central banks in Europe and Japan to push rates into negative territory. Will global developments affectÂ the Fed’s forecast for the domestic economy? Watch the second paragraph of the postmeeting statement, which describes risk factors officials are watching, as well as updated economic projections for clues on whether earlier forecasts of steady growth and gradually rising inflation will hold up in the months ahead. Ms. Yellen is likely to keep her options open during her newsÂ conference. The central bank wants to be in a position to raise rates as early as April or June should the economic data strengthen, but it doesn’t want to commit to a path .Â Ms. Yellen likely will emphasize that improvement in the U.S. data has been very recent, after a period of volatility stemming from China’s slowdown, and she might express trepidation about low inflation. â€œA lot has happened sinceâ€? the December Fed meeting, Ms. Yellen told lawmakers in testimony last month . • You must enter the verification code below to send.
