Australia Holds Rates Amid Hopeful Signs  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Australia’s central bank left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday, as expected, while leaving the door open for a cut later in the year should the economy falter. The Reserve Bank of Australia, or RBA, kept the cash-rate target at a record-low 2.0%, where it has been since May. It has cut rates twice already this year in response to sharp falls in commodity prices, economic weakness and benign inflation. “The available information suggests the economy has continued to grow,” Gov. Glenn Stevens said in a statement accompanying the decision. “Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending.” With the official cash rate on hold again, the focus is on the degree of the easing bias in the RBA’s statement as an indication of what’s to come. Tuesday’s announcement was more implicit than explicit and suggested rates may stay on hold for the foreseeable future, said Jasmin Argyrou, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Still, she said the economy remained vulnerable to bad news that could quickly change the RBA’s thinking. Sean Callow, a currency strategist at Westpac, said the reserve bank had toned down its concern over a high Australian dollar, which has lately been weaker, recently hitting 6-year lows against the U.S. currency. Rather than saying the Aussie was likely to, and needed to, fall further, the bank made a more benign remark–saying the currency had been adjusting to lower commodity prices. Recent economic data has shown business conditions in Australia are improving, while unemployment has dropped slightly despite expectations of a rise. The Aussie’s pullback, meanwhile, has taken some pressure off exporters. Still, a downturn in investment in the resources sector is continuing to hurt the economy, and Australian firms overall seem reluctant to invest–prompting most economists to forecast lackluster growth in the year ahead. Mr. Stevens has warned that lower interest rates may spur further increases in house prices, already booming in Sydney and Melbourne with possible dangers for the wider economy. “The bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market,” he said.
