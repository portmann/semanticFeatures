Fed’s Williams Tells CNBC Not to Expect Warning of Coming Rate Hikes - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams told a television channel Monday that the U.S. central bank is unlikely to provide much warning ahead of an increase in short-term interest rates. Instead, the official told CNBC that officials will need to go into every policy meetings with an open mind. “We should be coming together every six weeks, discussing what the outlook looks like, and what the right appropriate policy decisions at that meeting are, and adjusting policy” accordingly, Mr. Williams said. The Fed needs “to get out of this business of telegraphing our decisions in advance” and make sure that monetary policy is truly driven by and responsive to incoming economic data. Mr. Williams said rate rises are “on the table at every meeting” but he would not suggest action is likely to happen at any particular point, although he did say a year from now he believes short-term rates will have moved up off of their current near zero levels. “You don’t want to make a decision three months in advance and announce that decision when you really have more time to collect data and make the most informed decision you can,” Mr. Williams said. The official also noted that he accepts that a lack of firm guidance from central bankers could generate more volatility in financial markets. “We don’t want to be adding noise,” but at the same time, “we don’t want to be absolutely eliminating all uncertainty about our future actions. It’s healthy for the future actions to be uncertain because future conditions can change,” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Williams made his comments to the television channel in the wake of the release of the April jobs report on Friday. That release, which showed robust hiring gains and a further drop in the unemployment rate, renewed hope that economic weakness seen at the start of the year is in fact temporary, and that the economy remains on track for respectable growth. The jobs data also helped keep alive the prospect of a central bank interest rate rise at some point this year. Fed officials have long argued that the conversation about raising interest rates off of their current near-zero levels begins with the mid-June policy meeting. By and large, Fed officials have offered little guidance about the exact timing of rate rises. Mr. Williams welcomed the strength of the April jobs data and said the report is “a positive sign that we have good momentum going into this year,” adding the weak first quarter appears to be “more an anomaly than a signal of where we are going.” U.S. Inflation Undershoots the Fedâ€™s 2% Target for the 35th Straight Month Fedâ€™s Evans Continues to Advocate for Early-2016 Rate Increase Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
