Fed Policy Makers Stay United For a Fourth Straight Meeting - Real Time Economics - WSJ The 10-0 vote by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee Â followed identical consensus at the January, March and April policy meetings. The Fed has avoided a formal dissent this year in its longest stretch of unanimity since 2011 . Going into this weekâ€™s meeting, two policy makers in particular were seen as potential dissenters. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker had leaned toward a June rate rise earlier in the year . Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is a staunch opponent of raising rates this year and was believed to be ready to dissent if the Fed got closer to a rate rise. That didnâ€™t happen, either. The votes of these two officials suggests hawks may be cautious about rates while taking stock of recent economic weakness, while doves are happy that the Fed hasnâ€™t taken much more of a step toward raising rates. More broadly, the unanimous vote suggests the central bank is in a holding pattern when it comes to deciding on rate rises.
