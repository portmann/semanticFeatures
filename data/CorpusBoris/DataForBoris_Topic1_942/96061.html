Grand Central: BOE Rate Outlook Tied to Magic Fairy Dust - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ask 10 economists whatâ€™s behind the striking decline in British productivity growth in the last eight years and youâ€™ll get 11 different answers. Some say firms hung on to workers during the downturn in anticipation of the eventual upturn. Others say the damage to the banking system and low interest rates tied up scarce capital in unproductive firms. Others say itâ€™s all the fault of dwindling North Sea oil production. Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of Englandâ€™s deputy governor for financial stability, suggested in a speech on Monday that part of the explanation is the U.K. might be missing some magic fairy dust. Mr. Cunliffe was being serious. He was referring to total factor productivity, a fancy term for the mysterious component of productivity growth that remains once youâ€™ve accounted for gains in the efficiency of labor and capital. Whether it is innovation, human knowledge or animal spirits, this intangible dynamism can be a significant driver of productivity Â growth, which in turn boosts an economyâ€™s potential and propels living standards higher. Since it is hard to define, economists sometimes refer to it as fairy dust, or â€œpixie dust.â€? It also appears to be lacking in the U.K. right now. A paper by Bank of England staff published Tuesday found the decline in total factor productivity growth since the crisis offers a better explanation for U.K. productivity weakness than the theory that a broken banking system hasnâ€™t been reallocating capital properly. The upshot is that BOE officials still arenâ€™t sure whatâ€™s behind the U.K.â€™s woeful productivity, which is now some 15% lower than it would have been had it continued to grow at its precrisis trend. Mr. Cunliffe said the puzzle may never be solved, noting that economists are still arguing over the explanation for the industrial revolution. The BOE has been waiting for a productivity revival for a while now, to help keep a lid on inflation as growth accelerates and unemployment tumbles. If it doesnâ€™t recover, interest rates may need to rise sooner and faster than officials would like. So the future course of U.K. monetary policy may be determined by whether firms remember what they did with the fairy dust. Powell: Rate Rise by September. Federal Reserve GovernorÂ Jerome PowellÂ said he expects the U.S. central bank to begin raising short-term interest rates in September, with a second rate increase coming in December . â€œIf my forecast for the economy were to be realizedâ€”and that forecast includes significantly stronger growth than we realized in the first quarter of the year, continued progress in the labor market and a greater basis for confidence that inflation is returning to [the Fedâ€™s] 2% goal over the medium termâ€”if those things were realized, I feel thatâ€¦it will be time as soon as, potentially as soon as September,â€? Mr. Powell said Tuesday atÂ  an event hosted by The Wall Street Journal . Powell: Financial Regulation May Contribute to Decline in Bond-Market Liquidity . Divisions Remain as Eurozone Finance Ministers Meet Over Greece Deal. Significant divisions remain between Greece and its international creditors over measures Athens must implement before receiving desperately needed bailout aid, according to a document seen by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday ahead of a crucial meeting of eurozone finance ministers. ECB Keeps ELA Unchanged for Greece Wednesday.Â The European Central Bank kept lending to Greek banks unchanged Wednesday at nearly 89 billion euros ($100 billion) under an emergency program, according to a person familiar with the matter, as deposit outflows stabilized amid heightened expectations that Athens will strike a deal with its creditors to unlock bailout funds–Dow Jones Newswires. Foreign Reserves Slip in Emerging Markets, Raising Risks. Â Central banks in emerging markets are running down their foreign-currency reserves at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, reducing some countriesâ€™ capacity to weather potential shocks , such as a rate increase in the U.S.. Turkish Central Bank Holds Interest Rates. Turkeyâ€™s central bank held interest rates steady for the fourth consecutive month on Tuesday on a deteriorating inflation outlook and a weakening currency, with domestic political uncertainty also a factor afterÂ recent parliamentary elections. Bulgariaâ€™s Central Bank Governor Resigns. Bulgariaâ€™s central bank governor resigned on Tuesday, as the poorest country in the European Union slowlyÂ recovers from a banking crisis and remains vulnerable to developments in neighboring Greece. Ivan Iskrov,Â who spent 12 years at the helm of the Bulgarian National Bank, said in a letter to Parliament that he will step down on July 10, three months before his term expires in October. In June last year the countryâ€™s fourth largest bank was closed after reports that its main shareholder was embezzling funds from the lender prompted a bank run, which later spread to a second lender. The central bank was widely blamed for mishandling the crisis and Mr. IskrovÂ offered to resign in JulyÂ last year but later backtracked. Low Interest Rates Are Threat to Pension Funds, Life Insurers, Says OECD. Â The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned on Wednesday that prolonged low interest rates fueled by central banksâ€™ quantitative easing pose a serious threat to the solvency of pension funds and life insurers that could send ripples through the global financial system. Nepalâ€™s Economy Struggles to Recover from Quake. Powerful quakes in AprilÂ and MayÂ killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal and injured 22,000 more. They also threatened to undo years of economic gains in the Himalayan nation, which was still poorer, per capita, than Haiti and Burkina Faso before the quakes. Nepal said the quakes will have knocked 1.6 percentage points off economic growth in the year ending in mid-July. The disaster is also expected to push an additional 700,000 Nepalese below the national poverty lineâ€”around $200 a yearâ€” before mid-2016 . Baby Boomers in Multifamily Homes. The Kansas City Fedâ€™s Jordan Rappaport says baby boomers will replace millenials as the main driver of multifamily home construction in the years ahead. â€œAs the senior population swellsâ€”and more seniors downsize to multifamily unitsâ€”multifamily home construction will increase strongly for many years,â€? he writes. Swiss Quantitative Easing. In a San Francisco Fed paper , Jens H.E. Christensen and Signe Krogstrup examine a 2011 quantitative easing program undertaken by the Swiss National Bank. The bank only bought short-term bonds but the yields on long-term bonds also fell. â€œUsing a dynamic model of the yield curve, we break down the real-time response of Swiss government bond yields into expectations about future short-term interest rates and term premiums. We find that the declines in long-term yields following the SNB announcements reflect reduced term premiums in Swiss bond markets. Since the program did not include any purchases of long-term securities, these findings suggest that an expansion of bank reserves achieved by acquiring short-term assets can give rise to a reserve-induced portfolio balance effect on long-term yields. This is a lesson that seems especially relevant for the European Central Bank and its ongoing QE program,â€? they conclude. Ready for Change? Analysts atÂ KPMG InternationalÂ have developed annual country indexes that try to be forward-looking .Â  TheÂ Change Readiness IndexesÂ are designed to focus how well each nation is positioned to adjust to coming change, whether it is a sudden event like a tsunami or a slow-moving structural shift like an aging population. How to Prod the Recovery. In the Journal, Edward P. Lazear makes the case for business-friendly state economic devilment policy. â€œEmployment, state GDP, labor-law and tax data from 2000 to the present yield two strong lessons. First, a business-friendly climateâ€”market-oriented labor policies and lower taxesâ€”is effective in raising the growth in a stateâ€™s gross domestic product and employment. Second, states that suffered the worst employment shocks in the 2007-09 recession had the most rapid postrecession employment growth. This suggests that the weak national recovery cannot be explained by the depth of the recession.â€? Good Time to End QE. Mark Gilbert of Bloomberg View argues that the ECBâ€™s purchase of government bonds has become â€œa redundancyâ€? because of strengthening conditions. â€œTheÂ euro region’s economyÂ has recently been gathering a head of steam. And withÂ GreeceÂ closer to reaching a deal on renewing its aid package than at any time since electing a new government five months ago, the threat of a euro break-up as a brake onÂ business and consumer confidence Â  looks set to evaporate,â€? he writes. Revisiting the â€œHard ECU.â€? Writing in the Journal, John Phelan says an early British monetary proposal, the European Currency Unit, to which European currencies would have been pegged, and argues that it might have spared Europe some of its recent headaches. â€œHad leaders in what is now the eurozone taken a more cautious approach to monetary cooperation, they might have avoided the worst of the crises now roiling the regionâ€”a reality that should shape expectations as the Continent tries to recover from recent shocks.â€? Durable Goods Down 1.8%. Demand for big-ticket manufactured goods fell for the third time in four months in May, suggesting that business investment remains subdued . New Home Sales Up. Sales of newly built homes rose 2.2% in May to the highest level since the recession, another sign the housing market is building steam after years of sluggish progress. Bank Indonesia said Wednesday it has raised the amount commercial banks can lend for property and vehicle purchases, as it seeks to kickstart an economy that grew at its slowest pace in more than five years. Under the new regulations enacted on June 18, banks can loan up to 80% of the price of a house with a maximum size of 70 square meters, up from 70%, for first-time home buyers. The maximum loan for second-home purchases has been increased to 70% from 60%, and to 60% from 50% for third-time buyers–Dow Jones Newswires. SIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox .
