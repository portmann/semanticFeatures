5 Things to Watch for in the Fed Minutes - WSJ Federal Reserve officials entered their March 15-16 policy meeting with a more downbeat forecast on the economy and said they likely wouldnâ€™t raise short-term interest rates this year as much as they had previously anticipated.Â After lifting rates by a quarter of a percentage point in December, the Fed has held them steady since. The minutes of their gathering, due outÂ WednesdayÂ atÂ 2 p.m. EDT, should shed more light on their discussions about soft global growth, financial-market volatility and the likely path of rates. The minutes will reveal more details on Fed officialsâ€™ latest economic and interest-rate projections , including charts quantifying their uncertainty about the forecasts.Â Pay particular attention to whether policy makers shift their perspective on risks to growth. DoÂ most view them as broadly balanced, or perhaps weighted to the downside? This point is relevant becauseÂ the statements released after the January and March meetings didn’tÂ say how Fed officialsÂ judged the balance of risks to the outlook. The statements flagged global economic and financial developments broadly, which suggests officials couldn’t agree on how those developments will play out for U.S. growth and inflation.Â  The minutes could offer a window on the Fed’s deliberations about slowing global economic growth. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen elaborated further on these themes during a speech last week, when she also advocated policy makers “proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.”Â Chinaâ€™s economic slowdown and the oil-price collapse could be talking points in the March minutes. So could monetary policy in other countries and the impact on exchange rates. Days before the Fed’s March meeting, the European Central Bank announced a series of rate cuts, additional bond purchases and ultracheap loans for banks. In January,Â Japanâ€™s central bank set the countryâ€™s first negative interest rates in an attempt to stave offÂ deflation.Â  Inflation has undershot the Fedâ€™s 2% annual target for nearly four years. In March, officials slightly lowered their median estimate for so-called core inflation for 2017 from their December projection. Core inflation readings have nudged higher recently. The minutes could shed light on the Fedâ€™s internal debate over the inflation outlook, which will be a key factor in interest-rate decisions. The Fed in March lowered its expectation for rate rises this year, to a total increase of half of a percentage point from the full percentage point projected in December. This brought the central bank more into line with investors’ thinking. The minutes could offer insight into how stock-market volatility earlier this year informed policy makers’ discussions and theÂ role big swings in asset pricesÂ played in the decision to dial back the pace of rate increases.Â  Kansas City Fed President Esther George cast the lone dissenting vote at the March meeting because she preferred to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point. The minutes could offer more detail on her decision and whether other officials who couldn’tÂ vote shared her view. Investors and analysts will be keen to assess how much support Ms. Yellen has this year among voting members, though the minutes wonâ€™t identify individual officials by name. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
