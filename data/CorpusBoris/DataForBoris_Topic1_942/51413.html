Fedâ€™s Lockhart Still Sees Rate Rise in Coming Months, Data Permitting - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said Wednesday he remains hopeful the U.S. central bank can raise rates at some point in the next few months, but he needs to be sure that weakness at the start of the year proves temporary. When it comes to lifting rates off of near zero levels, â€œall meetings are in playâ€¦including June,â€? Mr. Lockhart told reporters after a speech in Baton Rouge, La. â€œIâ€™m still of the view that the conditions will be appropriate in the middle of the year, which we are getting closer to,â€? he said, in his first public comments since last weekâ€™s monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Mr. Lockhart noted that markets are also shifting toward what he thinks the likely path of rates will be after a period of disconnection between investor and official outlooks. â€œIâ€™ve noticed recently that probabilities as reflected in forward markets, or futures markets for fed funds, seem to have moved from December toward September. I think thatâ€™s a reasonable alignment with what I think to be the likely policy outlookâ€? for short-term rates, he said. But to get to higher rates, Mr. Lockhart said he needs to be sure that the unexpectedly weak levels of growth that started the year donâ€™t persist. To that end, he said Fridayâ€™s release of the April jobs data will be very important to gauge economic momentum in the second quarter. More weakness, coming on the back of Marchâ€™s soft hiring gains, wouldn’t be definitive to the outlook, but it would be a worrisome signal, Mr. Lockhart told reporters. Then, policymakers kept short-term interest rates steady while acknowledging weakness over the start of the year. While Fed officials collectively believe first-quarter weakness wonâ€™t carry forward, many central bank watchers believe the timing of interest-rate increases has moved back until later in the year. Most Fed officials have long agreed it would be very likely rates would rise this year, but some have signaled more uncertainty on that front in recent weeks. That said, several Fed officials reminded markets on Friday that rate rises are on the table at every Fed meeting this year starting with the gathering scheduled for mid-June. Mr. Lockhart is widely looked to as a reliable guide for the FOMC consensus outlook. The policymaker noted in his speech that officials will be under considerable pressures over coming months. In his speech, he said â€œthe incoming data over the, quite literally, coming days, weeks, and near-term months must be intensely watched and carefully interpreted,â€? he said. â€œFor policymaking purposes, the relevant timeframe has been foreshortenedâ€? when it comes to deciding on interest rates. Much of the officialâ€™s speech was devoted to making sense of the economy at the start of the year. â€œWeâ€™ve seen this movie before. Itâ€™s a pattern weâ€™ve seen over the years of the recovery,â€? Mr. Lockhart said in his speech. â€œI believe the underlying fundamentals are strong enough to propel the economy along a growth path that delivers a bounce-back in the second quarter followed by a resumption of a pace of growth between 2.5 and 3%,â€? he said. If that happens, â€œI expect to see further progress toward full employment and movement higher toward a healthier rate of inflation around 2%,â€? Mr. Lockhart said. Mr. Lockhart said in his remarks the evidence suggests the weak start to the year wonâ€™t last. He said bad winter weather over much of the country likely shaved half a percentage point off first quarter growth, which was reported last week at a very tepid 0.2% rise. Meanwhile, the strong dollar has lowered exports, and the collapse in oil prices had a big effect on investment levels. He said oil-related forces appear to have trimmed three-fourths of a percentage point off first-quarter growth. Exports will like be a drag on growth over much of the year, Mr. Lockhart said. But if oil and the dollar can remain stable, that could â€œcould dilute somewhat what would otherwise be drags on the economy in the near term.â€? Mr. Lockhart also said he wasnâ€™t worried about any major sense of excess in financial markets. Noting â€œstrongâ€? stock markets, he said â€œI have a lot of confidence that normally markets correct, and they correct themselves. So I donâ€™t at this moment have reason to be intensely concerned about valuation level of the equity markets.â€?
