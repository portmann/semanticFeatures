The Parody Of Errors That Led To Grexit | Seeking Alpha Now that Greece's exit from the eurozone seems all but a foregone conclusion, we look back at whether this could have been averted. What shows is not only a parody of errors on both sides, but also the severe constraints of the euro itself. The initial fallout of Grexit will probably be limited mostly to Greece itself, but over time things could become much more serious. Greece is in such a mess, but in fact it isn't the only eurozone country suffering from economic problems, although it's by far the most serious situation out there. How did we ever get this far? We'll provide a quick summary. The original sin, so to speak, was in Greek public finances. With hindsight we have to other candidates here, the mistake to let Greece in and what we will describe as the cardinal sin, the creation of EMU, European Monetary Union, in the first place. We have to stress that Greece is basically alone here, the public finances of Spain and Ireland were sound (both had low public debt and a surplus on the public budget on the event of the financial crisis). Italy had a high debt but not a high deficit, and high domestic savings. That is why the crisis is often mischaracterized and misunderstood. At heart, it isn't a sovereign debt problem. Greece is the exception, not the rule. In October 2009, the then Greek government under Papandreou revealed that the Greek deficit was 12% of GDP, not 6% as previously assumed. While partly the result of the financial crisis (deficits were exploding everywhere), there was also a good deal of previously creative bookkeeping to blame. This led to a cascading of events, from ratcheting up interest rates to credit downgrades, to the first Greek bailout of 110 billion euros in May 2010. But before we'll get to that, first another blunder, the missed opportunities. The creation of EMU removed the exchange rate risk and (supposedly) put monetary policy in the periphery on a sound (Teutonic) footing. The result of this is that investors, well in advance of the introduction of the euro, started to consider peripheral debt almost as good as German debt, and interest rate spreads basically collapsed everywhere. A wave of money entered the periphery, suddenly their balance of payment constraint seemed to have melted. However, this embarrassment of riches was mostly squandered. In Spain and Ireland, huge construction booms, that turned into bubbles, ensued. In Greece, apart from the wonderful 2004 Olympic Games, the money basically disappeared into the black hole of the state apparatus, kept out of sight by the peculiar concept of Greek bookkeeping. This was at the same time when in Germany they were introducing labor market reforms and wages were rather restrained, resulting in the following development: The fact that the whole EMU area (eurozone) now had a single one-size-fits-nobody interest rate that was too low for the periphery (mainly because Germany was struggling), reinforcing the boom in the periphery. To understand Merkel's policies, it is worth turning back the clock to 2003. She had only been head of her party for three years and was in the midst of writing a new agenda for the CDU. There were four-and-a-half million unemployed in Germany, social security coffers were empty and employers were groaning about an excessively high tax burden. Germany wasn't nearly as badly off as Greece is today, but it was in urgent need of restructuring, and Merkel began to prescribe a strict reform program for the country. The McKinsey management-consulting firm provided the numbers to support her bitter message of austerity. [ Der Spiegel ] The next blunder was to give Greek debt a haircut without a proper firewall in place. The haircut ended, once and for all, the idea that eurozone sovereign debt is risk free, that is, without principal risk. The effects were rather predictable and can be seen in the graph above. Interest rates started to diverge strongly, as they were pricing in this new principal risk. The results were a series of absolutely devastating self-reinforcing feedback loops: Capital was fleeing the periphery, producing a strong monetary contraction. In a flexible exchange rate, money cannot really leave a country (even if people sell its country's assets, they also sell the currency to buyers which will ultimately buy assets. The process is likely to engineer a depreciation of the process which is actually reflationary), but in a currency union the euros can go anywhere, bleeding parts of the periphery dry. Destroying bank balance sheets. Banks were the main holders of their respective countries sovereign debt and already reeling from the financial crisis. This created the need for bank bailouts (in Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and most of all Ireland) and the effects on public finances created a vicious feedback loop where banks and sovereign debt were caught in a deadly spiral downwards. The resulting higher bond yields itself worsened public finances and set in motion another feedback loop where rising interest rates would create insolvency, the prospect of which led to large scale selling of sovereign bonds and brought these higher interest rates about (without a lender of last resort bond markets can suffer from what economist call 'multiple equilibriumsa'). The third, and to some extent the second problem were basically solved by Draghi's 2012 "doing whatever it takes," that is, the ECB finally assuming the role of any other central bank, that of lender of last resort. For some time, tranquility returned and the acute phase of the eurocrisis seemed to be over. When a country has economic problems and the IMF is called in, they usually argue for budget cuts, the deflationary effects of which are offset by monetary stimulus (lower interest rates) and/or a devaluation and often some form of debt relief. The Troika (ECB, EU, IMF) recipe for the periphery consisted of the budget cuts without any of these offsetting measures. Of course, devaluation and lower interest rates (at least locally) are not possible within a currency union. If one might think that the periphery was already enjoying low interest rates (as the ECB rate is 0.5%) or even basking in the glory of the ECB's QE policy, then think again. We've just explained above that parts of a currency union can be bled dry whatever the rates. Monetary conditions in much of the periphery have been tight, not loose. Add to that the Greek deposit flight and you get a barren land without money. Until recently only the ECB could recycle some of it back but that has been limited and the result is complete asphyxiation. The results of the Troika recipe have been an unmitigated disaster. The austerity imposed on Greece has been brutal, and the results entirely self-defeating. High debt/GDP ratios are usually dealt with by a combination of nominal GDP growth (growing the denominator through real growth and mild inflation) and a primary surplus (budget surplus minus debt servicing). What you get when you force countries in a currency union, that is, without the offsetting reflationary tools (monetary, currency), the effects are counterproductive as nominal GDP sinks faster than the deficit is reduced. Here is Krugman : it suggests that a 1-point rise in the primary surplus, which requires austerity that causes a 3-point fall in real GDP, will reduce inflation by about 0.7 percentage points (3*0.23). And if you start with debt of 170% of GDP, this raises the debt ratio by more than a percentage point each year. That is, the attempt to reduce debt by slashing spending actually raises the ratio of debt to GDP, not just in the short run, but indefinitely. If you think Greece hasn't done any austerity, think again: The result: a 1930s style slump, contracting over 25% in five years, unemployment over 25%, youth unemployment over 50%, most wages and pensions cut by tens of a percentage point. How could the Troika have imposed such counterproductive policies on Greece? Well, the IMF was rather surprised as well, see the difference between the growth rate they expected on the basis of their program, and the actual outcome: To bring matters really home, Greece would have an enormous surplus if the economy was anywhere near capacity: So Greece needs growth and their public finances will automatically restore. Instead, the Troika still insists on austerity, it even seems to have doubled down on it this week: Instead they were confronted with a text from the creditors that upped the ante, demanding a rise in VAT on tourist hotels from 7% (de facto) to 23% at a single stroke. Creditors insisted on further pension cuts of 1% of GDP by next year and a phase out of welfare assistance (EKAS) for poorer pensioners, even though pensions have already been cut by 44%. They insisted on fiscal tightening equal to 2% of GDP in an economy reeling from six years of depression and devastating hysteresis . [ The Telegraph ] After the austerity blunder this is probably the one that will be the nail in the coffin of Greece's EMU membership. While the IMF has argued for more debt relief for Greece, the Germans are not having any of it. Here is Mrs. Merkel on Tuesday: Mrs. Merkel also stresses that there can be no question of a "debt haircut" for Greece, saying it would be illegal under the EU treaty. [ BBC ] We'll leave the legal argument for what it is, there are other arguments at play here. First there is that IMF report that argued that the EU may need to take losses of 53 billion euros (a 30% haircut) and come up with 52 billion euro of new money to have any chance to make the Greek debt situation sustainable. In 2012, the IMF obtained a promise from the Europeans to take Greece's debt levels substantially below the level of 110% of GDP by 2022. But this commitment was never kept, and Greek debt these days is close to 180% of economic output. [ Business Insider ] An internal review in 2013 would conclude that the IMF should have pushed earlier for a restructuring of Greece's debt, which would have eased austerity and limited the economy's contraction. As it turned out, Greece plunged into a much deeper recession than anticipated, with unemployment surging to about 25% in 2012. The IMF now recognizes that an earlier restructuring of Greece's debt would have helped the country's recovery, said a person familiar with the fund's program in Greece. IMF officials also accept that their assumptions underestimated the extent to which spending cuts would impede growth, according to the person, who asked not to be identified. [ Bloomberg ] Then we have the really remarkable fact (from Reuters ) that eurozone countries actually tried to stop the IMF publishing the report! Why do the Europeans insist on Greece paying back all its debt while almost everybody agrees that this is impossible? Two things. If we start with Greece, other countries could very well go to the IMF to assess the sustainability of their debt situation, and due to the grinding denominator effect (low or even negative nominal growth, without much recourse to ways to reflate within the euro), these aren't all that much better (as we have argued here ). The Germans fretted that Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission's president, might be too amenable to Tsipras. When Juncker had met the newly-elected Tsipras in February, he had greeted him with a kiss and led him off by the hand to a meeting. One senior German official joked: "If Juncker could decide for himself, we would have a pure financial transfer (of money from Germany and other countries) to Greece for the next 10 years." [ Business Insider ] The eurozone lacks the automatic transfer that makes the US a much better currency union, where the Federal state automatically transfers money from booming to busting states. There is no such thing in the eurozone, all transfers have to be made explicit, which makes them instantly problematic: German Chancellor Angela Merkel will take pains to appear she is extending an olive branch to Greece, but she has little room to negotiate after Greeks voted "no" on economic austerity, former Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said Monday. "Ultimately, people report to their own people, and [Merkel] has to be supported by the German parliament and the German people," Fisher told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "There is a limit of tolerance, and she knows what that limit is." [ CNBC ] The limits of that have been reached. One can explain to the Germans that they have greatly profited from the euro as their current account has gone from zero at the start to a ridiculously high surplus of 7% of GDP today as they've baked in competitiveness, but to no avail. One could explain that if Germany would have kept the DM, it would have long ago gone up and Germany would not have had the export success it has enjoyed, but they, as the Dutch, the Finns, the Austrians, etc. simply do not want to bailout the Greeks again. And there Greece is, it cannot devalue, it cannot embark on monetary reflation, there is no automatic transfer as in a full currency union like the US, it is mostly a sitting duck. It could be much better without the euro, although the way out is fraught with banana peels and hardship. And here we arrive at the original sin, the cardinal one. A currency union that is a half-baked system, rendering many countries powerless to improve their economic situation all that much, grinding their debt/GDP ratios ever higher in the process, even countries like Finland . We have explained its many imperfections and dysfunctionalities ( here ). Is it capable of reform? Well, it would have long gone if not for Draghi claiming lender of last resort status for the ECB and forcing that through the ECB council, but the reforms necessary for a full working monetary union (a full banking union and transfers and/or debt socialization) is, in all likelihood, several steps too far. The unraveling has begun with Greece leaving. While the disruption will impose very large cost on Europe, this is perhaps a good thing, as the euro will simply produce other crisis and its member states are largely bereft of tools to deal with them. This is simple and we have said that before. The Greeks are at fault for cooking the books and doing little reform. The Troika is at fault for insisting, even now, on death spiral austerity and resisting any debt relief. The solution is also simple. Force Greece to reform, go easy on the austerity and give them debt relief. Why isn't this happening, well, because of this: RBS puts the direct financial losses for the eurozone from a Greek default at €227bn, compared with €140bn if they bite the bullet on an IMF-style debt restructuring. [ The Telegraph ] But with the Troika (minus IMF) unwilling to consider debt relief which would provide room for easier austerity and more growth, doubling down on austerity instead this week, there seems little hope of getting here and the time is basically up. With a Greek bankruptcy and exit from the euro, other member states will take a big hit on the debt. The ECB system (ELA, Target 2) and the IMF will also be hit and there will be considerable economic fall-out. The eurozone will no longer seem irreversible which could very well lead to higher interest rates in other peripheral countries, worsening their already very shaky debt sustainability further. In any case, any new business cycle downturn or crisis will accelerate that, and if Greece could do an Argentina 2002-2008, other countries might actually want to leave and perhaps that is a good thing. The euro has been a disaster only kept together because of the unknown consequences of a breakup. That's simply not good enough.
