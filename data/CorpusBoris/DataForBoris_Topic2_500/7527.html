Cross posted from New Economic Perspectives Just as every Spring we can count on the Peter G. Peterson Foundation (PGPF) to do a supportive press release when the CBO issues one of its budget outlook 10 year projection reports, we can also count on being treated to public statements by Maya MacGuineas joining in the Peterson Army choir, warning about the coming debt crisis, and singing about the glories of deficit and debt reduction. And this while completely ignoring the real and sad consequences of deficit and debt reduction policies throughout the world since the crash of 2008, as well as previous applications to Latin American, Asian, and the nations of the disintegrated soviet empire, most notably Russia itself. Letâ€™s look at Maya MacGuineas latest effort; her testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. She begins by identifying herself as president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) and head of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, which she describes as â€œnon-partisanâ€? organizations â€œ. . . dedicated to educating the public about and working with policy makers on fiscal policy issues.â€? She then emphasizes that the Boards of her two organizations include past directors and chairs of various agencies within the Executive Branch and Congress, and leaders from business, government, policy and academia. I know these types of introductions are standard for people testifying in front of Congress, and that there is nothing out of the ordinary in presenting them. But, perhaps, we should occasionally ask what they mean from the viewpoint of what theyâ€™re intended to convey which is the authority and credibility of the person testifying on the subject she/he has been called upon to testify. So, my point is that what I see in these organizations is a lengthy list of individuals who have previously performed with what passes for success in governments and large organizations, but I also see that many of have them have been influential throughout a period when the United States became a place characterized by increasing extremes of inequality, due to their unfailing support for private and public partnerships, along with increasing subordination of the public sector to private sector business interests. I also donâ€™t see a diversity of viewpoints in this group with respect to ideas about federal budgeting and public finance. All I see are partisans, here, not partisans of the Republican vs. Democratic variety; but a partisanship of deficit/debt reduction vs. public purpose as the goal of fiscal policy. The supporters of CRFB and Fix the Debt are all on the side of deficit/debt reduction regardless of the consequences for most of the American people, and so since Maya MacGuineas represents them and particularly Peter G. Peterson, Iâ€™m afraid, the only expectation one can have is that she is a representative of that view, the view of neo-liberalism and the Washington Consensus, and not a neutral witness at all. So, Maya MacGuineas, as a partisan spokesperson for the groups and interests she represents and the correctness of the Washington Consensus made a number of primary points. 1. Our deficit and debt problems are far from solved 2. Having a fiscal goal is a key part of budgeting 3. There are many advantages to getting the debt to more manageable levels First, she assumes that the current level of US debt and the projections made by CBO show a problem both with the debt level and the level of the debt-to-GDP ratio. She presents the usual frightening numbers to show that this is true. However, I donâ€™t agree that there is any economic or financial debt level problem at all, provided only that the United States retains its present monetary regime of a non-convertible fiat currency, with a floating exchange rate, and no debts owed in any foreign currency. Thatâ€™s because for such a currency issuer, whatever debt level exists and falls due at any point, that debt can always be repaid because it is denominated in the currency the debtor nation can issue at will. All repayment takes then, is the willingness of the issuer to issue the money needed and to use it to repay the debt due. Insofar as one may say that the US has a debt problem of any kind, that problem is one of politics created by people who keep repeating misinformation about the US public debt causing financial insolvency, if we allow it to grow any higher than it, or at least the debt-to-GDP ratio is now. That kind of insolvency canâ€™t happen to the US because, in the end, there are no international or domestic constraints on our ability to create money to spend on repaying what we owe. We can see this if we look the at the situation from a simple accounting perspective of assets vs. liabilities. The US government has many valuable financial assets, which, by the way, deficit hawks like Maya MacGuineas never talk about and compare to US liabilities, and among them the most valuable financial asset is its constitutional authority to create money whose financial value it can specify at will (which under present legislation is delegated to the Federal Reserve System and its member banks, and to the Treasury). Now, how much is that asset worth compared to whatever level of debt is in question? What is the value of the federal money debt to federal money asset ratio, when the denominator of that ratio, is, in effect, infinity? From where I sit that value always = zero, whatever the level of debt may be at any point. So, there can never be any diminution or increase in the capacity of a fiat sovereign government like the US government to repay its debt instruments regardless how small or large the principal value of those debt instruments is. Whether that value is $50 million or $50 quadrillion the value of the federal money asset ratio is still zero. Itâ€™s also true that if no level of debt can represent a financial problem for a sovereign, itâ€™s also true that no debt-to-GDP ratio can be a problem. But Maya MacGuineas states both that â€œhaving a fiscal goal is a key part of budgeting,â€? and also that â€œ. . . the most important metric of a countryâ€™s fiscal health is its debtâ€?toâ€?GDP ratio.â€? And that means that she must view that metric as measuring progress towards the fiscal goal she favors, namely a balanced budget or at least a minimum level deficit. But, surely, a fiscal goal whose metric may indicate no improvement or worsening with respect to improving oneâ€™s fiscal condition, has to be a meaningless fiscal goal accompanied by a meaningless metric. And the truth is that for fiat sovereigns like the US the fiscal goal of a balanced budget has no obvious interpretation as something desirable, improving our fiscal condition. Of course, one can claim that running a balanced budget can increase government solvency the more it is done. But in fiat sovereigns like the United States, the goal of solvency has already been reached, since for reasons given above degree of solvency does not vary with the level of US debt, or with the level of the debt-to-GDP ratio. And since solvency is always there, then all that remains is to go beyond it to fiscal goals that are meaningful to people. I think the fiscal goal that ought to replace either increased fiscal solvency or balanced budgets in nations like the United States is â€œpublic purpose.â€? Of course, â€œpublic purposeâ€? is an abstract notion and measuring it will require a complex set of social indicators. Any single metric of whether fiscal policy is bringing us closer or further away from public purpose will certainly distort reality. However, fiscal metrics have to be dictated by proper fiscal goals. So, the goals must come first and the metrics problem solved later. Also, Maya MacGuineasâ€™s opposition to deficits is based on her identification of high and rising deficits with rising debt. But, there is no necessary connection between the two. The deficit is the current negative value of the gap between federal tax revenue and federal spending; while deficits are financed through the sale of debt instruments subject to the limit. So the identification has been correct, in terms of current practice. But it is not mandated by current law, which allows deficits to be financed by the Treasury using platinum coin seignorage (HVPCS). Iâ€™ve explained the details in my e-book, along with background and history of the proposal, its theoretical context, and addressed a variety of objections in the legal, economic, political, and institutional, categories. Maya MacGuineas next goes through â€œadvantagesâ€? of bringing the national debt down to â€œa more manageable level.â€? She believes that lower public debt will produce: greater investment and economic growth; higher income and wages, lower interest rates, declining government interest payments, thus freeing up resources, increased ability to respond to problems, and reduced risk of fiscal crisis. I could take the time to go into detail about how silly each of her arguments are on each of these. However Iâ€™ll content myself with the following quick points. First, if the debt really produces these results, then the remedy is just not to issue is anymore and pay off the old debt with seigniorage, while funding new deficits the same way, Second, if economies grow faster when deficits are reduced, then why is it that both in fiat sovereign and non-fiat sovereign nations, alike, we always see government cutbacks associated with recessions and depressions after the cutbacks occur? Where is the empirical evidence that, in the absence of bank-blown credit bubbles which we saw in the US towards the end of the Clinton and Bush 43 Administrations, economies grow faster when deficits are reduced? Third, if thereâ€™s no evidence that there is faster economic growth when government is cut, then how can one argue that wages will rise due to this non-existent growth? Fourth, I agree that government cutbacks might produce lower interest rates, but only because the downturns resulting from the cutbacks would persuade central banks to keep those rates down. Fifth, declining government interest payments doesnâ€™t free up resources. It just adds financial contributions to the non-government sector from the government sector. Sixth, cutting back on federal borrowing wonâ€™t increase the governmentâ€™s ability to respond to problems, because the â€œcrowding outâ€? theory of federal borrowing is nonsense. No matter how much money the federal government borrows, private credit worthy borrowers are able to borrow money if banks are willing to lend, simply because bank loans create deposits, and bank needs to fulfill their reserve requirements are always accommodated by borrowing reserves from other banks, or by the willingness of the Fed to always back bank after they issue loans, if they need additional reserves over and above what is available in repo markets. The Fed must provide this backing to the banks, because it is necessary to maintain stability in the financial system. And seventh, lower debts and deficits will not reduce the risk of a financial crisis in the banking system, simply because â€œinvestorsâ€? in the market have no real choice when it comes to buying Treasury Securities. The rates of security offerings follow the federal funds rate, and the Fed can always maintain that rate though its open market operations, and its quantitative easing programs. IT can face investors with the choice of buying Treasury securities and earning something on their money, or sitting on their reserves and earning the minimum interest on reserves (IOR), offered by the Fed. Also, no matter how high the debt is, it will be hard to persuade traders that the Government of the United States cannot make its payments. Remember, Greenspan, and Bernanke have explained to them that we always can, and the slightest exercise of the high value platinum coin seigniorage power by Treasury will produce a clear demonstration that this can always be done. Actually, the only possible cause of a crisis is a political one caused by the Congressâ€™s failure to understand its own powers under the constitution as well as its own obligations. But again, that is a political crisis, not a fiscal one, and if it were to occur, a large part of the blame would lie with Peter G. Peterson and the various groups heâ€™s funded to generate the misinformation theyâ€™ve provided to the Congress for many years now. Maya MacGuineas finishes her statement with an appeal not to add to the debt, while at the same time she says we donâ€™t have to end deficits immediately, but should do so in concert with the business cycle. There are a few implications of that advice that are worth noting. First, it is very possible that the fragile expansion underway now will falter, and land us in another serious recession. If that happens, it is very likely that increased safety net spending, even without deficits from discretionary stimulus will be result in increasing debt even if we donâ€™t engage in stimulus. If that happens however, what can we do do about it? If we practice austerity, the recent European record, as well as much else around the world, tells us that will only deepen the recession, and lead to even greater debt, which is what the debt hawks are trying to avoid. So what choice do we have: more deficit spending using increasing debt, more deficit spending using money creation as in seigniorage, or deepening recession? And second, there is, in this advice, a failure to understand the sectoral financial balances accounting identity. Put simply, it is true that the balances of government spending, private spending, and foreign sector spending must equal 0, during any period of spending flows. As it happens, the United States has been running a trade deficit (that is, the foreign sector has a surplus in its dealings with us), for many years. Those who want us to balance the budget during good times are really saying, that they want the federal budget to be more or less in surplus as it was under Clintonâ€™s Administration. That means that their prescription for good times is to force the private sector to absorb aggregate losses the size of the trade deficit. If thatâ€™s 3% of GDP, then the Maya MacGuineas, Pete Peterson, Paul Ryan crowd is appealing for the private sector to take those losses for as long as good times last. Now letâ€™s imagine that the economy looks like it is booming due to a banking bubble, and good times last for 7 years or so. What will be the eventual result when the economy crashes? A sudden tanking of paper profits when people have to face the reality of a 21% loss in the net financial assets of the private sector over that period? Thatâ€™s a disaster, waiting to happen. Thatâ€™s what MacGuineas is really offering. A false notion of fiscal responsibility that will deliver periodic disasters, increasingly impoverishing most Americans and completely subordinating them to the FIRE sector represented by Peterson and his allies. There hasn’t been “fiscal responsibility” by our government, nor its people for decades. The public & private debts incurred are simply never going to be paid. The detriment of doing so will be passed on for generations. I see the case against private debt, but public debt? Public debt can’t be passed on to future generationsâ€¦our children  and grandchildren will always be able to consume what they produce. If public debt was a future burden we might have seen some evidence over the past 235 years or so. Future growth makes past debt small by comparison, so small as to be inconsequential. The future itself is an unfunded liabilityâ€¦more so the less we invest in it. I’m not sure what you mean by decades.  When Bill Clinton left office in January 2001, he left the incoming Bush administration with a projected federal budget surplus of $5.6 trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  This surplus essentially would have eliminated the national debt at that time.  The reason for this budget surplus was the tax policies adopted by Congress in 1993, passed by Democrats and signed by Clinton, with no Republican support. ‘The most valuable financial asset is its constitutional authority to create money. Now, how much is that asset worth compared to whatever level of debt is in question?’ If that sovereign authority ever gets challenged owing to its gross abuse, it’s worth nothing. Gov-worshippers assume that the public can swindled indefinitely without provoking a counter reaction. History says that ain’t so. Do you bow before Shiva?  Does Shiva bow before you? Do you worship Mammon?  Does Mammon worship you? It’s always easer for 10,000,000 people to support 10,000 lords. It’s harder for 10,000 people to support 10,000,000 lords. Lord 1:  I rule over 200,000,000 imperial subjects. Lord 2:  I am greater.  I rule over 1,500,000,000 dragon sons.  I wish we had ever more.  It will make me even greater. When democracy came along, it said it was ‘democratic’ but it kept the structure of 10,000,000 people supporting 10,000 lords.  But it was a government for the people… if the government wanted to really ‘serve’ the people, with government officials public ‘servants,’ if it REALLY, REALLy wanted to do that, then, the government can grow food, drive trucks, babysit kids, manufacture furniture, make clothes, etc. AND the people can come along  and say, hmmm, that’s pretty good.  I like the way you grow your organic vegetables… By the way, you are doing a little too much, so, I will,…uh, tax you.   To slow you down, of course. Conversely, Jim, if you serve them with the authority to create money, then then they will legitimize that. The problem isn’t with “the printing press. The problem is that it’s ot being used for public purpose, but for private gain. Why is this seeming inability to understand our sovereign monetary system so difficult for these individuals to understand?  More importantly, given their nonsensical viewpoint, why are these individuals extended any credibility by policy makers and the media whatsoever? Thank you for answers to these questions in the last two paragraphs of this piece, Joe Firestone.  There is a reason why monetary literacy is not taught in our schools and we are instead treated to a constant diet of propaganda and persuasion regarding a set of monetary and fiscal spending policies that work to our detriment and the benefit of a very small segment of the population. People like Maya have built an echo chamber over the past 40 years. Congress listens to them, because most Congresspeople are part of the echo chamber. So where do these people (including some of the commenters) think the growth in the money supply will come from? I think they believe that the Fed will increase the high-powered money supply in order to back the private banks who will be expanding the credit-based money supply created by themselves. This means no expansion of net financial assets in the private sector, but continuous destruction of them as the surpluses destroy existing net financial assets. The end result will be periodic booms based on credit alone, matched by periodic bust, the eventual extinction of the middle class, and the creation of a plutocracy, ruled by an oligarchy. We are moving very fast down that road already. The ability of private debt to expand, assuming prudent underwriting, Is limited by the debtors debt service-to-income ratio. Obviously at some point debt service will overwhelm the ability to service the debt without starving. Since credit expansion only accounts for a small fraction of overall spending based on historical data, it doesn’t make sense that we can expect credit to drive future growthâ€¦at best it will create unsustainable bubbles, which are evident throughout history. The biggest expansion took place post-2000, deviating from the mean by a huge amount, and look where we are now. Every financial crisis has been debt crisisâ€¦i.e. private debt related to banking (assuming a currency sovereign). And Greece is more like a private debtor than a sovereign, so it holds for them too. For Eurozone members public debt is transferred to the private citizens. It doesn’t take much of a leap to see where that is headed. Credit reduces future income over the longer term for 99% of the population, transferring wealth in the form of interest and profit to the top side of town. When did people start believing they could borrow from Peter to pay Paul? Answer, when the teevee told them they could. Their banking model assumes loans are made with the savings we put in our banks.  Credit is therefore simply a transfer of spending power from a saver to a borrower and debt can never exceed aggregate savings.  Folks like Krugman therefore state that there is no such thing as too much private debt. If we practice austerity, the recent European record, as well as much else around the world, tells us that will only deepen the recession This is why people like Maya are so successful at what they do in getting educated intellectuals tied up in knots. The author writes an essay challenging her. And then at the end the author agrees with her premise that debt/deficits matter, that quantity of money is the criterion by which we should judge policy choices. I never said debts/deficits don’t matter, only that the debt doesn’t matter for solvency, and that the government deficit needs to match the sum of the trade deficit and savings desires. Actually, I think the debt does matter a lot because using it as a wedge issue distorts our politics and pushes it to the right. That’s why I want to get rid of the debt by using reserves derived from platinum coin seigniorage and paying it back as it falls due, without issuing any new debt. Deficits only matter in the sense that they tell us where we’ve been, not where we’re going. Deficits are an ex-post picture of what has already happened. Can’t do much about that without a time machine. Instead of obsessing over deficits, maybe we should be wondering about why we have high unemployment, crapified lives of quiet desperation for the bulk of the employed with little hope of anything getting better because mathematical dunces are in charge of the kitty. “Thatâ€™s because for such a currency issuer, whatever debt level exists and falls due at any point, that debt can always be repaid because it is denominated in the currency the debtor nation can issue at will. All repayment takes then, is the willingness of the issuer to issue the money needed and to use it to repay the debt due.” Worked for the Weimer Republic, why shouldn’t it work for us? What could possibly go wrong? The worst aspect of this sort of thinking is that it validates inequality. Why should the 1% pay more taxes when MMT or a platinum coin can solve all our problems? Sounds like Pie in the Sky to me. The situation is not remotely comparable. The Wiemar Republic had to repay it’s debt in hard currency, not Marks. They wouldn’t have had a problem if their debt was denominated in Marks. The debt* wasn’t offered to them on the condition they pay it back in Marks. Same as lenders aren’t clamoring to lend Greece Euros on the condition that Greece gets to pay it back in Drachma. I know, it’s a strange world… * I generally don’t go the “W” analogy direction for numerous reasons – WW1 losers have crappy credit, German coal was hard currency, War reparations are debt – hard to productively deploy this borrowing?!….etc… I’ve certainly tired of this MMT lesson drilled into my stupid skull. If I could only absorb the fact that debt holders really aren’t looking for a real return on lending and would be satisfied with the proper number of decimal points added to their account, then I would be an enlightened person too! Briefly, because the Finance Industry has built up 11 Gross Global Products worth of alleged money by using the MMT principles for themselves instead of for us.  This is enough to swamp any real market, and makes money useless for many purposes.  The market can’t decide what should be produced because all that money just shouts “Produce everything!”.  There would be the same problem deciding what to consume, except that would-be consumers have practically none of the money, otherwise the answer would be similar.  Most of our usual Geldspielen get bollixed up in similar ways.  People who work on MMT have paid a lot of attention to this — just the critics haven’t. The Platinum Coin is there to resist the people who claim that all the money they have cornered is all the money there can be.  If you look around, you see Euro-American society collapsing by following those rules.  To survive, we need to make some rules that work for us. Mark Blyth, Brown University economist, eviscerated these Fix the Debt ideas earlier this week in a 5-minute presentation before the Budget subcommittee (his presentation can be viewed on The Real News Network, and his written remarks to Congress can be found in a PDF online). His opening lines: “You don’t have a spending problem. You have a revenue problem.” His closing lines: “Austerity doesn’t fix debt. Growth fixes debt.” In between, his charts show that our taxes on high wage earners are way below OECD countries; that the only reason for the increase in debt was, as he put it, “You decided to bail out the entire global financial community,”; and, that since the late 1800s, every time an austerity program has been instituted, either a recession or a depression followed immediately. Blyth is one of the most no-nonsense economists I’ve ever heard, and he’s one of the preeminent voice on anti-austerity.  I’m surprised NC doesn’t give him more coverage. He’s a political scientist, as am I, writing on political economy. His book is excellent in many respects, but it is still within the old paradigm, and his writing reflects the idea that public debt is something negative, from a public finance point of view. Being free to spend public money for public purposes has never been part of American Freedom.  Our freedom has always preferred that we risk everything to make a living.  We don’t even have single payer health insurance.  Its funny how people – whose jobs were being sent to Asia in a Wall Street blitzkrieg against labor – did risk  everything in real estate as the only way left way to grow their tiny share of American wealth. And in the course of 3 decades had created that wealth, but created it by inflation and on credit.  This is what our irrrational economic system demanded; there were no other options.  And people did it, trusting that this was the way things were done and real estate would therefore remain a stable industry.  Realtors who couldn’t afford health care and had to rely on donations from other realtors, still believed this was the American way.  Makes me wonder if the housing industry was brought down because it achieved exactly what the system needed – a bubble – because without a bubble there could be no crash, and etc.  But the system itself finally imploded along with all of its nonsense.  If we had fiscal choices, here in the land of the free, would we frantically create other bubbles? Thank you for an excellent comment, STO.  Only thing I would add are the lost and impaired lives of our young people who “volunteered” for the military to preserve Bucky’s global role on behalf of the few.
