Eric Peters: "In A World Awash In Stimulus, How Should You Invest In The Absence Of A Crisis" | Zero Hedge by Capitalist Exploits - Jul 24, 2016 9:05 AM "Remember that your goal is to find the best answer; not to give the best one you have." â€” Ray Dalio An interesting observation in the weekly note by Eric Peters, CIO of One River Asset Management, who points out something we have touched upon recently: while stocks continue to soar in the face of one crisis after another, propelled by an endless amount of de novo liquidity... ... and yet with crises not "big enough" to push the world to the next - and final - level in monetary policy just yet, namely helicopter money, what is an investor to do next if, suddenly, there is no further crisis? This is precisely what we hinted at a month ago in " Wanted: Policy Panic" - Why The Biggest Investors Are Praying For A Market Crash " â€œThis uprising is a gift from God,â€? exclaimed the autocrat, ebullient. â€œTheyâ€™ll pay a heavy price,â€? continued Erdogan, unleashing his purge of political opponents. 10,000 were arrested, 60,000 civil servants dismissed, hundreds of schools closed. â€œIt looks as if something had been prepared, the lists are available, which indicates they were to be used at a certain stage,â€? said EU commissioner Hahn, overseeing Turkeyâ€™s EU bid, referring to the purge, â€œItâ€™s exactly what we feared.â€? But Erdogan is simply doing what every opportunistic leader does; not letting a good crisis go to waste. â€œThereâ€™s no need and no possibility for helicopter money,â€? said Kuroda in a BBC program (the quote dated June 17), explaining that existing monetary tools are sufficiently powerful. The BOJ leader faces a dilemma. How to introduce a new and more radical policy in the absence of acute crisis? You see, as excited as bearded Bernanke is by the prospect of freshly-printed Yen raining like confetti, the economy isnâ€™t sufficiently bad for grey-haired voters to willingly risk runaway inflation, destitution. â€œWe are ready, willing, and able to act if needed,â€? stated Draghi at the ECB press conference, where he had done nothing new. With stock and bond markets rallying in the aftermath of Brexit, and the Euro stable, thereâ€™s no European crisis to justify more radical action. Just an uneasy feeling. Because no one knows whether the accumulation of all this extraordinary stimulus is solving our problems, or simply staving off a crisis that will reappear soon after we stop. And with so much of this new money leaking to America and emerging markets, itâ€™s not just a question for Europe and Japan. Which leaves investors facing a dilemma all their own: In a world awash in stimulus, how should you invest in the absence of a crisis? One simple answer: keep creating lots and lots of small crises, which push the market higher, dislocating ever more from reality, until the inevitable "drawdown" ( in Goldman's words ), which in turn will be sufficient to prompt just the "policy panic" to unleash even more stimulus, and send global risk assets soaring to never before seen levels. Rinse, and repeat. Just pray that in the meantime the natives don't get too restless... DeadFred Dead Canary Jul 24, 2016 9:54 AM Apple_Pie JamaicaJim Jul 24, 2016 10:32 AM I'm making over $7k a month working part time. I kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so I decided to look into it. Well, it was all true and has totally changed my life. This is what I do... www.trends88.com The natives ARE getting more restless by the hour. These financial overlords are really good at slowing and maintaing the shearing of the wealth of every American. The crossing point is when "we the people" are so angry that we actually revolt. There needs to be three things. A realization that things won't get better until we act, we have the correct target to blame and the proper leader or leaders to lead us through the crisis. Buy yourself a little country like Ukraine, ideally with a government included in price, leveraged with free money from ECB and GMO permissions from EU. Yes, buy what you can with your trinkets and beads before everyone realizes that they are only trinkets and beads. There's no stimulus.  Anytime a member of the Finance Elite uses the word "Stimulus" it's a tell.  Stimulus is government debt-based spending that goes directly into the real, wider economy.  It goes into the pockets of the middle and lower classes, who will spend it.  There are many ways it can get there.  Could be a Payroll Tax holiday.  Originally it was proposed as massive infrastructure projects.  It could be free college tuition, or as crude (and effective) as a check in the mailbox. What the global financialized Elites have done is pump newly-created fiat through the Finance sector to pump up equity valuations, and then cycle that money back through the Central Banks via bond purchases.  The cycle is repeated over and over, like the vignette in "Catch-22" where there's a guy wrapped up in bandages like a mummy with a bottle running fluid into him and a bottle catching the fluid coming out of him and every few hours they just switch the bottles. This is not stimulus.  This is a check-kiting scheme, and the Elites are allowed to claim the profits from selling the proceeds. How to invest in this scenario?  First look up the word "Invest."  It does not mean, "Buy lots of pulltabs and scratch-offs," which is what these people are selling.  It means, "Put today's money to work to lay the groundwork for making more money tomorrow."  Buy tools of any and all kinds, pay off debts, fix your house and your car. We've allowed these people to build a global system of gibberish and gobbledygook, based on nothing, according to their own whims and fancies, completely and totally in the abstract.  That will last until a small, but critical, mass of people stop believing in it.  The Elites have been eating, digesting and believing their own bullshit for so long they'll never see it coming.  The last thing you want to have done is spent today's money on their lotto coupons, the day people stop believing in the hocus-pocus.  itstippy swmnguy Jul 24, 2016 12:03 PM The typical person who invests in stock-based mutual funds is saving for the future via an IRA, SEP-IRA, 401K, or similar plan.  He (she) has a decent job and income, so they have some surplus money to squirrel away for their "golden years".  Bravo for trying! Unfortunately, most of these investors either live in a condo, rental, or a newer house in good repair.  They have no idea how to use even basic tools, and the home needs no fixing up anyway.  If something breaks they call a repairman.  They either lease a new car, or buy a new car as soon as the manufacturer's warranty runs out.  They don't even own an oil filter wrench or an oil drain pan. They do not make extra mortgage or car payments.  The investing websites, newsletters, blogs, and books all tell them to "pay yourself first" by setting the maximum aside in an IRA, SEP-IRA, 401K, or similar plan.  The initial tax advantages, coupled with the miracle of tax-deferred interest and capital gains, will make them wealthy in their old age if they just stick with the plan longterm and ignore transitory market ups and downs (that's the pitch).   Paul John Smith Jul 24, 2016 10:16 AM the grateful un... Jul 24, 2016 10:28 AM the market is an endless fairy tale, while greenspan was in charge it was goldilocks, now its the boy who cried wolf, at other times its been the emperors new clothes, and when the central bankers finally get religion it will be king midas, who turned everything he touched into gold (unfortunately) Son of Captain Nemo Jul 24, 2016 10:38 AM One simple answer: keep creating lots and lots of small crises, which  push the market higher, dislocating ever more from reality, until the  inevitable "drawdown" ( in Goldman's words ),  which in turn will be sufficient to prompt just the "policy panic" to  unleash even more stimulus, and send global risk assets soaring to never  before seen levels. Rinse, and repeat. Just pray that in the meantime  the natives don't get too restless... And when you can no longer create consecutive "small crisis"?.... Ya take them to the biggest war that serves as the ultimate distraction! Me personally... Once they "Mission Accomplish" the next 9/11 moment to rally the new recruits... And they will of course... Because they have no choice with the overwhelming pushback and the growing dissension among the EU faithful for another re-invasion of Iraq and finishing off of Syria and of course beyond in order to preserve the "Unum Reserve Currency" status in play for the House of Cards to somehow continue... You collect the Draghi(s), the LeGarde(s), the Blankfein(s), Dimon(s), Bernanke(s) and last but not least the Summer(s) for a one way all expenses paid trip to the top of  Freedom Tower in lower Manhattan and provide the "fucked" with an entertaining spectacle of all of these individual(s) partaking in a "free fall accelerated" videotaped sky dive sans parachute from the very top as a lesson and warning to future others what is in the cards for them if they choose to do the same! The low interest rates IS the crisis. Because they pushed interest rates so low on govt debt, there is no safe place to park money for banks, this causes them to start speculating like crazy on equities with funny money and you have the next bubble blowing up right now. When the bubble bursts, all the banks investments will be wiped away and you will have bank failures. All they did was take loans against real property govt bonds and replace that income with equity speculation. When the equities drop it will be worse than the housing bubble bursting because there are no underlying assets to save the banks this time around. All that also pushes the working class people and consumers into a precarious condition where their cost of living is rising due to inflation, and the carrying cost of their debt is rising at the same time, in a time where jobs are stagnant. The crash coming is easy to see, we are right at the edge now. Banks wont survive this time around, there is no public appetite for more bailouts, and Trump would probably Veto them. Government need... Jul 24, 2016 10:50 AM 8/9 years into ZIRP and it's clear that the policy didnt work as intended AND the really big, 20+ year to manifest negative feedback loops (pension fund solvency, Medicare/Social Security solvency) are significantly closer.  When sovereign debt yields a negative return, the pension/SS returns go to hell.  Dont forget Obama's little healthcare program, too.  that sucker gets more expensive by the year.  Something has to change, and I dont think a 25% wealth tax will be well received. swmnguy Government needs you to pay taxes Jul 24, 2016 10:58 AM I beg to differ.  To say a policy worked or didn't work, you have to assess intent.  The framers of this policy are well-established as liars, so we have to extrapolate intent from their actions, not their words. I'd say this strategy is working just fine.  The architects intend the biggest bankruptcy of all time, to shed all their obligations.  Pensions and Social Security will be the first to go.  Way back as an Illinois legislator, Rep. Obama was talking about privatizing SS and dumping pensions, to get his cred as a "pragmatic liberal."  Same approach for healthcare; rope the Federal Government into directly subsidizing the finance/insurance sector until collapse. Watching the Elites stuff their pockets with both hands while chopping down the structure of the Finance Economy is pretty amazing.  ZIRP/NIRP is obviously designed to stampede wealth into stocks.  The antidote is to use your money to eliminate all your debts, buy things you need and can use tomorrow to make more wealth.  Or, in other words, to "Invest," as the word is truly defined and not the way it's been debauched in current usage.
