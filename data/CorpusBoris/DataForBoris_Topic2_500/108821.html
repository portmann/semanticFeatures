Why A Deal Between Greece And The Troika Has Become Harder To Achieve | Seeking Alpha Investors should realize that a deal between Greece and The Troika has become much harder to achieve after the referendum. The conviction of the referendum was so strong that the Greek government will find it very hard to vote a new set of austerity measures. Even worse, the bank run and the resultant pause of economic activity have made the situation much worse and hence Greece now needs a much greater loan from Europeans. The referendum in Greece was by far the most popular political event of the weekend. While the gallops were predicting a positive vote for new austerity measures and all the Greek media were relentlessly promoting such a vote, the referendum surprisingly turned out exactly the opposite way, with a strong conviction (61%) against the proposed austerity package. While I believe that this was a positive development for Greece, as the 5-year austerity program has completely failed so far (Greece has incurred accumulated recession 29%, deeper than the Great Depression, while its unemployment is the highest since World War II at 26%), investors of the Greek stock market (NYSEARCA: GREK ) should realize that a deal between Greece and Troika has become harder to achieve. First of all, the conviction was so strong that the Greek government will find it very hard to vote a new set of austerity measures. It is also worth noting that the announcement of the referendum forced the Greek banks to close and paused a large portion of the economic activity so its outcome cannot be undermined. In addition, the dispute between the opposing parties and citizens was remarkably intense and hence the anti-austerity voters are now expecting their vote to bear results. Therefore, the government will have a hard time voting new recessionary measures. Even worse, the ongoing bank run is depleting banks from cash and the confidence of citizens in the banking system has suffered a wound that will heal very slowly, possibly in about 2 years given the example of the bank run in Cyprus. Moreover, the economic activity has paused due to the prevailing uncertainty and the malfunction of the banking system and hence Greece now needs a much larger amount from Europeans to restart its economy than it needed two weeks ago. Consequently, Europeans may require more measures from Greece in exchange of the larger new loan required to heal the recent wounds of the economy. In other words, if it was hard to reach a deal two weeks ago, it has become much harder now. A remarkable point of the negotiations of the last 5 months is that The Troika has compromised very little whereas the Greek government has greatly compromised from its initial position for an end to austerity. This lack of compromise is a cultural feature of Germans but it also results from a political motive. More specifically, The Troika wants to set an example to prevent other countries from asking for debt relief or relaxation of austerity. While a debt relief of Greece with a 30% haircut would only cost about €100 B and hence it would be manageable, The Troika wants to set an example for the other problematic countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy) whose debt relief would be much more costly. The Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Tsipras, forced his finance minister to resign yesterday in a strategic move to approach The Troika, as the latter has clearly stated that it does not want to negotiate with Mr Varoufakis. Unfortunately, while Mr Varoufakis definitely lacks diplomatic skills and has an extreme love for publicity, he is by far the most competent financial expert within the government. In addition, while Europeans appreciate this move of the Greek government, the move is clearly insufficient to bring the two negotiating parties much closer. Finally, it is worth noting that all European governments have repeatedly proved that they are too slow in making decisions and they always do their best to postpone every painful (for their voters) decision to the future. However, this time is slightly different. Why European politicians can keep kicking the can down the road, the Greek government is facing enormous time pressure, as the Greek banks have been closed for more than a week. Therefore, this time the Greek government and Europeans will need to strike a deal in a prompt fashion, which makes it harder to occur. To sum up, the referendum has made it much harder for Greece and Troika to reach an agreement. To be sure, on the one hand the vast majority of Greek citizens voted against a new austerity package whereas the bank run and the resultant pause of economic activity have greatly increased the magnitude of the new loan required to restart the economy. If we add the absolute reluctance of Germans to make even a small compromise in order to set an example for the other problematic countries, we realize that is has become much harder for the negotiating parties to reach an agreement after the referendum.
