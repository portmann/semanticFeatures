But Japan's household spending (60% of GDP) was unchanged in 2015 versus 2012. Click to enlarge3 years of massive stimulus spending in Japan has had no impact on the problem it was supposed to solve. This is highlighted by new government data on household spending for 2015, as the charts confirm - they compare the 2015 data with that for 2012, before Abenomics began: Spending in the peak age range of 50 - 59 was just Â¥250/year higher, and it was Â¥7900 lower in the 40 -49 age group It still declines 31% once people reach the age of 70 - critically important with Japan's ageing population In US$ terms, of course, the numbers are lower due to Abe's focus on devaluing the yen since he took office US$ spending in the two peak age groups of 40 - 49, and 50 - 59, has fallen by $15k/year to $29k/year This matters, because consumer spending is 60% of Japanese GDP . The quite scary result is that the Bank of Japan has spent Â¥200tn ($1.84tn) since Abe came to power on its quantitative easing programme. Yet the Abenomics policy has completely failed to achieve its major objectives of boosting GDP and inflation: And as a result, Japan now has the world's highest level of government debt as a percentage of GDP at 226%. Yet premier Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda refuse to accept that their policies have failed. Instead, just like the European Central Bank yesterday , they have decided to implement their policies on a greater scale. Thus Japan introduced negative interest rates in January, meaning that the Bank now charges you to deposit money with it. Clearly these are increasingly desperate measures, which have a vanishingly small chance of being successful. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but it is usually the best guide that we have. And understandably, Japan's Diet (its parliament) is becoming very concerned - Governor Kuroda has been summoned for questioning a record 25 times so far this year. Foreigners have to pay the government to lend it money (and so are guaranteed to get back less than they lend) And GDP growth is almost impossible with Japan's median age now 47 years and its population set to decline by 600k/year by 2020 Premier Abe initially promised that he would restore the country to growth, and push inflation to at least 2%, within 2 years. Today, 3 years later, his Abenomics policies have entered the end-game. Some investors will no doubt continue to maintain positions in Japan, which is still the world's 3rd largest economy. But they will no doubt be keeping a close eye on their exit opportunities. When the rush starts, nobody will want to be left behind.
