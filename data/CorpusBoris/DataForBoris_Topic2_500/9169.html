The 'GREK' Alpha - A Game Theoretic Approach To Realizing Abnormal Gains - Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSEARCA:GREK) | Seeking Alpha A 'Grexit' didn't take place in 2012 and in the period that followed hints of Greece staying in the EU, Greece focused GREK (NYSEARCA:GREK) offered a HPR of over 50%. We analyzed the 2012 events using Game Theory and used the same game theoretic approach to predict that Greece WOULD reach an agreement with EU in the coming months. The game theoretic approach gains more prominence in the light of the fact that Yanis Varoufakis, Greece Finance Minister is a Game Theory expert and practitioner himself. Historical ASE and "GREK" ETF returns suggest that shorting GREK in the immediate term followed by going long on GREK can offer HPR of over 50% over next 6-9 months. With the advent of the great recession, the EU's very existence as a monetary union was threatened. Leading the pack of high debt countries was Greece, when in 2009 the public debt to GDP ratio exceeded 100%. The Maastricht Treaty of the European Union had provided no exit clause once countries joined the zone, and in 2009 the Lisbon Treaty did, for the first time, make it legally possible for a country to leave the European Union. So the market became rife with speculation that Greece would exit (or be forced to exit) the Eurozone as it blatantly ignored one of the fundamental tenets of the Maastricht Treaty - 'The ratio of gross government debt to GDP must not exceed 60% at the end of the preceding fiscal year'. While some argue this would have been a good thing for the Eurozone, a Greece exit would undermine the whole stability of the EU - If Greece exited, the market would speculate which country would exit next and this would drastically increase the borrowing costs for other countries such as Italy, Spain and Portugal leading to more instability. On the other hand, if Greece left the EU voluntarily due to the pressure the EU was exerting on it reign in expenses, it would have landed itself in a severe economic crisis after having to revert back to the Drachma. A stalemate in negotiations was reached when the EU insisted on Greece agreeing to highly unpopular austerity measures in lieu for a bailout. As in the prisoner's dilemma game, the payoff matrix is represented as follows - Payoff matrix A representative of the EU vs Greece If EU agreed to accept Greek bonds as collateral and Greece accepted the austerity measures, both would gain the most. However, Greece would gain more without austerity measures if EU accepted the Eurobonds, and EU would gain more without accepting Eurobonds if Greece accepted austerity measures. Lack of trust between both parties played an important role too and as in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the equilibrium state is one of non-co-operation (1/1). When evaluated from this game theoretic standpoint, we can see why Greece and other countries of the EU (mainly EU) were at loggerheads for so long. But in 2012, the EU came up with a solution to the problem with the ratification of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ESM was signed in February 2012 and the Eurozone governments agreed on 1st July 2012 as its date for entry into force. The ESM institution would be a permanent body and replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) which was temporary in nature. The ESM was ultimately established in September 2012 and had a lending capacity of over Eu500Bn. Included in its mandate was a Primary and Secondary Market Support facility which 'supports the good functioning of the government debt markets of ESM Members in exceptional circumstances where the lack of market liquidity threatens financial stability, with a risk of pushing sovereign interest rates towards unsustainable levels and creating refinancing problems for the banking system of the ESM Member concerned'. In other words, the EU demonstrated that it could withstand the shock of a 'Grexit' and maintain funding stability to other EU countries. The markets now saw the possibility of a solution - either one in which Greece leaves the Euro or one in which Greece stays. When the Greece national elections in May 2012 failed to produce a majority led government, the Athens Stock Exchange hit a fresh low not expecting to see a positive outcome for Greece in sight. The Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSEARCA: GREK ) traded in the range of $9 a unit, down from $16 just 3 months earlier. Of course the EU had no intentions of actually bringing about a full-blown Greek default. Later in 2012, when the pro-Euro New Democracy party led by Antonis Samaras came to power in Greece and began negotiations, the EU decided to write-off an additional 40bn-euro of Greece Debt and also offered an additional 44bn-euro in aid to Greece. Greece would also not need to pay principal on EFSF loans until 2022. In return, the EU demanded structural reform in the following areas - cut down on pension expenses, divest government stake in state owned enterprises, maintaining a primary budget surplus (budget surplus before interest payments on debt) of 4.5% of GDP and a number of other austerity measures. In return Greece would receive a Eu240Bn bailout and would be monitored by the troika - the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Payoff matrix B - representative of EU vs Greece post ESM establishment and concessions for Greece With the concessions made to Greece and the common knowledge that it was better off within the EU, Greece left with one dominant strategy - to agree to the bailout. The Greece parliament passed the austerity measures ("Labor market reform" and "Midterm fiscal plan 2013-16") in November 2012 and Greece was back in the EU. The GREK fund traded in the range of $18 a unit and would continue to rise for the next 18 months, until Syriza swept the local elections in May 2014. The charts below illustrate the performance of the ASE and the GREK ETF. Performance of the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) from March to December 2012 Now, in 2015, we use the same framework to evaluate the chances of Greece leaving the EU. With the Syriza party coming to power, we have a repeat of the crisis before the 2012 bailout. Syriza has demanded a haircut or debt forgiveness from its creditors. The main points of contention between Greece (Syriza) and the EU are as follows - · Greece claims that the austerity measures have severely had a negative impact its economy. Unemployment is over 25%, Debt-GDP ratio has topped 175% and its economy has been contracting sharply and was 27% at the end of 2013 from its pre-crisis peak · EU claimed that due to its debt structuring with Greece, its debt servicing is only 2.6% of GDP which is not unaffordable. It also claims that with further structural reform Greece would realize the benefits of an economic expansion and insists Greece stick to the deal it agreed to. However, on this occasion, the reaction of the market was a little more muted to the Greece standoff compared to its reaction in 2012. One factor that gave more confidence to the markets that a deal would be reached was the ECB announcing an open ended Eu60Bn per month bond buying program to beat deflationary pressure in the EU. This ECB program would flood the market with liquidity and provide the impetus for stable inflation (2%) and growth as well. As a consequence, yields on bonds have also been falling and the Euro has depreciated significantly to the US dollar. The overall result is that money is now cheaper and it is even less expensive for a deal to reached between Greece and its creditors. On the other hand, this Greece rebellion must in no way be made to look like a huge success as it would entice other parties in Spain, Portugal and Italy to push for anti-reform strategies as well. This would be detrimental to the EU as Mario Draghi, President of ECB, himself said the ECB stimulus is just a basis for growth and that real growth will only come from structural reform. The charts below show the effect the ECB QE has indirectly had a Greece 10 year bonds. The yields are much lower compared to 2012. Performance of Greece sovereign 10-year bonds from March to Dec 2012 Performance of Greece sovereign 10-year bonds from January 2014 to present After coming to power Syriza threatened to scrap the bailout agreement and claimed Greece was insolvent. It wanted a bridge loan to help it pay its dues from March to June, during which it would negotiate a new bailout agreement with its creditors. The markets were tense for a bit but at the 11th hour a deal was reached. Greece would continue with its existing bailout plan for the next 4 months, pending approval from the troika on the new reforms Greece would initiate to meet its bailout terms. However, the current situation isn't rosy at all and EU country leaders on multiple occasions have hinted at a growing frustration towards Greece. While there has been a positive news from the interaction between Greece and other EU member states at the European Union Summit this week, one can expect periods of tension to follow until an agreement is reached. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already invited Greece Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to Berlin for talks next week. The GREK ETF has closed at $10.75 as of the morning on Friday, 20th of March after a downward slide for the last 1 month. The charts below illustrate the performance of the ASE and the GREK ETF from January 2014 to the present month. Performance of GREK ETF from Jan 2014 to present Using Game theory to predict the future outcome - Grexit or no? Greece owes close to Eu30Bn in 2015 itself, with large payments due in July and August. Hence Greece would need to agree to a long term bailout plan with its creditors before this 4 month extension comes to an end. There is concern again that a 'Grexit' may occur since Greece would fail to reach an agreement with the EU before it runs out of cash. Once again we use the Prisoner's dilemma game theoretic approach that we built in the earlier section to predict the outcome. Payoff matrix D - EU vs Greece on reaching a long term agreement The tide has turned even more in favor of the EU in the recent months. With a strengthening economy backed up by a weaker Euro currency and lower oil prices, the EU is expected to grow at 1.2% to 1.5% this year. Eurozone money supply-cash and bank deposits-rose at an annualized 9% in February; the last time it rose this fast, the Eurozone economy was soon growing by more than 2%. Consumer confidence in the EU has also reached new highs and there are signs of optimism. Given this background, Greece would need the Euro even more. As it can be seen, the payoff for both parties is much higher for an agreement to be reached but the EU is in a much better bargaining position than it was in 2012. On the other hand, with the ECB QE in place, Greece can benefit tremendously from reaching an agreement with the EU and getting to put its sovereign bonds on the bond market again. Hence we predict an agreement will be reached and that it will come, even if it is at the 11th hour andeven though there may be a lot of background noise that results in significant market volatility leading to that agreement. The Greek Alpha - Opportunities for investors: There are opportunities for realizing a significant positive alpha with Greece. They can be achieved through shorting the Athens Stock Exchange in the short term and then going long on Greece as the deadline for the deal approaches. We compare the situation in 2012, which is analogous to the situation now. Economists predict an orderly exit of Greece from the EU June 20th elections result in formation of pro- euro government ECB declares Eu60Bn per month bond buying program The table above demonstrates the effects the major events explained through Game Theory had on the ASE and GREK ETF From Feb 2012 to mid-June 2012, GREK returned approximately -43.75%. The situation is analogous to the present situation where GREK returned approximately -42% from Sept 2014 to present day. From July 2012 to Nov 2012, GREK returned approximately +50%. This is period between the new pro-Euro Greece Government taking control of parliament (amid signs that Greece would stay in the EU) and the government actually passing the austerity measures ("Labor market reform" and "Midterm fiscal plan 2013-16") which sealed Greece's continuation in the EU with the 2nd bailout package We used game theory to predict a repeat of 2012 is the most probable outcome. Greece will reach a deal with the Euro, although the road leading to it will not be pretty and the deal may actually come about at the 11th hour. We make the following suggestions- o At the moment, short GREK - The negative current news and outlook bodes well for a short. Put options on GREK go out in September this year, which is well after a bailout extension can be reached o However, we suggest switching to a long position in GREK in May or June (depending on how the situation in Greece pans out). o With an investment horizon of the next 6-9 months, one can expect a HPR of over 50%.
