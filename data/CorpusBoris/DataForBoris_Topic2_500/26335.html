Fitch: Robust and Credible Economic Framework Underpin Peru's Policy Flexibility | Reuters (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 13 (Fitch) Peru's macroeconomic and fiscal policies have  prudently managed a positive commodity and international financing cycle without  accumulating large economic and external imbalances, according to a new Fitch  Ratings special report. The policies also presently enable the use of  counter-cyclical stimulus to smooth growth. Peru's policy framework is underpinned by a credible inflation targeting regime,  proactive macro-prudential management and a rules-based fiscal policy. 'Peru's  policy mix has enabled the sovereign to develop a track record for policy  coherence and credibility, leading to entrenched macroeconomic and financial  stability, and generated counter-cyclical policy space,' said Erich Arispe,  Director in Fitch's Sovereign Group.  Through the use of inflation targeting, Peru has established a record of low  inflation in spite of lingering financial dollarization. Anchored inflation  expectations have provided space to implement monetary policy stimulus in spite  of depreciation pressures.  In spite of weaker economic growth and Peruvian sol depreciation, financial  sector fundamentals remain sound. Effective macroprudential management has  prevented the build-up of vulnerabilities during the years of high growth, rapid  appreciation and abundant external liquidity.  High financial dollarization, in relation to 'BBB' peers, poses limits to  exchange rate flexibility and challenges to monetary policy. However, policies  directed at dedollarization of credit, high international reserves,  macroprudential measures and availability of FX intervention tools have reduced  risks related to high dollarization.  Prudent fiscal management offers room to ease policy to confront a more  challenging external environment. After recording consecutive surpluses and  reducing debt levels below 20%, the government intends to provide 2pp of GDP in  fiscal stimulus for 2015. Peru's fiscal financing flexibility is strong due to  its institutionalized fiscal stabilization fund, significant government  deposits, favorable debt composition and amortization profile, and a developing  local debt market. Peru's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies should provide a boost to the  economy in 2015 and 2016. 'The challenge for authorities is to withdraw the  monetary and fiscal stimulus in a timely and prudent manner to safeguard policy  credibility and rebuild counter-cyclical space,' added Arispe.  Reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness improvements will be needed to  improve long-term growth prospects in the absence of rising commodity prices and  abundant external liquidity.
