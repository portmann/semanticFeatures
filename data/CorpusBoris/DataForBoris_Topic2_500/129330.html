An Austrian Perspective On Greece | Seeking Alpha Austrian economist tends to blame soft money, market inefficiencies and a bloated state for the Greek crisis. However, since these have been present for decades in the Greek economy, they can't be responsible for the unprecedented collapse. In our view, the combination of hard money, the constraints of a fixed currency system and unprecedented austerity has been responsible for the Greek crash. Curiously enough, these are all part of Austrian recommendations. While their emphasis of debt retirement and structural reforms are useful, we think they are missing the essence of the crisis entirely. The Greek handling of its economy has many critics, and indeed there is ample reason to be critical. But not all criticism is equally justified or even substantiated. One peculiar critic here on SA is Acting Man; from the articles we have read, we gather that he is an Austrian liquidationist. So it is useful to see whether the Austrian perspective sheds any light on the Greek situation. We start with the article in which Acting Man gets some material from Syriza's manifesto and, without much (indeed, any) analysis, he duly dismisses all these proposals as nonsense : Not a single economic policy that can be described as even remotely sensible can be found anywhere in the manifesto, except the demand that military spending should be drastically cut. They might very well be, but it's difficult to tell as these are proposals, not actual policies, let alone policies that have been implemented, so we can actually see some results and take the analysis from there. Acting Man goes on to argue: Greece is really facing a big problem if the above is representative of what Syriza really wants in terms of economic policy We think, rather than discard proposals that haven't been implemented off-hand, it would be way more useful to look at the policies that actually have been implemented and the effects these have caused. However, we understand why an Austrian liquidationist might be a tad reluctant to do that, as the outcome of such study isn't kind to the Austrian core beliefs. Basically, Greece has been subject to a combination of a fixed exchange rate system, hard money and unprecedented austerity. The funny thing is, this is basically the recipe most Austrians would wholeheartedly welcome as the necessary cutting "liquidation" of dry wood. Well, a lot of wood has been cut, whether dry or not. However, are Austrians familiar with the concept of hysteresis? This is the long-term damage from the loss of productive capacity, over a quarter of GDP in the case of Greece. This comes in various forms: Loss of productive capacity (plant, equipment, know-how) Lack of investment due to large overcapacity Aging of capital stock due to lack of investment Reduction in effective labor supply as long-term unemployed lose skills, motivation and are discriminated against and the young and skilled move abroad. If demand returns (which, under the present euro arrangements isn't likely anytime soon), these effects don't just magically reverse but will create bottlenecks, basically reducing the rate at which the economy can grow. Sound money is perhaps the most core belief of the Austrians, which is why many (not all) are in favor of tying currencies to gold. That can certainly force countries to limit monetary growth, but as we have seen in the 1930s, this can also be extraordinarily limiting, forcing all of the adjustment on the deficit countries, creating deflationary bias and even Fisherian deflationary-debt spirals. This is basically what happened in the eurozone. It's useful to remember that in the 1930s, the countries that left the gold standard the earliest were also the ones that recovered the fastest. We have already described the similarities between the gold standard and the euro ( here and here ), the main difference is that countries cannot so easily escape, and we see the results. Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland are in some form of debt-deflationary spiral in which the debt/GDP ratio keeps on ratcheting up due to the low (or even negative) growth of the denominator. If it was as easy to leave the euro as it was to leave the gold standard in the 1930s, would Greece still be in the euro? How many member states would the eurozone still have? Acting Man laments the money printing: In the meantime, the euro area's true money supply has been inflated by nearly 60% and its current annual growth rate stands at nearly 13%. Problem seemingly "solved." What follows is a graph suggesting we had massive monetary growth. We're not going to mince our words here and argue that this really is a misleading use of figures. The graph starts in 1980(!), isn't corrected for inflation or tied to growth of GDP, and is for the whole eurozone area. It tells you absolutely nothing. Aggregate eurozone figures are really not telling much as monetary conditions can vary greatly in the eurozone. You wouldn't know, for instance, that, despite "all that money printing" a considerable part of the eurozone actually experienced deflation in the last couple of years. Acting Man seems to lament inflation eroding creditors: Everybody knows that not a single government will ever pay back its debts according to term of the contract (at the very least, it will be continually devalued by monetary debasement). The statement is actually nonsense, it only holds if real interest rates are negative which is historically more exception than rule. Apart from that, under the present circumstances debt-deflationary effects of deflation or lowflation is a much bigger risk. It is also untrue that a devaluation of the currency is required to deal with an economic crisis. The devaluation "solution" is nothing but smoke and mirrors. It benefits only a small sector of the economy, and even that benefit is strictly temporary. We've not found any analysis on which this sweeping judgement is based. Greece suffered a severe loss of competitiveness during the first decade of the euro, largely because of the capital inflows that resulted from eurozone membership leading to accumulating inflation differentials between core and periphery. It is simply a fact that there are few, if any, self-correcting mechanisms within a monetary union, so these inflation differentials kept on accumulating, resulting in severe misalignment of prices and large trade deficits in the periphery and large surpluses in the core. One can argue that Greece (or Portugal, Spain) isn't the export powerhouse like Germany, but now might be as good a time as any to remind people like Acting Man that Germany didn't have a trade surplus when the eurozone was formed. Now it is 8% of GDP. It's also useful to remember that Greece didn't have much of a problem before it joined the euro. From time to time, it simply devalued its currency to compensate for the accumulated inflation differential eating into its competitiveness, and that was that. Within the euro, what was a routine operation suddenly became deeply problematic and economically costly. Not only can't Greece devalue, it can only restore competitiveness versus the center countries by the arduous process known as internal devaluation, that is, cutting wages and prices. This is much more costly in terms of output cost, as people like Milton Friedman long argued, and Krugman recently calculated . But the ensuing deflation only causes the debt burden (in the form of debt/GDP) to ratchet up, a problem that seems to escape the Austrians completely. What's more, within the euro, all the adjustments have to be made by the deficit countries, there is no reflation by the center countries like Germany and the Netherlands (basking with trade surpluses of 8% and 10% of GDP, respectively), creating a deflationary bias in the whole eurozone. This is the main reason why the periphery (or even countries like Finland, which is the victim of other country-specific shocks which, under the constraints of the euro, is unable to deal with) suffered the longest economic slump in the past century, longer even than the one in the 1930s. Just as the Austrians were blind to these constraints of the gold standard in the 1930s (or even actively praising them), they're blind to the euro constraints of the euro. Austrians do not believe in active fiscal policy, and Acting Man is no exception, referring to Varoufakis' condemnation of austerity: It is a blanket condemnation of austerity and he doesn't tell us what exactly should be done differently. Most mainstream critics of austerity policies believe governments should go even deeper into debt, as they are hoping that the Keynesian "multiplier" fairy tale will somehow "kick-start" the economy, resp. imbue it with "escape velocity". These people apparently all believe the economy is a machine, or a spaceship. This is not the case. As it happens, Greece has gone through one of history's most unprecedented austerity experiments, and the effects have been predictable, and in range with the experiences in the other peripheral eurozone countries, as shown by the figure below. Without the possibility of offsetting monetary impulse or devaluation, that 'fairy tale' multiplier is actually a lot larger, as even the IMF acknowledged . The magnitude of Greece's austerity is something to behold: As you can see, there is no big mystery why the economy crashed by over 25%. One can blame it on all the dysfunctionalities of the Greek economy, the regulation, bloated state, etc. But these have been there for decades while the economy was growing. The funny thing is, Greece would have a tremendous budget surplus if the economy could get anywhere near full capacity: Usually, Austrians point to the wonders of free markets and indeed these are often useful. Here is Acting Man: It is not true that bailout money is needed to reform Greece's economy and administrative system. All that is needed for this is the willingness to implement reform. This willingness is practically non-existent among all Western governments. [our emphasis] Given that there are tens of thousands of often contradictory regulations and an impenetrable jungle of decrees and responsibilities, the complexity of which is such that ministers often have no idea what their own administrative apparatus is doing and whether it will actually implement their directives, radical surgery has to be applied... The most essential tasks in Greece are the liberalization of the economy and streamlining of the bureaucracy. The latter is more difficult, but surely, it is not impossible. So all that is needed is to reform the economy to something more market-friendly version. We have argued multiple times in the past that deregulation in countries like Greece (but also other peripheral eurozone countries) is useful. However, to argue that it is the "most essential task" is a bit over the top. The fact is that Greece has made considerable (but not often noticed) progress on this front. Here is the European Commission (pdf): Indicators measuring the overall regulatory environment show that Greece and Portugal are among the largest reformers: between 2008 and 2013, the two countries led the reform effort according to the OECD Product Market Regulation indicator. The introduction of an electronic registry to simplify the creation of new businesses and the introduction of a new form of limited liability corporation that has no capital requirement may have helped Greece rise 110 places to 36th out of 189 in the World Bank's Doing Business Report, the biggest improvement of any country between July 2012 and June 2013. There is also evidence to suggest that Greece's efforts to liberalise its heavily protected professions have made some headway. (our emphasis). But that hasn't prevented the economy from crashing over a quarter in five years. Perhaps even more telling, Greece has lived with these inefficiencies and bloated state for decades and its economy, whilst no star performer, has been growing steadily despite these ills. Surely structural reforms are useful, but these are by no means a miracle cure. What Greece is lacking is demand, which is simply the result of the constraints of the euro, the lack of possible devaluation or monetary reflation, and the imposed austerity. What constitutes a success, in Austrian eyes? Well, according to Acting Man: If we look at Europe, we can see that the Baltic nations retained the euro pegs of their currencies when they were struck by crisis and embarked on a truly wrenching austerity retrenchment, involving GDP declines by 30% or more. Naturally, with such a large proportion of "GDP" these days attributed to government spending, large spending cuts will make this phantom growth component disappear. For the past several years, the Baltic nations are the envy of Europe in terms of economic growth and in terms of the small size of their public debt. GDP declines of 30% or more. If that is a success, we hate to see what they constitute as failure. One might also want to realize that the Baltics had low debt levels to start off with. We're also not familiar with the concept of 'phantom' growth that Acting Man seems to apply to public spending. It's not an economic concept and those 30%+ GDP declines are pretty real, as well as the economic consequences. Austrians usually blame a crisis on lax monetary policy, setting rates below some equilibrium value that sets off too much capital formation. Ultimately, the excess capital, and the debt that has financed it, has to be 'cleansed' from the system. This is why Austrians are against any government and/or central bank intervention, the cleansing just has to run its natural cause. Fiscal policy should be non-interventionist and balance its books (or is only able to create 'phantom' growth). Austrians want to either abolish the central bank (or even fractionary reserve banking altogether) or place it under the constraints of a gold standard. Markets should be liberalized. We think almost all of this is contrary to the facts. Market rates have been low for decades, with or without central bank buying bonds. There hasn't been all that much excess capital formation. The gold standard didn't prevent the excesses of the late 1920s, and neither has the euro limited bubbles to emerge in Ireland and Spain. The constraints of the gold standard, as well as the euro, are all too real leaving countries unable to deal with adverse shocks, subject to debt-deflationary feedback loops and producing deflationary bias in the whole system. Rather than worry about inflation, we should worry about these, at least under the present conditions. Perhaps the most curious thing is that the Greek economy was relatively fine for decades, even with the host of inefficiencies and bloated state. These problems are real, we're not denying these for a moment, but these are not what have caused the deepest and longest slump in living memory, as the Austrians have it. Nor is removing the bloat and market inefficiencies, while helpful, in and by itself enough to deal with the demand destruction caused by the slump. And rather than a healthy cleansing (of 'phantom' growth), economies which run on excess capacity for years suffer long-term impairments to their future productive capacity (hysteresis). What has caused that slump is simply the combination of hard money, austerity and the constraints of a fixed exchange rate system. Curiously enough, this is a distinctly Austrian recipe. The only useful concept we see is that of debt restructuring or forgiveness, but overall, the Austrian perspective seems to be blind to the constraints of fixed currency systems, the possibilities of debt-deflationary spirals, the ability of demand to run well below capacity and the long-term damage that does to future productive capacity.
