Exter's Inverted Pyramid underlies the MIT School of Thought in Global Central Banking today. There is a significant void at Jackson Hole this year. A duopoly within the Federal Reserve is an emerging global systemic risk. As the global markets continue to test the convictions held in the narratives behind the year-to-date's crowded trades, the prism of Exter's Inverted Pyramid is increasingly framing the debate. Given that John Exter is an MIT alumnus and its alumni seem to be heavily represented in what passes for today's central bank policy making orthodoxy, especially in relation to QE, there is rationality behind the application of this tool in the search for safety and real economic value. Janet Yellen's break with tradition, by not attending the Jackson Hole gathering this year on August 29th, has created a leadership vacuum; which is amplifying the current volatility in the global markets. Her clarity and wisdom could have created some certainty, in order to stop the rot in risk asset prices, as investors and speculators migrate to the bottom of Exter's Inverted Pyramid. By way of another related auspicious coincidence, Mario Draghi will not attend either. Arguably the two most powerful central bankers in the world will be absent, from the annual central bankers' cabal, at a time when there is a loud cry for leadership emanating from the capital markets. This anchoring role now falls heavily upon the broad shoulders of Stanley Fischer. As if by divine providence, Fischer will be talking on the very subject that has got the markets so spooked of late; in his address entitled "U.S. inflation developments". Even more providently, the two themes at the latest gathering will be inflation and monetary policy. Draghi's deafening Jackson Hole silence was amplified by the speeches of his colleagues, Vitor Constancio and Peter Praet , who both attempted to signal that the ECB is about to react strongly to the fall in inflation. Fischer will therefore have the opportunity to reverse the current tendency of some senior Fed officials, who look at the US economy as a closed system in isolation from the global economy, when they opine on the trajectory of US interest rates. Thus far, he has been quite unequivocal on the subject; suggesting that inflation is still too low in his last speech on the subject. His innate Dovish bias, plus the current global headwinds, should provide him with an ideal opportunity to use the Jackson Hole platform; to re-frame perceptions of the Fed's adherence to the current expected path of interest rate increases. Larry Summers, also an MIT alumnus, set the scene for fellow alumnus Fischer to enter stage right; and begin to verbally take back the Fed tightening that markets have priced in. According to Summers, the Fed is on the cusp of a major policy failure ; that will occur if and when it starts to tighten this year. The policy failure, to which he refers, is the pervasive parochial groupthink within the Fed; that continues to ignore the relationship between its policy decisions and the wider global economy. This parochial groupthink was demonstrated clearly by James Bullard last week, when he opined that he is willing to see through the current commodity led disinflation; into a personal tightening bias, as he rotates into becoming a voting FOMC member next year. Dennis Lockhart also said that he shares Bullard's perception; and is still looking for a rate increase this year despite the global turmoil. The parochial groupthink at Bullard's St Louis Fed may not be pervasive. A research article, entitled "Oil Prices and Inflation Expectations: Is There a Link?" by Badel and McGillicuddy has helped to dispel this fear. According to their analysis, pre-"Credit Crunch" inflation expectations were weakly correlated, with a very slight suggestion of a causal link, to rising oil prices. Post "Credit Crunch" the correlation has tightened, with a much stronger implied causal link to falling oil prices. It would seem that there has been a stochastic shift lower in inflation and oil price expectations; something that will no doubt please Stanley Fischer more than James Bullard, as Jackson Hole looms. The parochial groupthink is more dangerously epitomised by the Richmond Fed's Jeffrey Lacker who votes this year; and began to make his case for an imminent rate hike as the markets collapsed. It could be said that this groupthink is a characteristic of those Federal Reserve Governors, who may not be MIT alumni; and who may therefore lack the full global perspective on their policy decision making responsibilities. In their defence, it can be argued that they are more influenced by the relatively healthy employment picture within the borders of the American economy. Furthermore, as the regional Federal Reserve members exert more influence going forward as the Fed evolves to represent US Main Street rather Wall Street, this parochial groupthink may become a global systemic risk. Their job description only allows them to react to global developments, if and when they show up in the American economic data. Bill Dudley is a classic victim of this duopoly within the Fed. As President of the New York Fed, he is a prisoner of Wall Street; and hence more influenced by the pressures exerted from the global markets. His latest speech was therefore equivocal, opining that the current market volatility put a September rate hike in question; yet cautioning that it was inadvisable to make a decision now, based on the current volatile situation, about what to do later in the year. His failure to provide certainty, at this time, does nothing to abate the market volatility; and in fact accentuates it. This defence of Fed domestic orthodoxy must however concede that the early signs of a liquidity crisis, caused by the global headwinds, are now evident in the short end of the Federal Reserve system's radar screen. Libor and Commercial Paper rates, already rising in anticipation of the Fed's tightening, took another quantum leap higher as liquidity dried up during the recent capital markets volatility. Financial institutions are reluctant to lend to each other, which hints at another unfolding "Credit Crunch". The global nature of this emerging "Credit Crunch" is causing conflicting signals; and conflicting stories to rationalize the price action that generates them. For example, observers are at a loss to explain why US Treasuries have not rallied so much during the equity market chaos. Bill Gross is certain that this is because the Chinese authorities are selling, in order to raise liquidity to defend their own domestic markets. This effective Chinese margin call, may also be affecting other investor groups such as hedge funds; who are forced to liquidate their winners in order to meet margin calls on their losers. On the other hand, the conviction, that the Fed will adhere to its tightening schedule this year, could also explain the lack of interest in the longer end of the Treasury yield curve. Fed Governors, who are MIT alumni, seem to have a pre-emptive global mandate in addition to their official domestic dual mandate. The interplay, between these two opposing geocentric groups of Fed policy makers, has clear implications for the global economy. The parochial cadre has the effect of creating a lag between Fed policy and the feedback loop into decision making from a global perspective. In effect, the Fed will therefore always be moving too late to save the global economy; and when it does act, it may then overreact to the global signals. "Taper Tantrums" and whatever their corollaries are called are therefore the order of the day. Contrarian investors should take note of this gift from the Fed! Fedwatchers have already adapted to this dynamic; and have now rolled forward their expectations , for a rate hike this year, into October. Last week's commentary, entitled "Courageous Convictions Get Tested Further" , observed the BOJ inching closer to a new round of monetary stimulus; as the GDP data fell back into economic contraction, exacerbated by the Yen's appreciation. This scenario became more likely, as Prime Minister Abe's adviser Koichi Hamada signalled a Japanese tolerance for a rising Yen in the short term; presumably with the objective of creating the excuse and catalyst for the next wave of easing. Last week, Prime Minister Abe deftly exerted pressure on the BOJ; in the characteristic Japanese style of veiled threats wrapped within polite sympathy. He praised the BOJ for its monetary stimulus to date; and pointedly refused to blame it for failing to hit its inflation target. Governor Kuroda must now therefore risk a humiliating loss of face, or go down gloriously Kimikaze style, in response to his leader's fulsome praise. Kuroda reciprocated with alacrity , replying that the 2% inflation target can still be met with the current level of monetary stimulus. Kuroda is engineering a period of Yen strength, as Japan's export competitors steal a march with weaker currencies, before he is forced to respond to the nation's leader's call to arms. The last commentary also suggested that global policy makers would soon resort to traditional deficit financing tactics, in order to borrow current economic growth from the future. It was assumed that the countries, with the soundest fiscal positions, would be the best placed to adopt this old Keynesian solution. It therefore was no surprise to see the dust being blown off Keynesian economic texts last week. America's Congressional Budget Office (CBO) flashed the green light, by reporting that the budget deficit will be lower than previously forecast. The next US President will therefore inherit a healthy budget picture, which then deteriorates swiftly due to entitlement spending kicking in. Countercyclical US fiscal policy appears to have been synchronised with the electoral cycle to perfection by the Obama administration. It was also no surprise to see France's Finance Minister Macron, in the vanguard of this resurgent Keynesian movement, making the case for good old deficit financed growth; even though French public finances lack the necessary fiscal health to sustain it. Given its healthy budget surplus, in the last report it was noted that "Germany will therefore come under extreme pressure, from within the Eurozone and from without, to start borrowing and spending again"; and also that "A clash of dogmas can be confidently predicted, as global growth slows even further". Macron has now begun to apply subtle pressure to stimulate this anticipated clash of dogmas , using the European Reformation wars between the Catholics and Calvinists as the analogy; and disarmed his Calvinist foes, by promising that France sincerely wishes to cut its fiscal spending to the Eurozone benchmark by 2022. He has also wasted little time in capitalizing on the opportunity, presented by the crisis in China, as the precedent and catalyst for the Eurozone Reformation that he envisages. Macron was less than subtle in his demands for the reform of European institutions, to create the new ones, which will share the economic burdens of the whole amongst each individual member. He neglected to spell out exactly how these burdens will be shared, in much the same way that he was vague about the French commitment to hitting Eurozone fiscal guidelines. He did however inject sufficient gravitas into his invective, with the not so subtle threat that the existence of the European Union itself was at stake. France has truly raised the stakes; which it can do because it has nothing to lose and everything to gain. This alarmism is not without good cause, as events in Catholic Spain have illustrated recently. Until now, Spain has showed solidarity at the national and European level, accepting its fate under the Eurozone budget rules; and applied extreme fiscal austerity, at the expense of the weaker members of its polity, with apparent success based on its latest strong consumption data . In the absence of healthy state coffers, to paper over the cracks, disintegration of national cohesion is accelerating. This disintegration is at its most extreme in Catalonia; where last week its leader Artur Mas called the national government's latest attempts to revoke its regional sovereignty "infinite cynicism" . National elections in Spain are the next emerging fault-line in the Eurozone; which represent a microcosm of the inherent Eurozone conflict between unelected centralised authority versus autonomous local democratic tradition. The global pressure on Germany was epitomised by the Globalist commentator Dennis McShane's article in Politico; lamenting the fact that Germany has no "LBJ" figure, to deliver the infamous kind of Keynesian policies that led to the Dollar being taken off the Gold Standard. The Germans are probably cheering this same historic fact, which currently underpins the Euro's reserve currency status; as much as they are as equally less enthusiastic about the Macron proposals that will undermine it. It was also no surprise to see Japan precluded from the new list of potential Keynesian exponents. Paul Sheard, S&P's Chief Economist, opined that the "Three Arrows of Abenomics" have missed their targets; and should be replaced with "Shock and Awe". Since Japan is currently in such poor fiscal shape, it is premature to look for monetary and fiscal "Shock and Awe". This is more likely to be found in countries like China, with more monetary fire power; which will then strengthen the Yen to such levels that the markets accept monetary and fiscal "Shock and Awe" from the BOJ and MOF in response. Sheard's "Shock and Awe", prescription for Japan, involves nudge policy incentives to massively increase both immigration and fertility. These are subjects that Abe has yet to meaningfully touch upon; and that will take decades to conclude successfully. Japan will therefore have to wait in line, for the traditional monetary and fiscal quick-fix, until its neighbours and trade partners have all had their turn; and the Yen has made up the ground it lost during the last phase of unilateral BOJ monetary expansion. Having kicked the Yuan out of the shadow SDR basket for at least another year and hence the Chinese capital markets into a new wave of lower price discovery by default, the IMF moved to take control of the narrative last week. The new IMF narrative informs that the sell-off in Chinese risk assets is a "necessary" adjustment , rather than a crisis symptom. The IMF is clearly worried that the "not crisis" in China may go further than just stopping the Fed from tightening. The markets suspect that the Fed does not have the ammunition, to respond to another "Credit Crunch", therefore the IMF is trying to manage perception to a level of fear that does not fully test this suspicion. Chinese policy makers have now taken the step of dipping into their pension funds, in order to support the equity market, with new legislation . Rather than selecting economic winners, Chinese policy makers are now selecting the economic losers. Premier Li Keqiang appears to have been selected, as the political scapegoat for the current economic crisis. Rumours of his demise began circulating last week; as policy makers try to draw a line under the crisis by blaming an individual, rather than the system within which he operates. When it became evident that this policy strategy of selecting losers was not a winning one, the policy makers responded by trying to select winners in the equity markets instead; with cuts in both interest rates and reserve requirements. Unfortunately, this only added to suspicions and made the situation worse. All attempts to prevent Chinese asset prices from converging on their lower intrinsic value seem to be meeting with scepticism. George Osborne has been dealt a particularly tricky hand to play. His aggressive public sector cutbacks have yielded the first budget surplus in three years; which will swiftly come at the expense of future economic growth. In markets that are looking for current safety rather than future pain, Sterling and Sterling Assets therefore seem to be safer right now. There is also a strengthening conviction that the Bank of England ostensibly has stronger economic growth and rising inflation data, to allow it to move on tightening before the Fed. Sterling strength has therefore done all the tightening for the Bank of England already; so that any increase in interest rates would be overkill. Sterling has been treading water, until its strength chokes off the economic growth and subdues the inflation data sufficiently, after which it will fall like a stone. To hedge his own position and prepare for the Sterling sell-off, Osborne began warning that it is the headwind from China that will shave points off UK GDP; and not his fiscal austerity regime. When the pressure comes on the Bank of England, to ease back on tightening, China rather than government policy will be framed as the reason. If he then continues to be as lucky as he has been so far, Osborne will get the stimulus from a falling currency and low interest rates; as the tailwinds to blow him on his course from Number 11 to Number 10 Downing Street.
