Paul Singer Joins Icahn, Soros; Warns "It's A Very Dangerous Time To Be In The Market", Buys Gold | Zero Hedge by Secular Investor - Jun 12, 2016 10:42 AM by Phoenix Capital... - Jun 12, 2016 3:18 PM by Tyler Durden - Jun 12, 2016 5:31 PM Over the past month, between Stan Druckenmiller, Carl Icahn and most recently George Soros, it has become positively cool to be a billionaire who has turned their back on the rigged market, and has decided to either get out of stocks or go outright net short (Soros and Icahn), while concurrently buying gold.  Over the weekend, yet another billionaire made waves, when Paul Singer told Institutional Investor in an interview that not only has the Fed's "monetary extremism" hindered economic expansion, blasting monetary policy as adding to not only the world's debt but its social problems (including lack of wage growth), warns that "at the moment weâ€™re either in a stage of stagnation or rollover, possibly in the early stages of a global recession", predicts that "itâ€™s a very dangerous time in the financial markets" and concludes that "weâ€™re very bullish on gold, which is the antiâ€“paper money, of course, and is underowned by investors around the world." As Institutional Investor writes , one of the to avoid losing money during market dislocations. â€œIf you break even in a bear market or crash or financial crisis, youâ€™re way ahead of the game,â€? he says. The legendary investor, who will be receiving an IInvestor Lifetime Achievement Award at the firm's annual Hedge Fund Industry Awards dinner on June 23 at the Why have developed economies been unable to achieve I believe the reason is a bad policy mix due to an unwillingness on the part of all of the governments of the developed world to take the normal and obvious fiscal steps to increase growth. Instead, in the absence of pro-growth policies on the fiscal side, the sole support in the developed world has been monetary policy. Thereâ€™s been a more or less universally practiced set of monetary policies consisting of zero and now negative interest rates and so-called quantitative easing â€” various forms of asset buying. It started out as all bond buying, but now itâ€™s leaked into equities. The result of all that â€” I call it monetary extremism â€” is that the economies have held up and had some growth, but that growth has been tepid, with the biggest gains going to The major impact has been this exacerbating effect on inequality. The large rise in asset prices in conjunction with continued sluggish growth is a terrible mixture, and it is part of the equation of why you have this bubbling-up edginess in society among the middle and working class in the developed world because of underemployment. The cure for the crisis â€” for the debt crisis, the financial crisis â€” has been deemed by the developed world governments to be more debt. There has not been a deleveraging. And after seven and a half years and counting of this mix of policies, at the moment weâ€™re either in a stage of stagnation or rollover, possibly in the early stages of a global recession. So I think itâ€™s a very dangerous time in the financial markets. Well, thatâ€™s a great question, because Iâ€™d go further. The lack of humility among central bankers â€” which is proven by the combination of no apology and no continuously, significantly erroneous projections postcrisis â€” is incredible. At the same time, presidents and prime ministers have been perfectly willing, desirous even, of central banks for holding up the world, which gives them â€” the presidents and prime ministers â€” the excuse not to engage in pro-growth policies. So they can stand there and bash capitalists or bankers and get votes that way, because it distracts attention from their own failures. But bashing capitalism is ultimately dangerous. The reason policymakers think it works is because seven and a half years Policymakers can transition the financial system into being sounder and more transparent, and transition macro policy away from quantitative easing. Stop the bond buying, stop the equity buying, but only while simultaneously implementing pro-growth policies in the tax, regulatory and structural areas. If not actually cutting taxes, making business formation easier and making their regulatory environments attractive to business location and expansion â€” including improvements in trade policy, education policy and job training and retraining. Raising interest rates and stopping QE without structural, pro-growth reforms gold, which is the antiâ€“paper money, of course, and is underowned by investors around the world. And we are very skeptical about markets. We hedge every equity position. Weâ€™re not in the mood to be surprised â€” surprised in the sense of losing large amounts of money â€” ever, but in particular now with this extraordinary and unprecedented situation where the stability of financial I believe the reason is a bad policy mix due to an unwillingness on the part of all of the governments of the developed world to take the normal and obvious fiscal steps to increase growth.

Fuck everyone at the same time. This bomb was dropped on Sunday in China and wow, the implications of allowing massive defaults is not good... It's too bad all the PM"s are so cheap that it's just not even worth the hassle of selling the real thing any more.  Looks like the jews are fucked and won't make it.  All that cunning, planning with ZERO common sense or long term view, but here's an old piece of advice when understanding managing something especially when you run both the fiat currencies and desire all the PM's. SnÃ­pÃ©ir_Ag_Obair Jun 12, 2016 5:52 PM Paper gold is not the anti paper money, and what The OneBank needs is for paper gold's value to go up as against the FRN. You control both sides for max leverage and thusly, my children: "weâ€™re very bullish on gold, which is the antiâ€“paper money, of course, and is under owned by investors around the world." Say the very people who through never ending propaganda spewed forth from the media empires their billionaire friends own have denigrated, manipulated and naked short sold using COMEX, the biggest fraud on the planet. Now that they have succeeded in flushing 1000's of tonnes of physical into their vaults they are ready to throw down against the evils of fiat. There are literally no words to describe how vile, corrupt, crooked and sociopathic people like Soros, Icahn and the rest of these pieces of shit who have hijacked every capital market, destroyed any semblance of price discovery, been bailed out directly by the taxpayers and indirectly through their criminal conspiracy with the Fed and every other Central Bank in the world. Get those helicopters fuelled up and those bug out bunkers warmed up cause you f**kers are going to need them when the rest of the 99.9999999% show up with the pitchforks and torches. Well, well, well, Paul Singer senses doom, jumps the fence. The man who has been complcit in destroying economies for the benefit of US interests.
