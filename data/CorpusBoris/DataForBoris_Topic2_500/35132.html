Previously, he was Deputy Director in the International Monetary Fundâ€™s Research and European Departments. Originally published at Bruegel The Greek government’s mounting financial woes are leading it to contemplate the previously unthinkable: defaulting on a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Instead of demanding repayment and further austerity, the IMF should recognize its responsibility for the country’s predicament and forgive much of the debt. Greece’s onerous obligations to the IMF, the European Central Bank and European governments can be traced back to April 2010, when they made a fateful mistake. Instead of allowing Greece to default on its insurmountable debts to private creditors, they chose to lend it the money to pay in full. At the time, many called for immediately â€œrestructuringâ€? of privately-held debt, thus imposing losses on the banks and investors who had lent money to Greece. Among them were several members of the IMFâ€™s Board and Karl Otto Pohl, a former president of the Bundesbank and a key architect of the euro. The IMF and European authorities responded that restructuring would cause global financial mayhem. As Pohl candidly noted , that was merely a cover for bailing out German and French banks, which had been among the largest enablers of Greek profligacy. Ultimately, the authorities’ approach merely replaced one problem with another: IMF and official European loans were used to repay private creditors. Thus, despite a belated restructuring in 2012, Greece’s obligations remain unbearable — only now they are owed almost entirely to official creditors. Five years after the crisis started, government debt has jumped from 130 percent of gross domestic product to nearly 180 percent. Meanwhile, a deep economic slump and deflation have severely impaired the government’s ability to repay. Virtually everyone now agrees that pushing Greece to pay its private creditors was a bad idea. The required fiscal austerity was simply too great, causing the economy to collapse. The IMF acknowledged the error in a 2013 report on Greece. In a recent staff paper, the fund said that when a crisis threatens to spread, it should seek a collective global solution rather than forcing the distressed economy to bear the entire burden. The IMFâ€™s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, has warned that more austerity will crush growth. Oddly, the IMFâ€™s proposed way forward for Greece remains unchanged: Borrow more money (this time from the European authorities) to repay one group of creditors (the IMF) and stay focused on austerity. The fund’s latest projections assume that the government’s budget surplus (other than interest payments) will reach 4.5 percent of GDP, a level of belt-tightening that few governments have ever sustained for any significant period of time. Following Germany’s lead, IMF officials have placed their faith in â€œstructural reformsâ€? — changes in labor and other markets that are supposed to improve the Greek economy’s longer-term growth potential. They should know better. The fund’s latest World Economic Outlook throws cold water on the notion that such reforms will address the Greek debt problem in a reliable and timely manner. The most valuable measures encourage research and development and help spur high-technology sectors. All this is to the good, but such gains are irrelevant for the next five years. The priority must be to prevent Greece from sinking deeper into a debt-deflation spiral. Unfortunately, some reforms will actually accelerate the spiral by weakening demand. On April 9, Greece repaid 450 million euros to the IMF, and must pay another 2 billion in May and June. The IMFâ€™s Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, has made clear that delays in repayments will not be tolerated. â€œI would, certainly for myself, not support it,â€? she told Bloomberg Television. Inevitably, debt relief will be provided — but in driblets and together with unrelenting pain. The Greek government will need to withhold payments to suppliers and workers, and will raid pension funds. Five years from now, the country’s economic and social stress could well be even more acute. The question will be: Why was more debt not forgiven earlier? No one is willing to confront that unpleasant arithmetic, and wishful thinking prevails. Having failed its first Greek test, the IMF risks doing so again. It remains trapped by the priorities of shareholders, including in recent years the U.K. and Germany. To reassert its independence and redeem its lost credibility, it should write off a big chunk of Greece’s debt and force its wealthy shareholders to bear the losses. The IMF is riven by contradiction. It is no longer fit for purpose. Greece is another country, in a long line of countries that have had their economies undermined, and in some cases wrecked by IMF policies enforced by loans. The IMF needs to be disbanded. All the countries that pay into the IMF should withdraw their funds immediately. Simple math back in 2010 came up with the obvious(for Greece). Default. Of course a Grexit before default would have been rightful but a total disaster for the financial markets(not prefarable!). Still Greece should not be a member of EMU without a single EMU-bond and a common fiscal budget(any thoughts Herr Pohl?). The neo-liberal EU-elite have deregulated the european banks in a way that was far worse than in the US. Germany have done most harm. German banks have traditionally been local and regional savingsbanks transferring low risk-capital to german (export-)manufacture–industry. But in the early 90s a new banklobby started to sell the idea that Frankfurt should be the money-center of Europe(not London). Later german financial elit(incl Pohl) allowed german banks to transform themselfes from savingsbanks(relations-banking) to investmentsbanks(selling and trading). GermanyÂ´s first bad bank was created after i.e DB and CB sold US MBS(toxic derivatives) for one trillion USD(total in Europe but biggest part to Germany)to pensionsfunds and “old school” regional savingsbanks(Landesbanks). That is how the small Deutche Bank(DB) could raise itself from the deepest bottom of less profitable banks to become the biggest threat to european economies. Commerzbank(CB) is another example how the repeal of Glass Steagall have induced and magnified the euro-havoc. The idea that eliminated currency-risks within EU would stimulate trade was instead multiplying credit-risks due to too low interest-levels for low-productivity countries like Greece etc. A strong Euro(think Germany) against the dollar did also hurt countries like Greece were debt doubled in euro before the crises(0,80 to 1,60). To tell the truth! EU-elites have never cared for the interest of the small member countries. They never bothered themselfes to examine the structural risks growing inside the peripheries. How much do you spend and on what? Very simple questions to ask Herr Pohl. The current big question for human beings is whether a genuine partnership can be established between government and banks (with government the senior partner) for the creation of money without the use of totalitarianism as we see in China or the West as we see in the near totalitarianism of the ECB and the IMF. Thanks for this very good article.  This together with how the IMF is operating in the Ukraine is giving us a clear picture of this destructive organization.  In the Ukraine it is supporting a repressive govt while privatizing the gas and agriculture for US corporations. Similar to extreme extraction of fossil fuels, repressive IMF policy if moving into areas with more ability to fight back and making their actions harder to ignore. Five years from now, the countryâ€™s economic and social stress could well be even more acute. The question will be: Why was more debt not forgiven earlier? Forgiving debt is anethema to the governing elites.  for them a social democratic government cannot be allowed to succeed because it sends the wrong message to other states – that there’s an alternative to austerity.  so if the sadistic, unnecessary and cruel torture of the greek population is the price to maintain the idea that there’s no alternative to austerity then so be it, elite circles see that as preferrable than giving even a glimps of hope that a challenge is possible. chomsky speaks about this concept a lot describing it as “failure by design”… his main argument is “a region that falls out of control can become a virus that will spread contagion, inducing others to follow the same path.” foe the european elites, greece must be disciplined, submit to their will and disgard any notion of independent policy or else it can simply fail.  its a rather depressing conclusion
