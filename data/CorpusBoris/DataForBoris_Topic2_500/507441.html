Equity Markets, Banks Welcome Bank Of Japan Policy Revamp - WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:DXJ) | Seeking Alpha Investors around the globe had anxiously awaited the results of Wednesday's meeting of Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Japan is the third-largest economy in the world, after the US and China. It has been suffering from weak economic growth for the past two decades, along with stubborn deflation, ever-rising government debt, and an ageing and declining population. The BOJ has pursued quantitative easing, first during 2003-2006 and then on a much more massive scale since April 2013. This past January, the Bank announced it would supplement its QE program by setting a negative policy interest rate. These policies have clearly lowered interest rates and pumped enormous liquidity into the Japanese economy. However, spending by consumers and businesses has remained sluggish, and there has been no progress toward the BOJ's objective of 2% inflation. Indeed, consumer prices may register a small decline for the current year, with GDP growth of only about 0.5%. The BOJ yesterday announced a major resetting of its monetary policy, based on a "comprehensive assessment of the developments in economic activity" under its policy of "quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE)" together with "negative (policy) interest rate" and a "price stability target of 2%." The revamped policy is called "QQE with Yield Curve Control" and is combined with an "'inflation-overshooting commitment' in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI) exceeds the price stability target of 2% and stays above the target in a stable manner." These are very significant changes. The yield curve control policy means the BOJ is now going to focus on the yield curve and, more specifically, target the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) "so that 10-year JGB yields will remain more or less at the current level (around zero percent)." The Bank abolished its guideline for the average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases, which had led to buying fixed quantities of JGBs at various maturities. It has moved to a more flexible policy of adjusting the volume of asset purchases in the short run to control bond yields, while still keeping the longer-term target of expanding its JGB portfolio by about 80 trillion yen annually. These changes towards rate targeting and increased flexibility in the Bank's quantitative easing should dampen the debate about the possibility of it running out of assets to buy and should address concerns about the excessive flattening of the yield curve and the adverse effects of the negative policy interest rate on banks and pension funds. The BOJ kept unchanged (at -0.1%) the negative rate it imposes on bank reserves held at the Bank. It can now lower this rate further, if warranted, while still maintaining the targeted 10-year yield at the present level. The change in the inflation policy target to one of overshooting the 2% rate "in a stable manner" is clearly a dovish move, signaling to markets the strength of the BOJ's commitment to press ahead with all means at its disposal to counter deflationary tendencies and achieve its price stability objective. This implies that monetary base expansion will be continued indefinitely. There was also an important adjustment to the BOJ's program of purchasing Japanese equities. While the total amount of equities purchased remains unchanged, the Bank will reduce the purchases of ETFs that track the Nikkei 225 stock average and buy more ETFs that track the much broader TOPIX index. This change responds to concerns that the previous emphasis on the Nikkei was distorting prices in that market. The TOPIX bounced 2.7% Wednesday, compared with the Nikkei 225's advance of 1.9%. We consider this policy revamp by the Bank of Japan to be positive for the Japanese economy and its asset markets. The Bank's targeting of the 10-year bond rate, while increasing the flexibility of its quantitative easing and maintaining its negative policy interest rate, is clearly a move into uncharted waters. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that controlling the yield curve is "quite doable." It will likely be a challenge. There is no immediate increase in monetary policy stimulus from the policy reset. The changes should, however, reduce the negative effects of the Bank's policy and make it more sustainable and easier to expand in the future. The new inflation target should give a needed boost to inflation expectations. These developments may eventually lead to some easing in the exchange rate for the yen, although the expected steepening of the yield curve and the US Fed's delay in raising rates could work against yen depreciation. The BOJ's outlook for the Japanese economy is "a moderate expanding trend." Exports are expected to remain "sluggish," as is production. Monetary policy will remain supportive, and fiscal stimulus is projected to increase. Progress on economic reforms is promised and is greatly needed. Japan's equity markets responded favorably to the new BOJ policies, as noted above. The Japan ETFs that are currently in Cumberland's International and Tactical Trend Portfolios are reflecting this movement. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSEARCA: EWJ ), rose 2.93% yesterday, and is up 5.28% for the year to date. The iShares MSCI Japan Small-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA: SCJ ), advanced 2.54% and is up 7.34% year to date. The currency-hedged WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEARCA: DXJ ), rose a more modest 1.97% as the yen increased by about 1.3% versus the US dollar. The 19% increase in the yen-USD exchange rate this year is reflected in DXJ's year-to-date decline of -13.41%. If the yen does start to decline as the BOJ policy changes take hold, this ETF will continue to recover, likely outperforming unhedged Japan ETFs.
