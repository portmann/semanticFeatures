Altogether, the government guaranteed some $584 billion in mortgages through federal agencies in 2010, and $1 trillion through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Photo: MANUEL BALCE CENETA/ASSOCIATED PRESS Itâ€™s no secret Washington tried to prevent an even deeper economic collapse by launching a $787 billion stimulus program in 2009. Whatâ€™s much less appreciated is how the federal government provided an economic boost of roughly the same magnitude through scores of federal lending programs. A new paper published by the Brookings Institution estimates the economic impact of more than 150 federal credit programsâ€”from mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration to loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration . Those programs sharply expanded during the recession and yielded stimulus in 2010 of $344 billion, according to Deborah Lucas, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That’sÂ similar to the economic impact of the stimulus bill in the same year. The calculation measures borrowing that likely wouldnâ€™t have taken place if borrowers had to seek private lending sources, many of which pulled back in the aftermath of the crisis. Altogether, the government guaranteed some $584 billion in mortgages through federal agencies in 2010, and $1 trillion through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. How much did this all cost the government? Thereâ€™s considerable debate over how the government should account for the programs’ costs. Right now, federal agencies use one form of accounting that estimates the lifetime cost of a new loan by discounting all of the governmentâ€™s future cash flows to a present value at the time the loan is made. Using that method, these programs actually make money for the government, at least on paper. A fair-value accounting method, meanwhile, measures the costs of federal guarantees at market prices.Â The Congressional Budget Office prepares cost estimates using both methods. Ms. Lucas uses the latter method to calculate that all the loans made or insured by the government in 2010 carried a cost of nearly $71 billion. That sounds like a lot of money, but it carries a significant bang for the buckâ€”around $4.86 in stimulus for every $1 of taxpayer cost. By contrast, the CBO previously estimated the stimulus bill had less than $1.50 in stimulus for every $1 in cost. The upshot is that credit guarantees can serve as a hidden form of fiscal policy, the sort that kicks in more dramatically when the economy contracts and private lending grows more expensive. They also doesnâ€™t need to wait for Congress to pass a law and the president to sign a bill. They’re automatic. To be sure, these programs could end up having a bigger cost for the government if borrowers defaulted in large numbers on their loans, wiping out the potential stimulus from such lending. ButÂ they can provide a key transmission mechanism for monetary policy by providing a channel for consumers and businesses to access credit at lower interest rates. The analysis, Ms. Lucas writes, â€œraises the intriguing questionâ€? of whether the housing market owes its recovery to the availability of credit through federal lending guarantees as much as it does to actions by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Ms. Lucas says the availability of publicly backed lending programs in the U.S. might also explain why it has enjoyed a stronger recovery than Europe, where thereâ€™s much less reliance on similarly structured credit programs. The Congressional Budget Office provides cost estimates using Federal Credit Reform Act standards in addition to fair-value accounting standards. An earlier version of this article said the CBO provides estimates using the latter method. (March 10, 2016) So debt is good private or public. Recovery-- is based on anything other than the reason for maintenance of a sick economy. Pull the oil and gas stimulus out and recalculate it all. What about the White House using the illegal Net Worth Sweep of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to avoid hitting the Debt Ceiling? Nothing was sucked up. The system was awash in excess reserves. If there had been "crowding out", interest rates would have been increasing. The message seems to be that the real economy was very sensitive to the availability of private lending. What seems not to have been taken into account was the fact that the $787 billion stimulus program was financed by selling bonds. If freeing up money for lending "yielded stimulus in 2010 of $344 billion," what was the suppressing effect of sucking up $787 billion for the deficit financing of the putative "stimulus program".
