Sat, 03/28/2015 - 20:36 | 5938192 Farqued Up What I cannot believe is that the EU is on an upswing. I would have guessed that the curve would look like a ball rolling off a table top. Goes way back, but it remains the human condition. Every economy is now fiat based with the debt that goes with it. We are all debt slaves (if not personally in debt, then your government or company is a debtor), with various liquidity conditions, some can make minimum payments, others not.

I'm not saying it's the wrong strategy, just that there are costs associated with such a move... Sat, 03/28/2015 - 20:20 | 5938151 JustObserving Many Greeks are realizing that they are debt slaves. No matter how hard you try, it is hard to love your masters. What is the chance that Greece can ever pay off its debt?  Less than zero.  So Greeks better be looking for a way out. That is what the polls show. The Greek government keeps trying to appease its owners though: The Greek Syriza-led government sent a list of austerity measures to its international creditors on Friday. Syrizaâ€™s proposals have to be agreed by the â€œBrussels Groupâ€?, consisting of the Eurogroup, European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), before any of the outstanding â‚¬7.2 billion in loans can be made available to the bankrupt state. The government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had previously agreed to send the list by Monday. Specific austerity measures were demanded of Greece following  last weekâ€™s summit  of European leaders. The content of Syrizaâ€™s proposals has not yet been publicised, but the conservative daily newspaper Kathemerini has reported that they include some â‚¬3 billion in â€œmuch-needed revenue.â€? Other measures include pro-business â€œreforms to improve Greece's investment climate,â€? as well as â€œprivatizations, such as regional airports.â€? The governmentâ€™s position on the possible lifting of VAT exemption is unclear, and it is also not known whether or not there will be an extension of the hated property tax. It is by no means certain that these measures will be enough to convince the creditors, especially as Syriza claimed for days beforehand that the list will not include â€œrecessionaryâ€? measures such as cuts to salaries and pensions. Greece will be unable to make it past April 20 without access to external funding, Reuters reported. Such a scenario would quickly trigger a default on a total debt of â‚¬320 billion.

The Euro is the key mechanism for centralization of power in Germany.  Germany, with its uber-efficient factories, disciplined labor force, and high tech, overpowers the manufacturers of all the other EU countries. German exports grow and Germany runs huge trade and financial surpluses.  Other nations in the EU cannot adjust the value of their currency or interest rate policies to regain competitiveness.  The Euro is a boon  to Germany and a strait-jacket for the other members of the Euro zone. Greece is a sub-prime buyer/borrower from Germany.  Any European in business knows the history and reputation of Greece as a very bad credit risk.  But, with Greece in the Euro, Germany sells vast amounts of goods and services to Greece, while German, French, and Italian banks provide the vendor-financing.  The banks know they can rely upon their governments to arrange a bail-out if Greece does not pay.  Sure enough, when the EU banks and economies catch contagion in 2009 and 2010 from the 2008 US sub-prime meltdown, the governments of Germany, France and Italy engineer a bail-out of their banks through the Troika "bail-out" of Greece. In the "Greek bailout", Greece is saddled with the cost of relieving the German, French, and Italian banks of the worthless Greek sovereign bonds and Greek bank IOUs they took as collateral for Euros advanced to Greece and Greek banks.  The Greek treasury is now the debtor for all the bail-out funds, and austerity is imposed on the Greek government to prioritize debt repayment over all other expenditures.  Greece goes into a depression and suffers 25% overall unemployment, 55%+ youth unemployment, and massive social suffering.  The rest of the "PIIGS" are treated similarly, with the EU forcing all of them to adopt austerity as the new economic/budgetary remedy for debt and lack of competitiveness. Austerity has similar effects in all the PIIGS. Greek voters elect Syriza to get relief from austerity and to stop the fire-sale of Greek assets under IMF rules.  But the voters want to keep the Euro and stay in the EU.  Tsipras and Varoufakis stopped the sale of assets and are playing out the charade of seeking relief from austerity, and seeking debt relief, knowing full well that the Troika and Germany (see Schaeuble) will stonewall any relief.   The Troika, Germany, and the ruling politicians in Spain and Portugal torpedo every attempt by Greece to negotiate relief.   Why?  Any relief to Greece will encourage anti-austerity, anti-Euro political sentiments, will create doubts about eventual repayment of PIIGS debts, will damage faith in the Euro and the EU banking system, and any rearrangement of the Euro system might weaken Germany's export domination in the EU. The Troika and Germany insist that Greece must re-confirm its commitment to austerity, asset sales, and "reforms" while accepting periodic loans to keep up its loan payments, i.e. "extend and pretend" that Greece will eventually repay the debts.  Tsipras keeps putting forward lists of "reforms", knowing they will not be accepted by the Troika.  Schaeulbe and Dijselbloem play out their roles as the perfect Teutonic "NO-men" to the Greeks.  Tsipras acts as the earnest nice-guy just trying to get relief for his suffering voters but being punched in the face by the nasty Troika and German operatives.  The stage is being set by Syriza for a referrendum of the Greek people to be given the choice between: (a) continue with austerity and misery in the Euro but survive with a drip-feed of new loans to keep the government and banks operating, while Greece's debt load inexorably climbs to ever-more unpayable heights; and (b) leave the Euro, repudiate the debts, and "do an Iceland".  There will be economic and financial dislocations but eventually Greeks will be better off. Without a mandate from the Greek people to leave the Euro, and even leave the EU, Syria is trying to negotiate with both hands tied behind its back.  But with such mandates, suddenly Greece would be in a position to repudiate the debts and the Euro system and thus create havoc in the EU banking system.   If Syriza gets its "Grexit" mandate from the Greek voters, the Troika and Germany will face the choice of giving some relief to Greece (and thus encouraging similar relief demands from Spain, Portugal and Ireland) or seeing Greece repudiate or default on its debts and crash the Euro-zone banking system. 1. While Greek requests for relief were being rebuffed, France and Italy have been given relief from their austerity programs, allowing them to run deficits above 3%; 2.  The Troika increases the pressure on Greece, threatening to cut off funding of Greek banks as those banks try to cope with the ongoing run of withdrawals, and refusing advances to the Greek government while repayments on bonds become due.  The Troika may create a Greek default on its own, since the Greek government is shut out of borrowing markets and is running out of stashes of cash it can grab for debt payments (perfect example of Germanic pig-headedness); 3.  Austerity is increasingly unpopular with Europeans, and has not led to economic recovery. The ongoing Troika/Germany versus Greece drama shows that significant relief from austerity cannot be achieved without threatening default or repudiation of debts.  Thus voters in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland are becoming increasingly attracted to ultra-radical anti-Euro parties; 4. Cracks are appearing in the EU banking system from unanticipated quarters - sanctions against Russia, Swiss dropping the Euro peg, and now the meltdown of the Austrian Heta bank and its spreading contagion to German banks; and 5. Draghi gets his covetted QE bond-buying program, which he no doubt sees as the means of saving the Euro, the EU banks, and economic growth in the EU zone, but may be seen as a move in desperation and an admission that they are all tanking. Germany will not willingly give up its dominant economic position given by the Euro.  Nor will Merkel willingly agree to renegotiate Greek austerity because she knows the German people will see this as a gift by German taxpayers to "lazy" Greeks.  German pig-headedness may provoke an unintended Greek default, but at least Merkel can say that she did not agree to give relief to Greece.  Ironically, under the Fiscal Stability treaty, German taxpayers have guaranteed all the debts of all other Euro member states, so Germany is on the hook with all the other Euro states if Greece defaults in any case.   Sat, 03/28/2015 - 20:56 | 5938231 Wolferl And Greece can "default" as much as they want, they still owe the debt to the ECB and the other EU/Eurozone states. So much about "Schadenfreude".
