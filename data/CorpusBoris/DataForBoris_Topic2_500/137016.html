What's Next For Greece? | Seeking Alpha The Tsipras government will most likely reach a final agreement with the EU on a third bailout program. This would pave the way for a near-term recovery in Greeceâ€™s economy and financial system, including its stock market. Even so, the probability that Greece will leave the euro within the next five years is higher now, by my estimates above 50%. In my January 2015 article, Greece s Parliamentary Election: The More Things Change . . . , I argued that the new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, would agree to continue the bailout regime with the troika. Indeed, unless he was willing to take Greece out of the euro, he had no choice. With a need for more money to meet its obligations but without control over the printing presses, Greece would have to accede to the demands of its creditors. Exiting the euro was not part of Mr. Tsipras' popular mandate. However, I did not foresee the irrational behavior of Mr. Tsipras' negotiating team (and its economic advisors). I thought that the Tsipras government would recognize the importance of preserving the progress made by the economy after four tough years and also seek to avoid inflicting more suffering upon the Greek people. While negotiators might seek concessions from creditors early on, surely, I thought, they would sign on to the bailout program in a timely manner to avoid further economic damage. Given the progress already made on restructuring the Greek economy, they should have demanded adjustments to the program only if the plight of the average Greek citizen failed to show steady improvement. To me, this was the appropriate middle ground. Instead, Mr. Tsipras' negotiators played a game of obfuscation, railing against austerity and the Germans, demanding war reparations and complaining about the loss of Greek sovereignty. At the outset, they failed to make their proposals specific and complete. Later, they wavered in their positions and refused to budge from their anti-austerity stance. (To be fair, it was reported that EU negotiators also made no new concessions to Greece.) In effect, the Greek negotiating stance was akin to a poker player trying to bluff his way to a win after laying his cards face up on the table. The Greeks had already signed on to the program years before and were in no position to negotiate any major changes, after failing repeatedly to implement key provisions of it. Everyone knew that. As a result, the Greek negotiators quickly developed a reputation among EU legislators, finance ministers and the business media as amateurs. By the end of the process, everyone seemed fed up with dealing with the Greeks. More importantly, by delaying the follow-through on the bailout program and by raising the specter that a deal might not be reached, Greece's negotiators may have inflicted serious damage on Greece's economy. Business activity has slowed. Businesses have delayed new investment. Capital has left the country. Bank deposits have left the financial system. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, in a recent interview , said that the Greek government is responsible for the sharp deterioration in the economy since the beginning of the year. It is still too early to know how much of a setback the Greek economy has suffered and how quickly it can recover. What we do know, however, is that the government's funding shortfall (and therefore the cost of the bailout program) has increased by tens of billions of euros, perhaps by as much as €100 billion. Could it really be that Mr. Tsipras was willing to suffer a shortfall of €100 billion in Greece's economy on a bet that EU negotiators would not permit Greece to leave the euro for fear of the contagion risk? Is it true that Mr. Tsipras only realized at the very last moments of the negotiations that Greece's financial system was in danger of collapse? What is most remarkable is that Mr. Tsipras' approval rating remains around 70%. The Greek people obviously do not blame him for the new damage inflicted upon the economy. So why did Mr. Tsipras embark upon this course? It is difficult to say for sure, but the short answer probably is domestic politics. Greeks voted for Mr. Tsipras because they wanted him to stand up to the troika. If he had not taken a tough stance, he may have lost legitimacy with his power base. Although most Greek voters wanted Mr. Tsipras push back against the troika, they were not willing to leave the euro. It is not clear whether they would have approved of the government's negotiating tactics, if they knew the harm that it would cause to the economy. Still, Mr. Tsipras and his advisors either knew or should have known and yet they pursued that course of action anyway. The endgame negotiating tactics of Mr. Tsipras are also somewhat mystifying. At the eleventh hour, Mr. Tsipras pulled out of the negotiations and called for a referendum on the bailout program. He campaigned hard for a "No" vote, even as he sent a letter to EU negotiators agreeing to nearly all of the terms of the bailout program. His acquiescence may be temporary. The exact terms of the third bailout program are currently under negotiation. Many of the terms of this new bailout program are essentially the same as those agreed in 2010, which the Greek government failed to implement. Mr. Tsipras is already on record as saying that he does not believe in the program, but agreed to it to save his country from disaster. Negotiating a Third Bailout Program. It would be quite surprising indeed if the third bailout program makes it all the way from negotiations through implementation without a hitch and with the full support of a Tsipras-led government. Armed with the "No" vote of the people, Mr. Tsipras may feel that he has sufficient cover to object to specific terms at any step along the way. While the financial markets breathed a sigh of relief when Greece and the EU reached an agreement on the outline of the third bailout program, they could remain on edge as the day-to-day give-and-take of finalizing the negotiations proceeds. Meanwhile, as the negotiating process continues, capital controls on the banks are still in place, large parts of Greece's economy are at a standstill and Greece's stock market remains closed. (It is scheduled to open Monday with restrictions). If the economy is to regain lost momentum, it is crucial that the government set a positive tone in the negotiations and avoid wherever possible disputes that might be seen as jeopardizing the third bailout program. This does not mean that Greece needs to cave in to every demand of its creditors, but it needs to tread carefully on disagreements and project consistency, stability and reliability in its negotiating posture. In recent weeks, the IMF and economists like Joseph Stiglitz have amplified their calls to reduce Greece's debt burden. Ultimately, debt relief may provide political cover to the Greek government for accepting the third bailout program. Although the government's debt is clearly too high, what matters most are the debt service requirements: the interest and principal that must be paid by Greece every year to service that debt. The average interest rate that Greece pays is already quite low. Principal repayments are a burden, but maturing debt has been and will continue to be rolled over. Greece cannot afford to pay down debt at this time. Yet, creditors want to keep debt service requirements as high as possible to provide negotiating leverage on program implementation because Greece has failed to implement a significant number of previously agreed reforms. Creditors, including Mr. Schaeuble, do not object to debt reduction in principle; they will only consider reducing debt after Greece has implemented the necessary reforms , which they believe are necessary to restore sustainable economic growth. The IMF is pushing for debt relief now as a condition for its participation in the third bailout program. (If it holds firm to this position, the third bailout agreement may be completed without the IMF.) Any agreement on debt reduction will most likely take the form of further cuts to interest rates and maturity extensions. Mr. Schaeuble points out that outright debt reduction is illegal under the terms of the EU treaty. Others are not so sure . Any meaningful reduction in principal may take place only after greater fiscal integration is achieved among the EU countries. Until then, interest rate reductions and maturity extensions can bring about a significant reduction in the present value of Greece's outstanding debt obligations, which will hopefully satisfy the Greek people. Concerns about the Financial Condition of Greek Banks. While the negotiations over the third bailout program are ongoing, there are also concerns about the state of Greece's financial system and especially the condition of Greece's banks, following the steady drain of deposits and attempts by many people to move money out of the country. Deposits have been leaving the financial system since before the January election and have picked up in recent months. With the decline in business activity, banks are also suffering from increases in non-performing loans; but how much remains to be seen. Some analysts are concerned that the Greek banks are now in a deep hole. Barclays , for example, said the banks have lost 25% of their deposits and are now reliant upon the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (NYSE: ELA ) of the European Central Bank (ECB). Furthermore, non-performing loan formations have increased this year. This will probably require another round of capital injections for the banking system. Wilbur Ross, a major global investor in distressed companies, has a slightly different view. WL Ross & Co. has a significant position in Eurobank and holds a seat on its board of directors. At a recent gathering at the New York Society of Security Analysts, he said that he believes that Greece's banks can probably handle the additional loan losses without further need for equity capital. Mr. Ross's viewpoint is consistent with my understanding of National Bank of Greece (NYSE: NBG ). Following its recapitalization in 2014, NBG has had ample capital and excess liquidity. Besides working through its existing NPL portfolio, its primary problem was finding good lending opportunities in an economy that was still struggling to get back on its feet. At the end of 2014, NBG's ratio of loans-to-deposits was quite strong at 83%. By the end of the first quarter, it had risen to 95%. On its second quarter conference call in late May, the bank said that deposit outflows had slowed (following Mr. Tsipras' replacement of finance minister Yanis Varoufakis as chief negotiator). NBG estimated that from the beginning of the year to May 15, it had lost €6.7 billion in deposits or 15% of its deposit base. Using Barclays's estimates and keeping all other variables constant, if NBG has lost a total of 25% of its deposits, its ratio of loan-to-deposits would now be around 110%. This is not excessively high, but the sharp rate of deterioration clearly raises concerns about the bank's ability to maintain its liquidity going forward. NBG has also pointed out that it holds about €37.6 billion cash value of eligible collateral which could support further advances from the ECB. While NBG's liquidity position has undoubtedly deteriorated since the beginning of the year, it is a reasonable bet that the bank is not currently in dire straits and that its liquidity position is manageable. NBG also noted that domestic NPL formation accelerated in the first quarter, but its percentage of loans 90 days or more past due was flat at 24.3%. Most of the pick-up in Q1 NPLs was concentrated in the residential mortgage loan book. In the past, these increases have proven to be reversible. The need of Greece's banking system for additional capital will of course depend upon the magnitude of the additional loan losses. At the end of the 2015 first quarter, the Greek banks had average Tier 1 capital of 13.7%. With certain simplifying assumptions about the magnitude and duration of the additional loan losses, Mr. Ross has projected that the banking system's Tier 1 capital ratio should remain above 10% by the end of the 2016 first quarter. Some banks may therefore need to raise capital, but the amount of capital needed would be manageable and might be done in the form of contingent convertible securities (CoCos), which would avoid diluting existing shareholders. NBG ended the quarter with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 12.1% and a Tier 1 Common Equity ratio of 8.7%. Increases in loan losses of the magnitude described by Mr. Ross would require the bank to raise additional capital. Common equity issuance by any of the banks is probably impossible at this time. CoCos are a good choice, because they are senior to preferred stock, most of which is held by the Bank of Greece. Given that NBG probably has adequate liquidity, it should be able to postpone raising capital, as long as bank regulators agree. This would give it time to determine whether the NPLs will decline on their own, as the economy and financial system return to some state of normalcy. Future Recovery of Greece's Economy and Financial Markets. At this point, the recovery of Greece's financial system and economy is dependent upon the ability and willingness of the government to follow through on the third bailout program. With the stock market opening on Monday after a five week hiatus, we will have another way of measuring sentiment about Greece's future prospects. Any selling at the outset will probably be limited, due to liquidity restrictions that will be in place. An eventual rebound in Greece's stock market is a good bet. The government is well aware of the fragility of the financial system. It is unlikely that it would permit the stock market to reopen at this time, if it planned to take a hard stance in the negotiations. A more accurate reading on the damage inflicted on Greece's economy will probably not be available for a month or two, after companies report their second quarter results and the government releases more current data on the economy's performance. If the Tsipras-led government wants to see a quick and sustainable recovery in Greece's economy and financial system, it should adopt a more positive posture toward the implementation of the bailout program. By now, everyone is well aware of the harmful effects of the austerity program and the suffering that it has inflicted upon the people; but the Greek government has made it tougher by refusing to follow through on certain reforms that were agreed back in 2010. It will likely get little support from the financial community outside of Greece, if it maintains this stance. Mr. Tsipras may be right that these reforms will inflict more suffering; but if they fail to bring about positive change, he can gain the upper hand in making future changes to the bailout program. Such changes could take the form of outright debt reduction or even direct fiscal aid, which would require further fiscal integration within the EU. But if the EU is unwilling to provide this support after Greece lives up to its obligations, Greece will then have no choice but to leave the euro. Extended haggling over the terms of the bailout program at this time will further reduce confidence in Greece and its government. Mr. Tsipras should recognize that some of these reforms, such as upgrading the country's economic reporting capabilities, can be advantageous to his position, since it would also give him the hard data that he needs to support any justifiable claim that the bailout program is not working as it should. Pushback from affected constituencies within Greece has and will undoubtedly continue to make implementation difficult. Greece may seek to phase in certain reforms; but it must take these tough steps to modernize its economy, increase its ability to adapt to change quickly and promote economic growth. If that medicine is too tough or if it changes Greece's way of life in ways that are undesirable to its people, then it should leave the euro. Throughout the current negotiations, rather than saying "no," the government should be asking its creditors "what if?" What if the proposed reforms do not bring about positive economic change? When should Greece expect to see results? How much time should it give to allow them to take hold? How will it adjust the program, if those results are not as favorable as anticipated? In doing so, it will lay the groundwork for future adjustments to the bailout program. As long as the Tsipras government advances steadily toward a third bailout agreement and follows up with confirmed progress on implementation, Greece's financial system and economy will recover. Given the market's uncertainty over Mr. Tsipras' intentions and the loss of trust over the past six months, Greece's stocks and bonds may trade at a wide discount to their "intrinsic values;" but that discount should narrow over time, as long as the country remains on a recovery path. Greek debt and equity securities will also trade at discounts as long as the Greek people show their lack of faith in Greece's financial system by keeping their money under their mattresses and out of the country. Measuring the potential longer-term upside in Greek stocks is more difficult now. Even during what now seems like the best of times, back in 2014, when the economy was beginning to gain traction and Greece was poised to return to the capital markets, there was already some doubt about whether the structural foundations of the Greek economy were sufficiently strong to allow it to remain in the euro. Now, with a hole that may be €100 billion deeper, it seems that the odds favor Greece leaving the euro sometime within the next five years or so. If its economic recovery proves to be insufficient, it is not clear whether other European nations will be willing to foot the bill (or whether Europe will be able to achieve the level of fiscal integration necessary to permit such a transfer of funds), even if Greece implements all of the required reforms. Since its economic recovery will also be very much tied to the recovery of the European and the global economies, Greece's ability to remain within the euro may not be entirely within its control.
