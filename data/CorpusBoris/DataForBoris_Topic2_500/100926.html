Greece: The Rally Will Be Breathless | Seeking Alpha The Greek Stock ETF is plunging by about 17% today, due to the uncertainty that arose from the upcoming referendum. The article explains why the result of the referendum will be positive for the new austerity package and the Greek stock market. Even if the government falls apart after implementing the measures, the next government will be even more pro-austerity and will just enhance the rally of the Greek stock market. After 5 months of continuous talks between the Greek government and Troika, negotiations reached a dead end. Although the recently elected, left government exceeded itself by proposing an austerity package of €5 B per year, the package was considered insufficient by Troika. Therefore, the government declared a referendum for the coming weekend, which caused a bank run, thus leading the government to shut down banks till July 7th. In this article, I will detail why the recent developments have presented a unique investment opportunity, with 40%-100 upside for the Greek stock market for the next 6-12 months. First of all, investors should realize that the Greek government resorted to the referendum only for political, self-promotional issues and does not have any intention of exiting eurozone. The government made its best effort to satisfy Troika by proposing a surprisingly heavy austerity package last week but the proposal was considered insufficient by Troika and hence the government had to come up with an even heavier package. However, as even the first package raised enormous complaints from the strong, anti-austerity minority within the governing party (as expected for a left party), Prime Minister Tsipras would not be able to get a unanimous approval of a new package from his own party. Therefore, he resorted to Greek citizens in order to show to his minority that the Greek citizens prefer the new measures to a Grexit scenario. Investors should not have any doubts for the outcome of the referendum, as polls have repeatedly shown that about 2/3rds of Greeks are against Grexit, including a Gallup (Greek language publication) that was publicized yesterday. Moreover, Tsipras has repeatedly proved that he is against Grexit and will do (almost) everything needed to avoid such a scenario. He was just forced to declare a referendum in order to get the approval of the anti-austerity minority in his party, as the latter would run out of arguments after a positive public vote. The main reason that the Greeks will vote in favor of the new austerity measures is that the majority of Greeks is extremely afraid of the unknown (Grexit). While most of Greeks have been severely beaten by the prolonged austerity measures, which have resulted in a world-record streak of recession (about 28% in 5 years, deeper than the Great Depression), they are even more frightened by the unknown consequences of a currency change. To be sure, during the weekend, there was not only a bank run, but also a gas station run and a supermarket run. People were purchasing hefty amounts of evaporated milk as if they were preparing for a war! While this is totally irrational, panic-driven behavior, it is the sad reality. As evidenced by the reaction of most citizens, the judgment capacity of the average Greek is not that great (I cannot come up with a more polite expression for the sell-out of evaporated milk given the ample domestic milk production). Even worse, all the media, from the largest TV channel to the smallest newspaper, have been doing their best to frighten the public and beat the government because they have built up very strong relations with the two parties that governed the country for the last 40 years and are looking forward to returning to power. It is characteristic that all the media were heavily criticizing Tsipras during the whole period of negotiations, claiming that the only thing he should do was to compromise to the requests of Troika in order to release the country from uncertainty. But when he eventually compromised last week, they again heavily criticized him, this time for compromising! In other words, whatever he does, the media will beat him until their political partners return to power. Consequently, the media will keep scaring the public till the referendum and hence there is only one possible outcome; a positive vote for the new austerity measures with a wide margin. For non-Greek investors it is critical to realize that Greece has much more in common with Latin America rather than Europe in terms of bureaucracy, corruption and down-the-table relations between media and political parties, as well as between enterprises and political parties. Nevertheless, the current valuations have been depressed to such a great extent that they have already discounted a high probability of a Grexit scenario. Therefore, the positive vote will release the Greek economy and its stock market from the prevailing uncertainty and hence it will trigger a sustained rally up to the levels prevailing before the political uncertainty started to weigh on Greece last summer. Even better, the current government was the last hope for the anti-austerity citizens. Now that this hope will eclipse, the austerity will be the one and only direction for the country and hence the political risk for Greek stocks will go away for good. It is also likely that the current government will start falling apart after the referendum due to strong internal conflict among its members, which means that it will be a question of time before the traditional pro-austerity parties return to power. It is also worth keeping in mind that a deal with Troika could be reached even before the referendum, though the chances of a compromise from Troika are low. At the moment, the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSEARCA: GREK ) is trading at $9.78. After the expected positive vote, I expect it to return to the level it had before the political uncertainty arose, i.e., around $20. This represents an approximate 100% profit within the next 6-12 months. Even if some investors do not feel comfortable remaining invested in Greece that long, they can take profits at the first strong resistance around $14. If some investors prefer to purchase a single stock instead of the ETF, I strongly recommend Hellenic Exchanges ( OTCPK:HEXEY ), which is debt-free and hence carries the minimum risk, even in the adverse scenario of Grexit. To conclude, investors should realize that the best investing opportunities arise when there is blood in the streets and panic selling. It is exactly this fear that will lead Greeks to vote in favor of the new austerity package, thus eliminating the political risk. Even if this government falls apart soon after implementing the measures, which is likely, the next government will be even more pro-austerity and will just enhance the rally of the stock market.
