Why Buying Corporate Bonds Is A Lousy Idea - iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:LQD) | Seeking Alpha Donâ€™t get me wrong. I like corporate bonds as an asset class. I think private sector ownership of corporate bonds makes good sense. As for central bank ownership of corporate bonds, not so much. But that's what the ECB is about to do. Don't get me wrong. I like corporate bonds as an asset class. And I think private sector investors like you and me should actively consider owning corporate bonds at any given time as part of managing a broadly diversified portfolio. Instead, where I start to think it becomes a REALLY lousy idea to buy corporate bonds is when you're talking about a major global monetary policy institution like the European Central Bank (ECB), which is set to begin buying corporate bonds as part of its ongoing once extraordinary now pedestrian stimulus program. Global central banks have long ago crossed the market intervention line, which is bound to only add to the eventual unintended consequences down the road. The ECB announced in March its intention to purchase corporate bonds as part of expanding its stimulus program that has already brought us beauts such as negative interest rates (this has really worked well so far for the Europeans and the Japanese, right? I hear that it has really helped already struggling banking institutions to have the front end of their respective yield curves pushed deep under water, except that it hasn't at all. What a surprise, since paying somebody to borrow money from you and charging them to deposit money with you makes so much sense in a rational world). Under the program, six national central banks within the Euro Zone will go out and buy investment grade corporate bonds in both the primary and secondary market. The ECB is expected to start slowly before eventually bringing the program up to purchases of around 5 billion to 10 billion euros per month. The ECB's hope is that the program will lower the financing costs for not only larger companies in the Euro Zone (EZU) but also smaller and mid sized companies that could more meaningfully benefit from lower borrowing costs. OK. But here is where I already start to have a problem with the program. It's great that the ECB wishes to lower borrowing costs by providing financing directly to companies, but with core interest rates already at record lows and in negative territory already well out the yield curve, the problem to this point has not been low borrowing costs or even access to credit for that matter. Perhaps the program will on the margin draw out the smaller to mid-size firm that might have otherwise opted against seeking to borrow money in the capital markets, but will it be worth the likely cost of having many existing larger borrowers undoubtedly squeezing the program for all that it is worth, and not necessarily in a productive way for the regional economy. Here's the issue. Most larger investment grade institutions in the European corporate bond market already have ready access to the capital that they need at a low cost. If they haven't used this access to cheap borrowing to engage in new projects already, its not like this new program is going to suddenly unlock this activity. Instead, what this program is more likely to encourage is even more financial engineering where companies are being further encouraged to borrow even more money at low borrowing costs to support share repurchases and dividend payments. And while the investor class certainly loves higher stock prices, we should clearly know by now in the post crisis period that these paper gains are not likely to translate through to any measurable amount of sustained economic growth. Overall, the program is likely to simply encourage more borrowing by companies that might not otherwise borrow that will be put to use predominantly for financial activities that are not productive at the end of the day. In short, it promotes a further misallocation of capital. In many respects, it is the equivalent of a person that maxes out the 0% balance transfer check offers that they receive in the mail and uses the money to buy stocks and send checks to their already well off children. What ends up happening is that the person is left with a lot more debt than they had in the past, and they weren't really productive with all that extra money they borrowed. Can companies roll over this debt into new borrowing at a future date just as the individual can transfer their debts using a future balance transfer offer? Sure. But this is all ducky until the day comes when the cost to do this is suddenly soaring because of some unexpected financial shock that has sent interest rates higher. After all, I'm sure the U.S. oil patch was filled with companies that borrowed cheap money up to their eyeballs thinking that they would be able to roll their debts at a low cost while they sucked in the profits from $110 a barrel oil for the foreseeable future. That is, of course, until oil suddenly plunged to less than $30 a barrel and the ability of many of these companies to repay these debts came into question. The other issue that comes into play is the long forgotten dilemma of moral hazard. It's one thing when the ECB is engaged in the large scale purchases of sovereign debt, which is a bad idea in and of itself given the future structural challenges facing the monetary union. But it is another thing altogether when the ECB is printing money to purchase corporate bonds. For no matter what criteria the ECB chooses, an active management decision will be made at any given time in selecting from what corporate issuer it purchases its bonds. Moreover, it further distorts the pricing function that investors in the corporate bond market should already be carrying out not to mention the fact that the entry of a massive buyer in the ECB will serve to crowd out many of these private investors in the end and force them to pay higher prices to to secure the bonds they wish or need as part of their own programs. Taking this one step further, if private investors can no longer get the credits they need in the European corporate bond market, they will venture elsewhere to places like the U.S. corporate bond market (NYSEARCA: LQD ), or high yield corporates (NYSEARCA: HYG ), or emerging debt markets (NYSEARCA: EMB ), or dividend paying stocks (NYSEARCA: SPY ). We have already likely seen some of these spillover effects take place in the U.S. corporate bond market, which soared higher in March following the announcement of the ECB program likely at least in part behind this news. But the potential benefit of all of these spillover effects for when you get down to it is nothing more than a program that is hoping that companies will borrow money to finance a project that they otherwise would not do because it wasn't going to be profitable enough. And it is coming at the price of encouraging borrowing that might not otherwise take place while at the same time promoting even further the potential for extreme valuations and asset bubbles across various market segments. Put simply, the potential costs vastly exceed the seemingly slim benefits at this stage. I admire ECB President Mario Draghi's determination. He proclaimed years ago that the ECB would do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro (NYSEARCA: FXE ). And he has certainly delivered in this regard when it comes to the deployment of monetary policy tools. But here is where ECB monetary policy makers have come up woefully short in doing whatever it takes to fix the underlying problem. Sometimes, doing whatever it takes does not mean that you need to be actively doing something to fix a problem. Often times, doing whatever it takes can require a more passive approach. Or perhaps it is something more qualitative than quantitative. This is a shortcoming in policy application not only for the ECB but also for the U.S. Federal Reserve here in the United States. To this point, a frequent lament I hear from both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB is that fiscal policy makers are not doing their part to enact the structural reforms needed to stimulate growth. This is a frustration they have continuously expressed since the early days of the post crisis period, as they proclaim that monetary policy can only buy time for fiscal policy makers to act. Indeed, I agree. But the reality is that by monetary policy makers constantly injecting stimulus into the economy, they are effectively letting fiscal policy makers off the hook by creating a condition where the economy looks fine when in fact it is not. This raises an important question. Instead of exhausting all of their monetary policy resources with the desperate hope that fiscal policy makers will finally wake up and address the underlying structural problems that are holding back the economy, an approach that for seven years now has proven futile, perhaps it is time for monetary policy makers to stand back a bit and allow fiscal policy makers to experience some of the painful reality they are otherwise inclined to ignore. After all, nothing motivates a politician to do something more than unfolding events that threatens their reelection chances or their legacy. If you as the Fed or the ECB want action on the fiscal policy side, finally impose some discipline instead of endlessly relying on coddling and hope at your own expense. At the end of the day, the ECB is going to move ahead with its corporate bond buying program. And another wave of gross capital misallocation will follow. Prepare for even lower corporate borrowing costs both in Europe and across the globe. And although the overall size of the program is relatively small, expect a small and fleeting boost to overall asset prices on the margin. Thus, for those of us that already own stocks and bonds, it is likely to provide yet another short-term positive boost. But in the end, this latest program in the global monetary policy stew is likely to do nothing more than further distort capital markets and asset prices, which will result in an even bigger clean up process at some point down the road.
