Has The IMF Gone Rogue? | Seeking Alpha Both sides on the Greek debt negotiations have made grave mistakes. Greece has been extraordinarily profligate until the financial crisis and has done too little in terms of structural reforms. The creditors should recognize Greece will not be able to pay back its debt and the imposed austerity has been counterproductive even on its own terms. Recognizing these mistakes offers a natural platform on which a compromise deal can be constructed. The position of the IMF is especially curious. The research department has acknowledged the mistakes but the hard-line negotiators on the ground have anything but learned these lessons. For the interested bystander it isn't altogether clear what is happening in the Greek negotiations with their creditors, the trio (ECB, EU, IMF) formerly known as the troika. But let us try to make sense of it. We begin with a simple series of stylized facts, stuff that we deem have solid foundations and see what kind of conclusions we can draw from these. The first of these is that, at 170%+ of GDP, the idea that Greece will be able to repay their debt in full (or even a substantial part) is a fiction. Greece would need to run a substantial primary budget surplus (budget minus interest payments) for decades to come, which would be a considerable drag on growth and thereby self-defeating. It would greatly help if Greece would be the master of its own monetary affairs (Japan has a higher public debt ratio than Greece but the situation is rather different because Japan is the master of its monetary affairs), it could reflate, and the combination of growth and inflation could reduce the debt, but even that is a tall order. Most important of all, to make Greece the master of its own monetary affairs it would have to leave the euro. This would lead to a collapse of its new currency against the euro, and while in time that would restore competitiveness and help reflating the economy, its debt would explode further, since it's denominated in euros. We therefore think this is a simple hard economic fact. We don't know why the troika doesn't recognize this. Doing so would give it a powerful bargaining chip, it could offer debt write-offs or at least substantial restructuring to ease the burden of payments in order to extract reforms of the Greek economy. We guess there are two reasons why this hasn't happened (although the IMF has, in one of its more lucid moments, acknowledged this). At the time of the previous Greek bailouts, politicians in Nordic eurozone countries promised that it wouldn't cost their tax payers a single euro, in fact, some stressed that they would make gains (interest payments). Secondly, it sets a precedent and will undermine politicians in other peripheral eurozone countries (the Rajoy's of this world) who have abide by all demands and made large sacrifices to do so. Still, we think the sooner it is recognized that Greek debt will never be repaid in full, the better, as this would open up a new alley in the negotiations (indeed, as we write, Tsipras, the Greek prime minister has insisted just this, debt reduction for reforms ). Instead of trying to squeeze every penny out of Greece it's much more important to restore Greek economic growth. The simple fact is that Greece's economy has imploded by over a quarter, and this in and by itself has made the debt situation much worse, despite rather large haircuts for private investors. Whatever policies and reforms are imposed on Greece, they should be with the aim of maximizing growth, as that makes everything else that much more easy. It is very unfortunate that the whole protracted impasse in the negotiations between Greece and its creditors has been very detrimental to growth. Just as the first green shoots were coming out of the Greek economy, which started to grow again in the second half of last year, it has moved back into recession as a result of The rather draconian austerity imposed on Greece has been counterproductive. The economy has shrunk by more than a quarter, unemployment exploded to over 25% with youth unemployment at 60%, capital, skill, and worker experience formation has ground to a crawl, the hysteresis effects of which will be felt for decades to come. For the people who still deny that Greece has made rather draconian cuts, here is a rather telling graph that sums it up: Perhaps even more tellingly, below is what the IMF thought Greek growth would be, and the actual growth outcome. The difference is so painfully glaring Apart from wiping out more than a quarter of the economy, the creditor program imposed on Greece has been an abject failure even on its own terms. Greek debt has exploded, rather than become more manageable, and this despite two significant haircuts to private holders. In the light of the above failure of the Troika program imposed on Greece, the positioning of the IMF is, well, very curious indeed: The Fund's man on the ground in Athens - Poul Thomsen - has pushed the austerity agenda with a curious passion that shocks even officials in the European Commission, pussy cats by comparison. This would be justifiable (sort of) if the other side of the usual IMF bargain were available: debt relief and devaluation. This how IMF programmes normally work: impose tough reforms but also wipe the slate clean on debt and restore crippled countries to external viability. [ The Telegraph ] The International Monetary Fund acknowledged on Wednesday that it made "notable failures" in the Greek bailout, underestimating how much the austerity measures it pushed would pinch the country's already faltering economy. The IMF made the unusually frank admission in an evaluation of how it handled Greece's debt crisis, which triggered financial turmoil across the eurozone. [ Huffington Post ] Here is the Blanchard paper and the actual IMF Paper . It's actually worth quoting at some length: There were notable successes during the SBA-supported program (May 2010-March 2012). Strong fiscal consolidation was achieved and the pension system was put on a viable footing. Greece remained in the euro area, which was its stated political preference. Spillovers that might have had a severe effect on the global economy were relatively well-contained, aided by multilateral efforts to build firewalls. However, there were also notable failures. Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30 percent of its deposits, and the economy encountered a much deeper-than-expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment. Public debt remained too high and eventually had to be restructured, with collateral damage for bank balance sheets that were also weakened by the recession. Competitiveness improved somewhat on the back of falling wages, but structural reforms stalled and productivity gains proved elusive. Pension system put on a viable footing? Yes, that was the IMF's verdict a couple of years ago, one might want to keep that in mind when you read stuff about Greek pensions, much of it is rather sensationalist. What will also be clear, if that wasn't blatantly clear already, is that there is ample room for a simple deal. In such a deal, Greece would be given debt relief (they can't possibly repay the debt anyway) and austerity "relief" (as austerity has been tremendously counterproductive and most of it is done anyway), in order for meaningful structural reforms (like tax collection, product markets, etc.). But the IMF, or at least the part of it which is dealing directly with Greece, still isn't playing ball (even if there are some reports that they support debt relief): The International Monetary Fund "torpedoed" a recent attempt by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to offer Athens a compromise proposal in tortuous debt talks, a German daily reported. Citing a "negotiator" as its source, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said there had been "tensions" between the EU Commission and the IMF in recent days as Greece and its creditors race against the clock to come up with a debt deal to avert a catastrophic default by Athens. The compromise that Juncker wanted to present to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras would have allowed Athens to postpone some 400 million euros in pension cuts in return for making similar savings on military spending, the newspaper said in its Sunday edition. But the IMF was opposed to any such "bartering", the source was quoted as saying in the report. [ eubusiness ] Now we're on the IMF and Troika mistakes, the following can't be left unmentioned either, about the original (2010) first Greek bailout : Pöhl: It was about protecting German banks, but especially the French banks, from debt write offs. On the day that the rescue package was agreed on, shares of French banks rose by up to 24 percent. Looking at that, you can see what this was really about -- namely, rescuing the banks and the rich Greeks. If you wonder who Pöhl is, he is not just anybody but the former president of the Bundesbank (who was also on the IMF board at the time of the first Greek bailout). Other former IMF officials have argued the same . Whatever the researchers say at the IMF, the actual approach on the ground hasn't changed: Oddly, the IMF's proposed way forward for Greece remains unchanged: Borrow more money (this time from the European authorities) to repay one group of creditors (the IMF) and stay focused on austerity. The fund's latest projections assume that the government's budget surplus (other than interest payments) will reach 4.5 percent of GDP, a level of belt-tightening that few governments have ever sustained for any significant period of time. [ Bruegel ] And this approach doesn't only apply to Greece, but to the whole eurozone periphery, here are the primary surplus targets for these countries: the entire edifice of IMF-proposed macro-policies for the eurozone, as summarized in these numbers for peripheral primary surpluses, was (and is?) all-but-unthinkable. [ FT Alphaville ] Imposing draconian austerity on one country is one thing, but on half a currency block, without offsetting debt relief, reflation, or even compensating reflation in the rest of the eurozone has had considerable spillover effects. Here is the structural budget position of the entire eurozone, which moved sharply into surplus: The effects on growth are plain to see: No wonder most of the eurozone was stuck in an endless recession until the ECB started to consider QE which led to a fall of the euro. Both sides are at fault for the present mess. The creditors failed by not providing debt relief sooner and by imposing counterproductive austerity on Greece. Greece has done too little in terms of structural reforms. Acknowledging past mistakes provides a natural basis for a way out of the impasse where a deal that gives Greece debt and austerity relief in exchange for more fundamental structural reforms is the only one that makes sense. The position of the IMF in particular is rather curious. Their own research department and head economist seems to be at odds with the hard-line approach of the IMF officials on the ground, dealing directly with Greece. This is rather unedifying, to put it mildly. Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
