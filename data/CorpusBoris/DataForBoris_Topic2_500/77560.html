Policy And The Euro | Seeking Alpha Policymakers are becoming more optimistic about the euro area economy. Stimulus measures have led to rising inflation, as well as improving domestic demand. The euro should trade sideways in coming months as its economy improves, while its bond-purchasing program weighs on interest rates. Newly implemented stimulus measures by the European Central Bank are both pushing inflation measures higher, and benefiting consumers, leading to increased sentiment around the euro. The euro area currency is represented by CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSEARCA: FXE ). In June, the ECB kept its lending rate at 0.05%, unchanged from the previous meeting, and in line with estimates. As the euro area economy deteriorated in previous years, policymakers were forced to cut the lending rate, and eventually enact a bond-buying program. Policymakers intend to leave the stimulus program in place until a noticeable recovery in inflation measures occur. "As explained on previous occasions, our asset purchases of â‚¬60 billion per month are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term," according to Trading Economics. Meanwhile, the headline inflation measure remains low, but is showing signs of improvement. In May, the inflation figure came in at an annual pace of 0.3%, above the previous month's reading of 0.0%, while also exceeding estimates for 0.2%. Disinflation took hold of the economy from 2012 to the beginning of 2015, but since stimulus measures have been enacted, the price measure reversed its course. Policymakers' acknowledged at their recent meeting that effects of stimulus are already being experienced. "The effects of these measures are working their way through to the economy and are contributing to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit expansion. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the euro area economy, lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations," according to Trading Economics. Finally, alongside rising inflation measures, consumer spending is also accelerating higher. In April, the retail sales figure came in at an annual pace of 2.2%, above the previous month's revised reading of 1.7%, while also exceeding estimates for 2.0%. Since falling to -4.0% contraction in 2012, retail sales have steadily risen to current levels, seen below. Private consumption is currently underpinning the economic recovery, and should sustain its strength as the labor market further improves. "In recent quarters, domestic demand and, particularly, private consumption were the main drivers behind the ongoing recovery. The latest survey data to May remain consistent with a continuation of the modest growth trend in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favorable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms," according to Trading Economics. Newly enacted stimulus measures continue to aid the euro area. Disinflation looks to have finally abated, with inflation measures now beginning to rise. Moreover, household spending is driving economic activity as low interest rates, and a strong labor market improve consumer sentiment. Although stimulus measures are limiting gains in the euro, investor sentiment is improving as the currency bloc experiences increasing economic activity, which should deter short sellers from taking negative positions in coming months. Ultimately, it looks as if the euro could continue to trade sideways against the U.S. dollar.
