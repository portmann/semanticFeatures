Originally published at his website Any sensible person can see how a certain video [1] has become part of something beyond a gesture. It has sparked off a kerfuffle reflecting the manner in which the 2008 banking crisis began to undermine Europeâ€™s badly designed monetary union, turning proud nations against each other. When, in early 2010, the Greek state lost its capacity to service its debts to French, German and Greek banks, I campaigned against the Greek governmentâ€™s quest for an enormous new loan from Europeâ€™s taxpayers. Why? I opposed the 2010 and 2012 â€˜bailoutâ€™ loans from German and other European taxpayers because: the new loans represented not a bailout for Greece but a cynical transfer of losses from the books of the private banks to the weak shoulders of the weakest of Greek citizens. (How many of Europeâ€™s taxpayers, who footed these loans, know that more than 90% of the â‚¬240 billion borrowed by Greece went to financial institutions, not to the Greek state or its citizens?) it was obvious that, at a time Greece could not repay its existing loans, the austerity conditions for giving Greece the new loans would crush Greek nominal incomes, making our debt even less sustainable the â€˜bailoutâ€™ burden would, sooner or later, weigh down German and other European taxpayers once the weaker Greeks buckled under their mountainous debts (as moneyed Greeks had already shifted their deposits to Frankfurt, London etc.) misleading peoples and Parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of â€˜solidarity to Greeceâ€™ would turn Germans against Greeks, Greeks against Germans and, eventually, Europe against itself. In 2010 Greece owed not one euro to German taxpayers. We had no right to borrow from them, or from other European taxpayers, while our public debt was unsustainable. Period! That was my â€˜controversialâ€™ point in 2010: In 2010, Greece should have borrowed not one euro before entering into debt restructuring procedures and partially defaulting to its private sector creditors. Well before the May 2010 â€˜bailoutâ€™, I urged European citizens to tell their governments not to even think of transferring private losses to them. To no avail, of course. That transfer was effected soon after [2] with the largest taxpayer-backed loan in economic history given to the Greek state on austerity conditions that have caused Greeks to lose a quarter of their income, making it impossible to repay private and public debts, and causing a hideous humanitarian crisis. That was then, in 2010. What should we do now, in 2015, that Greece remains in crisis and our people, the Greeks and the Germans, have, regrettably but also predictably, descended into a mutual â€˜blame gameâ€™? First, we should work towards ending the toxic â€˜blame gameâ€™ and the moralising finger-pointing which benefit only the enemies of Europe. Secondly, we need to focus on our joint interest: On how to grow and to reform Greece rapidly, so that the Greek state can best repay debts it should never have taken on while looking after its citizens as a modern European state ought to do. In practical terms, the 20th February Eurogroup agreement offers an excellent opportunity to move forward. Let us implement it immediately, as our leaders have urged in yesterdayâ€™s informal Brussels meeting. Looking ahead, and beyond current tensions, our joint task is to re-design Europe so that Germans and Greeks, along with all Europeans, can re-imagine our monetary union as a realm of shared prosperity.

Michael Hudson: Europe Tilts East Towards China Bank Super Lawyer, Rodgin Cohen of Sullivan & Cromwell, Says Regulatory Capture is a Myth ? “Any sensible person . . .” Ah. But the Troika are not sensible people or they would realize that this Austerity isn’t working for anybody including themselves. It’s destroying the Eurozone. Greece is only the first casualty, but it won’t be the last. At best they will be able to stabilize Italy and Spain until the next financial crisis, and even that is improbable given the death spiral of Austerity induced contraction. Talking about “sensible people” making policy for the Eurozone is like talking about a “philosopher king.” It sounds nice, but has no relation to reality. The Troika will never admit that their policies have caused this crisis and that only ending Austerity can fix it. The IMF is well known in Latin America as an instrument of American imperialism (in the apocalyptic Cold War … and now post Cold War) … why any European country would even share an espresso with them … is beyond belief! Contraction does lead to austerity … but having austerity imposed by political fiat … compounds the natural with the expedient.  And the expedient is never good in the long run. But let’s admit, it failed, miserably. Yanis V. pleaded ( begged ? ) Europe to stop the current head-on crash dead on its tracks in order to engage in a soul-searching process which would allow for Europe’s required re-design process (paradigm shift ?) But the BB axis (Brussels-Berlin) has fully rejected this Yanis V. proposal… and thus Europe’s trapdoor has slammed shut. The natural consequence now is having a 950-lb gorilla regarding the arch-famous â€˜impossible triangleâ€™ that Greeks and their sisters talk about on every street corner all morning long till lunch time (approx.) The three mutually incompatible vertices of the Greek ‘impossible triangle’ are : (1) The Syriza ruling party staying in power. The uncompliable list of promises made to the Greek people by Syriza has now been replaced by an equivalent uncompliable list of promises made to the Troika. There are people who would benefit from a breakup of Western Europe … qui bono?  Who are those people?  What is their agenda?  Why would you want to assist them?  V for Varoufakis! As many analyses and comments have outlined here … it is wrong to backstop speculators, just because they might lose money.  This includes the banker bailouts for “Greece” … or the massive banker bailouts a few years before that for the German and British banks courtesy of the Federal Reserve. As an outsider looking in and as someone who has had close to 30 years experience of finacial markets, I would concur with the points raised. However, the current state of affiars predominantly lies with Greece. Why? you might ask. The public commentaries made by Greek politicians have not done much to help relaltionships. The problem seems to be that the current Greek government has no idea how to behave on the international stage. That is not to say that they do not have valid points to make, rather the way they are projected. If Greece realy wanted war reparations why has it not/does not start legal proceedings at the International Court of Justice, assuming this is the correct body to which to turn?  Greece and its people need to wake up to the fact that it is not the centre of the universe, that they need to take responsibility for their actions on an individual basis and on a governmental basis and move on from the age old view that they are the victims and that everyone is out to get them – they are not. I have been coming to Greece for more yeras than I care to remember and I have always been left with the notion that this is the ‘could have been country’. So much of its high quality human wealth has been by divisive politicians and the systems set up to ensure that they stay in government that they have instilled a ‘right of entitlement’ in to its people, an entitlement that is not deserved. The only way forward that I can see is for a government – this government perhaps – to change the selfish attitude of the individual into a collective attitude of the whole. However, with this comes a collective responsibility – that interests of the state are protected and that they out way the demands of the individual. SIngapore is probably the best example, where the population regards it  a privilage to work for the state, unlike here where people regard it as a right to work for the state and where the state embraces and courages the competition of the private sector as a means to drive itself. Please. The excess mortality caused by Austerity must run in the tens of thousands. It also did nothing toward furthering its stated goals as every economist even lightly touched by Keynsian theory predicted. That’s why the Eurozone governments demand the Greeks adhere to the old program and do so publicly. Who wants to admit to having killed tens of thousands for nothing? And this is the one lie this Greek government cannot tell. Greece and its people need to wake up to the fact that it is not the centre of the universe, that they need to take responsibility for their actions on an individual basis and on a governmental basis and move on from the age old view that they are the victims and that everyone is out to get them â€“ they are not. That’s a fine view to have, but it doesn’t reflect how Greece is being treated. Greece’s default on their debts – which will eventually be entirely necessary because they are unpayable – is being treated as an impossibility, tantamount to the apocalypse. If you really want Greece out of the spotlight, let them default and become a bankrupt state. I guarantee you won’t hear of Varoufakis again. So you’re saying the German banks should have taken their losses, instead of shifting them to European taxpayers and then demonizing the Greeks? “How many of Europeâ€™s taxpayers, who footed these loans, know that more than 90% of the â‚¬240 billion borrowed by Greece went to financial institutions”. *Thanks for making the case for Yanis Varoufakis, and Greek gov position, within your great blog. I appreciate the great information provided here and I certainly agree that the money transferred to Greece went to financial institutions, mostly EE ones who were not exactly careful with depositor’s money… Little sympathy for their action here. One should be reminded thought that some of the money transfered to Greece was not always rich citizens’ money by the way or some sort of “not-mine big money”. A very significant part of it is money saved by cohorts of prudent middle-income North-of-EZ-savers either directly of via pension funds… I understand that their case, prudent EZ middle class, with a  strong embedded preference to “save rather than build” as opposed to their South-Of-EZ counterparts, they were used to a relatively robust monetary and banking environment for decades, is no NC readership. But is bankrupting the banks where those prudent depositors had their savings is THE panacea? That most certainly depends on your standpoint. But of course, whatever the trick, the tax-payer would have to foot the bill in this case as well… The question is of course: who is bringing the bill? There’s a huge difference between a state insuring the deposits of individual and prudent depositors and using public money to prop up large, imprudent, irresponsible, and criminogenic banks (and especially their criminal managers), who to continue to prosper despite their manifold and clearly visible faults. Depositors at core banks should indeed be bailed out, not the banks themselves as is now the case: no one is bailing out Greece, Greece is being used as a tool by the ECB to bail out failed core banks. That failure is the fault of core bankers who approved obviously un-payable loans to Greece, particularly the 2010 “bailout” that Greece could obviously never pay back. Before 2010 you could blame that on corruption in Greece, after 2010 it is clearly corruption outside of Greece’s control. The “blame game” that Yanis V. is so concerned about is very much real as the forcefull consequence of millenary differences that canâ€™t be solved with an Excell worksheet as Europeans have tried to do. The path taken by the Brussels-Berlin tandem has lost track of the original idea which was to avoid wars, not to induce new ones. So Europe should have tried to conform a solid Free Trade Zone, period. A Customs Union would have pushed it beyond its ‘natural’ limits. A Monetary Union was plain crazy without first having political union, fiscal union and banking union firmly in place. Actually it was a truce, and we’ll see how long it lasts.  They have declared war on you.  When are you going to answer the questions about this deal posed by Costas Lapavitsas? The bailout was largely used to repay Greece’s debts, with those debts largely held by European financial institutions.  But to call these institutions ‘speculators’ is perhaps somewhat unfair.  It is worth remembering that the Greek government produced fraudulent financial figures for many years, greatly understating its actual indebtedness.  The banks purchased Greek debt on the basis of these figures i.e. had they known the truth, they probably would not have purchased the debt.  The blame for this must largely lie with Greece. Last I checked, the Italians, the French, and the Germans fudged their Maastricht numbers, too. It makes sense that fraud is ubiquitous, since the neo-liberals run the show, there as here, but again, there seems to be nothing exceptional about the Greeks, except that they are weak enough to be made an example of.
