There Is Little 'Fact' In The Austerity Vs. Deficit Spending Debate | Seeking Alpha There Is Little 'Fact' In The Austerity Vs. Deficit Spending Debate Economics is not a science able to produce evidence to show any theory is correct - yet we rely on opinion to manage the economy. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman argues always for deficit spending whilst other argue the opposite. I cannot understand why any economist would speak with conviction. I am appalled what passes for economic "fact" or "proven" economic theory. Scientific methods require: It seems unlikely that economics will ever rise to be a science. If it ever does it will be because the structures of both data and analysis reach entirely different levels than they have to date. It is hard, if not impossible to allow one economic variable to change while holding the rest frozen. What would be possible is for one area in a country to do one thing, and another area in a country to do another - but there would still be no control of the variables. A majority of economic data in the USA is extrapolated, lacks detail, and is far from real time. Every economic dynamic must be identified, managed and recorded. Being a sailor, you begin to understand the concept of multiple dynamics. The swell one encounters at sea come from many directions - sometimes reinforcing each other, sometimes canceling each other - but never constant or consistent. With over 7 billion people, nearly 200 countries, and 100s of thousands of business globally each producing various sizes of economic swell - it is impossible to replicate ANY economic situation. Every situation will be different. For any economist to believe deeply in a single economic theory is not logical. Recently Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman, the mouthpiece for neo-Keynesians, stated : America has yet to achieve a full recovery from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Still, it seems fair to say that we've made up much, though by no means all, of the lost ground. But you can't say the same about the eurozone, where real G.D.P. per capita is still lower than it was in 2007 .... Why has Europe done so badly? In the past few weeks, I've seen a number of speeches and articles suggesting that the problem lies in the inadequacy of our economic models - that we need to rethink macroeconomic theory, which has failed to offer useful policy guidance in the crisis. But is this really the story? No, it isn't. It's true that few economists predicted the crisis . The clean little secret of economics since then, however, is that basic textbook models , reflecting an approach to recessions and recoveries that would have seemed familiar to students half a century ago, have performed very well. The trouble is that policy makers in Europe decided to reject those basic models in favor of alternative approaches that were innovative, exciting and completely wrong. Using GDP as the metric, the USA is doing better than Europe. However, there is very little in common economically between the USA and Europe. It is far from proof that what the USA is doing to solve its economic doldrums is turning out better than the path Europe has taken. One major headwind facing Europe is a poor monetary union where the weaker members cannot gain traction without control of their currency. If Europe did what the USA did - what "proof" is there that Europe would be in a better position today? My OPINION is that there are no good monetary options which can overcome a poor monetary union. In Professor Krugman's post, he asserts that the reason Europe is not doing well is because of austerity, and claims Keynesian huge budget deficits would have been the correct way for Europe to go. There is no empirical long term data on the effects of large budget deficits, low inflation and quantitative easing - unless one wants to use Japan. Japan continues to be dogged with deflation or low inflation as well as poor GDP growth. On the other hand, one can look at the opposite approach taken by Iceland (renunciation of debt combined with austerity) which appears to achieve nearly the same result. Neither Japan nor Iceland has economic dynamics which are similar to the USA or Europe. I have never understood the general concept that if a little deficit spending is good, a ton of it is better. One cannot assume doing more of something will give you a better result. It could be the optimum deficit spending was less than the USA did - or even if the long term effect of austerity would have been even better. My opinion is that austerity was not the way for the USA to go based on the dynamics in play - but this is an opinion without empirical evidence. On the other hand, I think that much of the deficit spending the USA did at the peak of the Great Recession recovery was misdirected and therefore did not have the necessary punch. The biggest economic growth headwinds for the USA (and Europe and Japan and to a lesser degree China) is debt. This past week Van R. Hoisington and Lacy H. Hunt of Hoisington Asset Management stated in part : In our review of historical and present cases of over-indebtedness, we noticed some overlapping tendencies with less regularity that are important to mention. First, when all major economies face severe debt overhangs, no one country is able to serve as the world's engine of growth. This condition is just as much present today as it was in the 1920-30s. Second, currency depreciations result as countries try to boost economic growth at the expense of others. Countries are forced to do this because monetary policy is ineffectual. Third, devaluations do provide a lift to economic activity, but the benefit is only transitory because other countries that are on the losing end of the initial action retaliate. In the end every party is in worse condition, and the process destabilizes global markets. Fourth, historically advanced economies have only cured over-indebtedness by a significant multi-year rise in the saving rate or austerity. Historically, austerity arose from one of the following: self-imposition, external demands or fortuitous circumstances. Here Messier Hoisington and Dr. Hunt have partially argued for austerity. Professor Krugman believes austerity is a "new" and unproven idea - but austerity has been an economic tool used since the beginning of time. But here again, the problem is that detailed empirical data is lacking to prove scientifically how much deficit spending or austerity should occur - and under what circumstances or dynamics. If you have only a sledge hammer in your economic tool box, every economic crisis will be sledge hammered. Every situation has different dynamics, and requires different tools of different sizes. Economists appear not to understand the limitations caused by lack of scientific methods used to "prove" or explain their theories. My usual weekly wrap is in my instablog .
