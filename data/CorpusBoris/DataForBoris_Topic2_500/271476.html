Renzi: Eurozone austerity fanning populist flames | Seeking Alpha Dec 22 2015, 03:29 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi is warning that German-driven eurozone austerity policies are fanning the flames of populism, leading to political paralysis across the continent and electoral setbacks for incumbent governments. In an interview with FT the day after voters in Spain slashed Mariano Rajoy's majority in parliament - leaving him struggling to form a new government - Renzi said there was one main lesson to be learnt. "I don't know what's going to happen to my friend Mariano but I know that those who have been in the front line of being the faithful allies of the politics of rigor without growth have lost their jobs...it happened in Warsaw, it happened in Athens, it happened in Lisbon. Let's see what happens in Madrid."
