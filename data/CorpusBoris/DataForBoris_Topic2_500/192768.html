Europe Winning Austerity Battle On 1 Front, Faces New Major Challenge On Another | Seeking Alpha Austerity faces test with emerging refugee crisis. A number of countries in Europe have been experiencing welcome economic growth, which has helped leaders in the euro zone to successfully put pressure on countries to continue to embrace austerity measures. It has worked so far, with Greece being forced to get in line again, and now Portugal the latest to vote in a government that has implemented austerity as part of its recovery plan. Socialists trying to ferment a revolutionary atmosphere in the region have been shrinking in influence, as the population in general doesn't believe they can deliver on their promises; specifically if they want to remain in the European Union. The problem emerging as the EU has attempting to force member nations to be more self-sufficient by slowly getting them to cut back on spending and privatizing more business, and has started to gain a little traction in that area, is the unfolding refugee crisis that along with the slowing global economy, could put pressure on austerity in Europe if costs soar in order to take care of the growing number of people flooding into the region. That means austerity will be tested severely in the next year or two in Europe. Not only will there be tensions between member nations whose more productive people have been resisting propping up those they consider less productive, but there's already growing tensions between those people allegedly attempt to escape from the Middle East war zones and Europeans who already feel they're being invaded. As investors we'll have to carefully watch the unfolding crisis in Europe if we have any exposure there. I believe it's about to face its most severe test as an entity, and if conditions rapidly deteriorate, when combined with a slowing economic region, it could put a lot of pressure on performance for companies doing a lot of business there. The elections in Portugal have brought back the former government which had been embracing austerity. While it lost some power and leverage, the fact the economy of Portugal had been improving helped it to overcome resistance from Socialists trying to take control. It's a small consolation when considering the nation still owes a combined â‚¬78 billion to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Brussels. The IMF recently warned Portugal that reduce its debt load or it would trigger a new crisis. With the victory, albeit one where it'll have to work with opposition parties to gain a majority for approval of further reforms, the people of Portugal have given the overall okay to continue austerity to deal with the economic crisis in the country. As with other areas of the euro zone, that works as long as there is some economic growth and improvement. Now that growth is slowing, how the populace of Portugal and other countries will respond remains to be seen. For Portugal, it appears it will continue to find ways to lower public spending and possibly increase taxes even more than it has. The latest data from Europe confirm the global economy is slowing down. Markit's latest score from its purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed the score dropping to 53.6 in September. Economic growth in the region remained a weak 0.4 percent over the last three months through September, which remained at the same level of the prior three months. Being more open than the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) was quick to say if the euro zone economy weakens it'll expand its stimulus program. If the fourth quarter shows further economic decline, the general consensus is the ECB will definitely take action. One of the major concerns is the slowing Economy of Spain, which had its PMI score fall from 59.6 to 55.1, reflecting the slowest growth rate so far in 2015. With Spain growing at about double the rate of the rest of the euro zone in 2015, it would be a blow to the region if it falls even more over the next several months. My belief is it probably will, based upon the data from the U.S. concerning its growth rate is slowing, and we all know about China. That a refugee crisis is already upon Europe is apparent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently opened up the floodgates for the EU in general, and Germany specifically, with over 200,000 people coming into Germany in September alone, according to Reuters . Merkel has no interest in stemming the so-called immigration, she only wants to see it done "orderly." So when she calls for protecting the "external borders" of Europe, she only means in the sense of managing the influx of refugees, not keeping them out. In Germany itself, the government believes it will take in approximately 1.5 million alleged refugees in 2015. For Europe, it is unknown how many people have entered illegally. Estimates at this time is that 630,000 have done so , and it could be much higher. What is concerning many and could result in major unrest, is the composition of those coming to Europe is primarily made up of men, which account for 69 percent of those entering the EU. The remaining 31 percent break down in 18 percent being women and 13 percent children. The concern is many of the men aren't refugees at all, but potential enemy combatants. What's important to understand is how this may disrupt economics and European citizens. There is already growing resistance to the immigrants in Europe, and social unrest is increasing. What is a major concern to me as an investor is how quickly situations like this can escalate out of control. Merkel acknowledges there needs to be better management of the situation, but doesn't have the will to turn back this questionable refugees. This could be inviting disaster into Europe, which would have serious economic and political repercussions if violence flairs up and the Europeans raise up against it. Add to this the slowing European economy, a tenuous hold on enforcing austerity on member nations, and some nations finally experiencing some economic growth, and you have a potential powder keg brewing. For example, if Portugal and Spain, which have been had their economies growing, are pressured to accept a significant number of refugees, and those economics reverse direction, which it looks like they are, it is a recipe for disaster. Even if the refugee situation weren't a part of the euro zone story, there is cause for economic concern. Add that to it with the potential for unrest and instability, and it increases the risk exponentially. It's not necessarily time to cut back on exposure to Europe, but it's getting very close. Like the rest of the major economies of the world, it is slowing down. I see that, combined with those taking on more austerity during a time when countries are going to be asked to foot the bill for millions of people legally and illegally in the country, as a good reason to be alert to how that will affect investments in European companies.
