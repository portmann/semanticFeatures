Overcoming The Roadblock Between Monetary Policy And The Real Economy - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Monetary policy has run into a roadblock. The stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve has not had the desired impact on the real economy. As a result, the stimulus is causing more harm than good. The next step may be a helicopter drop. The Federal Reserve held approximately $870 billion in assets prior to the Great Recession, while banks held approximately $10 billion as required reserves and a negligible amount in excess reserves. In response to the financial crisis, the Fed lowered short-term interest rates to near zero for roughly seven years, otherwise known as zero-interest rate policy or ZIRP, before raising the rate by 25 basis points in December 2015. The Fed also bought Treasury and mortgage bonds from the banks, otherwise known as quantitative easing or QE, in several stages through the end of 2014. The Fed's assets soared to nearly $4.5 trillion and the banks were left with trillions in excess reserves from the bond purchases, which were intended to keep credit flowing to households and businesses. These excess reserves total approximately $2.2 trillion today, and the Fed is paying the banks that hold them approximately $12 billion per year in interest at a rate of 0.5%. In addition to keeping credit flowing in the financial system, the Fed's intent was to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates through its bond purchases, in turn lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Fed Chair Janet Yellen claims to this day that the combination of these two policies, QE and ZIRP, were largely responsible for saving the American public from another depression and fueling the recovery that we have seen to date. It has been my longstanding view that these policies are causing more harm than good, and that they have not been effective at creating jobs, promoting stable prices or fueling faster rates of economic growth, as Fed officials continue to claim. Monetary policy has had a significant impact since the Great Recession, but not in the way that the Fed contends. Its primary result has been to increase asset prices in financial markets, rather than to create jobs and faster rates of economic growth in the real economy. This is why we have seen such a pronounced divergence between market prices and economic fundamentals. Additionally, the benefits of the Fed's policies have disproportionately rewarded a small minority, while the drawbacks continue to impact the majority. Between our current monetary policy and the impact it was intended to have on the real economy is a roadblock that the Fed has not been able to circumvent. All of the money, or credit, created by the Federal Reserve never ended up in the hands of the majority that would have been inclined to spend or invest it in the real economy. Instead, it ended up primarily in the hands of a minority that were incentivized to invest it. The primary reasons for this are that many households and businesses are still deleveraging, while others are unable to qualify for the credit available. This is the roadblock. Creating more liquidity and a lower interest rate environment does not remedy this situation. Lowering long-term interest rates and increasing bank reserves through bond purchases does create more favorable conditions for an increase in aggregate demand, or the consumption of goods and services, but it is not the catalyst for that demand. The catalyst is real income growth, which is what has been lacking in this recovery. Income growth is the primary driver of consumer spending growth, and growth in consumer spending is what leads to job creation. Job creation is then a secondary driver of consumer spending. The Fed would have us believe that without the panacea of monetary policy largesse there would be far less job creation and substantially weaker economic growth. This is ridiculous. Instead of realizing the limitations and of its policies as prescribed, and opting for alternative courses of action, it continued to push in the same direction. This is what has led to the quandary we find ourselves in today. Furthermore, if monetary policy incentivizes investment to such an extent that it drives interest rates down too low, it can actually thwart an increase in the rate of consumer spending growth, as I believe is the case today. The most significant impact that monetary policy has had on the real economy is through the decline in mortgage interest rates. Lower mortgage interest rates have allowed millions of homeowners to refinance, thereby lowering monthly payments and increasing savings. It has also lowered the monthly cost that would have otherwise been incurred for new homeowners that qualified for credit. The impact that Fed policy has had on borrowing costs has also reduced the interest expense on our national debt, which in turn has slowed the growth rate in our deficits. Another key factor here is that the Federal Reserve is paying the Treasury the interest earned on its holdings of government debt, which is further reducing the deficit. Many large corporations have been able to borrow long term at very low costs, which has helped to strengthen balance sheets. Unfortunately, the proceeds of these borrowings have not been directed towards capital spending. Instead, they have been used to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Lastly, monetary policy has fueled the demand for financial assets, leading to all-time highs in the stock market (NYSEARCA: SPY ) and record-low yields in the bond market (NYSEARCA: AGG ). To the extent that the increase in financial wealth has led to additional spending on goods and services, this is a benefit to the real economy. While the benefits of monetary policy are transparent and have largely been realized, many of the detriments are not. I think about it from the standpoint of a professional athlete who is using steroids to enhance his performance in the short term without consideration of the damage that is being done to his body in the long term. Rather than spend the hours of hard work on the practice field necessary to achieve lasting success, he chooses the easier route of taking an injection. The athlete is the US economy and the injection it has taken over and over again is increased liquidity combined with historically low interest rates. The trophy we have won for one of the weakest recoveries on record is a stock market at all-time highs. But what have we sacrificed along the way and how healthy will our economy be in the future when the drugs wear off? Monetary policy stimulus didn't create demand as much as it drew it forward. It is no different than any of the other consumer-based fiscal stimulus programs that were implemented during the recovery. The tax incentives that were introduced to buy homes, cars and appliances during the recovery simply stole forward demand that would have occurred on its own. In the case of monetary policy, it stole forward demand for financial assets. When the incentives for consumers ended, demand waned and sales fell. When the monetary stimulus ends, so too will the demand for stocks and bonds, and when it reverses course, prices will inevitably fall. Because monetary stimulus fueled demand for financial assets rather than the economic activity that leads to strengthening fundamentals, we have historically high valuations that will inevitably revert to a mean in the future. The divergence between market prices and economic fundamentals is a significant drawback to monetary policy that we have yet to realize. I think the steady outperformance of US financial markets has given lawmakers an excuse to do virtually nothing from a fiscal standpoint over the past several years. This is another significant detriment to the Fed's monetary policy, in that the stimulus has inflated financial asset values, giving the false perception that the economy is a lot stronger than the fundamentals suggest. While putting downward pressure on interest rates has benefited borrowers, it has done so at the expense of savers, very conservative investors, insurance companies and state pension funds that face liabilities in the trillions. From this standpoint, Fed policy has simply stolen from Peter to pay Paul. For savers and more conservative investors, this lost income is reducing consumption of goods and services. It is also forcing others to save more at much lower rates of return on safe investments. While the benefits of monetary policy stimulus in the form of inflated stock and bond prices are largely behind us, the drawbacks that I have listed are not. They are in front of us. The Fed realizes that it faces a conundrum in that more of its same policies will not achieve the desired results, while reversing the stimulus and tightening monetary policy could lead to a decline in stock and bond prices that will undermine the recovery. Therefore, I think it is contemplating a change in policy after the November election that it believes will overcome the roadblock I have described. I believe that the Fed is fully aware of the shortcomings of its policies and the rising risks that have developed from their implementation. It understands that the combination of QE and ZIRP has had a limited impact on increasing aggregate demand in the economy, but we will not hear any public acknowledgement of this, because that would undermine what credibility and influence the Fed still thinks it has. Members of the Fed may discuss the idea of eventually tightening monetary policy, because that falls in line with their narrative of a gradually strengthening economy. The reality is, however, that the economy is losing steam. As a result, the Fed is more likely to move in the direction of further stimulus, but with a twist. Janet Yellen stated in Jackson Hole on August 26 that the Fed will "likely need to retain many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the crisis," and that "policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to consider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy." In my view, this is a reference to what has been referred to as helicopter money. Helicopter money is a reference to a form of monetary stimulus made popular by economist Milton Friedman. A central bank stimulates consumer demand and raises the rate of inflation simply by giving money directly to consumers, as though it were falling from the sky out of a helicopter. This is not what would happen literally if implemented, but the concept is the same. The difference between quantitative easing and some form of helicopter money is that it removes the banks from the equation. During the various QE programs, the Federal Reserve created money by buying bonds from the banks in exchange for reserves. If the reserves are not used to lend, as they were not, then there is no impact on the aggregate demand that leads to economic growth. I envision a program whereby government spending in the form of significant fiscal stimulus is financed directly by the Federal Reserve, meaning that the Treasury issues debt to pay for it, which is then purchased by the central bank with newly created money. This would have a direct impact on the real economy that current Fed policy to date has not. Will it work and to what extent? That is a debate for another time. While I think this is a distinct possibility at some point next year, it would require legislation and cooperation between Republicans and Democrats that may be unachievable. It may also necessitate a crisis of some kind in order to motivate Congress to action. Still, both Presidential candidates have proposed significant fiscal stimulus programs as a part of their platforms. I do not know what the implications for financial markets would be should this come to pass, but it is worth serious consideration.
