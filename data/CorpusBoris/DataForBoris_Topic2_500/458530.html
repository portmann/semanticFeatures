Fundamentals That Will Impact All Our Portfolios, Domestic And Internationally - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Roosevelt's economic stimulus vs. Obama's: The discrepancies in leadership, priorities, and results are dramatic. The purpose of these fundamental reports is to be able to reference them on this site as I write about trades I'm taking over the next 36 months. I'll analyze markets, US stocks, indices, debt instruments, currencies, metals, and energy starting with the trading vehicles listed in this report. If there's enough interest, Iâ€™ll expand to international markets and exchanges. My objective is to get some international camaraderie going as we batten down the hatches amid the eye of this financial storm before we bust through to the other side. 1933-1939 vs. 2009-2016 - You be the judge: 1933: Economic Stimulus per capita: $746 ($13,785 in 2016 dollars) 1933-1939: Federal debt to GDP moved from 39.40% to 43.25% 2009: Economic Stimulus per capita: $2,691 ($3,003 in 2016 dollars) 2008-2016: Bank Bailouts already paid: $14,426 per capita 2008-2016: US Commitment to bank bailouts: 16.8 trillion, $52,688 per capita. Roosevelt's Economic Stimulus, The New Deal or "3Rs", cost a total of $50 billion (876 billion in 2016 dollars) to fund: Recovery - of the economy to normal levels; and Roosevelt's New Deal injected money directly into the economy rebuilding infrastructure, creating jobs, enhancing the quality of life for the current and future generations of US citizens. Roosevelt's economic stimulus was accompanied by accurate economic reporting ensuring citizens could objectively monitor progress of their elected officials to ensure the United States was on the right path The face value of Obama's "economic stimulus" was $858 billion ($960 billion in 2016 dollars) the majority of it tax credits and programs already on deck to be funded. Obama's economic stimulus, according to the hard data, has done irreparable long term damage to the US dollar, debt market, taxpayer and US economy. 2009 stimulus was sold as countercyclical, In other words, when the economy is slow, the Federal government acts as a spender of last resort, injecting money into the economy hopefully in places where those dollars have a high velocity. Didn't happen, over 4.6 trillion has already been paid out to the banks that caused the crisis. Savers at the same time are being stripped of trillions in interest income by the largest negative rates of return in history for the longest period of time in history removing trillions from the economy. During Obama stimulus the national debt increased by 94%, the debt to GDP ratio rose to 105% (113% World War II all time high) and the US taxpayer responsible for the tab has nothing to show for it except a bill they can will to their children. Roosevelt's New Deal put millions of Americans of millions of Americans back to work, The Civilian Conservation Corps alone employed over two million men (2.98% of the 1933 US population). New Deal programs built roads, bridges, dams, airports, railways, schools, courthouses, city halls, hospitals, post offices from coast to coast strengthening America's infrastructure and putting people who wanted to work back to work. Obama's stimulus was void of substance for US citizens, the majority of the stimulus package were tax incentives and programs already on deck to be funded, in other words the 47 billion in handouts to aid low income and the unemployed was on deck to be funded but were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to increase the represented total stimulus amount. Roosevelt's New deal projects included; The Triborough Bridge, La Guardia Airport, Lincoln Tunnel, Overseas Highway, Dams in Tennessee, Shasta Dam in California, Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, The Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State, The nation's first freeway in Los Angeles, The Golden Gate Bridge, The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the 469-mile-long Blue Ridge Parkway, The Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah National Parks, just to name a few. See this SA post for pictures and more information in New Deal projects Obama's clean, renewable, efficient energy programs cost 68.4 billion plus tax incentives. President Obama said he "is committed to taking responsible steps to address climate change, promote clean energy and energy efficiency, to ensure a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations" and "development of innovative, low-cost clean energy technologies for tomorrow" including rooftop solar, energy storage (batteries), smart grid technology, programmable thermostats, methane gas capture. The program also touted achieving an economy-wide target to reduce emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels before 2025 but nothing big on wind (just tax credits) or hydroelectric power. Source The White House. Utility-scale solar in the US now averages 5 cents per kilowatt-hour (more than 7 times the cost of Hydroelectric power). All solar power in United States satisfies less than 0.5% of US power needs. Cost of production, 7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or 10 times the cost of Hydroelectric power, farmers also get a 4 cents per kilowatt-hour credit. Source NY Times During Obama's economic stimulus new EPA Carbon Regulations came into play that according to the US Chamber of Commerce will increase energy costs, reduce GDP by 51 billion and cost 442,000 jobs by 2022. In the US hydropower is produced for an average of 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or 1/7 the cost of solar, 1/10th of methane gas capture. Hydroelectric power is very efficient; "hydro turbines can convert as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity. The best fossil fuel plants are about 50% efficient. The Hoover Dam cost $859 million in 2016 dollars The Dam's construction employed thousands of workers, now in its 81st year of operation it continues to control flooding, provide water and clean energy to millions in Arizona, southern California, and southern Nevada. The Hoover Dam generates on average 4 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each year. The plant has a rated capacity of 2,998,000 horsepower. Shasta Dam in California cost $633 million in 2016 dollars Construction employed thousands, now in its 71st year of operation it continues to control flooding, provide water and clean energy to millions in Northern California. The Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State cost $928 million in 2016 dollars Construction employed thousands, now in its 74th year of operation it continues to control flooding, provide water and clean energy to millions of people in Washington State. Total cost of the 3 dams: $2.68 billion in 2016 dollars. For more than 70 years these Dams have controlled floods, provided water and clean power to millions of homes and businesses at 1/3 to 1/10th the cost of the Obama clean energy programs. Total cost of Obama's clean energy programs: $68.4 billion Cost of rebuilding America during the Great Depression: From 1933 to 1939 the national debt grew from 22.54 billion to 40.44 billion, or plus 79.41% (converted into 2016 dollars from 416.53 billion to 698.93 billion or + 284.40 billion). From 2008 to 2016 the Federal debt to GDP ratio moved from 67% to 105% (all time high from World War II was 113%) When Roosevelt took office, the Great Depression was crippling the US economy. In response, the new president called a special session of Congress the day after the inauguration and declared a four-day banking holiday that shut down the banking system, including the Federal Reserve. This action was followed a few days later by the passage of the Emergency Banking Act, which was intended to restore Americans' confidence in banks when they reopened and rebuild confidence in the nation's banking system. Title I; expanded presidential authority during a banking crisis, including regulation of all banking functions, including "any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin." Title II; gave the comptroller of the currency the power to restrict the operations of a bank with impaired assets and to appoint a conservator, who "shall take possession of the books, records, and assets of every description of such bank, and take such action as may be necessary to conserve the assets of such bank pending further disposition of its business." Title III; allowed the secretary of the treasury to determine whether a bank needed additional funds to operate and "with the approval of the President request the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to make loans secured." Other legislation also helped make the financial landscape more solid, such as the Banking Act of 1932 and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act of 1932. The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 itself is regarded by many as helping to set the nation's banking system right during the Great Depression. Source Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Roosevelt attributed the Great Depression to "unscrupulous bankers and money lenders". he let them go bankrupt, his administration "tried to jail those responsible" for enabling rampant speculation and "unethical lending practices of the banks that led the eventual crash of 1929 (1932-34 Pecora Hearings). Unfortunately there were no specific rules in place to prosecute "unscrupulous bankers and money lenders" and he created the SEC to try and prevent future abuses Many of Roosevelt's New Deal programs remain active today, with some still operating under the original names, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ( OTCQB:FCIC ), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the largest Social Security. Roosevelt accomplished this as he recovered from Polio and dealt with Hitler (Germany), Mussolini ( OTCPK:ITALY ) and Hirohito (Japan) and prepared the United States for, and ti win World War II. Like 1933, in 2009 the US was in the bowels of a financial crisis, unemployment was at a 25 year high and climbing. After a flubbed oath of office that forced him to take it over again he gave a strangely uninspiring and forgettable address. President and Mrs. Obama found time for Hollywood celebrities, Washington glitterati, and politicos of every shape and size but somehow had no room on their dance card for the 48 Medal of Honor winners who attended the "Salute to Heroes" ball, it was the first time in the ball's 56 year history the Commander in Chief was a no show. The day after the inauguration as the 44th president, his first executive order was to officially close off his personal records to the public. Nine days latter his first act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. The act states that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuits regarding pay discrimination resets with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action. Obama's reforms and policy on the banking crisis Rather than try hold those responsible for the banking crisis accountable as Roosevelt did, Obama's "economic stimulus" continued to supplement the 700 billion dollars President Bush authorized for the Banks in October 2008. According to the Special Inspector General for TARP the bailout commitment total for the US government is now up to $16.8 trillion dollars with $4.6 trillion already paid out. Yes, it was trillions not billions and the banks are now even larger and still too big to fail. 16.8 trillion bank bailout commitments equates to $116,525 per taxpayer, $52,688 per capita. 4.6 trillion that has already been paid out equates to $31,905 per taxpayer, $14,426 per. Sources Inspector General and Forbes Economic stimulus for the US taxpayer and citizen was more modest with a face value 858 billion (including tax incentives) 858 billion equates to $5,951 per taxpayer or $2,610 per capita. February 17, 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The primary purpose of ARRA was to save and create jobs almost immediately. Secondary purpose to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession. April 27, 2009 Obama "buzzes" New York City in Air force one causing 911 survivors to panic. May 15, 2009 provision of the stimulus package caused outrage in the Canadian business community, the government in Canada "retaliated" by enacting restrictions on trade with the U.S. "Economic stimulus" drops to about 42 billion after you pull out the tax credits, pork barrel energy programs and what was already on deck to be paid. 42 billion equates to about $291 per taxpayer, $131.72 per capita. What "economic stimulus" did for savers 42 billion is 4.25% of the minimum we know that savers lost in interest income from the largest negative rates of return in history for the longest period of time in history.

Pre 1980 BLS.GOV inflation calculations methods measure a constant standard of living, current methods measure a minimum standard of living. 1980 pre revision BLS.GOV calculation methods put inflation 3 times higher than what is currently reported by the BLS.GOV. The CPI not only dictates Treasury rates but all other Governmental expenditures that are linked to the CPI rate like Social Security benefit increases. From 2008-2015 an average of 1.2 trillion has been removed from the economy annually due to lost interest income on US Treasury debt and increases that did not occur to Social Security Recipients directly as a result of the current inflation misrepresentations by the BLS.GOV. Details, all supporting charts and data How does striping Savers, Social Security Recipients, Soldiers, Policeman, Fireman every other Government employee, their suppliers and the free market out of trillions "stimulate an economy" What did economic stimulus do for borrowers? In 2009 the Fed Funds bank borrowing rate dropped to 0.13%, The prime rate remained unchanged at 3.25% until December 2015 then bumped up to 3.50% Consumer credit card rates remained above 13.00% close to the 20 year average of 14.22%. Not that Japan is any example to follow but when Japan's deposit rates went to zero the Japanese at least had the conscience to lower their prime lending rate to 0.95% At 0.95% Japan's Prime Rate is less than 1/3 of the 3.00% gross profit margin between the US Fed Funds rate and Prime lending rate. Allowed the US Treasury to refinance existing Federal debt at the lowest rates in history ( Maturity Extension Program ). Lock in the US Treasury's debt service cost at the lowest rates for the longest period of time in history, the average US Treasury duration is now nearly 6 years, average yield less than 2.75%. The US debt to GDP ratio is currently the worst since World War II at 105% and is quickly closing in on the all time high of 113% Debt to GDP in 2009 when "economic recovery" officially began 80.10% Debt to GDP at the height of the Great Depression 39% Budget deficits still exceed 400+ billion annually. Each 1.00% increase in debt service could will add 192 billion to the current 400+ billion annual deficits.

China by the Fed's own numbers buried the US during "economic stimulus & recovery" During "economic stimulus and recovery" the USD had an overall depreciation of 10.27% against the Chinese Renminbi despite massive intervention by the Chinese to devalue their currency. Greenspan enabled the Financial Crisis Greenspan's agenda one week after leaving the Fed. 7 February 2006 Lehman Brothers paid Greenspan $250,000 to meet with 15 of its most important hedge fund clients in Lehman's executive dining room. Greenspan's primary theme was the white-hot U.S. housing market was slowing down but evidence of it would not show up statistically for several months and it could take more than a year. Housing prices fell, global investor demand for mortgage-related securities evaporated, many of the attendees at the 7 February 2016 Lehman's Brothers dinner that negated Greenspan's advice watched their hedge funds implode as subprime mortgage failures ignited the largest financial crisis in US history. 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, at the time it was the largest BK in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. In the video below Greenspan apologized for nearly 2 decades of failed monetary policy that put the US into the largest financial crisis in history but kept Lehman's 250K fee and still earns over 100K per "speaking engagement" 31, January 2006 Bernanke becomes Fed chair, his bio. How could this clueless wonder's calls on the market earn him the job to navigate the US out of crisis. They didn't, most traders I know believe Bernanke was put in because he was clueless after Greenspan get the Fed is so much trouble by essentially enabling the banking crisis. Fed independence from the US Government collapsed, the US Government gave the Fed 2 options do exactly what your told or we'll audit you for the first time in 102 years. An audit would pull your alumni off the 25K to 250K per hour speaking tour and onto the jail tour. Bernanke assumed the position for the Federal Treasury rather than the Federal Justice System and currently receives 100K to 250K an hour on the speaking tour. Now Grandma Yellen has assumed the position and is doing exactly what she is told by the Federal Government telling economic recovery fairy tales that no one believes. Fed creditability with the market is at a new all time low. Yellen latest fairytale tells us the economy is in "recovery" and there will be 8 rate hikes between now and December 2018, the market says less than 2. A-C on the chart below shows the markets expectations for rate hikes A) In June 2011 the market was pricing in 3, 0.25% rate hikes by March 2019, with the spread between the September 2016 (GEU16) and March 2019 (GEH19) deliveries at 0.75, position value $1,875 USD B) By November 2013, optimism for US economic recovery and rate normalization peaked with the market pricing in 9, 0.25% rate hikes the spread moved to 2.25, position value $5,625.00 USD C) Current rate hike expectations have dropped to less than 2, 0.25% hikes, with the spread at 0.3750, position value $937.50 USD D) If the market had faith in the Fed the spread between the September 2016 (GEU16) and March 2019 (GEH19) deliveries would be 2.25 reflecting the Fed's expected 8, 0.25% hikes, position value $5,625.00 USD. E) I think the Fed is lying bout economic recovery and rate hikes while the market is overly pessimistic (basically it's telling you to move down into the bunker) I believe we'll see 4 0.25 rate hikes between now and March 2019. I'm in this position at 0.3750 position value $937.50 my objective is 0.8750 position value $2,187.50 quotes . I believe the rate hike won't be generated by "economic recovery" but the US's inability to borrow as it fires up more QE and it's debt creditability erodes. Give new meaning to the phrase "Collateral Damage" (as in borrowing Collateral) The only way The US can fix its debt problem with more debt is if the money borrowed goes to programs like Roosevelt's which injected money directly into the economy. 1933 Economic Stimulus per capita; $746 or $13,785 in 2016 dollars 1933 to 1939 the Federal debt to GDP ratio moved from 39.40% to 43.25% 1939 National Debt per capita $663 or $11,458 in 2016 dollars Obama's stimulus injected money directly into the Banks that caused the problem and pork programs at the same it removed money from the economy through negative rates of return and BLS.GOV inflation misrepresentations. 2009 Economic Stimulus per capita; $2,691 or $3,003 in 2016 dollars 2008-2016 Bank Bailouts already paid per capita $14,426 2016 National debt per capita $60,215 2016 Total Bank Bailouts guaranteed by the US Government $52,688 per capita Hopefully the FOMC will figure out Banqiao banking just doesn't work and misreporting inflation may work in the short term but will have horrific long term consequences. The good news is bad news generates major market moves and powerful trends, it's going to be a fun year for traders who are on their game and have strategies in place to capture them. If Greece a country with a GDP the size of Orange County California, or the UK (3.94% of global GDP) can generate the moves we've seen just think of how much fun we're going to have in the US markets (23.32% of global GDP) with the kind of fundamentals we have and an election year on deck. My purpose in writing these long winded articles is so I can reference them on this site over the next year as I write about specific trades in shares, indices, debt instruments, currencies, metals and energies. I think it's time for all to brush on the sectors you've forgotten about, your shorting and collar strategies. Metals are sure to shine, debt instruments look like they be a downer (rates higher) and we should have the opportunity to pick up our favorite US shares at much better prices after the selling hemorrhage stalls. Few of my favorite US stocks and ETFs I'll be writing about using my own trades as examples (both short and long). If there is interest I'll expand to international markets. Volatility will be high, trade with the trend, when possible use option collars to define your risk on trades and for the duration of every trading period. I run a family office from the Virgin Islands, have about 1/3 of assets in US markets and like to get some online international camaraderie going as we batten down the hatches getting ready for the next leg of this adventure. I have been a professional trader for over 20 years including time on the floor. My sole professional purpose is the preservation and enhancement of family wealth. I don't sell a newsletter, I don't manage US funds (only non US) but I do enjoy trading the liquidity of US markets, especially on days like Brexit. Good luck, America, I can feel the pain and disappointment you must being going through looking at your economic numbers. I sure hope you can come up with a better line up of leaders this fall.
