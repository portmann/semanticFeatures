Pointing to Greece, Japan Chooses Growth to Cut Deficit - Real Time Economics - WSJ That was the message late Monday after the Japanese government released its latest blueprint for growth and fiscal reform. Economy Minister Akira Amari said austerity measures–severe spending cuts and tax increases– only made Greece’s debt problems worse . Critics often liken Japan’s mountain of debt to Greece’s. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014 was 230%, versus 189% for Greece, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Under the new plan Japan will focus on economic growth as a means of reducing its deficit, though it didn’t include any major overhauls . The plan is based on an assumption of 3% growth , an annual rate that hasn’t been seen in the past decade and a half. Even if that rate is achieved, the government would still need to eliminate another Y9.4 trillion ($76 billion) in annual spending to achieve a balanced primary budget–excluding interest payments–within five years, the government estimated in February. The markets largely shrugged off the plan, though some analysts said it will provide a test for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Success would likely mean growing calls for him to serve another term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party after his tenure expires in 2018, perhaps scrapping a party rule limiting leadership to two consecutive six-year terms, said Kenji Yumoto, senior chief economist at Japan Research Institute. By law, Mr. Abe would be required to call a general election by late 2018. Failure to achieve significant growth and cut the deficit, on the other hand, would perhaps make it difficult for the Bank of Japan to end its aggressive assets purchases because of fears about the effects of rising interest rates on Japanese government bonds, Mr. Yumoto said.
