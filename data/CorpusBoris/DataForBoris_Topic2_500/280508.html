A Look At The Ministry Of Finance Japan Draft 2016 Budget | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The current account surplus and balance of trade is improving. The deficit to outlay ratio is shrinking. Rising tax revenue and lower spending is decreasing budget deficits at the expense of lower household income. Interest payments on government debt projected to surge in 2016. One year has passed and Japan has not deteriorated as many analysts predicted. The Japanese stock market has gone up 10% since last year, the yen has been flat against the U.S. dollar, the Japanese housing market is rebounding, real GDP is at 1% and people who invested in the Japanese bond market didn't lose any of their money. I mentioned in a previous post last year that Japan's situation wasn't that bad at all. The current account was improving, the budget deficit was contained, bond yields were falling and I said that the benefits of the restart of the nuclear reactors was going to boost the economy of Japan. Well, two of the 48 nuclear reactors have been restarted and many more are going to be restarted as approvals are underway. With this in mind, let's see how the fiscal situation will look like in 2016. First, let's focus on the trade and current account deficit in Japan. Both have been deteriorating rapidly in 2013, but since 2014 the trend is improving (see chart below from Tradingeconomics ). The latest current account number in October 2015 was a surplus of 1458 billion yen, a huge improvement from last year. The obvious reason for this is because the energy sector has seen a huge decline. As Japan imports around 90% of its energy supply, it benefits tremendously from lower oil prices. The second reason can be found in the weak yen, which declined by 20% since last year. A weak yen will reduce deficits and boost overseas investments. Exports are on the rise but haven't improved a lot if you account for a weaker yen. The trade balance is still negative, but somewhat improving because import costs for oil and gas have declined in 2015. The latest November trade deficit figure came in at 379.7 billion yen. This number is likely to improve as Japan's nuclear reactors are starting to come online. If we then move on to the budget deficits, I have to say I'm impressed by the numbers (see chart below from Correlation Economics ). The deficit to outlay ratio (which gives the likelihood for hyperinflation) has come down from a peak of 62% to 40%, which is a huge improvement. The chart below (created by Correlation Economics ) illustrates that the government has cut back on spending (red chart) and the budget deficits (39 trillion yen) have come down as a result (green chart). Spending is estimated at 97 trillion yen in 2016. It also shows how tax revenues in Japan (blue chart) have gone up due to a rising stock market and the tax hike in 2014. Tax revenues are expected to come in at 57.6 billion yen in 2016. This rise in tax revenues has decreased the budget deficits in Japan. Although I have to mention that this happened at the cost of the public by imposing taxes. The result is a 3% year over year decrease in household income. Finally, let's have a look at the monetary policy and interest payments on government debt. As you know, the Bank of Japan is buying more than 100% of the issuance from the Ministry of Finance at this stage. On October 31, 2014, the central bank of Japan announced it will buy 80 trillion yen per annum ($730 billion/annum) of assets (mainly government bonds) to maintain its 2% inflation target and to keep bond yields at record lows. The yen has crashed since that announcement and bond yield have hit new lows with the 10 year Japanese bond yield trading at 0.26%. The Japanese government is very confident about the economy and didn't increase these asset purchases for 2016. They will maintain the monetary expansion at 80 trillion yen per annum until the inflation target of 2% has been achieved. Today, the year over year inflation rate in Japan is still at 0.3% The following chart below from FRED illustrates how Japan (similar to the ECB) is rigorously expanding its balance sheet by buying Japanese government bonds. This has helped lowering interest rates and interest payments, but this cannot keep going for much longer. At some point in 2020, the Bank of Japan will hold almost 80% of all outstanding Japanese government bonds with a remaining maturity of 10 years or less. This will make it difficult for the central bank to buy any more because banks need to keep a certain amount of them as collateral for various transactions. Once they stop these asset purchase programs, bond yields will surge, interest payments will go up together with the deficits. A currency crisis will start and the yen will plunge. Of course, this won't happen this year just yet. Although I do see emerging problems on the front of interest payments. The report of the Ministry of Finance Japan estimates that interest payments will be at 10 trillion yen, even with the current low interest rates. The reason for this is the quickly rising government debt (232% of GDP). If tax revenues were to drop (due to a crashing U.S. stock market which leads to less overseas profits) or if interest rates were to shoot up (due to an end on government bond purchases), interest payments could quickly escalate compared to incoming tax revenue. The asset purchase program from the Bank of Japan has effectively postponed the bad fiscal situation. It increased tax revenues through a higher stock market/higher taxes and deficits shrank. It did bring in a lower yield environment to spur economic growth, but there is a limit to this quantitative easing which is expected to hit in a few years from now. These policies also had adverse consequences as household income shrank 3% year over year. Moreover, the high amount of debt lead to a significant rise in interest payments, which is a disturbing new trend. Overall, the fiscal situation seems to be contained.
