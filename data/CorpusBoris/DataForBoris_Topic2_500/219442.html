3 Reasons To Sell The Yen | Seeking Alpha Expansion of Japanâ€™s QE program at the BoJ October meeting will rapidly weaken the yen. PBoC's soft monetary policy accompanied by Chinese yuan devaluation poses a threat to Japan's foreign trade. The Bank of Japan can't remain indifferent to the new round of currency wars. The BoJ's upcoming meeting is a key event of the last week of October: there are expectations that the bank will expand its stimulus package. 15 of 36 Bloomberg economists believe that the BoJ will add to its stimulus measures . At the same time, flexibility of Japan's QE program enables one to predict that yen will fall even if there is no stimulus shift. The fact is that Japan's quantitative easing program differs from that of the US or Europe both in scale and in flexibility. For example, if the ECB acquires assets worth 60 billion euros a month, the BoJ may vary this amount depending on the liquidity of the debt market. In the third quarter, the monthly average BOJ bond & ETF buying was 9.3 trillion yen , up from 9 trillion yen in the second quarter. According to estimates by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BNP Paribas, the share of bonds owned by the Bank of Japan will increase by the middle of 2016 to 43% from 28.5% of the total notes traded on the market. The bond liquidity is gradually falling, while number of bonds with negative yield is increasing. The yen has come to stay as the main funding currency for the long haul. Amid the rising risk appetite, the chance for a yen revaluation is therefore close to zero. There are many examples: after Mario Draghi's speech at a press conference following the ECB's October meeting, European bonds with negative yields increased to 1.57 from 1.38 billion euros. This is a strong argument for the EUR/USD collapse. Chinese yuan devaluation is another bullish driver for USD/JPY. Despite PBoC's desire to stabilize the yuan, Bloomberg experts are confident that the currency will continue to weaken due to weaker economic growth and slowdown in inflation, as well as China's soft monetary policy. The CNY/JPY correction has a negative effect on Japan's foreign trade. This can force Tokyo into a technical recession in the third quarter. The BoJ therefore has enough prerequisites for QE expansion. However, with or without a stimulus shift, the yen is likely to continue to weaken. In my opinion, no matter the outcome of the upcoming BoJ October meeting, investors should adopt a sales strategy for the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: FXY ). In the event that the quantitative easing program is expanded, USD/JPY rates will rapidly rise to around the 124 mark. But if the BoJ maintains the status quo, the USD/JPY will continue trading within 119-121. However, gradual improvement in U.S. macroeconomic statistics and higher probability that the Fed will start its monetary restriction in December will eventually allow the USD/JPY to move out of the consolidation zone.
