What Role Will Government Fiscal Policy Play In US Economic Future? | Seeking Alpha The Congressional Budget Office has lowered deficit forecasts for the next ten years, primarily due to the continued low level of interest rates. The is very little leadership being shown on fiscal policy in the near term, and this presents us with a picture of policy drift. While we may have rising deficits over the next ten years, levels that could be worse under a new president,  it is uncertain whether these deficits will raise economic growth. Right now, Washington, D. C. faces a void in leadership when it comes to the construction of a coherent fiscal policy. Future results come about from the current drift in the economy's performance. New projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate where this drift seems to be taking us. The latest figures coming from the CBO, however, indicate that deficits over the next ten years will be lower than previously expectedâ€¦lower by $700 billion. The major reasons for this decline are as follows: government revenues will be $400 billion lower; but interest costs will be lower by $1.1 trillion. The government revenues will be below earlier forecasts because the economy is projected to grow more slowly than when estimates were made earlier. Government outflows will be lower because interest rates are expected to remain lower than originally forecast. In other words, the weak economy will reduce the government deficits from what the CBO originally thought that they might be, even though, through 2026, the government deficits will be growing. The problem, it seems to me, is that the future of the government's budget just seems to be drifting. In other words, there is no one at the controls, neither the administration nor the Congress. With the economy showing such mediorce growth (year-over-year the US economy rose by 1.2 percent in the second quarter of this year) many economists and analysts are calling for a more aggressive and structured fiscal deficit, one aimed at boosting economic growth and raising employment rates. At least through the end of the Obama administration, however, there will be no major effort to change the fiscal situation. Therefore, the Federal Reserve is the only game in town, and they appear to be very low on ammunition. And, the leadership coming from the Fed's board is not gaining any supporters. It appears that even a new president will have difficulty getting an aggressive economic policy through the Congress. Right now, there doesn't seem to be much hope in a strong, focused budget coming out of Washington in the near future, regardless of the specific thrust of such a program. If this is the case, then fiscal policy will continue to drift into the near future. There remains a question, anyway, about what a more aggressive fiscal policy might do in the near future. If the economy is being dominated by supply-side factors then any worthwhile policies aimed at stimulating the economy would only have a longer-term impact and would not changes things much over the short-run. These longer-run programs would be aimed at modernizing and improving the infrastructure, expanding education and training, enhancing the sources and efficiency of energy sources, and stimulating further advances in information technology. All of these tend to have a longer payoff horizon than most politicians would like. The danger of encouraging the politicians to act is that they would aim at potential short-run solutions in order to placate their constituencies and get them re-elected. If the issues surrounding the moderate economic growth are real supply-side issues, then these short-run programs would just drive up the deficits with very little impact on overall economic growth. Right now, the national debt is 77 percent of nominal GDP. Current budget projections will result in this figure moving up to 86 percent in 2026. More aggressive efforts on the part of the government to raise the deficits will only raise this number, especially if the added deficits produce very little additional economic growth. Moving the national debt total relative to nominal GDP up to around 100 percent is not good. Right now there are no indications that the credit rating of US government debt will be lowered, but some of the credit rating agencies are raising issues about the rising government deficits. And, right now, CBO projections indicate that longer-term government rates, like the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, will rise in the future but not in a accelerating manner. The CBO report sees the yield on the 10-year Treasury averaging 1.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year. There previous forecast was for 2.8 percent and 3.5 percent respectively. The current yield on the 10-year Treasury note is somewhere between 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent. This forecast assumes little increase in demand pressures on yields and no changes in the government's credit rating. The rise in the nominal Treasury yield is associated with a rise in inflation that would get built into inflationary expectations, which would cause the yield to rise. Right now, the estimate of inflationary expectations from market yields is around 1.5 percent. The target inflation rate of the Federal Reserve is 2.0 percent, although the market doesn't seem to agree with this figure. So, for the future, expect little coherent direction for the government's fiscal policy. But, expect fiscal deficits that will be somewhat larger than what the CBO is currently projecting. And, if this turns out to be the case, expect very little improvement in the future growth of the US economy. I don't know about you, but I don't find this to be a very comforting picture, especially the feeling that there will be very little leadership on fiscal policy coming out of Washington D. C. in the near future, regardless of the outcome of the election. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
