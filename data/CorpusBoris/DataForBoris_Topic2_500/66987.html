The Kiwi Dollar Will Continue To Test New Lows | Seeking Alpha It is possible that the NZD could breach the 0.70 level in the coming months. Markets are estimating a 42 percent probability of a rate cut in New Zealand on June 11. A new tax on home investments adds credence to the probability of a rate cut. The NZD is currently trading near a six-month low at 0.7311. While the currency had briefly risen to a four-month high of 0.7724 against the USD at the end of April, the currency has continued to revert downwards over the past month. Over a long-term basis, the kiwi dollar has not tested such lows since the first half of 2010, when the rate fell below the 0.70 mark against the USD. However, in the context of the current macroeconomic environment, it is certainly possible that we will see such lows being tested again. Firstly, not only does New Zealand face the prospect of a further rate cut - but this would be compounded by the prospects of a concurrent rise in interest rates in the United States. With a monetary policy statement in New Zealand set for June 11, traders are pricing in a 42 percent probability of a rate cut. However, even in the case that a rate cut should not materialize, I would expect that the mere perception of the same will likely lead the NZD lower up to June 11. Moreover, one-year forward inflation expectations in New Zealand have risen by 1.32 percent from a previous 1.11 percent. However, this rate of inflation growth may not be sufficient to ensure that the country remains in the target band of 1-3 percent, with the current inflation rate in the country standing at 0.1 percent. In this context, a further rate cut is likely to ensure inflation expectations are met. Moreover, with a new tax on home investments to quell New Zealand's booming property market, this has further fueled speculations that a rate cut will take place. The RBNZ had faced a dilemma in that interest rates needed to be cut to stimulate inflation, but this would also have had the effect of contributing to higher mortgage demand through availability of cheaper credit. In this regard, a tax on property investments removes the need for an interest rate rise - and this has added to speculation that the opposite will in fact take place. To conclude, I cannot see a bullish case to be made for the kiwi dollar at this point in time. With new property taxes enforced and the need to combat deflation, the case for a lower interest rate is stronger than ever. Moreover, even if interest rates are not cut officially, the perception that the same may materialize will likely lead the NZD lower over the coming month.
