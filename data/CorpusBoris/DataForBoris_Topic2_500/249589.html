Synthesizing QE Thesis And Fiscal Policy Antithesis Into A New Global Pyramid Scheme | Seeking Alpha Nov. 28, 2015  7:02 AM ET  |  Includes: CHN , CNY , CYB , EWG , EWJ , EWQ , FEU , FXE , FXI , FXY , SPY by: Adam Whitehead The Fed has almost got QE accepted as a normal monetary policy tool and has succeeded in taking the sting out of the "Taper Tantrum". Europe is creating the narrative of reform and deeper integration to face the challenges of terrorism and migration with a combined fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. The BOJ is keeping its powder dry, but the risks from inaction are compounding. Britain U-Turns on fiscal policy based on perceived national security threats and the Chancellor's political expediency. In the previous report entitled " Probing For Global Consensus On Divergence ", Janet Yellen's call for further debate and study of the topic of unconventional monetary policy was noted in her speech on " Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period ". The IMF responded with alacrity, to Yellen's suggestion, with its own forum at the Sixteenth Jacques Pollak Annual Research Conference under the heading of " Unconventional Monetary And Exchange Rate Policies ". This conference brought the top thinkers on the subject together in the hope of developing some consensus. The last report entitled " Framing Global Macro Divergence Within Global Political Convergence " also observed that, relating to this thought leadership process, there was a school of thought being promoted by central bankers who have experimented with QE. Seemingly, their objective is to get QE officially accepted as a conventional monetary policy tool. The IMF conference gave an indication of just how far this initiative to elevate QE into the central bankers' pantheon of monetary policy idols has progressed. This progress report can be split into four "polarised" opinions; that neatly fit with the authors who opined in summary at the conference. Adam Posen, of the Petersen Institute, sees QE as an acceptable policy tool; both in crisis and in normal conditions. Obama Administration go-to economist Paul Krugman's views, are that QE has not been a game changer and neither is it a panacea. He therefore leaves the door open to a further debate on fiscal expansion. The Bank For International Settlement's (BIS) Claudio Borio opined that the limited asymmetrical impact of QE, on the consequences of a collapse in unsustainable asset price bubbles, is not conducive to normal economic conditions. He is therefore a believer in structural economic reform. The Fed's Lael Brainard unsurprisingly is an apologist for QE. She maintains that the Fed has not destabilized the global economy by applying QE. Presumably therefore the Fed will not destabilize the global economy by normalising monetary policy either. Perhaps most importantly, there were no outright critics from either the "Perma-Keynesian" or "Supply Sider" groups. This suggests that QE is here to stay if the four "polar" views can continue to politely disagree. Better still they will accommodate each-others' viewpoints in a grand doctrinaire synthesis of their antitheses. According to Schopenhauer the truth is at first ridiculed, then violently rejected and finally accepted as commonplace. The absence of violent rejection suggests that either the great man was wrong, or that QE is not a "truth" after all despite what some central bankers say. The last report observed that Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart had signalled that there will be a stop-start path to the evolution of the interest rate normalization process. This point was reiterated by James Bullard. San Francisco Fed President John Williams then laboured the point; when he followed up on his colleagues by saying that the slope of the increase in interest rates is the "most important", not the actual move itself. The Fed is doing a masterful job of taking the sting out of the "Taper Tantrum". Market expectations for the December lift-off have hit 75%; so that if the FOMC does nothing, the disappointment and negative backlash on the Fed's communication policy will be immense. It therefore seems that the Dallas Fed's Robert Kaplan's key signal, that he believes that the normalization is still a monetary policy accommodation, is well supported by these recent Fed speakers. Even the Fed's own Trade Weighted Dollar Index is signalling that a great deal of the expected tightening has already occurred via the exchange rate. The Fed will no doubt tread cautiously with this in mind. Chairman Janet Yellen was able to skilfully defend the QE process, against consumer champion Ralph Nader's assertion that it had unfairly prejudiced savers with low interest rates, whilst still affirming that the normalization process will not involve large incremental interest rate increases. She will no doubt keep a very close watch on the rising level of corporate defaults. Normalization may involve a natural process of removing overcapacity in the economy; but care should be taken to avoid a repeat of 2008. (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas - link ) The Fed is not out of the woods just yet however. The previous report in this series, entitled " Say What's Breaking Down? ", explained how the Fed had come up with a new measure of inflation that would justify its tightening bias. This measure, known as the Dallas Fed's Trimmed Mean Measure of Inflation, has allegedly been constructed with the kind of components that evince the stable non-disinflationary bias that the Fed is currently looking for. All is not well however for this index, or for those who swear by its veracity. Whilst the long term annualised measures of the index are holding up, it has started to dip very dramatically in the out to one month measure. A recent report from the Centre For Economic Policy Research (CEPR), entitled " Rebooting the Eurozone: Step 1 - Agreeing a Crisis narrative ", signals that opinion makers and policy advisers are searching for a new narrative thesis for Europe. From this platform economic resources can then be deployed. Clearly, the recent tragedy in Paris will frame the context and content of this new narrative thesis. The narrative is already being woven by the European defence sector. This industrial sector will be the initial direct beneficiary of a European fiscal stimulus, prompted by national security objectives. This is symbolised by Airbus, the doyen of joint European national security policy. The company sees a window of opportunity , in evolving its A400 transport and A330 tankers to meet the competitive economic landscape on the new battlefield against terror. No doubt commercial civilian products and services will spin-off from the initial military R&D spending, as previous conflicts have shown. The total Eurozone fiscal stimulus windfall, for the defence industry, has been estimated at 50 billion Euros so far. The importance of this stimulus, is that it will hit the real economy directly rather than financial assets, in the way that QE has done. The impact on the real Eurozone economy will thus be immediate and significant. The narrative of the new "Martial Plan" for the affected areas of the Eurozone and wider conflict zones in the Middle East North Africa Region has yet to be fully fleshed out. No doubt it exists. Such a plan will ultimately be the mega-stimulus that will stimulate the global economy and restart the emerging markets narrative. It will however be conditional upon political change and best practice political and corporate governance in the countries involved. Getting to the next phase of the global business and credit cycle is now being skilfully managed and coordinated at the highest levels. The last report, entitled " Framing Global Macro Divergence Within Global Political Convergence ", observed that the fiscal drift towards deficit spending had been triggered by the terrorist atrocities in France. This cause and effect was symbolised, by the latest post- "November 13th" announcement of a 10 Billion Euro joint Franco-German refugee fund. Not wanting to be left out, the European Union then budgeted for a 1.8% boost in spending to deal with the immigration situation for the fiscal year 2016. The recent behaviour of French president Hollande was instructive in testing the crisis narrative-weaving hypothesis. Rather than invoking NATO charter Article Five, as America did after 9/11, he invoked Article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 42.7 obliges all 27 European Union nations to come to France's assistance "by all means within their power". "By all means" implies economic as well as political and military assistance. President Hollande has therefore provided the incontrovertible legal basis for a Eurozone fiscal expansion. Not even the Germans can challenge this, unless they wish to align themselves with the terrorists. It is also instructive that this fiscal expansion does not include the United States. This obliges Congress and the President to set the terms and conditions of any reciprocal American military fiscal stimulus. Hollande then laid the foundations of the Congressional debate on his state visit to America. He is strictly observing NATO protocol in order to maintain the alliance's commitment. Following this NATO protocol and his Eurocentric strategy theme, Hollande immediately met with Angela Merkel, after his American trip. He then applied the full power of Article 42.7, in order to get the desired reciprocity from Germany. Merkel responded in a measured manner, cognizant of the fact that she faces re-election in 2017, with the commitment of the Luftwaffe in a limited reconnaissance role. Germany is now creeping towards a combat role. The ultimate combat role will presumably be dependent upon some subsequent act of aggression or terror directed towards it. The call to arms from the leader of the European Commission, following the recent atrocities in Paris, has been similarly instructive. European Commission commander in chief Jean- Claude Juncker demanded the formation of a Eurozone army. In addition he has outlined a plan for a joint Eurozone bank deposit insurance scheme. This proposed scheme will become operational in 2017 and will take a further seven years to execute. It should be noted that the German national elections are in 2017; and also that hostility towards Juncker's deposit insurance plan in Germany is intense. It would seem that Juncker's project is to accelerate the pace of European political and economic union, using the tragedy in Paris and the migration crisis in Europe as catalysts for change. In a further signal that it is moving to embrace ownership, of the unified Eurozone project, the Commission then issued its own version of a Papal Bull. This decree admonished member nations for their economic transgressions and indiscretions. Germany was lambasted for its single minded pursuit of exports at the expense of its trade partners. Southern European nations were hectored for their lack of fiscal rectitude. Even those nations who are members of the EU, but avoid joining the Eurozone, were signalled out for criticism. These nations were criticised for their pecuniary and cynical unilateral approach to dealing with the Eurozone. The Commission was sending notice that it intends to reform (and unify) the Euro-area under its governance. Its intention is to set it on a sustainable path, that will end the current unsustainable trade and debt imbalances that threaten unity. Juncker's attempts, at deeper political and fiscal integration, should be put into the context of his perception of the current centripetal forces in the Eurozone. As a result of terrorism and immigration, Eurozone nation states have re-erected their border controls and put the Schengen Treaty and Schengen Zone into stasis . The effect is that the free movement of people and labour has been terminated. The frustration of this fundamental core principle, therefore, puts the future of the Eurozone and the Euro currency at risk. Translated into Juncker's frame of reference, this therefore means that the existence of the European Commission and hence his career is threatened. This sublime existential threat was opined by the Commission in a classic piece of Orwellian rhetoric worthy of the Ministry of Information. According to the Commission's spokesman Valdis Dombrovskis on this matter, refugees and terror pose the greatest threat to the Eurozone economy since World War II. This view however belies the fact, that Eurozone policy makers are already anticipating this existential challenge by deploying increased fiscal spending combined with an extension of quantitative easing. The crises therefore breathe life into a Eurozone that was dying of its own internal natural causes. It is telling to see that sales of Hemingway's "A Moveable Feast" have gone up since "November 13th" but that sales of Orwell's "1984" have remained the same. All this is occurring even as European individual freedoms are eroded further in the name of national security. Evidently Europeans and their policy makers are now on the same page. The response, by Juncker's nemesis Jeroen-Dijsselbloem, of the Eurogroup was equally instructive. He signalled that the fiscal slippage process has begun, when he commented that France's 2016 budget was broadly in line with expectations. He qualified his comment by further delaying any detailed analysis of the effects from terrorism related spending until then. France therefore has the green light to go ahead and spend, since Dijsselbloem has agreed to look at the effects of the expected spending post facto. Italy, Spain, Austria and Lithuania have been put on warning that they will miss their 2016 deficit targets. This begs the question of how they will be able to relate their fiscal transgression to terrorism and immigration. The ECB became the first global central bank to officially address the matter of terrorism. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio began this process, when he said that although it was too early to gauge the impact of the Paris attacks. In his opinion the attacks have certainly provided challenges to economic growth. Italian Governing Council member Ignazio Visco moved the baseline, away from Constancio's, further towards monetary policy easing. He opined that the attacks threaten to hurt an already weak economic recovery in the Eurozone. Mario Draghi avoided the issue of terrorism. He preferred to repeat the mantra that "we must do what we must do" aka expand QE, if the Governing Council decides that the current scale of policy is not strong enough to push inflation to the ECB's target. Draghi's view was then basically repeated verbatim by Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen. Liikanen's conversion, from Northern European Hawk to Dove, is a noteworthy development. It signifies that resistance to Draghi's push for expanded QE from traditional opponents is eroding. Liikanen's conversion probably owes something to the economic slowdown in Finland; and increased debate over continued Eurozone membership in his country. The classic smoking gun and hence collateral required for the expansion of QE, was provided courtesy of the ECB's Financial Stability Board. Its latest semi-annual analysis looks at the risk of feedback to the Eurozone economy. This feedback is expected to come from the "Taper Tantrum" in Asia triggered by the Fed raising interest rates. The probability of rising risk premiums in capital markets are therefore increased. Presumably, the ECB will be on hand to avail itself of these rising risk premiums in Eurozone sovereign bonds. It will then get some good entry levels in its next round of bond purchases. Against all this momentum, the Bundesbank's Jens Weidmann took up a defensive holding position. He argued persuasively that not enough time has yet elapsed, during which the impact of the ECB's previous easing combined with the tailwind from falling oil prices has occurred, for an accurate assessment of the situation to be made. He no doubt was trying to position himself ahead of Draghi's spin on the latest German PPI number. This shows continued deceleration. There is also a growing school of thought which sees the net 800,000 influx of migrants to Germany as boosting GDP by 0.2%. Allegedly, this will then compensate for the headwinds from the expanding Volkswagen saga. The latest German fiscal spending data certainly seems to support this view. Weidmann can spin all this is a tailwind to industry and consumption. Draghi will no doubt spin it as evidence of deflation, that requires a QE solution. German resistance has developed into full-blown insurrection at the ECB. This was instigated when Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger opined a blunt public refusal to accept an expansion of QE. The Executive Board is known for its traditional consensual modus operandi. Lautenschlaeger's well publicised break with tradition signals trouble on the horizon. It also signals that Germany feels that a QE expansion is becoming an inevitable fait accompli. Weidmann's position is certainly supported by the four year high in the latest Eurozone PMI data , the 0.7% Q3 rise in German domestic demand and also the jump in the October Ifo business confidence survey. In the last report , BOJ Governor Kuroda's reticence to ease further and inclination to keep his powder dry were observed. The latest manufacturing PMI data supports his reticence. The latest BOJ minutes also show that there is a creeping fear that QE is not working. This failure is because it has failed to raise wages or narrow the output gap. Kuroda had opined that Japan Inc. should now play its part by awarding higher pay increases. The behaviour of Japan's trade unions may now force him to eat his words. Japan's Trade Union Congress (Rengo) will cut its wage bargaining demand for this year; back to two percent from an initial higher demand level. There is therefore no push, for the wage-push inflation that Kuroda has been seeking. Furthermore, it is evident that inflation expectations in Japan are falling. This further complicates Kuroda's job. This was underlined by the latest Reuter's survey on inflation; which found expectations falling for a third month. He now faces the dilemma of whether to consider an even larger expansion in QQE, in order to meaningfully attempt to shake inflation expectations, or to accept that he has been beaten. Prime Minister Abe must therefore boldly press ahead with Abenomics II. He may possibly even expand its scale and scope. A recently released Goldman retail investor survey found increased pessimism over Abenomics for the next twelve months. Abe's initial response to this increasing pessimism was bizarre. Notwithstanding the fact that the unions are already low-balling their wage demands, Abe called on Japan Inc. to award 3% wage increases for those who qualify as minimum wage earners. Since the minimum wage affects only about 2 million Japanese, it is going to take several years for a 3% compound growth rate to meaningfully move the inflation needle. The last report entitled " Central Banks Try To Put The V Back in Divergence " explained how Mark Carney's halo was slipping. This was followed by the previous report entitled " Probing For Global Consensus on Divergence ". This later article stated that "Policy risk is now building a substantial risk premium into Sterling and Sterling Assets; in order to factor in the new uncertainty". Markets have now begun to seriously consider these risk premiums as Sterling begins to lose the safe haven status. This safe haven status it was won by default, based on events in Paris and the fears of the "Taper Tantrum" in America. All of a sudden, speculators have noticed that Governor Carney and his team are far from "Team Safety". The last report detailed the state of the Bank of England's loss of credibility; in relation to its abandonment of guidance. This comedy of errors continued during Governor Carney's testimony before the Treasury Select Committee. Under cover of his Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) colleagues, Carney has been distancing himself from the requirement for guidance on the timing of interest rate increases. This may work with City pundits and the general public, but it does not fly with government officials. Carney therefore compromised himself further and made his colleagues look like bigger charlatans. This was done when he opined that "The question in my mind is when is the appropriate time for interest rates to increase". He then qualified this with the guidance that he U.K. will have low interest rates "for some time" and the pace of tightening will be "limited". Having abandoned guidance, he is suddenly providing it again. The comedic double act was completed by his colleague Kristin Forbes. Forbes was on hand to provide the "non-guidance", from the MPC, that the next move in interest rates will probably be up. The Governor therefore took some of his omniscience back, by providing the certainty that interest rates are going up. The MPC paid for his gain, by being relegated to the role of making him look good through the committee's indecision. The Bank of England seems to be all about Carney and his image; and less about making the right decisions. Carney's words of certainty were however completely overturned with a joint disclaimer by Forbes and himself. Allegedly, British workers are now actually working even less hours than they claim that they wish to work. This development implies that there is in fact more slack in the labour force than initially assumed by the MPC. In addition therefore, it signals that the pressure to increase interest rates has been significantly reduced. The MPC has now been dithering over its understanding of this gap in the labour market for the best part of two years. Over this time it has destroyed its credibility further; and raised the requirement for clear guidance. Carney promised to bring some clarity and guidance on this subject at the Bank's next Inflation Report in February 2016. This delivery date is ages away, in the reality of life in the capital markets. This kicking, of the can of worms down the road, neatly gives the MPC and Carney lots of room to manoeuvre. It also gives them more time to come up with the next carefully worded piece of procrastination on the subject. To make matters worse, governor Ben Broadbent hinted that there is another anomalous QE influenced statistic that is puzzling the MPC. According to Broadbent, "what is extremely striking is the lack of credit growth".... so that "this is the most credit-free recovery we've ever had". The MPC clearly doesn't yet understand why all its QE and the government's fiscal spending have not boosted credit growth. One obvious answer is that the QE has been locked up in financial assets. This has effectively precluding any lending. Another answer is that the banks don't have the balance sheets to sustain lending. This is especially the case, in the wake of tighter capital adequacy rules post "Credit Crunch". Yet another answer may be that the banks don't want to lend. This is because they are worried that everything will go South again, when the Bank of England removes its QE from the financial system. Chances are that all of the above, in some way are causing the "creditless" recovery that so worries Broadbent. This suggests that QE has not been the panacea that it is claimed to be. It also signals that without it the banks are back in "Zombieland". The Bank of England's problems and also those of Chancellor Osborne were compounded by the publication of the latest budget deficit figures. These figures show a 16% y-o-y increase in the deficit to £ 8.2 billion. This widening is allegedly being driven by continued borrowing, rather than from declining tax revenues. After applying a counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus, Britain now has a pro-cyclical deficit problem; and its economic strength is clearly dependent on this pro-cyclical public spending driver. Based on the headline size of the deficit, Chancellor Osborne therefore in theory has the ammunition he requires for pressing on with his attack on public spending. The said attack on public spending will then act as an economic headwind. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned of the negative consequences for the economy, if he presses on with his cost cutting. A weakening economy could then knock on, in the form of reduced tax receipts, which would then push the deficit even higher. Osborne is already under pressure to maintain the level of military spending to meet current commitments. When these commitments get increased, in the aftermath of the Paris atrocities, the pressure will rise further. The police had also signalled that their ability to deal with an escalation in the terror threat has been compromised by his proposed spending cuts. The combined services issued a stark warning to Chancellor Osborne, before the Prime Minister's announcement of a strategic defence and security review. This review was expected to outline a £ 200 million cut in national security spending. In response to the police, Osborne signalled that the level of spending on their public service will not fall. Osborne also faces the inconvenient truth that his popularity is falling precipitously. He is now viewed as a Chancellor who threatens the livelihoods of working families. This negative perception is based on his mishandling of the family tax credit issue. There was thus ample motive for him to U-Turn on spending. If he U-Turned however, his credibility would be further undermined. Osborne therefore needed one of his classic cunning plans. This plan would capitalise upon the emotive issues of national security and terror threats. These threats provided the cover for a U-Turn. The opportunity for his U-Turn was neatly presented by the Autumn Statement. Signs of the cunning plan emerged in Osborne's Twitter account pre-Autumn Statement. He Tweeted that "Govt will invest over £15bn over next 5 years fighting terror threat at home and abroad". This was corroborated, when the Prime Minister signalled a £12 billion upgrade of Britain's military equipment ahead of the review announcement. The classic U-Turn manoeuvre , to reverse the disastrous tax credit policy for the lower paid, was then executed. The move required a classic piece of Treasury maths casuistry to justify it. This statistical sleight of hand was made by the inappropriately named Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR somehow was able to forecast a public sector surplus in 2019/20, out of the current ballooning deficit. It is more likely that this forecast surplus was made in order to accommodate Osborne's U-Turn. His reputation as an astute and prudent Chancellor now stands in tatters. His ambition to become Prime Minister, now takes over as the driver of economic policy decisions in the United Kingdom. One is reminded of the fate of Gordon Brown, who similarly drove economic policy to ensure his desired political destiny. The Prime Minister has acted as Osborne's deficit target pathfinder. He has been probing public opinion by blazing a path of rhetoric, in an advance to contact with ISIS in Syria, without seeking a UN mandate. Not even Tony Blair was as Gung ho, at the height of his popularity, when he ballooned the already ballooning deficit with a military adventure back in 2003. A ComRes survey however, shows that the majority of Britons surveyed still wish to be part of a UN led coalition in Syria. Evidently, the painful lessons of the past in Iraq have not been truly expunged from British memory by the recent atrocities in Paris. Cameron and Osborne therefore need to manage the British public skilfully. They also need to ensure that public support for military action in Syria does not follow on to become enthusiasm for the "Brexit" from the Eurozone. This current emotive climate of patriotic unilateralism that they are creating, clearly presents this diversionary risk. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis made it clear that, whilst some British caveats on Eurozone treaty renegotiation can be accommodated, the reform of the free movement of people principle is a deal-breaker for the EU. Unfortunately the principle of free people movement is core to the inter-related terrorism and immigration issues. Islamic terrorists are to be found with British and Eurozone nation passports which provide them with freedom to operate. Sterling and Osborne therefore both look vulnerable in the meantime; until their cunning plan materializes further. The knee-jerk reaction was to buy Sterling based on the U-Turn and its implicit fiscal stimulus . Once this fiscal stimulus catches up with the ballooning deficit figures however, sentiment will change rapidly. The last report observed the Chinese positioning, to weaken the Yuan after it has joined the IMF SDR currency basket. This view is apparently held by the majority of the hedge fund community. The majority of whom have been positioning to capitalise on the Yuan weakening. This trade is Bank of America Merrill's top pick for 2016 .They refer to the breaking of the Dollar peg that will initiate it as the "great divorce". This report also suggested that "He [President Xi Jinping] is therefore positioning the Yuan and the Chinese economy for transition, during SDR currency basket entry, to the following period of intense competition with China's trade partners". This suggested eponymous "transition" was confirmed in the same word, by PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang. He said that "interest and exchange rates are expected to gain greater significance in the future as the monetary framework is in transition." In the capital markets, a premium is already being factored into Dim Sum bonds in anticipation of the devaluation. The swift denial , of any such devaluation intention and capability post SDR basket entry, by PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang only served to intensify the suspicions. He is subliminally implying that there is no smoke without a fire. The mob-handed intervention by the authorities, to curtail capital outflows pre-IMF SDR basket entry, only served to fan the flames of suspicion. Contrary to the PBoC's actions, the embrace of a free floating exchange rate should come with entry to the IMF SDR currency basket. Instead of a free market, an egregious manipulation was witnessed over the last few days to fix the Yuan's SDR basket entry rate.
