Abenomics- Economic Implications And Analysis | Seeking Alpha The article examines the merits of the fiscal policy employed by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and whether such expansionary efforts are sustainable. An analysis of Japan's monetary policy delineates a need for greater action due to past ineffectiveness. An outlook for Japan's NIKKEI index is presented given a need for further monetary easing and historical responses to Japan's current regulatory environment. Taken straight from Japanese mythology, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "three arrows" approach to reinvigorating the Japanese economy has attempted to appear equally legendary. The three arms of reform refer to the Bank of Japan's "unprecedented" monetary stimulus, the government's aggressive fiscal spending, and a "growth strategy" of structural reforms and deregulatory measures. With an unprecedented amount of reform hand in hand with the NIKKEI Stock Market rising nearly 100% since 2010, investors commend "Abenomics" with nothing but enthusiasm. However, with headlines such as Japan's mixed numbers show hobbled economy captivating public attention, economists are wondering whether Japan's outlook truly has evolved for the better. Though the bull market has been sharpening its horns in Japan for half a decade, Japan's growth GDP growth has failed to crack 3% since 1991 , a target desperately needed to attain Abe's target of a GDP worth ¥594 trillion by 2020. History (distinct from mythology) is not in favor of Japan's ambitious visions of the future; the past two decades have contained marked stagnation and deflation. An evaluation of the drastic means Abe adopted in order to combat such obstacles to growth indicate the reasons why Japan's household spending fell 2.9% from a year ago in November and headline unemployment hit nearly a two-decade low of 3.3% even as the NIKKIE gained over 12% in the same time period. Before tackling the giant that is Japan's monetary policy, it is necessary to first give a nod to Abe's fiscal policy. There have been three stimulus packages so far ; an initial package of ¥10.3 trillion, followed by another round worth ¥5.5 trillion in April 2014. More recently, an emergency package worth ¥3.5 trillion was passed in December 2014, as fears of recession and deflation reemerged. Considering that in 0.9 to 1.7 percent of the nation's GDP growth in 2013 was predominantly accounted for by these extensive measures, one could say that fiscal policy has been a crucial factor in Japan's stimulus: However, the reason why many economists do not attribute fiscal packages as much attention as is warranted by policy success is because it is generally a one-time push by the government (whereas monetary policy can persist for longer periods of time). With government debt reaching roughly 240% of GDP, Japan's future will clearly dissociate from future stimulus under fiscal policy. That leaves the (in)famous monetary policy that "Abenomics" is known for. The 2 percent inflation target set in 2013 by the then-newly appointed Governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, served as the beginning of Japan's most aggressive stance toward inflation. In official publications released by the BOJ, Haruhiko promised to reach the aspired target by utilizing open-ended asset purchases and a doubling of the monetary base by 2015. One may wonder why Haruhiko did not simply pursue the standard issuance of monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Quite simply, the central bank had long hit the lower bound on interest rates by 2013 and hence conventional monetary policy in Japan was rendered ineffective . Haruhiko Kuroda's "Quantitative and Qualitative Easing" served as the complement to Abe's government-backed resuscitation of the economy. Avoiding the overnight policy rate, the Bank of Japan instead injected massive amounts of money into the economy via quantitative easing. The BOJ is annually adding a net ¥80 trillion (about $660 billion) of Japanese government bonds to its balance sheet -the equivalent to what the Federal Reserve was purchasing at the height of its easing, for an economy a quarter the size of the U.S. By purchasing these securities, the Bank of Japan is adding reserves, or lendable assets, to the balance sheets of Japanese banks (who would then presumably boost loans to consumers). Recent analysis done by Alhambra Investment Partners shows that despite the unprecedented rise in reserves, consumers continue to suffer at the hands of falling income: That's right, household spending and household income dropped 2.9% and 1.8% respectively in November for a third straight month. Meanwhile a drop in inventories cut 2.1 percentage points from total growth and Business investment shrank an annualized 5.0% during the quarter . It is no wonder that GDP shrunk by 0.8% (though still a relatively mild contraction). In other words, the massive repurchases of government securities by the Bank of Japan aimed to represent expansionary monetary policy has not helped the consumer. Even with tailwinds such as a depreciating yen along with low commodity prices boosting exports, consumption and investment continue to falter. A potential rebound in oil prices recovering from the overshooting experienced throughout 2015 would only further negate the positive effects low oil prices have brought to Japanese industry. With neighbor China also experiencing an economic slowdown, it is unlikely that Japan will find solace in ravenous global demand. Yet fortunately for investors stubbornly following Abenomics toward what appears to be a recessive abyss, the one bright spot for Japan has been the NIKKEI index. Three primary reasons stand to explain the reason why Japan's market has performed superbly relative to its stagnant peers. Firstly, confidence in the government's aggressive stance on economic difficulties, one that has not been displayed in Japan for decades, has bolstered bullish sentiment. Secondly, a the aforementioned side effect of the BOJ's easing program has been the depreciation of the yen-this has helped Japanese companies improve their export sales despite industrial output falling 1.0 percent in November . Finally, the stock market itself is an engine for growth given that it can influence consumption and investment through the wealth effect; namely, favorable stock market conditions directly lead to an increase in paper wealth, and consequently consumers and businesses herald future growth by utilizing this newfound wealth by consumption and investment respectively. Conclusively, Japan's ultra-easy fiscal and monetary policy has led to various repercussions for the nation: the sharp fall of the yen's value against the dollar, pushed up earnings of major firms to record levels and triggered a surge in share prices in the Tokyo market . Unfortunately, consumer spending has suffered as wages are outpaced by the very inflation measures Abe so keenly wishes to augment. With consumption taxes also kicking in last October as supplements to those put in place in 2013, consumers will only further experience greater difficulties in the New Year. Yet despite the rough the diamond lies in Japan's stock market, which is expected to continue its stellar bull run as Abe reignites monetary stimulus to further cradle the Japanese economy. With the Wall Street Journal quoting that the "BOJ said it would maintain its annual asset purchases at around ¥80 trillion" while also "buying ¥300 billion annually of exchange-traded funds that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400," the market will only continue to experience the expansionary environment that has led to its superior returns. Thus, though the Japanese growth prospects remain tender, investors can find jubilant relief in the hands of an appreciating stock market.
