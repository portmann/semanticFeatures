5 Takeaways From the ECB’s April Presser - WSJ European Central Bank President Mario Draghiâ€™s news conference, briefly interrupted by a protestor chanting “end the ECB dictatorship,” involved repeated assurances that the recently launched bond-buying program is working, with no early end in sight. But Mr. Draghi said the program will only achieve the twin objectives of assuring the economic recovery and returning inflation to target if it is fully implemented. The ECB’s program of quantitative easing was launched as recently as March 9, but questions are already being asked about its likely duration. “I’m quite surprised by the by the attention a possible exit from the program receives when we’ve only been in the program for a month,” Mr. Draghi told reporters, and insisted that it remains the governing council’s intention toÂ  but more than â‚¬1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) in mostly government bonds through September 2016. The ECB has to buy â‚¬60 billion of bonds a month, distributed around each of the currency area’s 19 members and carrying a yield no lower than the deposit rate, which stands at minus 0.20%. Moodyâ€™s Investors Service Tuesday warned the ECB could run out of eligible bonds from some governments around the turn of the year, and it’s not alone. “These worries are premature, certainly not supported by the current evidence,” Mr. Draghi said, adding the program could be adjusted if needed, but ruling out a cut in the deposit rate. Accentuating the positive, Mr. Draghi cited a number of reasons for believing that the pickup in the pace of economic recovery that appears to have started in early 2015 can be sustained, ranging from an expected increase in investment to repair neglected infrastructure, to an easing in fiscal tightening, and a reduced general need to cut borrowing. The many critics of quantitative easing in Europe fear it will fuel asset prices bubbles, and sow the seeds of future crises. Mr. Draghi said he was aware of those risks, but didn’t see any evidence they were actually present. And if they did materialize, the best way of dealing with them is to tighten “macroprudential” regulation, not reverse course on monetary policy. There was not much new on the eurozone’s most pressing problem. Mr. Draghi repeated that it’s up to the Greek government to establish the conditions under which Greek bonds might be accepted as collateral again, but seems intent on leaving negotiations to the politicians. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
