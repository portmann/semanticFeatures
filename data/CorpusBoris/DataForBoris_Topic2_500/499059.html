Why A 2% Move In Stocks Feels Like 20% | Zero Hedge by williambanzai7 - Sep 10, 2016 2:20 PM To plunder, to slaughter, to steal, these things they misname empire; and where they make a wilderness, they call it peace.--Tacitus by Phoenix Capital... - Sep 10, 2016 1:09 PM A weekend anecdote from Eric Peters, CIO Of One River Asset Management â€œEverything is 10-times bigger now,â€? said the CIO. A 2% move in stocks feels like 20%. And a 10bp move in bond yields feels like 100bps. â€œItâ€™s the kind of thing that happened to Alice in Wonderland.â€? When you combine negative rates with leveraged carry strategies, anything becomes possible. You can justify almost any price for an asset provided policy makers can suppress volatility. â€œBut elevated asset prices come at the cost of systemic fragility. Because to suppress volatility requires feeding the beast with ever more stimulus.â€? â€œ30-year Japanese govâ€™t bonds yields jumped from 0.05% to 0.50% in 4 weeks,â€? continued the same CIO. Their price fell 15%. â€œThe person who locked-up their money for 30yrs in exchange for 1.5% in cumulative interest payments, lost 15% of principal. Thatâ€™s 300yrs of interest, lost in a month.â€? And the Bank of Japan just signaled that they want a steeper yield curve. Which means more losses to come. â€œThese instruments are nuclear bombs. Theyâ€™re toxic waste. Theyâ€™re owned but un-ownable. Not even Alice encountered such nonsense.â€? Kaboom! The earth shook. A manmade tremor. The chubby North Korean kid had popped off another plaything. The dark side of mankindâ€™s technological coin. You see if Apple can waterproof an iPhone 7 supercomputer, any paranoid dictator can eventually miniaturize a nuclear weapon; if we allow him. And we have. Naturally, every coin has two sides, and mankindâ€™s eternal tale is shaped by how we react to our tails. We responded to a bad 2008 coin flip with massive monetary stimulus, extending the limits of what was once thought technically possible. But after eight straight years of landing on heads, weâ€™re again growing nervous about that inevitable, overdue tail. G20 leaders convening in China announced, â€œWe will pursue innovative growth concepts and policies by forging synergy among fiscal, monetary and structural policies, enhancing coherence between economic, labor, employment and social policies as well as combining demand management with supply side reforms, short-term with mid- to long-term policies, economic growth with social development and environmental protection.â€? Having studied our disastrous reaction to the 1929 tail, and frightened by the rising anger that led to Brexit, Trump, Sanders and Le Pen, policy makers appear intent on boosting economic growth through fiscal expansion, structural reform. Theyâ€™d better deliver for the sake of society. But never in history have both bonds and stocks been this expensive simultaneously. Which is perfectly fine, so long as rates stay low and investors expect to flip heads yet again. But can bond prices sustain these levels once policy makers commit to aggressive borrowing/spending? No one knows. Is that the dark side to todayâ€™s innovative policy coin? Unsure. And with Draghi disappointing markets by not expanding his balance-sheet expansion, and the BOJ indicating it wants Japanâ€™s yield curve steeper, are central bankers finally finished? little_fish Looney Sep 11, 2016 10:33 AM My last pay check was $9500 working 12 hours a week online. My sisters friend has been averaging 15k for months now and she works about 20 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do... www.14earnpath.com RiverRoad Looney Sep 11, 2016 11:16 AM Explains all the insanity out there and the inexplicable inability of the press to report what we can see plain as day. The G-20 communique is a stellar example of the kind of non-thinking that typifies those in charge.  Seriously...."demand mangement with suppl-side reforms...." which means instead of wage/price controls we are going to step in and limit ownership of real property and real access to product.  This is why people in Canada pay about 170% over that in the USA for a gallon of milk.  I used to get paid good money to write circular verviage like that in DC and NY.  Last Monday I liquidated everything in the market.  The check is due here tomorrow.  Cash will be stored in the house.  Gold and silver ounces in distant out buildings on the property.  Arnold Versengetorix Sep 11, 2016 10:29 AM  You being a circular verbiage master, I know you did not mean to ring the dinner bell to those that would take it away from you, â€œWe will pursue innovative growth concepts and policies by forging synergy among fiscal, monetary and structural policies, enhancing coherence between economic, labor, employment and social policies as well as combining demand management with supply side reforms, short-term with mid- to long-term policies, economic growth with social development and environmental protection.â€? Brilliant! Now, our politicians only must tap into Divine Grace before setting out on their Quest Perilous, while keeping the Deplorables at bay. I sort of hope they raise in Septmeber and IÂ´ll take a long vix position with tight sl beforehand. If by some miracle they raise its gonna be a really good day. muahahahahah  or any paranoid president of the us. Because we know the only country that used nuke against people. And it's not NK.  09-11 11:00: AUDIO CLOSED FOR THE WEEK, THE DESK WILL REOPEN ON SUNDAY AT 2200BST... 09-11 11:00: RANsquawk - Today's Trading Edge 09-11 11:00: A Tweet from Fox Business's Gasparino states that bankers are... 09-11 11:00: M&A from the US session: 09-11 11:00: METALS AUDIO CLOSED FOR THE DAY, THE CHANNEL WILL REOPEN MONDAY AT... 09-11 11:33: 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Turns 25: Here Are The Best Covers Of This Feminist, Iconic Song 09-11 11:33: Your Favorite Fantasy Football Stars May Be Wearing Kanye West's New Football Cleats 09-11 11:33: Terms Of The Trade: Beta, Delta, Theta 09-11 11:33: MFRI Reports Q2 Loss/Share From Continuing Ops $0.11, Sales $22.9M Down 9% YoY 09-11 11:33: Series of H&R Block BoD Form 4s Filed After Hours, Deferred Stock Units Vesting 09-11 11:33: HalcÃ³n Resources Completes Restructuring and Exits Prepackaged Bankruptcy, ~$1.8B Of Debt Eliminated Along With $200M Of Annual Int.
