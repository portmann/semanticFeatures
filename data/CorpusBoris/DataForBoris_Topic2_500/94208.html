Short Greece Proposal Update: Greece Folds | naked capitalism 2:00PM Water Cooler 6/22/15 - 06/22/2015 - Lambert Strether Links 6/22/15 - 06/22/2015 - Yves Smith Links 6/21/15 - 06/21/2015 - Yves Smith Lambert is probably covering this ground in Water Cooler too, so forgive any redundancy. Some details of the Greek proposal have leaked out. — Joost de Vries (@devriesjoost) June 22, 2015 Note contrary to earlier media reports, it technically does not lower pensions payments but does reduce pension spending by requiring higher contributions, including payments from retirees themselves. As the Guardian’s Athens reporter, Helen Smith, notes: ……thereâ€™s a hefty increase in revenues from VAT over the next 18 months. Greece has also accepted that pension must be reformed, and is planning a hike in pension contributions and an increase in health contributions from retirees. However, it appears that actual pension rates wonâ€™t be cut, allowing Athens to argue it has kept to its red line. Another quick verdict is that “ pensions are almost spared “. And while European leaders are urging their peers to consummate a deal, it’s not clear these pension moves will be enough to satisfy countries like Slovaka, which have said they can’t stomach financing Greece’s more generous pensions. One rebellious country could probably be shamed into line, but we have yet to hear of the reactions from the real hardliners like Finland and Spain, since the summit has just begun. However, regardless of what you think of the pension finesse, the Syriza government has agreed to continue with austerity. A 1% primary surplus for 2015, which was the creditors’ target that Greece accepted the weekened before last, contrasted with  the IMF estimated that primary surplus for 2015 was going to be as low as negative 1.5% roughly a month ago, represents a big hairs shirt for Greek citizens. Even though recent Greek budget releases show the primary surplus above the target for the first five months, if you look into the details of how that was achieved, it was through payment deferrals and cuts. Those payment deferrals, meaning non-payments to important vendors like pharmaceutical suppliers will need to be made more current, and other reserves that have been run down to make payments such as the borrowings from the IMF reserves, will also need to be made up at some point. That means that the actual impact of meeting the target will be greater than the 1% when you allow for where it would be if Greece were as current as it has been whether new government came in, as opposed to stretching payables to such and extreme degree. If you take the IMF estimate of a 1.5% primary deficit as a decent representation of where things stand if the Greek government had been paying bills on a normal bassi, that means the amount of austerity being inflicted this year is close to 2.5% of GDP. That is essentially the same increase as  the pre-negotiation target of 3.0% of GDP relative to Greece having primary surpluses before the negotiations began Recall that the February Eurogroup memo that Greece signed, which said that the primary surplus target would be adjusted in light of current conditions, that is arguably what happened, that the target was adjusted to produce the same degree of “fiscal consolidation” and not actual relief. And not only is this year’s level harsh in an already severely depressed economy but 2018 and later target of 3.5% is simply draconian. Although the Greek government will try to spin otherwise, the new coalition has agreed to continued austerity. They are now just hashing out implementation details. Greek Bailout Proposal Makes Potentially Big Concession on Pensions, Officials Say The proposals, formally submitted to creditors Monday morning, foresee new pension savings and revenues worth 0.4% of gross domestic product for this year and 1% starting next year, the officials said. That would bring the left-wing government in Athens close to the target demanded by its creditors. [â€¦] Greek officials said that much of the pension target would be achieved by increasing contributions from employers. On top of that, an extra payment to the poorest pensioners, known as EKAS, would be phased out between 2018 and 2020, the officials said. Based on that, the odds are very high that this deal goes through. The Greek government is delivering on the 1% of GDP pension cuts demanded by the creditors, with the big “concession” that the government is getting is that it is being implemented in phases. Editor in chief of Syriza paper Avgi tells me: Tsipras can sell this deal to MPs – just- because of nod to debt and redistribution measures Well,  austerity NEVER works because the opposite of austerity (which apparently doesn’t have a word) brings perpetual  prosperity; as demonstrated repeatedly in (uh) Greece before they were required to have all this austerity. What Greece did before now was lard up on debt that they do not control in a currency that they do not set rather than tax their richest citizens. What is being pushed now under the name of Austerity is burning the seed corn (and the tractor) for fuel rather than planting it for next year. The sensible alternative is not to lard up on debt rather than collect taxes but to actually invest for the long term and to restructure tax collections so that the debt can be paid down over time.  The catch is that this requires the (largely German) creditors to recognize that their plan for austerity on top of austerity won’t work and to take a different approach that will work out in the long term. Yes, the biggest insanity of this approach is that the Greek government has a very narrow tax base and desperately needs to broaden that (as in fix tax collections and get better at going after the rich) and also address other areas of government where it is barely functioning (like the court system). The creditors can’t even bring themselves to adopt a mixed approach of allowing or even pushing Greece harder to implement the reforms needed to make Greece more functional as a state as they whip it to meet their numbers. With due respect, any “fixing” will take years and is obviously very easy to promise (as it has been promised before). The problem here is that the creditors wanted some proof that the Greek side was willing to do some thing BEFORE getting the money. A Portuguese blogger, quite sympathetic to Varoufakis economic proposals, BTW, wrote something recently under the title “Varoufakis’ virginity” (as in, trust is like virginity, you only lose it once). From that point of view, these last 5 months have been a disaster. Raising corporate taxes is also counter productive. It either results in higher prices or layoffs. It’s unfortuante to see it come to pass, but as Yves has stated all along, the Greeks had no operating room.  Either succumb to demands, or risk total chaos and even worse depression in a Grexit.  I thought Varoufakis did a good job of selling the message of why the push back was warranted, but it has fallen on mostly deaf ears. Slovakia et al may be making a fuss to get some sweetener to bring them on board. That is how negotiations in the EU often go. Often the sweeteners will be in some completely unrelated field. This is what you must expect when you surrender your sovereignty to a corporate scheme. It enriches the wealthy and impoverishes everyone else. Kinda what we can expect from these oh so wonderful trade deals. Maybe we can make this work in the US too.  Let’s eliminate fiscal transfers between states and eliminate the national minimum wage (and whatever other labor reforms are needed).  Shouldn’t take long for a race to the bottom between states to kick into gear. This would solve the China trade problem too.  Instead of US corporations outsourcing part of their supply chain to China, they can keep the supply chain wholly within dollar-land, using one of the low-cost states as a substitute for China.  Surprised nobody has figured out this already; we should be seeing arguments that fiscal transfers and a national minimum wage is an impediment to free-trade within the US trading bloc.  /sarc In a few months, the targets will have been missed, the Troika will threaten to cuts funds, and we’ll be back at the table.
