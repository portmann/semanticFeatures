U.S. Economy: Desperate For Fiscal Steroids - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Latest macro releases point to a downturn of the US business cycle. Interest rate hike expectations adjust abruptly downwards. The need for a new generation of highly targeted fiscal stimuli will eventually become a top priority as monetary policy tools lose their effectiveness. Last week's releases had us glued to our screens as we were waiting to see if the Q3 business cycle would accelerate, essentially paving the way for an interest rate hike. This, however, was not the case. The plummeting of both manufacturing and services ISM indices, for the month of August, exposed just how weak the US economy is, and put a lid on any chatter about imminent rate hikes. With less and less ammunition left in its arsenal, the Fed alone cannot fight off a recession, making fiscal policy actions an unavoidable path. For these fiscal policies to work though, a new generation of highly targeted fiscal stimuli will need to be implemented as the one-size-fits-all model used in the past will not be able to reverse the productivity slump and rejuvenate demand beyond the short-term cycle. The US economy is in need of some serious fiscal steroids aimed at its biggest structural issues and capable of boosting its manufacturing base. This, of course, will be a subject for intense political discussion in the months to come with any actual initiatives to be expected after the US elections. Politics aside, financial markets are already beginning to turn their attention to the need for fiscal action, and this has direct implications for US equities (NYSEARCA: SPY ), US bonds (NYSEARCA: TLT ) and of course the US dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ). Equity markets are expected to benefit from this development as the Fed's hands are tied for the time being, meaning that with no interest rate hike in the horizon, equity prices will reach new highs. While equities will rally, US Treasuries are expected to drop if politicians ultimately accept much deeper budget deficits in order to revive growth. Should this occur, the Treasuries market will be faced with a new wave of supply, which in turn will cause the bear steepening of the US yield curve. This might be what finally pushes US bonds off the cliff as it is the seventh time in the last 12 months that they test the limits of their bull flattening trendline, dangerously approaching their point of reversal. While the investment implications for equities and bonds are obvious, for the US dollar the situation is rather ambivalent, as it has been for over a year now. The US dollar index has been trapped in a sideways fluctuation zone between 92 and 100 since early 2015. Since interest rate hike expectations have adjusted to the new reality, this means that the USD will continue to "live" within this band as there is no macroeconomic factor that could give the greenback a new direction. However, if the bear steepening of the US yield curve does occur then it could increase the difference between US long-term yields and those of its major peers. This increase could generate an uptrend for the US dollar, essentially releasing it from its sideways trap. As decoupling scenarios were dismantled last week, the focus, inherently, shifted to fiscal policy. At a federal and state level, the current fiscal policy mix seems to have subtracted 0.21% from real GDP growth in Q2, according to the estimates the Brookings Institution released. This is rather alarming, since, as it stands, the policies in place are not helpful to the US economy, at a time when the US economy is at its weakest hour and completely dependent on them. Considering the large gap that policymakers will have to bridge, i.e. becoming a highly positive force, from the negative one that they are now, bold moves are required. As monetary policy has almost exhausted its options the game now enters the political arena. The new US president will have to take very daring and controversial actions in order to boost both the short-term and long-term cycle, but more importantly stop a recession that might be lurking around the corner. This coupled with the fact that we are looking at a first-term presidency, with re-election guiding every move once elected in office, fiscal policy will climb very high on the agenda. Much pressure also will be applied to creditor nations which have the capacity to accommodate the US in its fiscal policy efforts, to follow suit, if not be the first ones to exercise it. This might actually be a positive development for the global economy, which has been showing signs of weakness for quite some time now. Germany's most recent figures on its industrial production indicated a 1.5% drop, while UK manufacturing nosedived 0.9%. China continues its soft landing with its growth rate dropping to 6.7%, and Japan falling to a 0% growth with a subzero inflation rate. It would seem that the world is ready for fiscal policy to take place. Economies need to be jumpstarted in real and nominal terms. While a meaningful shift in fiscal policy involves a much greater degree of political brinkmanship than monetary policy does, it will ultimately be the only way out if the economy slips into a recession and the monetary tools prove inefficient on their own.
