UK's Hammond: 'modest' investments deliver quick fiscal boost | Reuters By David Milliken and Huw Jones | LONDON LONDON Finance minister Philip Hammond said he favored "modest" investments if needed to help Britain's economy cope with the Brexit vote shock and he suggested big infrastructure projects would not be among his tax and spending plans to be announced in November. "Often it is modest, rapidly deliverable investments that can have the most immediate impact, particularly on the road network, but also in some places on the rail network," he told lawmakers on Thursday. "The Treasury will be in a position to deliver a fiscal response if appropriate on the 23rd of November," he said, making clear that he felt there was little room for maneuver because of Britain's weak public finances. Hammond also said his previous comments about a possible "reset" of fiscal policy in the wake of the Brexit vote referred to the government's decision not to pursue a previous target to run a budget surplus by 2020. In July, he prompted speculation that he might be planning a major increase in spending big tax cuts when he made the comment about a possible reset of fiscal policy. Since then, signs have grown that the initial hit to Britain's economy has not been as bad as the Bank of England and many economists expected, although it is on course for a sharp slowdown. The Bank of England has said it might cut interest rates again later this year after announcing a major monetary stimulus push last month. Hammond said on Thursday that any fiscal stimulus by the government should be done over the short term and have a quick impact on the economy. "I think there is a role for big, strategic projects, but they are unlikely to be ever able to contribute to fiscal stimulus because of the timelines involved," he said. Hammond also said he agreed that Britain needed to build more homes. But he said Britain's public finances remained "unhealthy" and its public debt was close a level that might affect the willingness of markets to buy British government gilts. "So I don't think we should be cavalier about the level of the debt," he said.
