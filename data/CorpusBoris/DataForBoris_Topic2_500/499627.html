Central Banks Are Becoming The Problem - And They Know It - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Central banks have increasingly become a part of the economic problem. Bankers weapons of low interest rates and easy money have created perverse economic incentives. The recent hawkish statements from the ECB and the Fed is likely a bluff that can be utilized to spur governments into action. It is becoming apparent that central banks are becoming less of a solution, and more of a problem. Easy monetary policy has its limits. Eventually, fiscal policy must work in tandem with monetary policy to increase economic stimulus. Central bankers are not only recently raising this issue; it has been apparent for years as they have pushed for more direct government action to spur growth. Since the GFC, interest rates around the world have sat near 0%. And, with a supposed 'Fed liftoff' (NYSEARCA: SPY ) delayed with each passing month, they have failed to undo them. As a result, easy money has flowed through the economy. Despite that easy money, only a trickle of those funds have made it through to the real economy. Racked by underemployment and falling labor force participation rates, median household income has dropped for much of the last two decades. Much of this drop is due to the disparity between high skilled and low skilled jobs. The moving offshore of manufacturing left blue collar workers in the U.S. with fewer options. As options shrunk, lower salaries were accepted, and as good jobs dwindled for the blue collar workers, many left the workforce. As a result, income disparity grew between the high skilled and low skilled workers. As wage growth was primarily situated in the former, more money was concentrated in fewer people. Thus, the engine of economic growth slowed down. Any individual person or family can only take so many vacations, or get so many haircuts. Demand for goods slowed as a fewer absolute number of families could afford to eat out, go on vacations, and keep the economy growing. To be sure, at an average level easy money increased income, but the increasing isolation of money in fewer hands does not work in the long run. QE and low interest rates around the world certainly saved the economy from a long-drawn depression. However, as normalization is delayed and median wage growth declines, the economy is not as strong as it is made out to be. It is quite clear that central bank policy has failed to move economies towards strong growth. And, as the Economist points out, what we really need is "the combination of high, durable and inclusive growth together with genuine financial stability." Years of economic policy has left legislators overly-optimistic in the abilities of central bankers. Legislative reforms are all but non-existent. A decade after the GFC, the only ones that actually believe the economy has truly recovered are those that have a direct incentive to believe so. Fast forward to the present, and central bankers are trying to push back. The ECB and the Fed are losing confidence in easy money policies and thus are starting to tread with caution. A change of rhetoric of "we will do anything the market requires" has adjusted to what Bloomberg summarized in 2014 as; "We're maintaining the current policy stance while watching the potential economic risks, and we're committed to take further action should the economy weaken in an unexpected manner." "Stabilising fiscal policy is restricted by law in the EU. Countries that could use fiscal space, won't; and many that would use it, shouldn't." - Telegraph.co.uk The current scare in markets was a direct result of more hawkish central bank stances in the EU and the U.S. In an almost prophetic like prediction of current events back in March, the ECB vice president also stated that "not only is it wrong to start talking down monetary policy - it's actually dangerous" This is now becoming a reality. Recent statements regarding hawkish policy stances by both the ECB and the Fed resulted in a sell-off of stocks and bond on Friday. In an almost bizarre twist of fate, the market sold off so much that central bank policy is unlikely to remain hawkish, and thus prompt a recovery. Central bank's recent statements could very much be a bluff to legislators. Policy is likely to unwind the recent sell-off, and the Fed put will continue in earnest. In the long term, it may be used as a data point to encourage governments to utilize fiscal policy and deregulation to spur a stagnating economy. It is only a matter of time before the long term trend of falling median household income hits demand. At that point, no amount of easy money will prop up the economy, and elevated asset prices only go so far. A quasi-monetary-union in the EU means it is not clear who can even begin fiscal stimulus and how. A gridlocked U.S. parliament is struggling to even pass simple reforms. Across the world, central bankers are the only ones with tools to prop up the economy, and the risks associated with that are becoming prevalent. Underemployment, unemployment, and anemic growth are plaguing first world economies. If governments don't start to become part of the solution soon, they will almost certainly turn our central bankers into villains.
