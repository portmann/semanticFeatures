This Was Obvious in 2010 and Stated Explicitly Last March - The Euro, Stick a Fork In it, Its Just About Done! | Zero Hedge by Sprott Money - Jun 24, 2016 8:50 AM by Phoenix Capital... - Jun 23, 2016 8:13 PM More and more, the markets feel like they did in late 2007/ early 2008: when stocks held up based on hype and hope that Central Banks could put off another Crash. This Was Obvious in 2010 and Stated Explicitly Last March - The Euro, Stick a Fork In it, Its Just About Done! I also called it in 2010 as well.

The latest estimates announced by the EIU (Economist intelligence unit) in March 2010 are even lower at 1.2% and 1.5% for 2010-11 and 2011-12, respectively. The European Commission has also raised similar concerns with the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, criticizing governments after scrutinizing the strategies of 14 countries, including Germany, France, Italy, the U.K. and Spain, that â€œtheir budget projections were based on favorable macroeconomic assumptions after 2010 that may not materializeâ€? (stated in a press article on March 18, 2010) Raising concerns on the UK, the European Commission also stated that â€œThe U.K. won't meet the EU's recommended target of reaching a 3% budget deficit by 2014-15, and projections for economic recovery may also fall short. Details on how the U.K. government, whose budget deficit is expected to hit 12.7% in the current financial year, will rein back its spending are also lacking. The absence of detailed departmental spending limits is a source of uncertaintyâ€?. Continuously rising fiscal deficit has led to a continuous increase in the government total debt, which increased from 43.3% of GDP in 2007-08 to 72.9% in 2009-10. Moreover, according to EU Commission estimates, after Ireland, the UK is poised to incur the worst deterioration in the gross debt ratio in the EU, from 44.2% of GDP in 2008 to 88.2% of GDP in 2011. Though the average maturity of UKâ€™s debt is considerably higher compared to other nations (thus no refinancing risk in the near future), the expanding interest burden is exacerbating the already strained fiscal deficit. Moreover, rising debt not only restricts governmentâ€™s fiscal stimulus and support to the economy, but is also forcing the government to undertake sharp fiscal consolidation measures to moderate the adverse impact of rising interest expenses on the fiscal deficit. This is bound to have an internal deflationary effect. The government expects an increase in its debt from 55.5% of GDP in 2008-09 to 90.9% in 2012-13. In absolute terms, the government debt is expected to grow from Â£796.4 billion in 2009-10 to Â£1,486.2 billion in 2012-13. However, we expect the debt to increase much higher off higher primary deficit owing to relatively lower GDP growth assumptions.  Italian Banking Macro-Fundamental Discussion Note and the  Spanish Banking Macro Discussion Note  in anticipation of our upcoming Spain analysis, which should be a doozy!
