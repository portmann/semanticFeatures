China Fails To Deliver Major Fiscal Stimulus At People's Congress, Makes Many Promises Instead | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Gold has surged another 4% this week to bring year to date gains to 20% in dollar terms, 19% in euro terms and 24% in sterling terms.  Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Back in October, the latest credit impulse in China just rolled over and died. Ahead of the actual news, MNI said â€œone source familiar with the data said new loans by the Big Four state-owned commercial banks in October plunged to a level that hasn't been seen for many years." Sure enough, when the numbers hit, it wasnâ€™t a pretty picture. RMB new loans came in at just CNY514bn in October - consensus was far higher at CNY800bn. That was down 6.3% Y/Y. Total social financing fell 29% Y/Y to CNY447 billion, down sharply from Septemberâ€™s CNY1.3 trillion print. So what, did China do you ask? Well, they unleashed massive fiscal stimulus: The deluge of fiscal spending was at least the most since May 2014, and seemed to prove that between an acute over-capacity problem and jitters from the reverse-wealth-effect created by last summerâ€™s stock market collapse, businesses and consumers had no desire to borrow, while rising NPLs meant banks were reluctant to lend. As we said at the time, it looked like Beijing was finally prepared to acquiesce to incomparable, pet-rock hating PhD economists like Citiâ€™s Willem Buiter who said the following summer: Fiscal policy can undoubtedly come to the rescue and prevent a recession in China. The first-best would be for the central government to issue bonds to fund this fiscal stimulus and for the PBOC to buy them and either hold them forever or cancel them, with the PBOC monetizing these Treasury bond purchases. Such a â€˜helicopter money dropâ€™ is fiscally, financially and macro-economically prudent in current circumstances, with inflation well below target and likely to fall further. As we never tire of mentioning, that idea is absurd on its face: youâ€™re simply printing one paper liability and buying it with a another paper liability that you also print. In any event, fast forward to January, and credit impulse was back with a vengeance, as the Chinese created a mammoth $520 billion in credit ahead on the Chinese New Year. Or, visually: So China created half a QE3 in the space of just a month, or, as we quipped, "Minsky wants his chart back". The reason for the surge was largely the result of frontloading loans mostly at smaller banks, as well as lending to government projects in the first year of 13th Five Year Plan, which helped to boost loan growth. Many economists had expected loans to slow sharply in February as lending to government projects wound down. However, it turns out this was just the start of China's latest policy, which is really just a return to its old policy of flooding the economy with debt: as Market News reports expectations that "January's surprisingly strong new loan growth would prove temporary may have been premature as bank officials in a number of Chinese cities say February new loans look to be just as strong, even with a week-long holiday in the middle of the month." According to MNI, new loans so far in February were similar to the levels during the same days of January. The total so far in February is seen at around CNY2 trillion already (and that was weeks ago).  One month and one RRR cut (the fifth since early 2015) later, and perhaps, based on its own experience with expansionary monetary policies that have thus far failed to produce growth or perhaps by watching DM central banks plunge headlong into NIRPdom without making even so much a small dent in the disinflationary impulse, China has come to terms with that fact that perhaps a bit of fiscal stimulus may be the answer. Well, â€œa bit,â€? turned out to be the right characterization, because on Saturday, Beijing said it will aim for an economic growth rate between 6.5-7 percent, (we already knew that) with a consumer inflation target of around 3 percent and money supply expansion of around 13 percent, according to a series of draft reports ahead of the opening of the 12-day parliament. "Many investors had been hoping China would post an aggressive target for fiscal spending to prop growth," Reuters notes. "But the draft goal of running a fiscal deficit equivalent to 3 percent of GDP, while up from the previous year's target of 2.3 percent, still disappointed some who had hoped for a number closer to 4." "That's still the most red ink on the fiscsl account  since 1979 and up markedly from last year's 2.3%, but it's not enough and should be increased," a central bank advisor Yu Yongding told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting. And here's an important point from Zhou Hao, economist at Commerzbank in Singapore, also quoted by Reuters: the low figure may reflect concerns that a higher number would signal tolerance for another spree of debt-fueled growth such as that Beijing embarked on in 2009. In other words, getting too agressive here might have sent the wrong message that, having failed to make a swift transition from the smokestack, investment-led economy to a consumption and services led model, China is simply prepared to go right to back to what (used) to "work." But that would simply plunge the coutnry back into an ultimately untenable position by exacerbating the acute overcapacity problem and thus driving up NPLs and down demand for credit (well, unless it's credit companies are taking on to pay off old debts).  Primier Li also reiterated Beijing's intention to address zombie companies through a combination of mergers, bankruptcies and debt deals. As for that all important indicator of just where Chinese society is heading: 5.6 million state workers will be laid off in the next two to three years. Long torches and pitchforks.  So if China did not deliver the much desired (and needed by the market) stimulus (which was originally scheduled for last weekend's disappointing G-20 meeting where nothing concrete emerged either due to Schauble vocal opposition to any more global monetary or fiscal stimulus) what did the first day of China's National People's Congress deliver? A lot of promises as the following list from Reuters shows. A whole lot of promises, none of which China will achieve. To target 2016 GDP growth of between 6.5 percent and 7 pct.

"We must make consistent efforts to encourage the public to start businesses and make innovations." "We should strive to achieve major breakthroughs in basic research, applied research, and research in strategic and frontier fields by 2020."

"Over the next five years, we should aim to ensure that water consumption, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP are cut by 23 percent, 15 percent, and 18 percent, respectively, and that forest coverage reaches 23.04 percent." "We will promote greater user of Chinese equipment, technology, standards, and services in the international market, and help Chinese manufacturing brands gain international recognition." "We wish to actively negotiate and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. We will help speed up negotiations on the establishment of the China-Japan-ROK free trade zone. We will work to make progress in negotiations on investment agreements between China and the United States and between China and the European Union."

Soooo, they can change their fucking mind in a second. A couple of the king commi's get together and puff next day they can spend on what ever they want, they can build 100 more cities, 1000 more ships, give 100 billion to all the providences, they can do whatever they want to make things temporarily better, the peoples input or concerns do not fucking matter. Soooo dont listen to what they said because things will change from most everything they said. They are FUCKING COMMUNIST. Westerners dont get it! If communism is defined as  public ownership and communal control, then China no longer fits that definition (if it ever did).

How is this good for the Chinese economy?   The money getting scalped is eventually just financially raping the hard working Chinese people who are paying for this with devalued currency...the ultimate and insidious tax/redistribution of wealth.

Any or all information where the Fed has either directly participated in, or directed other banks to purchase oil future contracts for any reason over the past 60 days.

For thousands of years, one after another the chinese despots achieve only the deaths of millions of their own citizens. The current super-corrupt despotic regime is no different except now they have the ability to murder millions in other countries. And how many military bases/installations/outposts, etc., does China have scattered around the globe...?    How many 'regime changes' has China either imposed directly, or been actively involved in again...? Sat, 03/05/2016 - 11:55 | 7275430 shantyman Ahhhh u touch on a great point...until 10 years ago China's army was essential a National Guard Force, zero bases off shore, their Navy was a small coastal force, airforce while capable against 3rd world situation did not have the reach at all to extend power... Their %military to GDP was miniscule....while the USA spends a massive % of our GDP on Bases offshore.... The Chinese have not been successful in an Army Camapaign against a foreign country since the Chinese Russo War...The Japs kicked their asses all the way acroos the continient... Their Naval Force is not even close to Blue Water as yet....putting a destroyer thru the Dardenelles (wich had to be assisted by the USN) and sailing a crusier to Hawaii is not BlueWater... They have zero Air refuelling capability These Island they are creating out of reefs are nothing more than fixed points to bomb from far away...projection of power in no where to be found beyond a few small bases in Africa.... I hope they begin to spend a ton of money attempting to project power, eat up what is left of their bidget and hit backruptcy sooner than later... Sat, 03/05/2016 - 10:22 | 7275127 Sudden Debt It's the fact that our own economies are lagging another 6% in Europe. Where will they find the money to fund their socialist dream now? They can't tax more (they will try) because that will slow down the economy even more. And America? With it's almost near full employment (which is 5%) and actually stands at 4.9%?! Everybody is lying. And lies always catch up after a few years. To many lies, no results and mass unemployment. Sat, 03/05/2016 - 11:57 | 7275439 Early Retirement China is a Communist-military dictatorship with no democratic institutions of any kind. The acceptance of the Remnibi into the IMF currency basket signifies the death of morality in the west. Sat, 03/05/2016 - 12:24 | 7275520 Batman11 Western savings rates have approached zero due to the welfare state safety net. Western consumers can spend nearly everything they earn. China has high savings rates because there is almost no welfare state and they need to save for a rainy day. Chinese consumption is impacted by high inequality, low wages and no welfare state. High taxes on the wealthy to provide a welfare state for those lower down the scale would have boosted China's economy. Those that would now be on unemployment benefits would still carry on consuming at a lower level. In a world of chronic over-supply, investors are irrelevant. We need to get money into the hands of consumers.
