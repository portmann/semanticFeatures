After failed coup, Turkey's central bank cuts rates again | Reuters After failed coup, Turkey's central bank cuts rates again ISTANBUL Turkey's central bank cut interest rates for the fifth straight month on Tuesday, lowering its overnight lending rate by an expected 25 basis points days after a failed coup shook the country and briefly roiled its financial markets. The central bank has responded to the government's repeated calls for cheaper credit while presiding over a weakening lira currency and above-target inflation. President Tayyip Erdogan, who favors consumption-led growth and whose status as Turkey's dominant political figure was reinforced by Friday's dramatic events, equates high borrowing costs with treason. Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci told Reuters in an interview late on Monday he expected the central bank to continue with "bold" rate cuts, adding he would understand if it took no action this time following the coup attempt. "Market developments will be closely monitored and the necessary liquidity measures will continue to be taken to support financial stability," the bank said in a statement. The bank cut the highest of the multiple interest rates it uses to set policy to 8.75 percent. It left its benchmark one-week repo rate unchanged at 7.5 percent. Eight of 19 economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a 25 basis point cut in the upper band, while six expected a cut of 50 basis points. The remaining five predicted no change. A faction of Turkey's military attempted to topple the government in a coup that started late on Friday night but later crumbled as Erdogan supporters answered his call and took to the streets in defiance of the plotters. Financial markers were impacted and some analysts have voiced concerns about the ensuing widespread crackdown on the judiciary and civil service. Following the interest rate decision, the lira was little changed on the day, at 2.9780 from the previous session's close of 2.9755. The key to understanding what’s going on lies not with personalities, campaign strategies or party rules but rather with the voter.   PDF Document   Reuters News Agency | Brand Attribution Guidelines | Delivery Options Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters .
