Draghi Pulls Out All The Stops - Is It Enough? | Seeking Alpha The ECB decided to cut rates and expand its QE program. Mario Draghi also asserted that further rate cuts will not be needed. After the underwhelming ECB rate decision back in December, this time ECB President Draghi didn't hold back by cutting rates and expanding the quantitative easing program. And even though he then backpedal by saying at the press conference that there is no need for further rate cuts, these expansionary policy steps should be more than enough to provide liquidity to the markets and help drive down the Euro. Will it be enough to pull the EU out of its weakness or pull up inflation? For now, it doesn't seem likely in the near term. The ECB also lowered its outlook for inflation and GDP growth for Euro Zone for 2016-2018 . So to offset the lower expectations of growth and inflation, the ECB decided to act. After all, Draghi promised in the past he will do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro. And in this recent ECB meeting he sure delivered : Cutting the cash rate from 0.05% to 0%, reducing the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4% and even the less quoted marginal lending facility was cut by 5 basis points to 0.25%. Moreover, the ECB augmented the QE program by a third to 80 billion euros per month - the market expected an increase to 70-75 billion euros. The ECB also opened the door to purchase corporate bonds and even introduced a new Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operation (TLTRO II) arrangement, in which banks could receive four year loans at an interest that could reach the new deposit rate level. But after all these new measures were introduced the Euro changed direction and rallied and the even stocks declined. This was because Draghi then pointed out that there is no need for further rate cuts. This comment eclipsed the stimulus package. And perhaps this comment elicit a market reaction that wasn't intended by Draghi, but one can make the augment for saying it. First, this may have been just a comment to ease the pressure from the Germans, who aren't too happy with the recent stimulus package. If Draghi doesn't plan to cut again rates saying so now - he won't find a better timing to do so especially after such a stimulus package - could curb expectations for further cuts down the line. So in a way this statement was to inoculate himself from further rate reduction pressures form the market. Finally, if market conditions go sour he can always backtrack from this so-called promise and cut further rates - this will only act as a positive surprise in the markets and augment the reaction (he didn't promise he won't cut rates only that no need to cut more). For now, it makes sense to stop cutting rates and see if these steps actually help the economy without putting too much pressure on commercial banks that aren't too happy with lower interest rates. After all, the deposit rate has been negative since June 2014, the cash rate at 0.05% since September 2015 and the QE program started off last year; and yet, the EU isn't doing a whole lot better in terms of core inflation, employment or economic growth. I think the ECB has done more than enough in this recent meeting and now it all boils down to what policymakers do including whether the expansionary monetary policy will be accompanied by a much needed fiscal stimulus. If not, it will be up to the private sector to pull the EU out of its current state. In any case, I still think the recent ECB stimulus package will bring further down the Euro against the majors. But without fiscal stimulus, it won't be enough to strengthen the Euro Zone's economy.
