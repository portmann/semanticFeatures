(NYSE:HRTG) | Seeking Alpha HRTG has been an incredible performer since its IPO, and there's no reason for this to change.The company detailed potential geographic expansion and M&A on its Q4 CC.As the "insurance ecosystem" remains largely the same from conditions that contributed to HRTG's rapid share price increase, you want to remain long.Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HRTG ) has been a huge winner for me, and is going to continue to be a winner into the balance of 2015.I continue to recommend a long position in this well-managed insurance player.Prior to Q4 reporting, I was expecting the share price growth curve to greatly flatten in 2015, as HRTG's non-acquisition, non-assumption key metrics were to continue a slow move higher.Post Q4 reporting, we now know that geographical expansion is in the near-term plans at HRTG, as is M&A: Both developments are extremely productive to the bull case, and are byproducts of HRTG's ability to scale up its model as long as Cat Bond and Reinsurance costs remain at historic lows.HRTG CEO Bruce Lucas was asked about current pricing in regards to both on the conference call, and he responded that both remain at rates that are flat to last year's pricing.He also alluded that the forward curve of pricing, meaning the pricing of multi-year risking off, remained at highly sustainable levels.I've been a HRTG bull since its IPO, because I believe the current "insurance ecosystem", if you will, is entirely conducive to rapid growth and managed risk for players in the traditionally higher risk profiles of the industry.This defines HRTG.HRTG, as a result of historically cheap Cat Bond/Re, has been able to take on high levels of risk (read: high premium policies) at extremely low rates of risk-off, allowing it to take on more risk.At that point, it simply risks off more and then proceeds to take on more risk.You can see how this cycle works.I've detailed this "ecosystem" greatly in prior SA PRO articles, and remain long the thesis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If HRTG expands into the Texas coast, a market that I'm familiar with and that I can say as of today remains highly fragmented, I would think this would materially change existing analyst modeling to the upside.</span>I was going to remain long HRTG until it experienced a catastrophic event that would reset Cat Bond/Re pricing, as well as the risk/reward to premium generation capacity of its book anyway, but this is just more reason to continue pounding the table for ownership.The "ecosystem" described, I believe, is also what's fueling the company being active in M&A prospecting.There's no reason for a well-funded, well-oiled machine like HRTG to not try to acquire as much of a footprint as possible in the current environment.Until the catastrophic event status quo changes or risk-off pricing increases, expect HRTG to remain in a constant state of "gobble and grow".I'm expecting HRTG to continue to be a top performer into the balance of 2015, and continue to recommend a long position.This is a space you want to own, and HRTG is a very attractive vehicle of ownership.Source: Heritage Insurance Holdings: Expansion And M&A Potential Should Drive Share Price Disclosure: The author is long HRTG.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
