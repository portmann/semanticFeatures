(NASDAQ:CTWS) | Seeking Alpha The general consensus is that water utilities are safe investments.CTWS and ARTNA have maintained decade-long dividends.However, the reality is that water utilities are drowning in regulatory related capital expenditures.CTWS' capital expenditures have quadrupled over the last decade.ARTNA has almost no cash flow, after capital expenditures, to pay for dividends.Additional scrutiny is warranted for these "safe" investments.Investors, especially retirees who seek safe income generating investments, have highly prized water utilities for their consistent dividends.For example, Artesian Water (NASDAQ: ARTNA ) and Connecticut Water (NASDAQ: CTWS ) have paid quarterly dividends for decades without interruption or reduction.The general consensus among investors is that utilities are safe investments because the services provided by industry operators are essential.However, water companies are now drowning in regulatory-related capital expenses.Connecticut Water's maintenance capital expenditures have increased four-fold over the past decade, according to data compiled from CTWS' 10K statements.Additionally, Artesian Water's free cash flows have been drained away by capital projects, according to SA article "Artesian's Dividend Marathon in Jeopardy."The insidious part is that these regulatory costs are capitalized.Consequently, the negative regulatory impact remains undetected from traditional financial metrics.Therefore, additional scrutiny is highly warranted on these seemingly safe investments.Many water utilities look attractive on the outside from a dividend to net income payout ratio perspective.However, most water companies are decaying on the inside as their financial posture is eaten inside out by increasing EPA-regulation.Utilities: Increasingly Stringent Regulations The EPA, at any time, can enforce costly regulations on water companies pursuant to two main regulatory acts, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act.The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates the treatment of water and establishes guidelines into the levels of contaminants allowable in water.The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of drinking water and wastewater into lakes.The EPA has passed increasingly stringent regulations.Arguably, two of the most costly regulations are the limit for arsenic in water to 10 parts per billion, one-fifth of the previous allowable level ( EPA: 2006 ), and the limit of lead and copper in water, primarily originating from the corrosion in water pipes to 1.3 parts per million (EPA: 2011).The poster-child for the steep costs associated with compliance is Connecticut Water, the largest water utility in the New England area, which reported the following on page 25 of its 2013 10K : "Environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently�(and)�have tended to become more stringent over time.(NYSE: W )e have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws�(however)�we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with�current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business�or financial condition."Accelerating the already high costs to comply with regulation is the aging infrastructure of the US water distribution system.For example, the capital expenditures incurred to maintain Connecticut Water's existing infrastructure, to regulatory standards, has quadrupled from $10 million to over $40 million, in the past decade alone refer to graph below and has significantly overshadowed net income according to data compiled from the CTWS' 10K filings.Additionally, Artesian Water's free cash flow has been drained away by capital projects.As a result of the skyrocketing capital expenditure costs, water companies have a harder time paying dividends.The tricky part is that the negative regulatory costs are capitalized and remain hidden in traditional financial metrics such the dividend-to-net income or the payout ratio.Consequently, solely focusing on CTWS' stable dividend and secure payout ratio, as presented below, and further explored in detail in this SA article on Connecticut Water , for dividend sustainability is a treacherous proposition.Unlike the payout ratio, the theoretical dividend surplus or shortfall metric (1) and the free cash flow available to shareholders-to-dividends are accurate indicators for dividend sustainability.These metrics, unlike the payout ratio, factor in the negative impact of capital costs related to regulatory compliance.The theoretical dividend surplus or shortfall metric for CTWS, presented in the figure below, shows that Connecticut Water is financially strained as a result of regulatory capital costs.Additionally, according to SA article "Artesian Water Corporation's Dividend Marathon in Jeopardy," ARTNA's free cash flow metric-to-dividends metric shows that ARTNA dividends are also strained.The unfortunate reality is that many water companies are pulverized by regulatory capital expenses and have raised new shareholder capital to pay for their dividends, according to data compiled from CTWS's 10K filings (refer to figure below).Similarly, according to SA article "Artesian Water Corporation's Dividend Marathon in Jeopardy," Artesian Water also has franticly raised shareholder capital to pay for dividends.It is very alarming when companies seek capital market assistance to fund dividends and may indicate that a company's dividends are no longer sustainable.Rate Increases Not Enough to Stop the Bleeding The traditional method for water companies to offset costly capital expenditures is to petition for increases in base water rates.For example, Connecticut Water has successfully petitioned for a yearly rate increase of 7.86%, according to CTWS' 10k filings.Also, Artesian Water has successfully petitioned for a year rate increase of 11.1%, according to ARTNA's 10k filings.However, companies such as Connecticut Water and Artesian Water are at high risk of being unable to secure rate increases to offset capital expenditures.Any back of the envelope calculation clearly shows that the current base water rate increase of 7.86% for Connecticut Water is not sufficient to offset their regulation-induced capital expenditures of $45.6 million, especially on a net income base of $18.3 million.Similarly, it is hard to justify that the current rate increase of 11.1% for Artesian Water is sufficient to offset their regulation-induced capital expenditures of $21.2 million, especially on a net income base of $8.3 million (Information gathered from the company's respective 10K statements).Additionally, Connecticut Water reported on page 23 of their 2013 10K that their No. 1 financial risk was the inability to raise rates to cover capital expenditure costs as quoted below.Similar literature can be found on ARTNA's 10K filings.
