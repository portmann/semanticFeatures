(NYSE:PFE) | Seeking Alpha PFE is suitable for Enterprising Investors, but not Defensive Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 4.38% in annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) has shown consistent and significant earnings growth over the last several years, which will immediately intrigue many investors.However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value.It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels.The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion.This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another.By using the ModernGraham method , one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Adequate Size of Enterprise - Market capitalization of at least $2 billion - PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition - Current ratio greater than 2 - PASS Earnings Stability - Positive earnings per share for at least 10 straight years - PASS Dividend Record - Has paid a dividend for at least 10 straight years - PASS Earnings Growth - Earnings per share has increased by at least 1/3rd over the last 10 years, using 3-year averages at the beginning and end of the period - FAIL Moderate PEmg (price over normalized earnings) ratio - PEmg is less than 20 - PASS Moderate Price to Assets - PB ratio is less than 2.5 or PB x PEmg is less than 50 - FAIL Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5 Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition, Part 1 - Current ratio greater than 1.5 - PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition, Part 2 - Debt-to-Net Current Assets ratio less than 1.1 - FAIL Earnings Stability - Positive earnings per share for at least 5 years - PASS Dividend Record - Currently pays a dividend - PASS Pfizer Inc. does fairly well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors.The Defensive Investor is concerned with the insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns.As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history.In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.24 in 2010 to $1.95 for 2014.This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate of 4.38% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years.Here, the historical growth in EPSmg over the last five years is around 11.41% per year.The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur.Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time.Source: ModernGraham Quarterly Valuation Of Pfizer Inc.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
