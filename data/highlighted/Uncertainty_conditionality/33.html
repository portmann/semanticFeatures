Includes: AMGN , CA , GRMN , INTC , KLAC , KRFT , LLTC , MAT , MDLZ , MSFT , PAYX , PCAR , STX , VOD , WDC , WYNN by: Fredrik Arnold 10 top yielding NASDAQ 100 dogs (of 53 paying dividends) upsides ranged from 15.9% to 29.72% March 10 (per analyst targets); 2 dog downsides slid 3.97% & 10.2%.Top yielding NASDAQ dogs retreated bearishly in March while those of the Dow continued to be mixed up.Analysts projected 16% to 32.74% 1 yr.net gains for WYNN; INTC; STX; MDLZ; WDC; VOD; MSFT; GRMN; KLAC; AMGN.Analysts projected 3.37% & 8.92% 1 yr.net losses for LLTC & PAYX.Results from IndexArb.com tallied for 53 NASDAQ 100 Index members paying dividends as of market closing prices March 10, 2015 were stacked against analyst mean target price projections one year out.The resulting chart of that data shown below turned up ten stocks displaying 15.9% to 29.72% price upsides.On the downside, the tally found two stocks showing 3.97% & 10.2% price drops.The chart above used one year mean target price set by brokerage analysts matched against March 10 closing price to reveal ten NASDAQ index stocks showing the highest upside price potential into 2016 out of 30 selected by yield from indexArb.com dividend data.The number of analysts providing price estimates was noted after the name for each stock.Three to nine analysts were considered optimal for a valid mean target price estimate.Seeking Alpha reader requests prompted this series of index-specific articles reporting dividend yield plus price upside results for these indices: Dow 30 ; S&P 500 ; S&P Aristocrats ; Russell 1000 ; Russell 2000 ; Russell Combined ; NASDAQ 100 ; Champions ; Contenders ; Challengers ; CCC Combined ; Global .Bonus reports covered Bad Boy AllStars , and Sector Leaders .This article was written to reveal bargain stocks to buy and hold up to one full year.See Dow 30 article for explanation of the term "dogs" for stocks reported based on Michael B. O'Higgins book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins, 1991), now named Dogs of the Dow .O'Higgins system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks.Utilizing analyst price upside estimates expanded the stock universe to include popular growth equities, as desired."The NASDAQ-100 Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization.The Index reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology.It does not contain securities of financial companies including investment companies."Again, just three of nine sectors were represented in the top ten NASDAQ dogs by yield as of March 10, 2015 per IndexARB.com data: consumer goods; services; technology.One of three consumer goods representatives again claimed the top spot, Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT ) [1].The other consumer goods representatives found themselves in fifth and ninth place: Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: KRFT ) [5]; PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR ) [9].Services put the second, and seventh place representatives on the NASDAQ high yield list: Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN ) [2], and Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX ) [7].Technology put the remaining five firms in the top ten by yields.Third overall was Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX ) [3].Other technology firms ranked fourth, sixth, eighth, & tenth: Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ) [4]; KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ: KLAC ) [6]; Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) [8]; CA Technologies (NASDAQ: CA ) [10].These completed the top ten NASDAQ 100 dogs for March by yield.Top ten NASDAQ 100 dogs compared to those of the Dow by yield were graphed below as of market close 3/10/2015.Annual dividend projected from $10,000 invested as $1K in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points shown in green for price and blue for dividend.Actionable Conclusion (3): NASDAQ 100 Dogs Cowered As Dow Dogs Mixed Up NASDAQ 100 top dividend payers soared in dividend as price plummeted after February.Aggregate single share price dropped 9% and aggregate dividend from $10k invested as $1k in each of the top ten stocks rocketed up 10% to send the NASDAQ 100 dogs retreating via the bear CorpusPath.Meanwhile, Dow dogs mixed up again showing almost 2% more annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten, while aggregate single share price for the ten rose 0.05% between February 9 and March 9, according to IndexArb.As a result, the Dow dogs overbought condition (in which aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k each in those ten) shrank to erase its record-tying February high.The overhang was $173 or 47% in April; shrank to $170 or 46% come May; swelled to $215 or 59% for July; fell back to $197 or 53% in August; widened to $239 or 65% in September; fell to $199 or 53% through October; widened again to $230 or 62% through November; moved to $233 or 61% in January; remarked the record September gap of $250 or 65% for February; then slid to $243 or 62% in March.To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential.Added to the simple high yield "dog" metrics, analyst mean price target estimates provided another tool to dig out bargains.Actionable Conclusion (4): Wall St. Wizards Cast An 8.48% Average Net Gain from Top 30 NASDAQ 100 Dogs By March 2016 Top thirty dogs from the NASDAQ 100 index were graphed below to show relative strengths by dividend and price March 10, 2015 and those projected by analyst price target estimates to the same date in 2016.A hypothetical $1000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased.The shares number was then multiplied by projected annual per share dividend amounts to find dividend returns.Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge the stock price upsides and calculate net gains including dividends less broker fees as of 2016.Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $30,000 invested as $1k in each of the highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created data points for 2015.Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the thirty highest yielding stocks and aggregate one year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2016 data points.Price was shown in green and blue was used for dividend.Analysts reported by Yahoo projected a 8.8% lower dividend from $1K invested in each of his group of 30 while aggregate single share price was projected to increase nearly 12% in the coming year.Notice that price still exceeded dividend signaling an analyst predicted overbought NASDAQ 100 index into 2016.The number of analysts contributing to the mean target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the charts.Three to nine analysts was considered optimal for a valid estimate.A beta (risk) ranking for each analyst rated stock was provided in the far right column on the above chart.A beta of 1 meant the stock's price would move with the market.Less than 1 showed lower than market movement.Higher than 1 showed greater than market movement.A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stocks movement opposite of market direction.Five of the ten top dividend yielding NASDAQ 100 dogs were assessed to be among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1 year target prices.Therefore, the March dog strategy was graded by Wall St. wizards as 50% accurate.Ten probable profit generating trades revealed by Yahoo Finance into 2016 were led by Wynn, Intel, and Seagate: Wynn Resorts was projected to net $327.39 based on dividends plus a mean target price estimate from sixteen analysts less broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to

combined with projected annual dividend less broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 106% more than the market as a whole.Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ ) was projected to net $215.36 based on dividends plus mean target price estimate from sixteen analysts less broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 20% more than the market as a whole.Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) was projected to net $119.10 based on a mean target price estimate from twenty-two analysts combined with projected annual dividend less broker fees.The Beta

less than the market as a whole.KLA-Tencor was projected to net $179.50 based on dividends plus mean target price estimate from twenty analysts less broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 57% greater than the market as a whole.Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) was projected to net $160.43 based on a mean target price estimate from nineteen analysts combined with projected annual dividend less broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 42% less than the market as a whole.The average net gain in dividend and price was over 21.5% on $10k invested as $1k in each of these dogs.This gain estimate was subject to average volatility 13% greater than the market as a whole.Conclusion (6): (Bear Alert) Analysts Forecast 2 NASDAQ Dividend Dogs to Show Net Losses of 5.57% & 7.78% By March 2016 Two probable losing trades revealed by analysts reported by Thomson/First Call in Yahoo Finance into 2016 were: Linear Technology (NASDAQ: LLTC ) was projected to lose $33.68 based on dividend and a median target price estimate from sixteen analysts including $20 of broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 29% greater than the market as a whole.Paychex, Inc. was projected to lose $89.18 based on dividend and a median target price estimate from sixteen analysts including $20 of broker fees.The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 4% less than the market as a whole.The average estimated net loss in dividend and price including $20 of brokerage fees was 6.14% on $2k invested as $1k in each of these two dogs.This loss estimate was subject to average volatility 13% more than the market as a whole.The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor-in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions.Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of "dividends" from any investment.Stocks listed above were suggested only as possible starting points for your index dog dividend stock purchase/sale research process.These were not recommendations.Disclaimer: This article is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed to constitute investment advice.Nothing contained herein shall constitute a solicitation, recommendation or endorsement to buy or sell any security.Prices and returns on equities in this article except as noted are listed without consideration of fees, commissions, taxes, penalties, or interest payable due to purchasing, holding, or selling same.Graphs and charts were compiled by Rydlun & Co., LLC from data derived from www.indexarb.com ; analyst mean target prices by Thomson/First Call in Yahoo Finance.Source: 9 Nimble NASDAQ Divi-Dogs Deal 16% To 30% March Upsides; 2 Drop 4% & 10% Disclosure: The author is long INTC, GE, PFE, T, VZ.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
