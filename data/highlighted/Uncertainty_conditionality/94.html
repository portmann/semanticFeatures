however, a crowded market could result in a pricing war like the one seen in the Hep C market.This would mean the company will have to offer significant discount.But even after assuming a gross-to-net adjustment of 50%, the value of ARC-520 comes to around $10, and I have not yet considered ARWR's other candidates.Source: Arrowhead Trades At Just 50% Value Of ARC-520 Disclosure: The author is long ARWR, GILD.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
