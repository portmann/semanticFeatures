(NYSE:RIG) | Seeking Alpha The company has four 10-year contracts and one 5-year contract for five newbuild UDW rigs coming online 2016-2017.Net present value of each 10-year contract is $580 million.My first article analyzing Moody's downgrade of Transocean's (NYSE: RIG ) debt focused on the relationship between cash outflows in the form of capex and dividend and cash inflows in the form of operating cash flow, smaller Macondo liabilities, and positive working capital position.The table shows negative cash flows every year provided EBITDA is $1.8 billion in 2016-2017.I have no interest in analyzing EBITDA numbers, despite my belief that those numbers are too low, but what I want to discuss is the possibility of additional cash inflows for Transocean within the context of $1.8 billion EBITDA.Transocean may possibly incur a deficit of $1.6 billion over the next four years, but it has an important source of cash inflows that Moody's touched upon in the following manner: To the extent Transocean Partners, LLC is used to raise equity to pay down debt further, it would come at the expense of increased organizational complexity and likely structural subordination of cash flows -- these factors would offset most of the benefit of lower leverage.What Moody's is saying is that Transocean Partners (NYSE: RIGP ) may finance dropdowns by issuing equity and not a word that it can do the same by issuing debt.RIGP has no debt on its balance sheet at this time and has equity of $2.4 billion.Let's examine two things: b) The extent of possible cash flow subordination should Shell rigs contracted out for 10 years be dropped down into RIGP.Additional debt on RIGP level will be consolidated into Transocean's balance sheet since Transocean effectively owns more than 70% of outstanding units.Transocean's ownership of RIGP includes both common and subordinated units.Transocean owns 51% of common units and 100% of subordinated units.Subordination of cash flows at this stage basically follows ownership CorpusPath, i.e. Transocean receives 70% of cash flows derived from dropped down assets.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If the company were to drop down new assets using debt, then it would still receive 70% of cash flows minus interest payments on this debt as ownership structure would remain intact.</span>Suffice to say, these interest payments are a fraction of additional cash flows.Here's a cash flow table with assumption that each dropdown of Shell rigs with 10-year contracts are financed with 100% debt: Net annual cash flow per contract is $87 million.Net present value of each contract at 8% discount rate is $580 million.Debt incurred by RIGP per dropdown is $500 million, assuming dropdown price of $1 billion per contract.Total cash inflow for RIG would be $2 billion.Total annual subordination of cash flows to non-RIG owned portion of RIGP would equal to $26 million per dropped down rig.$2 billion in cash derived by RIG from dropdowns to RIGP changes the overall liquidity picture dramatically and implies net debt would actually decrease over the next four years.Additionally, Transocean may be able to deconsolidate RIGP from its balance sheet by issuing an insignificant amount of new RIGP equity to become a minority holder of common units.Transocean would still remain a controlling holder of RIGP via its subordinated units.Deconsolidation of RIGP would wipe $2 billion of debt from RIG's balance sheet, the same way Seadrill wiped $3 billion of debt from its balance sheet when its deconsolidated Seadrill Partners in early 2014.Contrary to Moody's view, Transocean has very strong options to increase its liquidity and reduce debt over the next several years even if the industry downturn remains in place through 2018.Shell contracts are a vital component of this flexibility and given relatively subdued dayrates on these contracts I see little risk of them being renegotiated.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Moody's stresses in their research note , that they would consider an upgrade if they see signs of debt/EBITDA ratio moving towards 4.</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Time will tell if this ratio ever moves into their expected 5.5-6 range in the first place.</span>Source: Transocean: Fuzzy Math Behind Moody's Downgrade -
