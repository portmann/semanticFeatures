and the only way to get more return is by taking more risk.Good luck with that.This is about proper expectations.Where he has made a prediction, the outcome is obviously unknowable today.If the market has some disappointing annualized rate of return over the next 20 years, which is possible, it is important to remember a couple of things.It is not likely that anyone will average 10% returns in a 2% world, which places an emphasis on savings and living below your means, which is a point he makes in the first quote.The other point, and I think this is more important because it doesn't get mentioned very often, is that whatever the annualized return over the next 20 years, it will not be linear.There will be great years, terrible years and flat years.Since the peak in 2000, the S&P 500 has averaged 4.6% per year.That 4.6% certainly does not belie what has happened over that period.Source: Great Advice From Bill Bernstein Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it.The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: To the extent that this content includes references to securities, those references do not constitute an offer or solicitation to buy, sell or hold such security.AdvisorShares is a sponsor of actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and holds positions in all of its ETFs.This document should not be considered investment advice and the information contain within should not be relied upon in assessing whether or not to invest in any products mentioned.Investment in securities carries a high degree of risk which may result in investors losing all of their invested capital.Please keep in mind that a company’s past financial performance, including the performance of its share price, does not guarantee future results.To learn more about the risks with actively managed ETFs visit our website AdvisorShares.com .We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
