outperformed all expectations.We analyze why.Outlook for the smartphone and tablet market is provided, and implications for Sony is described and analyzed.At the beginning of this month, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) announced a plan to invest nearly $900 million in its semiconductor and component business.The investment will increase the monthly production capacity of CMOS image sensors from 60,000 units to 80,000 units per month by the end of June, 2016.The company has previously announced a similar plan to invest in semiconductors, and the recent announcement is an extension of the original program to expand production capacity to 75,000 units per month.In this article, we will take a closer look at Sony's Devices segment, evaluate the prospects of the image sensor market, and lastly discuss why Sony is investing heavily.Sony's Devices segment is divided into two overall product categories; semiconductors and components.Products produced in the latter mentioned category include batteries, audio/video/data recording media, storage media, optical pickups, and optical disk drives.Measured by revenue, the semiconductor category is the largest of the two, and includes CMOS image sensors which will be the focus of this article.Chart 1.Source: Quarterly reports Q113-Q314.Made with plot.ly .From Q114 to Q314, revenue has grown from ?184.1B to ?292.9B, or nearly 60%, while operating income has increased from ?12.5B to ?54.5B.In its latest Q3 report, Sony stated that the impressive results were caused by a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, but also (more importantly) by an increase in mobile device demand and therefore image sensors and camera modules.Picture 1.Source: Sony Q314 presentation The better-than-expected results made Sony adjust its full-year guidance for the segment upwards from ?890B to ?950B in sales with expected operating profit to increase from ?67B to ?100B.Even more impressive than the Q3 results, Sony provided a long-term sales target of ?1,300-1,500B to be achieved in 2017: Picture 2.Source: Sony Q314 presentation The target represents an increase of 37-58% from the current year's forecast of ?950B.It certainly seems that Sony has great belief in the future success of the Devices segment.As mentioned earlier, the segment's semiconductor category includes production of CMOS image sensors.These image sensors are primarily used in mobile devices such as smartphones, phablets, and tablets to help capture high-quality photographs in low-lit environments.Apart from producing its own smartphones and tablets, Sony is a provider of CMOS image sensors to many brands including Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and LG ( OTC:LGEAF ).Most notably, the company has supplied sensors to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) since the launch of iPhone 4S (rear camera only) and now supplies the iPhone 6 ' and 6 Plus' front- and rear camera as well the iPad Air 2 .This means that Sony's Devices segment is partially correlated with not only the success of the wildly popular iPhone and iPad, but also the overall growth in the mobile devices market.The impressive growth in sensor sales, as cited in the above-mentioned quarterly results, suggests that Sony is a passenger on the speeding mobile devices train.The question becomes, however, if the train is about to slow, thereby making Sony's investment in growth an investment in overcapacity, or, if the train can continue its impressive speed for years to come.As the two charts depict, the global smartphone- and tablet market has unsurprisingly grown rapidly since 2009 and 2010.But is this growth sustainable?Global smartphone shipments are forecasted to reach nearly 1.9B units in 2018, which represents a CAGR of roughly 8%.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Only the future will tell if this growth is actually achievable, but current market conditions hardly indicate a slowdown as many countries are still in the early adoption phase of smartphones.</span>The overall tablet market appears to be facing stagnant-to-declining sales as phablets become increasingly popular, and upgrading cycles remain long due to few technological advances.On this matter, IDC notes: In the early stages of the tablet market, device lifecycles were expected to resemble those of smartphones, with replacement occurring every 2-3 years.What has played out instead is that many tablet owners are holding onto their devices for more than 3 years and in some instances more than 4 years.We believe the two major drivers for longer than expected tablet lifecycles are legacy software support for older products, especially within iOS, and the increased use of smartphones for a variety of computing tasks.While current tablet owners are holding on to their devices longer than expected, it seems plausible that consumers considering a replacement would rather opt for a phablet: Although the holiday season might not be indicative of the future, it is still remarkable how fast the number of phablet activations have grown while tablets are declining.It is hard to argue against a correlation in this case.Based on the charts above, the overall market for mobile devices is likely to continue to grow.Therefore, it seems more likely that Sony's investment will be in growth, not overcapacity.On a side note, I don't believe it matters too much for Sony if the tablet market is declining or not.As long as users are shifting to other mobile devices that include cameras, it really doesn't matter if the company is supplying sensors for one type or the other.This indifference is actually very beneficial to the company as it becomes protected against shifting consumer trends and brand loyalty.So far we've established that Sony's Devices segment has improved drastically over the last three quarters.We've also established that the market for mobile devices is likely to continue growing.When combined, it seems rather obvious why Sony keeps investing in this segment.But as intelligent investors and business owners, we can take things a step further.Or, as Howard Marks puts it, we should apply second-level thinking.Let's begin by examining Sony's press release more closely: Stacked CMOS image sensors deliver superior image quality and advanced functionality in a compact size.Demand for these image sensors is anticipated to further increase, particularly within the expanding market for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.Sony is striving to bolster its production capacity for stacked CMOS image sensors and further strengthen its integrated supply operations in order to reinforce its leading position in the image sensor market.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>From this quote we can conclude (or assume) three things: Demand is expected to increase further Sony has a market leading position that it seeks to strengthen If one were to consider the investment from a business owner's perspective, would one deem the investment wise?</span>This is an easy question to answer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If your company has a market leading position, a superior product and expects an increase in demand, would you not seek to strengthen your position to fend off competitors and meet the demand?</span>Of course you would.As a careful business owner, however, you would want to make certain that your investment would not be threatened by new market entrants and/or competitors offering similar products at a lower price.You would need a form of unique advantage.The company has over three decades of imaging experience, and has managed to develop an image sensor that is smaller, faster, takes sharper pictures, and uses less power than any of the competitors.The technology is, of course, built in-house and patented, which makes the intangible asset a competitive advantage.Therefore, we would, as business owners, conclude that it is simply not economically reasonable for a competitor to invest in image sensor R&D and production facilities to match our products.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even if competitors were able to produce a product of similar quality, it would still be hard to penetrate the smartphone- and tablet market due to already established relationships between our company and customers (producers).</span>From a business owner's perspective, Sony's investment definitely seems like a rational allocation of capital.Superior products, increasing demand, and a competitive advantage are all factors that every investor looks for when deploying capital.As illustrated above, one cannot understand Sony's investment in semiconductors without applying second-level thinking.First-level thinkers would read the news about a $1B investment in semiconductors and likely conclude that Sony "continues to invest in underperforming businesses that aren't profitable and have no future due to intense competition".In short, Sony is in a very advantageous position to strengthen their moat in image sensor production.I believe this is the main reason why the company continues to invest in its Devices segment as the overall market for mobile devices is expected to grow for years to come.Also, the Devices segment is Sony's most profitable (picture 2), both on the bottom line and in terms of operating margin.The investment in Devices is therefore in line with Hirai's latest strategy announcement to emphasize profitability instead of volume.If present trends continue, however, Sony could be looking at both volume and profitability, as its image sensor business is poised to outperform.Source: Why Sony Is Investing Nearly $1B In Image Sensors Disclosure: The author is long SNE.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their
