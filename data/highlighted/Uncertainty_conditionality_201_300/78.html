(NYSE:SMFG) | Seeking Alpha Of Japan's big three, SMFG has the lowest price/book and PE ratios.SMFG is the most dependent on interest income, and does a great job turning that into EPS.All three Japanese banks have strong balance sheets, but SMFG has much more cash on hand.Japanese banks have always fascinated me.Interlocking conglomerates, called keiretsu, dominate the economy, and these conglomerates have extremely loyal ties with big banking firms.As it boils down, Japan has basically three big banks, each connected to two major keiretsu.The largest is Mitsubishi UTJ Financial Group (NYSE: MTU ), which supports the Mitsubishi and Sanwa keiretsu.Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (NYSE: SMFG ) covers construction giant Sumitomo and shipping giant Mitsui.Finally, we have Mizuho Financial Group (NYSE: MFG ), which has Fuyo and Dai-Ichi Kangyo.Among the big six conglomerates, and by extension the big three banks, the overwhelming majority of significant Japanese corporations are represented.The Nikkei average is surging to a 15-year high, with anticipation that Shinzo Abe's government planned reductions in corporate tax rates and a soft yen are going to benefit the export economy.As you might guess, a 15-year high means a lot of high premiums among top stocks.By the numbers, however, Japanese banks are still extremely reasonably priced, both compared to the Japanese market and compared to major international banks elsewhere in the world.What can I say?I love numbers, so lets bring some out.They're all huge, needless to say, but notice that the traditional bank metrics are all pretty favorable, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial is head and shoulders above the others in all counts.It's putting out the most loans as a percentage of their depositors, its trading at the best discount to book, and it's got almost 10 times the cash on hand that the others do.That's a respectable PE ratio in all three cases, but once again Sumitomo Mitsui Financial is clearly trading much cheaper relative to earnings.It's not necessarily a good or bad thing, but it's also worth noting that their interest income is a higher portion of their total income.Mizuho Financial gets more income from its fees than its interest spread, which is a good thing because they've got less deposits as a percentage of the liabilities on their balance sheet to work with.Sumitomo Mitsui is the most dependent on lending its deposits out, and fortunately for them they're doing an extremely good job with it.Sumitomo Mitsui's business, like the other two big banks, is overwhelmingly domestic to Japan.That doesn't mean the company doesn't have international aspirations, however, and last month they announced approval for a branch office in the Philippines.That may not sound like much, particularly since Sumitomo Mitsui was already doing business in Manila for decades through a representative at a local bank.With the Philippines economy among the fastest growing in southeast Asia, however, it is a sign that Sumitomo Mitsui is keen to expand its business there.Domestically, the bank is growing as well, with a deal to acquire Citigroup's (NYSE: C ) Japanese consumer banking assets back in December for only $334 million.Citigroup was never able to make that segment profitable, but merging it into Sumitomo Mitsui's already exceedingly profitable consumer banking segment, it should be pretty trivial for them to make a solid return on the investment.The Sumitomo keiretsu features 11 companies which are in the Nikkei 225 index.Like all conglomerates they've got interests in all sorts of industries, but the core of their assets are metals, mining, and heavy industry.Sumitomo exporters one may be familiar with are Mazda Motor Corporation ( OTCPK:MZDAY ) and electronics giant NEC.Mitsui, by contrast, is more interested in insurance, transportation, and steel work.One company directly under the Mitsui Group umbrella which investors will immediately recognize is Toshiba ( OTCPK:TOSYY ).Although they are not directly controlled by Mitsui, the company also has close ties to both Sony and Yamaha.Mitsui Group also has links to a third, smaller keiretsu, the Toyota Group.They are immediately recognizable as a major manufacturer of vehicles through Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM ), and as a keiretsu with no bank of their own, they work with Sumitomo Mitsui.The banks are lagging behind the broader market, as I've said, and a good argument can be made for any of them as an investment at this point, while we wait for the traditionally slow-moving banks catch up to the Nikkei.This is not unusual for the Japanese market, as the nature of the interlocking keiretsu means that it takes some time for the boom markets for certain companies to trickle down through the rest of the conglomerate's holdings, and finally to fully be realized by the bank itself.Of all of them, however, Sumitomo Mitsui is clearly the biggest bargain of the bunch, with no real justification for them to be trading at a discount to the other banks when they have such a strong balance sheet and such a large amount of cash to work with.Source: Japanese Banks Are A Bargain,
