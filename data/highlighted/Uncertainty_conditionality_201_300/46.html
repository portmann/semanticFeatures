The new CPI rebased to 2012 was released on February 12, 2015.Inflation in January 2015 at 5.1 per cent as measured by the new index was well within the target of 8 per cent for January 2015.Prices of vegetables declined and, hearteningly, inflation excluding food and fuel moderated in a broad-based manner to a new low.Thus, disinflation is evolving along the CorpusPath set out by the Reserve Bank in January 2014 and, in fact, at a faster pace than earlier envisaged.The primary reason for putting forward this comment is the point that the Indian central bank views disinflation evolving at a faster pace than expected.If this continues, I am of the view that another 25-50 basis points interest rate cut is likely within the next 3 months.Therefore, the positive trigger for the markets will continue and lower interest rates are important for robust GDP growth as it eases lending for core sectors such as infrastructure and manufacturing.From a investment perspective, I had pointed out ICICI Bank (NYSE: IBN ) and State Bank of India (OTC: SBKFF ) as good investments in the coming months.I maintain that view and both these banking stocks are likely to rally through 2015 as further interest rate cuts are on the horizon.This will trigger strong credit growth for these banks.With ICICI being the largest private sector bank and SBI being the largest public sector bank, the market position is strong to capitalize on the growth opportunity in the coming quarters.Besides the interest rate factor, I was also of the opinion in my earlier article that the Indian budget 2015-16 will be transformational.In my view, the budget is positive and focus on the housing and infrastructure sector has the potential to boost the country's GDP in the coming quarters.Further, the budget has also proposed to reduce corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over the next 4 years and this will have a positive impact on corporate earnings.According to Goldman Sachs strategist - The reform momentum remains positive with the Union budget focusing on growth, reviving investments and outlining various structural reforms that should bode positively for most sectors.We also expect the rate cycle to ease further.I must also point out that the Indian finance minister, who presented the budget, expects India's GDP growth to accelerate to 8.0%-8.5% in the fiscal year starting in April, from 7.4% percent this year.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If this target is achieved, India will overtake China as the fastest growing economy this fiscal.</span>In my view, this will translate into portfolio adjustments and more flow of investments in the Indian markets.Therefore, investors need to remain invested in Indian equities even as markets trade at record highs and I believe that positive triggers will continue to flow in the form of further interest rate cuts, strong corporate growth, accelerating GDP growth and improvement in the country's fiscal position through public sector unit disinvestments.Besides the banking stocks that I recommend earlier, there are several ETFs that can be considered for exposure to Indian equities.EG Shares India Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: INXX ) is a good investment option considering the focus on the housing and infrastructure sector.The ETF has high exposure to large and very large infrastructure companies in India and therefore the exposure is with companies having strong fundamentals.India Small-Cap Index ETF (NYSEARCA: SCIF ) is also a good investment option with several promising mid and small sized Indian companies that can make it big over the next 3-5 years.In conclusion, the rally in Indian markets is likely to continue and investors can consider fresh exposure to the markets even at current levels.Over the next one year, Indian markets can be a star performer.Source: Good News Continues For Indian Markets Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
