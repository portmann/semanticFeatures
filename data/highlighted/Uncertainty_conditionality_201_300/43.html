by saying that the revised data shows a picture of robust economy, with growth having picked up significantly over the last three years, which is at odds with still-low direct measures of growth of production, credit, imports and capacity utilization as well as with anecdotal evidence on the state of the economic cycle.But the RBI agreed with the picture of a steadily recovering economy as portrayed by the revised GDP series.RBI believes that there are many important reform measures in the budget, which will help improve supply over the medium term.The bank is of the view that, in the short-term, the postponement of fiscal consolidation to achieve targeted 3% (of GDP) by one year will increase aggregate demand.This worries the central bank from the standpoint of aggregate demand management (especially with large borrowings intended for public sector enterprises), at a time of accelerating economic recovery.RBI also welcomed the shift in spending - from subsidies to infrastructure, and to better target and further reduce subsidies through direct transfers.It also expressed its belief in the targeted fiscal deficit number.Government and Central bank agrees on inflation objectives The central government has signed a memorandum with the RBI setting out clear inflation objectives for the central bank.Now, the government and the central bank have common objectives, and fiscal and monetary policies are expected to work in a complementary way.RBI believes that, the government intends to compensate for the delay in fiscal consolidation with a commitment to an improvement in the quality of adjustment.The rupee (NYSEARCA: INR ) has remained strong relative to peer countries.While the RBI believes that an excessively strong rupee is undesirable, it creates disinflationary impulses.The central bank reiterated that it does not target a level for the exchange rate, nor does it have an overall target for foreign exchange reserves.While RBI continues to intervene (in both directions) on occasion, it is only to reduce avoidable volatility in the exchange rate, and any reserve build-up is a residual consequence of such actions rather than a direct objective.The bank justified its out-of-policy meeting actions by mentioning two reasons: While the next bi-monthly policy statement will be issued on April 7th, the still weak state of certain sectors of the economy as well as the global trend towards easing suggests that any policy action should be anticipatory once sufficient data support the policy stance.With the release of the agreement on the monetary policy framework, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to offer guidance on how it will implement the mandate.Going forward, the RBI will seek to bring the inflation rate to the mid-point of the band of 4 +/- 2% provided for in the agreement with the government, i.e., to 4% by the end of a two year period starting fiscal year 2016-17 (Apr-Mar).The current cut in policy rates was as expected.We believe that further rate cuts will be dependent on inflation dynamics, as quoted by the central bank: Further monetary actions will be conditioned by incoming data, especially on the easing of supply constraints, improved availability of key inputs such as power, land, minerals and infrastructure, continuing progress on high-quality fiscal consolidation, the pass through of past rate cuts into lending rates, the monsoon out-turn and developments in the international environment.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If disinflationary trends continue, and inflation remains below 6%, we believe that, the central bank will be comfortable in cutting rates by 25-50bps during the current calendar year.</span>Source: Reserve Bank Of India Eases Rates By 25 Bps; Expect Another 25-50 Bps In 2015 Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
