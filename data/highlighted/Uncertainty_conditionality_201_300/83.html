Includes: DBJP , DXJ , EWJ , EWV , EZJ , FJP , HEWJ , ITF , JPNL , JPP , NKY by: FX Analyst Japan emerges from recession with 2.2% annualized growth in the last quarter of 2014.Inflation stabilizes at 2.4% and is likely to be met with BoJ inaction.Japan emerged from a recession caused by the April 2014 consumption tax hike from 5% to 8%, with growth in the last quarter of 2014.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.6% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and by 2.2% on an annualized basis.The annualized growth of 2.2% came in lesser than the 3.7% expected by analysts, according to a Reuters poll.Consumer confidence grew for the past 3 conservative months from 37.7 in November 2014 to 38.8 in December 2014 and 39.1 in January 2015.Over 4,700 households were asked about their perceptions of overall livelihood, income growth, employment, their willingness to buy durable goods, and their prospect over the next 6 months.While consumer confidence has recovered after a low in November 2014, we note that 50 represents an expansion, and with the latest reading at 39.1, this still represents a contraction.Net exports grew by 0.2% and business spending grew by 0.1% over the last quarter.Any hint of monetary accommodation by the BoJ would result in a weaker yen and this is likely to damage consumer confidence further.We have to remember that the weaker yen only helps the exporters which has already benefited with a 0.2% growth in net export.This is the benefit of a weaker yen, but the cost would be that the ordinary Japanese have to pay more for their imports on top of a more expensive consumption tax.The USD/JPY is now constrained to the range of $118 to $120 on BoJ inaction, compared to the rise from July 2014 to November 2014.This seems to be a sweet spot for the Japanese economy for now.Another factor that may constraint the BoJ preference for monetary easing is that Statistic Japan had announced that inflation has grown by 2.4% for all items in Japan for January 2015.The chart above shows that inflation has firmed to 2.4% ever since the 80 trillion yen QQE program by the BoJ in October 2014 to stimulate the economy.Looking forward, the price of oil has bottomed out from a low of $45 in January 2015 to the current price of $62/barrel of brent crude oil.This would mean that inflation will continue to build up in the months ahead.This should prevent the BoJ from further aggressive policy in the next few months.As Japan emerges from recession, it should increase household's consumer confidence back to the 50 level and reverse the weakness in consumer spending, such as the -1.3% monthly reduction of sales in January 2015.This is merely the first page of the pending recovery of Japan, and we have to continue to keep an eye for it to see if it is a truly sustainable recovery.In an early encouraging sign, Japan's industrial production in January 2015 surged to 4.0% over market expectations of 2.9% and December 2014 growth of just 0.8%.This expansion is expected to carry on to February and March 2015 which is mainly attributed to foreign demand instead of domestic demand for Japan at this stage.The Japanese equity market took this positively together with the fact that Japan is officially out of recession.The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSEARCA: EWJ ) has been on a bullish trend as seen in the daily candlestick chart below.Since the February 2015 opening price of $11.62, the EWJ has appreciated by 6.28% in one month to $12.35.While this growth is good, I would still recommend a wait and see attitude for further signs of sustained improvement in the Japanese economy.If investors are really keen on the EWJ, they should enter at a discount with a target entry price of $12.00 to $12.10.For your information, the EWJ is a highly liquid ETF with market capitalization of $15.08 billion and daily transaction volume of 38 million.It includes world renowned Japanese blue chip companies, such as Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE: SMFG ), Mizuho (NYSE: MFG ) and Canon (NYSE: CAJ ), across the wide sector of the Japanese economy.So, if you are looking to seek exposure to the Japanese economy, EWJ is a good choice and it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in USD.Source: Japan Emerges From Recession Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
