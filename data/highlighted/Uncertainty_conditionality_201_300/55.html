core exports fell 3% YoY.Rising electronics goods imports is a concern; gold imports continue to be low.India's trade deficit numbers continued to shrink, with the numbers for January 2015 coming in at USD 8.3 bn (December 2014: USD 9.4 bn, January 2014: USD 9.5 bn).Imports were down ~11 YoY to USD 32.2 bn while exports also were down ~11 YoY to USD 23.9 bn.For the financial year-to-date (April-January), the trade deficit numbers have reached ~USD 118 bn (against ~USD 117 bn for the same period last year), with both exports and imports growing at ~2% YTD YoY.Imports fell, thanks to lower crude oil prices The continued sharp improvement in the trade balance compared to the previous month was due to fall in oil prices, leading to oil imports plummeting by 37% to USD 8.2 bn during the month (December 2014: USD 9.9 bn, January 2014: USD 13.2 bn).The price of Indian crude basket fell from an average of USD 105/barrel in January 2014 to USD 47/barrel in January 2015.Crude imports were once a third of total imports, and the proportion has now fallen to 25%.But how long crude prices will remain favourable is a lingering question.As we write this article, crude prices were USD 59/barrel, up 27% from prices at the end of January 2015.Non-oil non-gold imports (core imports) increased ~3% YoY to USD 22.4 bn during the month.Top 10 items in the import bill is given below.While crude oil fell 37% YoY, Electronic Goods (+ 20%), Coal (+22%) and Iron and Steel (+ 32%) imports went up significantly.We note that, imports of electronic goods - the second highest item in the import bill - are increasing at a worrying pace, with imports during the first 10 months totaling to USD 31 bn, compared to USD 27 bn during the same period last year.Exports also contracted due to fall in oil prices Exports contracted ~11% YoY, mainly due to fall in petroleum exports, which halved to USD 2.4 bn in January 2015.Core exports (exports ex-petroleum products) contracted 3% YoY - due to fall in Gems & Jewellery and Chemicals exports.Data from the Reserve Bank of India showed that the Indian Rupee [INR] appreciated in terms of Real Effective Exchange rate during January, with overvaluation pegged at ~12% compared to 36 trading partners.Year-to-date, rupee appreciated against all the four major currencies, including the dollar, despite the dollar strengthening.This was due to lower crude oil prices and strong performance in the local stock markets.While we see the improvement in recent trade deficit numbers as driven by crude oil alone, we note that core imports inched up while core exports contracted.Balance of payments data for October-December 2014 to be released by the end of this month is the key data point we are watching for the rupee.Despite the significant gains on account of lower crude prices, trade deficit in October-December quarter deteriorated to 7.7% of GDP - the highest in six quarters.This is due to higher imports of electronic goods, fertilizers, machinery, and most notably, gold.The imports of gold have fallen since then, but electronic goods import continues to be strong.India will need to incentivise the electronics manufacturing sector to arrest the quick rise in such imports.As the global growth, ex-US, remained fragile, exports will remain under pressure.India's inflation eased recently, which we believe to be favourable for exports, as lower inflation differentials help in reducing the pace at which India loses its cost competitiveness vis-?-vis the rest of the world.We maintain our 2015-end INR target of INR 65/USD, depreciating due to broad dollar strength, and overvaluation in REER terms.Source: India's Trade Deficit Improves Again In January, Thanks Again To Crude Oil Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
