The economics of Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance The word 'property' usually refers to physical objects - autos, homes, art, etc. - that can be lost, damaged or otherwise cause the owner to sustain financial loss.The word 'casualty' usually refers to the concept of liability and is often associated with coverage of negligent acts or omissions - professional liability, worker's compensation, etc.Insurance companies primarily make money in two ways: By generating an underwriting profit.I.e., collecting premiums that exceed insured losses and related expenses.Investment income - premiums are collected from the insured (policyholders) upfront and paid out in claims later.In the interim, the insurer is left holding large sums of money (sometimes called 'float') that may be invested at the insurer's discretion (modulo regulatory guidelines).If premiums exceed total expenses and eventual losses, the insurer not only gets to pocket the investment income from float, but also gets paid for holding it.Unfortunately, due to the economics of the business being so enticing on paper, it attracts intense competition.The resulting pricing pressure often causes underwriting profits to be slim to non-existent - in most years, the P&C industry as a whole operates at a significant underwriting loss.For our current purposes, the precise definition of float is unimportant.The point that needs to be understood is that float behaves like a revolving fund.Every day an insurer pays out policyholders in claims, while at the same time the insurer also replenishes its float by writing new or renewing old policies.On a day-to-day basis, the precise amount in this revolving fund will bob up and down.However, for a mature insurance company operating at scale, writing a diverse range of recurring business, and not making significant changes to its business model, the amount of float will be stable.It will shrink or grow only rather gradually over years.Framework for analyzing an insurance company The earnings power of its float (i.e., investment income).At first glance, the cost/quality of float seems easy to determine - P&C insurance companies regularly publish their 'combined ratio'.The combined ratio represents total insurance costs (expenses plus losses incurred) compared to revenue received from premiums.So a combined ratio of 95% means that for every $100 of premium that the insurer wrote, $5 was pocketed as profit.Unfortunately, the combined ratio is meaningless over short periods of time: quarterly and even annual underwriting figures are too heavily based on estimates to be any good.However, the combined ratio taken over a period of years gives a rough indication of the cost of float.The primary objective of a high quality insurer is to price policies profitably with unwavering discipline.Intense competition in the industry and an often misguided emphasis on increasing the size of float (as opposed to quality) causes insurers and underwriters to come under great pressure to increase premium volume at all costs (i.e., regardless of underwriting profitability).Moreover, since calculating underwriting losses involves significant estimates initially, insurance companies can show underwriting profitability for short periods of time by simply 'underestimating' their losses.In effect, an insurer could run itself like a Ponzi scheme (perhaps even unintentionally).Determining the earnings power of float requires an analysis of the investment portfolio of the insurer.Insurance companies invest in a mix of fixed income instruments, equities and private equities.Thus, any analysis of this must include some consideration of prevailing and future interest rates, quality of bonds, equities, etc.Chubb has been in the P&C insurance business since 1882.According to A.M. Best (the leading independent authority on insurance operations in the U.S.), Chubb constituted the 12th largest P&C insurance group in the U.S. based on 2013 net premiums written.The company operates via three business units: Personal Insurance, Commercial Insurance and Specialty Insurance.For the year ended December 31, 2014, these units represented 36%, 43%, 21%, respectively, of Chubb's total net premiums written (figures pulled from the latest 10-K ).The Personal Insurance unit primarily focuses on high net worth individuals, writing policies on homes, fine art, jewelry, fine cars, yachts, etc.The Commercial unit focuses on specific industries and niches, writing policies for liability, automobile, worker's compensation, property, marine, etc.The Specialty Insurance unit writes specialized professional liability policies for private as well as public companies.These are products ranging from directors and officers liability to fiduciary liability insurance.In a nutshell, Chubb writes diverse lines of business.A significant percentage of its business is in niche areas which insulates the company (to a small extent) from pricing pressures.This insulation from pricing pressures will manifest itself in the data as we will see in a moment.Perusing Chubb's latest 10-K and old reports (available here ) one obtains the following data for Chubb: The key takeaways from these numbers are: Total business underwritten has remained remarkably stable over the years.As evidenced by the combined ratio, underwriting seems to have been priced quite profitably.Total invested assets have gradually increased over the years.Let me remind the reader that the combined ratio for any given year is mostly meaningless - it involves significant estimates of the total losses that may have to be paid out in the future.The true amount of losses only becomes clear over time.Regardless, a combined ratio under a 100% over a number of years is indicative of profitable underwriting.This is especially true if net premiums written, invested assets, and the capital structure of the company remain stable (losses/claims do need to be paid out at some point; if premiums remain stable, there is some assurance that claims payments aren't just being funded by writing new business.The latter strategy would for all intents and purposes function like a Ponzi scheme, with the attendant consequences down the line).A useful supplement to the data above is a tally of the company's initial loss estimates compared to the actual amounts paid out over time.In the following table, the top line shows the estimated net liability for unpaid losses recorded on the balance sheet for the indicated years.It represents the estimated losses to be paid out in the future for all years prior to the balance sheet date.The upper section of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded estimates at the end of each succeeding year.As time goes on, more information becomes available, estimated losses turn into actual losses and the numbers approach economic reality.The conclusion is clear: Chubb has habitually been conservative in estimating losses - actual losses have, so far, turned out to be lower than their initial estimates.That is, over time underwriting has often been more profitable than any individual year's combined ratio may initially indicate.Return on investments going forward.Given Chubb's track record, it is reasonable to assume that the company will continue to underwrite with discipline.What we need to do is come up with a conservative estimate of the combined ratio that the company may be expected to maintain over the years in the future.In the past decade, the worst years for Chubb (from an underwriting perspective) were 2011 and 2012.Both resulted in a combined ratio of 95.3%.The year 2011 was particularly bad for the whole industry due to the loss impact from earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand.According to Chubb's 10-K for 2011 , catastrophes accounted for 8.9 percentage points of the combined ratio.The same catastrophe impact (plus additional impact from superstorm Sandy) continued into 2012.Of course, catastrophe losses should not be treated as 'one-time' events for an insurance business - providing protection against catastrophes is an integral part of the business model.Regardless, given Chubb's underwriting profitability even in years experiencing considerable catastrophes, one may reasonably and conservatively estimate that the company will be able to maintain a combined ratio of 95% (or better) over time going forward.It also seems reasonable to assume that the amount of business the company underwrites will remain fairly stable over the years at about $12 billion.Putting it all together, one may conservatively estimate that Chubb will produce $600 million in pre-tax underwriting profit (annually) going forward.To deal with investment income, we need to analyze Chubb's investment portfolio.The company primarily invests in high quality fixed income securities (U.S. treasuries, investment grade corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, etc.).Thus, investment income is significantly impacted by prevailing interest rates and the re-investment/maturity profile of the portfolio.The company's investment income has been coming under pressure due to reinvestments in the prevailing low interest rate environment.As to how long this environment will continue, the timing and rate of interest rate changes is anyone's best guess.A conservative approach to take would be to simply assume that the yield on the investment portfolio will continue to come under pressure.A reasonable estimate would be a 3% pre-tax investment yield going forward.This yields an estimate of about $1.2 billion in annual pre-tax investment income.Summing up, a rational investor may conservatively expect Chubb to earn $1.8 billion in pre-tax income (annually) going forward.From the perspective of a private business owner, this information allows one to estimate a value for Chubb in its entirety - the value of the business is the sum of all future unencumbered cash flows appropriately discounted.Varying the discount rate between 7%-10% values Chubb in the range of $18 billion-$27 billion.That is, if the owner requires a minimum of a 10% annualized pre-tax return from investment, then he/she should pay (roughly) no more than $18 billion.Similarly, lowering the required return rate hurdle to 7%, values the business at an approximate maximum of $27 billion.Of course, minority shareholders are not in the same shoes as private business owners - shareholders do not get to pocket the profits from the business and deploy it as they see fit.Instead, a shareholder is at the mercy of Chubb's management as far as the allocation of the profits from the business are concerned.Thus, we need to evaluate management's handling of these profits.Management's capital allocation options in general The management of any publicly traded corporation has essentially three options for the redeployment of profits from the business: Reinvest into the business to grow organically, or acquire other businesses to grow.The dividend option is the easiest to understand for a shareholder - a cash payout is quite self-explanatory.The goal of reinvesting for organic growth or acquiring companies is to increase future cash flows from the business.Determining the efficacy of this action requires determining the rate of return on this additional capital deployed.This can be complicated.For insurance companies, the situation is sometimes simplified by the fact that organic growth often translates to growing the size of the investment portfolio.A priori, share repurchases are the most confusing.However, it is easy to see that, essentially, share repurchases are a hybrid version of the other two options.The simplest way to see this is to divide shareholders at any given moment in time into two classes and to assume (for simplicity) that the company is the only buyer in the market.The two classes of shareholders being those who will continue to hold the stock, and those who are selling the stock.From the perspective of sellers, the company's repurchase of shares is simply a cash payout.The situation for continuing shareholders is more interesting.For continuing shareholders, the company's repurchase of shares increases the fractional percentage ownership of each share.In effect, on a per share basis, this behaves exactly the same way as say organic or acquired growth in the business would work.Put differently, for continuing shareholders, repurchase of shares by the company amounts to additional investment in the company by management on behalf of shareholders.Thus, the efficacy of this is determined by the price paid for repurchasing shares and the future earnings of the business.An important caveat is in order: if share repurchases do not result in reduction in shares outstanding (i.e., the purchases were completely offset by dilution from stock based compensation say), then there is almost no net benefit to continuing shareholders.Thus, any claims by management of having 'returned value to shareholders' via share repurchases should be backed up by an actual reduction in shares outstanding.Capital allocation decisions by Chubb management Over the past few years, Chubb management has deployed earnings from the business primarily into dividends and share repurchases.Share repurchases have resulted in a considerable reduction in shares outstanding.For instance, there were approximately 261 million shares outstanding at the end of 2012; as of February 13, 2015, there were approximately 231 million shares outstanding.Furthermore, these shares were repurchased at prices under (often significantly under) $100 per share.To put this in perspective: $100 per share translates to a market capitalization of approximately $23 billion.By our estimates, Chubb will earn at least $1.8 billion pre-tax moving forward.In effect, Chubb management has been redeploying earnings into an investment with a pre-tax yield higher than 7.8%.As of writing, Chubb's share price hovers around $100 per share.Based on our estimates and management's capital allocation decisions, an investor buying at current prices and holding for the long term can reasonably expect to realize a return in the neighborhood of 8% annualized (dividends plus share price appreciation).By most standards, this is a reasonably attractive security.However, any individual investor should judge this attractiveness based on their opportunity costs (i.e., rational yield expectations on alternative investment opportunities available to them).The current risk free return as embodied by yields on 5-year U.S. treasuries hovers at around 1.5%.The prospective return on the S&P 500 index, as roughly approximated by the current earnings yield, hovers around 5%.There are some standard risks with any analysis such as the one above.The most salient one being that a number of estimates about the future have been made (for instance, underwriting profitability going forward, prevailing interest rates).Although an effort has been made to err on the side of conservatism, these are still estimates about the future which are always fraught with uncertainty.One also has some risks that are specific to insurance companies that an investor needs to be cognizant of.Instead of listing them here, let me refer the reader to the disclosure in the company's 10-K .Additionally, there are some risks specific to Chubb that have not been discussed (primarily because in the author's opinion they are not particularly significant).Some of these risks are: Chubb has a defined benefit pension plan.Although this plan seems to have been funded adequately, defined benefit liabilities at corporations in general have shown a disturbing tendency of ballooning as time goes on.Chubb has significant international operations.This subjects the company to the usual risks resulting from operating in legal, political, regulatory and business climates other than the United States.Chubb has some legacy asbestos related liabilities.Although these liabilities seem to have been adequately accounted and reserved for, asbestos litigation has proven to be a continuing prolonged process.A re-estimation of these liabilities may possibly affect the future profitability of the company adversely.Source: Chubb: Detailed
