attractive economics, with high returns on capital and recession-resistant qualities.Over the last decade, AZO has reduced its share count by 60%, and delivered a 550% total return to investors.Despite AutoZone’s superior Sales/Square Foot, operating margin and return on investment, the company trades at a discount to its peers.Over the last decade, AutoZone (NYSE: AZO ) has been an outstanding investment, growing EPS at a CAGR of 17% and delivering a total return of 550%.This performance has been driven by stable, recession-resistant earnings growth averaging 6.5% a year, and a massive, shareholder-friendly buyback program which has reduced AZO's share count by 60% over the last 10 years.Operating in the attractive auto parts industry, AutoZone still has a long growth runway ahead of it and presents current investors with a reasonable entry point in a somewhat overheated market.The automotive aftermarket is divided into 2 distinct, yet complementary industry segments: the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) or Commercial markets.The DIY auto aftermarket provides repair and maintenance products to customers who work on their own vehicles.The DIY industry segment is somewhat smaller than the commercial market, yet is growing at a relatively faster rate (market size shown below).DIY is more consolidated than the DIFM market, making it difficult for industry participants to grow market share and reducing the number of acquisition opportunities.With repair and maintenance expenses being difficult to defer, the DIY market tends to be shielded from market cyclicality.Customers often demand high levels of assistance in product selection and require rapid product delivery, giving industry participants pricing power and limiting the potential of online competition.Relative to the commercial market, the DIY market tends to command higher gross margins, yet involves a greater level of selling, general and administrative expenses.AutoZone dominates the DIY market, with 15% market share and more than 75% more revenue than its next closest competitor (shown below).With more than 80% of AZO's revenue coming from the DIY customer, AutoZone's near-term results are highly dependent on this segment.The commercial or "Do-It-For-Me" auto aftermarket serves customers who have experts perform their maintenance and repairs.This segment of the market has experienced a somewhat slower growth rate than DIY (shown below), but due to its fragmented nature, it gives industry leaders the potential for meaningful market share growth.AutoZone has decided to enter the DIFM market organically.By adding commercial programs to existing stores, AZO has been able to push DIY revenue to over 18% of sales from under 12% in 2009.With 30% of commercial programs started in the last 3 years and more than 20% of stores without a commercial program, there is still a significant opportunity to increase DIFM penetration within AutoZone's existing store base.DIFM still represents a considerable growth opportunity for AutoZone and will be a meaningful contributor to the company's expansion, with both organic growth and acquisitions likely to play a part in growth within this segment.Industry Competitive Factors and Consolidation Because the auto parts industry has the difficult task of sourcing parts for all vehicles made over the last decade or more, competing in this business requires a significant investment in slow-moving inventory.Although this would generally be considered an unattractive characteristic, in this industry it has created a substantial barrier to entry, protecting the profits of top companies.Larger competitors are able to profitably hold more inventory than their smaller competitors, as their greater footprint allows them to move through this inventory faster, generating more sales for each dollar invested.Their added scale also gives them more bargaining power over suppliers, improving margins and profitability.Because of the competitive advantages enjoyed by larger companies, the auto parts industry has undergone significant consolidation, leading to a relative oligopoly between industry leaders Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP ), AutoZone, and O'Reilly Auto Parts (NASDAQ: ORLY ) (shown below).This consolidation has partially been the result of large acquisitions by both Advance Auto Parts and O'Reilly, with Advance completing the transformative acquisition of General Parts International in 2014 and O'Reilly completing the acquisition of CSK in 2008.These top companies have also been able to take market share organically, outgrowing the market due to their greater scale, improved inventory availability and enhanced profitability, leading to stable, mid-single-digit unit growth (shown below).With these companies still collectively holding less than 50% market share, each has a number of years of profitable, above industry growth rates ahead.AutoZone has been able to convert its leading competitive position into impressive profitability.AZO has been able to generate more profit than its competitors for each dollar of sales, although O'Reilly has made inroads since its acquisition of CSK in 2008 (shown below).AutoZone has enjoyed industry leading cost of goods sold, SG&A and operating income as a percentage of revenue, with these impressive metrics stemming from the company's dominant position in the DIY market and its greater sales per square foot (shown below).The auto parts industry as a whole has benefited from a steady reduction in cost of goods sold, with product costs decreasing with the industry's improved bargaining power.This increased consolidation will remain a tailwind for gross margins in coming years, helping industry leaders grow profits faster than sales for the foreseeable future.AutoZone will also benefit from SG&A expenses decreasing as a percentage of revenue, as its commercial sales continue to grow faster than DIY.Overall operating margin can be expected to grow modestly over time due to this gross margin and SG&A improvement, boosting future earnings and return on capital.AutoZone's same-store sales metrics have lagged its peers recently, with same-store sales averaging 2.1% over the last decade, compared to Advance's and O'Reilly's 2.7% and 4.8% growth, respectively (shown below).The blame for this underperformance rests primarily on AutoZone's underperformance in the commercial segment.Over this time frame, both Advance and O'Reilly have grown DIFM sales at a faster rate than DIY, helping grow their same-store sales faster than the industry average.AutoZone has only recently made a push to enter this underpenetrated segment; increasing the proportion of its stores serving DIFM customers starting in 2010, coinciding with the company's improvement in same-store sales.With AutoZone improving the positioning of its commercial segment, it's likely to bridge this same-store sales gap over the next few years.Over the next decade, same-store sales growth can be expected to be north of 3% on the back of this success in the commercial market.AutoZone's consistent profitability and strong cash flow generation have enabled the company to pursue stable store expansion with the remainder of cash flows (and modest debt issuance) used to fund a shareholder-friendly buyback program (shown below).Over the last decade, AutoZone has reduced its share count by 60%, or 8.9% annually, boosting the total return on the stock to more than 550%.With AutoZone continuing to generate significant cash flow, buybacks will remain a meaningful contributor of AZO's total return going forward.Assuming AZO trades at a comparable valuation and maintains similar leverage, AutoZone has the ability to reduce its share count by 5%-6% annually going forward, raising its total return by a similar amount.AutoZone has the potential to sustain double digit earnings per share growth for at least the next decade.AutoZone targets 3%-4% annual square foot growth, which is an achievable target considering the company's stable domestic growth and rapid international growth prospects (with Mexican and Brazilian stores growing to 7.5% of AZO's store count, from under 2% in 2004).This unit growth, combined with 3% same-store sale growth and modest margin expansion (to a 21% operating and 12% net margin, from 19% and 11%, respectively in 2014), would bring net income growth to 7.5% annually.This would double AZO's net income over the next decade, in line with results from the last 10 years.Combining this net income growth with an annual 5%-6% share count reduction will lead to EPS growth of more than 14% annually over the next 10 years.This EPS growth rate assumes no acquisitions, which would have the potential to increase EPS growth further.Despite its industry-leading operating metrics, attractive growth prospects, and shareholder-friendly buyback program, AutoZone has historically traded at a persistent discount to its peers (historic P/E ratios shown below).Relative to its peers, AZO has traded at an average discount of 28% and 8% to ORLY and AAP, respectively, over the last 9 years, with this discount widening modestly to 32% and 11% at present.Currently, the auto parts industry is priced above its historic norm with AAP and AZO trading around 30% above their normal P/E ratios of 17 and 15, respectively, and ORLY trading almost 40% above its normal P/E of 21.Although this may be symptomatic of an overvalued market, it bears caution as investors may be baking in an overly optimistic scenario for the auto parts industry as a whole.Assuming a 9.5% discount rate, 7.5% earnings growth over the next 10 years and a 3% terminal growth rate, AZO would have a fair value around $750 per share.AutoZone currently trades modestly below this fair value, although I would recommend investors wait for a modest pullback to below $600 before initiating a position.This price would give investors a 20% discount to fair value, which is a reasonable entry point considering the low beta, recession-resistant nature of the stock.This price would give AZO a P/E ratio of 18, more in line with its historic norms and would be a good entry point into this long-term outperformer.Source: Let AutoZone Drive Your
