Director and Member of Business Development Committee Hong Zhao - Chief Executive Officer of China Operations Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by.Welcome to the SciClone Pharmaceuticals 2014 Financial Results.[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to Jane Green from Investor Relations.Please go ahead.Good afternoon.SciClone would like to thank you for joining the call today.The company would also like to remind you that today's call is being recorded.Speaking on today's call are Dr. Friedhelm Blobel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wilson Cheung, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Hong Zhao, Chief Executive Officer, China Operations.It is SciClone's intent that all forward-looking statements, including statements regarding financial guidance and commercial and development activity made during today's call, be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed.All

documents that SciClone files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Forms 10-Q and 10-K.Good afternoon, and welcome to SciClone's conference call and webcast to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results and our outlook for 2015.I'd like to focus my comments today on SciClone's overall performance, the highlights of the quarter and the year and what we are looking forward to in 2015.I'll also provide perspective on the continuing evolution of the China pharmaceutical market and the opportunities these changes can represent for SciClone.Hong will briefly comment on our commercial strategies and organization, and Wilson will provide an update on key strategic issues as well as our full year financial results.Then we will open the call for questions.We are extremely pleased with the continued strong performance of our core business in the fourth quarter and full year.We are especially pleased to have delivered on our growth objectives for the last 5 quarters in a row and delivered on our revenue and EPS guidance for the year.Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $8.7 million or 27% higher than the same period last year.ZADAXIN performed very well and grew by 28% compared to the same period in 2013.This performance reflects the continued strong growth of the last 5 quarters and continued demand in the market for our flagship product.Importantly, our volume market share for ZADAXIN continues to hold steady at approximately 14, 1-4, percent and our value share continues at more than 40, 4-0, percent.We think this is a remarkable performance given that ZADAXIN has been in the market since 1996 and is indicative of its competitive strength as a high-quality, differentiated product.Market indicators suggest that traditional Chinese medicine is likely to remain a major market category for at least the next decade, underscoring ZADAXIN's value as a proven product with a differentiated [indiscernible] pedigree.In a highly competitive marketplace in which the generic companies has no differentiation based on quality but can only compete on price, we are very pleased with the continued strength of ZADAXIN sales and maintenance of its leading market position.We believe that we can continue to achieve our goal of growing ZADAXIN in line with China pharma market growth and for the company potentially exceeding that growth rate over the next several years.In addition to the continued strength of ZADAXIN, we are extremely pleased to several additional achievements in 2014, notably, the approval of DC Bead and the establishment of a cardiovascular product partnership with The Medicines Company, adding 2 promising products to our portfolio: ANGIOMAX and CLEVIPREX.We are very excited about the pending launch of DC Bead, which was registered in China in August of last year for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, the most common form of primary liver cancer.DC Bead is a novel product for the China market consisting of an embolic bead delivered through a minimally invasive, nonsurgical procedure to block the blood flow to tumors.The majority of people with HCC have cirrhosis usually from chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or chronic alcoholism.Because of the country's high incidence of hepatitis, China accounts for approximately 1/2 of the world's liver cancer cases.More than 350,000 people die from primary liver cancer in China annually.We and our partner, BTG, believes that there is great interest among Chinese physicians to offer new differentiated treatment options to patients.DC Bead has the potential to be a successful interventional oncology product in the China market to help address this medical need.Since receiving approval, our oncology sales team and economic marketing liaisons have been actively preparing to launch the product, anticipated to take place at the beginning of the second quarter.We have established high-quality relationships with the medical professionals and institutions that specialize in cancer treatment, which we believe will be a critical advantage in introducing DC Bead to the market.In March, we are planning to host an important medical symposium at the China Conference on Interventional Oncology designed to educate a large group of physicians about the scientific rationale and medical practice of using DC Bead in the treatment of liver cancer.The technique of administering DC Bead requires some skills and specialized scanning technology in order to place the beads property in the vasculature, which the major PCI centers in China presents.So our educational and marketing efforts will focus on these key targets.We have the additional advantage that BTG's partner in Japan, Eisai, is already engaged in launching the product in that market, and we are learning from their experiences in educating Japanese oncologists.While we know that successfully introducing DC Bead will require some pioneering marketing and educational efforts, we believe that this product in time can become a major revenue driver for SciClone and can be accepted by interventional oncologists as a major step forward in the treatment of HCC.The current market competitor is a cheap generic, Lipiodol, which is a formulation of particles that is injected into the hepatic artery.As the higher quality, premium price product, we believe that DC Bead can potentially transform the treatment of liver cancer, but it could take a few years to get there.As we have noted before, we expect to begin to recognize DC Bead revenues in the second quarter of 2015.We will recognize revenue when we sell to the distributor and hospitals will start buying only thereafter.We expect DC Bead 2015 revenues to be quite modest with an anticipated breakeven point after approximately 3 years.Relative to our growing cardiovascular portfolio, we were delighted to announce in December the establishment of a strategic partnership with The Medicines Company for 2 cardiovascular products: ANGIOMAX and CLEVIPREX.We believe that these 2 products represent significant opportunities for SciClone and have the potential to augment our cardiovascular franchise.Both ANGIOMAX and CLEVIPREX offer significant synergies with our current cardiovascular portfolio in our sales and marketing activities.We believe that ANGIOMAX represents an attractive alternative to current treatment options in the large and growing PCI market with a potential to achieve effectiveness, including reducing bleeding events especially in high-risk patients.In this way, ANGIOMAX is an excellent complement to Aggrastat, which is targeted to patients with a lower risk of bleeding events.In addition, the anti-hypertensive CLEVIPREX offers potential advantages when compared to conventional IV products thanks to its rapid onset, short half life and arterial selectivity.We are looking forward to working with our partner, The Medicines Company, to advance these promising products.We will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization, including pre- and post-launch activities in China, and we will also assist in the China registration process.We know that MedCo had many options for partnering these valuable products in China.That they have chosen SciClone is testimony to our expertise in the cardiovascular market, especially our established presence in Chinese hospitals, cardiac catheterization labs, strong relationships with cardiologists and strong knowledge of the market and the regulatory process.In addition, the quality of our commercial organization and especially our unwavering commitment to compliance were key differentiators that made our company the partner of choice.Looking forward to our prospects for 2015, we anticipate continued growth in demand for ZADAXIN, continued progress in our development pipeline and continued pursuit of strategic opportunities to augment our portfolio with additional e-licensing and promotional transactions.We also continue to believe that the changing dynamics of the Chinese pharma market will continue to offer both challenges and opportunities and will ultimately benefit companies like SciClone that offer high-quality, differentiated products that advance the practice of medicine.We continue to anticipate growth opportunities for ZADAXIN in the indications for which it is currently approved and develop potential new indication.As we have previously discussed, we believe that the therapeutic areas of hepatitis B and sepsis continue to represent growth areas for ZADAXIN and are continuing to implement academic marketing strategies to deepen market penetration.We're also looking forward to sponsoring an additional sepsis trial, which is anticipated to be initiated in China by local researchers this year.Data from that trial, if positive, could complement the positive data from the earlier trial we have reported on, and that showed the survival advantage for sepsis patients treated with ZADAXIN and could help to drive utilization.We are also hopeful of making progress with the other products in our development portfolio.Neucardin for congestive heart failure is moving along and our partner continues to enroll a 1,600 patient Phase III trial in China.We believe that Neucardin represents a market opportunity to SciClone that could be as big as ZADAXIN and perhaps even exceed ZADAXIN's revenues.Relative to ProFlow for peripheral arterial disease, our partner TLC had been in discussions with both the China and Taiwanese regulatory authorities relative to the development process and has intended to file a clinical trial application, or CTA.TLC was recently notified by the CFDA that ProFlow did not receive clinical trial approval.TLC is in the process of appealing this decision.Until that appeal process is completed, we will not be able to predict the time line, if any, for developing ProFlow for the China market.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While this is a disappointment, SciClone and TLC plan to continue to have close communication for this development and discuss alternative strategies in our collaboration.</span>Our 2 other development portfolio products, the antifungal Loramyc and the fast-acting, portable RapidFilm for delivery of ondansetron to treat nausea induced by chemotherapy are continuing to make progress in the regulatory process as well.The China pharmaceuticals market is anticipated to maintain a healthy growth rate, is best [ph] estimated at about 13% to 14% in 2015 and at a similar rate throughout this decade.The dynamics of this market are continuing to evolve.We have noted before that the ambitious government-led reform initiative is succeeding in increasing access to health care products and services and is also creating the need to raise [ph] rising cost.There are various pilot programs ongoing.Some at the national level and some at the provincial level that are affecting all aspects of pharmaceutical R&D, including drug approval and regulatory processes and timelines, pricing and competition.Some of these programs appear to be leading towards a more market-based approach rather than a centralized government-controlled approach.China watchers agree that it is going to take a while for all of this to sort out.Our perspective is that the movement towards more open market with a more level-playing field will ultimately be beneficial.The government support for growing a more innovation-based pharmaceutical industry that can become an exporter of pharma products, not just an importer, is a critical and positive change.Innovation requires a more open competitive market and a regulatory process designed to encourage innovator companies by providing a clearer and more predictable regulatory process.Another key aspect of encouraging innovation is to enhance enforcement of intellectual property protection.The generic companies will always continue to play a role in the market, but investment in innovative pharmaceutical research and development has to be able to realize a return.While it might take some time for these aspects of the market to change and the CorpusPath to reform may not always be straight, we believe that SciClone is well positioned to benefit by building a portfolio of only high-quality, differentiated products in established therapeutic classes that advance medical care, we can continue to offer premium priced options that physicians favor and that patients will pay for out of pocket regardless of their level of reimbursement.Our development portfolio includes products that could move through the regulatory process as midterm market opportunities.ANGIOMAX, for example, could gain market approval in 2018.We could see other approvals in that time frame or shortly thereafter, all of which can begin to contribute to our revenue growth.Our business development strategies are focused on pursuing opportunities to bolster our marketed product portfolio in the near term as well as drive longer-term growth.As the China market continues to evolve, we are convinced that SciClone will increasingly be viewed as the partner of choice for companies that may want to participate in the market's growth but reduce their risk exposure.We believe that our self acumen, the reputation of our sales organization and our market knowledge and extensive compliance program will continue to be partnering assets in the coming years.Our strong cash flow and cash balance combined with operating efficiencies and well-managed organizational growth should continue to provide us with the resources to acquire potentially valuable assets that can continue to drive our growth and strengthen our position in the China pharma market.Thank you, Friedhelm.We believe that our enhanced sales, marketing and organization strategy in 2014 and our strong emphasis on the implied [ph] were the key growth drivers last year.In 2015, we are moving forward with additional innovative market-based programs to extend our market success.We are implementing the key programs to increase the direct engagement with our customers as part of our retail-focused going-to-patient strategy.We are doing direct outreach to customers with more medical and scientifical events.Our highly trained sales representatives and the medical and sales personnel play key roles in those efforts.We are using digital marketing programs to expand patient access.This includes electronic tools to enhance physician detailing [ph], Internet marketing and [indiscernible] to the consumer outreach.These efforts connect the company to physicians, patients and investors [ph].We are excited to prepare the launch of the DCB target for the early second quarter.This involves a lot of the market research and particular events for physicians in the Chinese [ph] market and deploy our sales team [indiscernible].We have the benefit of being able to leverage the largest medical scientific network we have established in the oncology community.At the same time, we are continuing to strength and enhance our compliance program and ensure that every employee adheres to the strict rules and regulations we have put in place.We have little tolerance for the noncompliant.At our analyst meeting in January, our theme for 2015, focus on building SciClone success in the China pharma market, we believe that we are off to an excellent start this year.Thank you, Hong.Now I would like to ask Wilson to discuss our financial performance for 2014 and our outlook for 2015.Wilson?Thanks, Friedhelm.Before I review our full year 2014 financial results, I'd like to provide some brief updates on corporate matters.With respect to the SEC-DOJ ongoing investigations, while there have been no significant developments to the reported publicly in the current quarter, discussions among members of our Board of Directors, our external counsel and the government are continuing.We are still not yet in a position to predict what the outcome of those investigations will be or the timing of any resolutions.We have not recorded any additional charge above the $2 million we reported in March 2014 to reflect our estimate of a probable loss incurred related to potential penalties, fines and/or other remedies in the ongoing investigations.It should be noted that we could be required to pay higher fines or other penalties.With respect to MEDA, we filed a request for second arbitration in December 2014 in order to enforce our right to compensation.The arbitration case is pending and no hearing has taken place yet.The amount of any final payment to us remains uncertain and as such, we have not recognized any gains in our financial statements.Relative to our stock repurchase program, we are pleased to announce today that the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $15 million for share repurchase through the end of 2015.Our strong cash balance enables us to continue this program while having adequate cash to pursue our business development opportunities.We continue to believe that our stock repurchase program is a value-creating strategy for our stockholders, and we are very pleased to be able to continue implementing the program in 2015.We're also very pleased to announce today that we were able to remediate and eliminate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that have been previously reported in 2012 and 2013.The material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of certain corporate monitoring controls.During 2014, we designed and implemented procedures to address the material weakness, including corporate monitoring controls and many other controls that provide an increased oversight over our China operations.As a result, the material weakness was fully remediated as of December 31, 2014.As part of our strong commitment to compliance in every aspect of our business, we continuously work on improvements in our internal controls so that we can have confidence in our ability to continue to meeting our reporting obligations.We are proud of the significant improvements we have put in place to ensure implementation of high-quality internal controls going forward.Now I would like to review our financial results.I will focus my comments on the full year performance.Please consult the press release we issued today for full details.For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues were $134.8 million compared to revenues of $127.1 million last year.ZADAXIN revenues were $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $29.8 million or 30.9% increase compared to $96.3 million last year.Promotion services revenues were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $27.6 million last year.Our promotion services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were negatively affected by the expiration of the promotion agreements with Sanofi when their terms ended on December 31, 2013.On a GAAP basis, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $25.2 million or $0.49 and $0.48 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively, compared with net income of $11 million or $0.20 per share on both a basic and diluted basis for 2013.Our non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $39.7 million or $0.77 and $0.75 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively, compared with non-GAAP net income of $23.2 million or $0.43 and $0.42 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively, for last year.Sales and marketing expenses were $48.5 million compared with $55.2 million last year.Research and development expenses were $14.6 million compared with $8 million last year.R&D included $11 million in upfront costs under our recent in-licensing arrangements primarily with The Medicines Company for 2 cardiovascular products, ANGIOMAX and CLEVIPREX.General and administrative expenses were $22.7 million compared with $32.5 million last year, primarily related to lower legal costs associated with the ongoing government investigations and other legal matters and gains related to the recovery of accounts receivable that have been previously expensed as bad debt.As of December 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $86.3 million compared to $85.9 million as of December 31, 2013.Consistent with past practices, we have presented non-GAAP information as we believe this non-GAAP information is useful for investors taken in conjunction with our GAAP financial statements because we use such information internally for our operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes.Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of our operating results as reported under GAAP.The non-GAAP calculations and reconciliation are provided in the accompanying table in today's press release titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income.Finally, I would like to provide annual guidance for 2015.We project our 2015 revenue to be in the range of $153 million and $158 million and our non-GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis to be in the range of $0.73 and $0.77.Sales and marketing expenses are expected to grow in direct correlation with revenue growth for 2015.General and administrative expenses will only grow modestly as we improve our reporting infrastructure, while research and development expenses are projected to be approximately 2x our 2014 levels.At a more detailed level, in 2015, we have budgeted the following items as part of our growth strategy: an additional $4 million in R&D expenses in support of our new in-licensing arrangements, an additional $1-plus million in business development activities, an additional $1 million in new IT infrastructure investments and an additional $2 million budgeted for legal expenses related to the SEC-DOJ investigations.That is a total of $8 million or $0.16 EPS impact that we could have added to the 2015 guidance for a total of $0.91 midpoint.But we felt it is important to note that these costs, with the exception of the legal expenses, represent important reinvestments into the company for long-term growth.Just a couple questions.One, can you just provide us some background as to why you're providing more of non-GAAP numbers instead of GAAP from an expectation standpoint?What is it from these expenses that you think is one time that you're now more pressing that non-GAAP earnings number?This is Wilson.Hamed, thank you for your question.Let me just say that in the past, we have normally report the GAAP numbers and then provide the non-GAAP EPS numbers as a supplemental information so investors can actually look at our operations and compare on an apples-to-apples basis.This particular year for 2015, we feel that they are certain reinvestments of expenses that we consider as more ones-off, that's why I want to spell that out separately.And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, because these total expenses added up to about $0.16 EPS impact, I don't want investors to feel that we are actually not growing our EPS number.Because if you actually added that $0.16, we would have guided $0.91 EPS for 2015, which would represent a 21% increase on the net profit from 2014 to 2015.I think with the exception of the $2 million that we budgeted for the legal expenses related to the SEC-DOJ investigations, which we don't really have a lot of control but that's the amount that we budgeted, the remaining items we feel is on top of what we call steady-state.That's why I want to spell that out separately.Okay.All right.And the other item was that from ZADAXIN penetrating through the Tier 2 and Tier 3, how much of that market do you think you've gotten through so far as far as the hospitals go?Well, hospital reform in China there is generally the expectation that the market will continue to grow at an overall rate of around 15% and the demand will very much be for well-established products.So ZADAXIN is right in the middle of that, so we think that ZADAXIN will continue to grow just overall drug market and that growth is really in all major areas.It's certainly in Class 3, but also in Class 2 hospitals.But they seem all to be growing, maybe a little stronger in Class 2 than in Class 3 as far as growth is concerned.How much growth opportunity do you think there is left in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities for you?Well, as I said, we think that we should be able, at least in the years until 2020, to continue the growth which we have seen in the last 2, 3 years and which is expected from the overall China drug market.So this is not only one more year of growth and then the growth would come to an end.But this expansion and continued growth of the drug market, and thus also for our major products, is expected for several years to continue.[Operator Instructions] I have no further questions at
