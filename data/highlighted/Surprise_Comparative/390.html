Officer of Conatus, who will discuss recent company highlights and clinical development program; and Chuck Cashion, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Conatus, who will review the company’s financial results.We will then open the call for questions from invited participants.Before we begin the call, I would like to comment on our disclosure last week regarding the resignation of our Chief Medical Officer, Gary Burgess.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A number of you have reached out seeking greater clarity on his reasons and his plans.</span>Unfortunately, Dr. Burgess has chosen not to disclose this information publically and we must respect that decision.What we can point out is that the data monitoring committee will receive all of our clinical trials met last month, confirm that are no safety issues with emricasan and recommended continuation of all ongoing trials.As a reminder, Dr. David Hagerty joined us last October as Executive Vice President of Clinical Development.So, the Clinical group has strong leadership in place.We believe we have sufficient and appropriate staff to ensure the continuity of our development program and we expect no impact on projected timelines.Thank you, Alan.Good afternoon everyone.I’d like to start today with a reminder that our lead compound, emricasan, is a pan-caspase protease inhibitor that addresses key underlying mechanisms of liver damage across a broad spectrum of chronic liver diseases regardless of initial etiology or cause or the degree of progression.Emricasan is an orally available small molecule which is actively transported into the liver with high first pass uptake.But it is not metabolized in the liver making it ideally suited as a potential treatment for liver disease.We've been working through a systematic drug development process to confirm emricasan’s safety and activity in various patient populations in order to position us to pursue the most efficient regulatory approval pathway.Although we have shown drug activity against both mechanism-specific biomarkers and clinical disease biomarkers across the spectrum of liver diseases, we have stated that our focus for emricasan development is in patients with cirrhosis.This is how we got there.Back in 2013, we identified cirrhosis as a potential indication for emricasan clinical development.With that in mind, in 2014, we set out to answer three key questions needed to confirm and refine an appropriate initial drug registration program for patients with cirrhosis.First, we needed to understand how to safely and effectively dose emricasan in patients with cirrhosis, especially those with liver function impairment.Second, we needed to understand whether the optimal dose of emricasan is consistent across different etiologies or underlying causes of liver disease.Third, we needed clarity on endpoints that could support regulatory approval in particular surrogate endpoints that could potentially be used in accelerated regulatory approval pathways.To provide answers to these questions, we conducted a series of clinical trials throughout 2014.To evaluate dosing in cirrhosis patients, who may also have reduced renal function we conducted three organ impairment trials of Phase 2 PK PD trial in acute-on-chronic liver failure or ACLF patients, a Phase 1 trial in patients with severe renal impairment and a Phase 1 trial in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment.Through these three trials, we learned that emricasan was well-tolerated in all tested patient populations, with no dose limiting toxicities or drug-related serious adverse events.We learned that in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment, we can deliver active doses of emricasan within the range cleared by prior pre-clinical toxicology testing.In patients with severe liver function impairment, dosing outside the cleared pre-clinical range may be necessary for drug activity.We believe these results provided us with a clear CorpusPath forward to conduct clinical trials in cirrhosis patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, which represents about 80% of the estimated 1.3 million patients diagnosed with cirrhosis in the United States.We have previously conducted extensive dosing and modeling studies in HCV Hepatitis C virus patients to establish the optimal dose of emricasan measured against both mechanism-specific and standard clinical biomarkers.To evaluate if the drug response to these biomarkers was the same in patients with fat as the cause of their liver diseases, we initiated a trial in March of 2014 in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, or NAFLD including patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH with the same set of biomarkers used in the HCV studies as the endpoints.We expect to report the results from NAFLD/NASH trial within the next few weeks.The results of this trial will provide important information relevant to our selection of patient populations for initial registration studies.Regarding clarity on appropriate endpoints for accelerated regulatory approval pathways, I'd like to address an independent annulment of direct relevance to our efforts.In January of 2015, proceedings of a 2013 NASH endpoints workshop sponsored by AASLD and FDA were accepted for publication in hepatology and posted online.Of particular importance to our programs, the manuscript identified three validated surrogate endpoints for patients with liver cirrhosis that could potentially support accelerated approval.Model for End-stage Liver Disease or MELD score, Child-Pugh-Turcotte or CPT score, and Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient, or HVPG, we are already evaluating emricasan in cirrhosis patients using these same three endpoints in our ongoing portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis Phase 2 trials which were initiated in September of 2014.We're currently preparing to seek additional regulatory guidance on the appropriate use and analysis of these endpoints in potential accelerated approval pathways.In 2014, we obtained the answer to the first key question, regarding safe and effective dosing of emricasan in cirrhosis patients with the results from our three organ impairment trials reported in January.We expect to answer the second key question by the end of this month, regarding whether or not the biomarker response in patients whose etiology of liver disease was NAFLD/NASH is the same as we observed in HCV patients.We gained insights into the third key question regarding appropriate surrogate clinical endpoints potentially useful for accelerator approval pathways in January of 2015, with the posting of the AASLD, FDA manuscript.We intend to seek additional clarity on these endpoints through direct discussions with regulatory authorities within the coming months.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Other activities due in 2014 included the initiation of three additional trials supportive of our longer term emricasan development strategy.</span>In May of 2014, we initiated a trial in post-liver transplant patients with residual fibrosis after successful treatment of their underlying Hepatitis C virus infections.Consistent with our focus to treat patients with more severe forms of liver disease, we expanded the trial during the year to include patients with early-stage cirrhosis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The post-transplant population near the middle of the liver disease spectrum is relatively small, but very well managed and should provide a great opportunity to examine emricasan's longer term safety and impact on liver histology.</span>Emricasan also has U.S. orphan drug designation for post-transplant patients with recurrent fibrosis to delay the progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver diseases.We expect to release initial baseline data from this trial in the second quarter of 2015.In September of 2104, with initial PK PD organ impairment data in hand, we had safety and dosing data that supported clinical trial in cirrhosis patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.We initially addressed that important portion of the liver disease spectrum with the initiation of two liver cirrhosis trials.One in mix etiology patients with confirmed portal hypertension for which results are expected in the third quarter of 2015.The other in mixed etiology patients with MELD scores of 11 to 18 for which topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2015.As a reminder, the AASLD FDA manuscript posted online in January identify the same three endpoints, MELD score, CPT score and HVPG being used in these trials as validated surrogate markers potential appropriated for accelerated approval.In summary, 2014 was a year of systematic drug development activities design to answer the key questions needed to advance emricasan along what we believe to be the most efficient registration pathway that is in patients with cirrhosis in clinical trials using validated surrogate marker and accelerated approval pathways.We expect 2015 to be a year of registration strategic refinement and confirmatory trial results from ongoing trials.Thank you, Steve.After the market close today we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014.I will focus here on full year results.Research and development expenses were $14.9 million in 2014 compared with $6.9 million in 2013.General and administrative expenses were $7.4 million in 2014 compared with $4.7 million for the full year in 2013.The net loss was $22.3 million in 2014 compared with $15.6 million in 2013.The increased expenses and net loss reflected the expansion and advancement of our clinical development activities increased personnel cost driven by staff expansion and the full year of cost related to our obligations as a public company.At December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $37.1 million compared with $56.4 million at December 31, 2013.We are projecting a year-end 2015 balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $15 million excluding cash from any financing activity.We will revisit our forecast quarterly and update as appropriate.We believe our financial resources are sufficient to fund our ongoing and anticipated activities at least through year-end 2015, but we will require additional capital to support future development and registration activity.Thank you, Chuck.I would like to conclude today with some observations regarding what we have learnt from our completed trials to-date and what we need to learn to support our planned advancement of emricasan into registration study.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>On safety, no dose limiting toxicities have been observed and no drug related serious adverse events have been reported with more than 550 subjects treated ranging from healthy volunteers to acutely decompensated cirrhotic in 13 clinical trials.</span>On drug activity, we have confirmed active doses across all stages of liver disease tested.We have confirmed observations in the literature that see cleaved Cytokeratin-18 cCK18 levels are increasingly elevated with liver disease severity.We have also confirmed 30% to 50% sustained reductions in elevated cCK18 level after treatment with sufficient dosing of emricasan regardless of disease severity even in ACLF patients.On drug exposure, we have learnt that systemic drug levels increased with severity of hepatic impairment as well as with dosing.We have learnt then in patients with mild and moderate impairment we can deliver active levels of drug within the range of our preclinical toxicology coverage.We have also learnt that systemic drug levels may exceed our preclinical toxicology coverage in patients with severe hepatic impairment.If we choose to pursue future studies in these severely impaired patients we will need to seek regulatory endpoint.Through our ongoing trials we are continuing to build the safety data base across a broad range of liver disease population.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We are confirming appropriate dosing in patients with fatty liver diseases to allow for more advance studies in NASH patients, while in our etiology-indifferent liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension trials we are measuring efficacy against validated surrogate endpoints linked to meaningful clinical outcomes.</span>Regarding further development, we are actively pursuing the most appropriate pathway for initial registration in terms of etiology and stage of progression and will be seeking regulatory guidance confirming endpoints and potential access to accelerated approval pathways.We expect quarterly readouts from our ongoing clinical trials to the remainder of 2015 and we have sufficient capital to continue all planned activities at least through year-end 2015.That concludes our prepared comments.Now I would like to turn the call over to our operator to moderate the question-and-answer session.Thanks for taking the questions.First question just has to do with the initial comments around departure of Gary Burgess and I am not if a lot of people are familiar with David Hagerty.But can you maybe just provide some commentary about David Hagerty's background and qualifications and also some commentary around the transition between Gary and David on the clinical trials that were ongoing, was it a smooth transition between the two.So just initially some comments there.Sure, John.Happy to answer.As Alan mentioned Gary has chosen not to disclose his reasons for leaving the company.And that's why we mentioned and talked about the recent data monitoring committee's conclusions that there were no safety issues associated with the clinical trials and the recommendation to move forward.So we believe that's not the reason, okay.Second with respect to David Hagerty, I think the most accurate thing I can say about David, certainly he is an M.D., is that he is an experienced drug developer.He has worked in both big pharma, biotech -- big biotech and small biotech, has driven the development of compounds through market approval.And we basically expect him to do the same here at Conatus.He was brought on board as Executive VP.Gary was reporting to him.And in that context, he remains the leader and in the leadership position here at Conatus.And as we -- as Alan mentioned we see no impact at all in our -- in the execution of our clinical trials.And the transition of Gary leaving the company is going quite smoothly.Thanks for that.And then just on the NASH/NAFLD data readout, I think you mentioned it was the next couple of weeks, can you maybe provide some additional transparency on the timing for additional readouts on the other clinicals?And then just some commentary around your plans for meeting with the FDA.Sure.So with respect to all the clinical trials, we are currently on track to meet guidance so NAFLD first quarter that's a couple of weeks to go.Base line data in the POLT study second quarter.We actually refine the liver cirrhosis study we have talked about that second half, we now believe that will be fourth quarter.And as we had guided before the portal hypertension study will readout in the third quarter.Just timing for meeting with FDA.And then have you made any -- or can you provide any thoughts around when you might consider applying for an accelerated review or drug designation?Well, I think as we have said the last piece to the puzzle for discussion with regulatory authorities and I don’t want just restrict that to FDA, because our plan is international registration studies.But in -- so let's talk about in the context of regulatory authority.That information will be available by the end of this month, that's the end of the first quarter.With that information in hand, we intend to pursue regulatory endpoint rapidly.I cannot give you the exact timeline associated with that, but certainly as we mentioned in the call today, within the next several months.Okay.And then just on cash position by year-end 2015, Chuck I think you mentioned about $15 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities you have available, you know, based on the Phase 3 clinical plan that you have in mind.What kind of capital requirements you think you will need for that.I think those trials, John, are being formulated in - we will know the clarity after we meet with the regulators just what their expectations will be.So it’s difficult to tell you today the cost associated with those registration trials, but I can tell you that we will need to raise additional capital in order to support those.Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Bayko of JMP Securities.Your line is now open.Hi.Thanks for taking the question.We are all looking forward to seeing your data in the NASH population.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Could you maybe tell us more specifically what kind of patients are you enrolling?</span>And in terms of the biomarkers what magnitude of change kind of gets you excited and things that you may have ultimately clinical impact in NASH?Sure.The way we define the inclusion criteria in the NAFLD/NASH population in this trial is they have to have persistently elevated transaminases or ALT that should favor patients with later stage fatty liver disease, the NASH population.But we are not requiring that patients have biopsy proven NASH.So the big requirement is persistently elevated ALTs.The biomarkers that we are looking at are the same set of biomarkers that we use to identify 25 milligrams BID dosing as essentially an etiology-indifferent dosing for active drug treatment.And as you know that's the drug dose that we are using not only in NAFLD study right now as a test case, but in all of the other clinical trials that we are doing that I mentioned earlier.The biomarkers are two mechanism specific biomarkers, Caspase 3/7 -- activated Caspase and also cCK18 versus the traditional clinical disease transaminases ALT and AST.We've built the model using extensive data in the HCV program to understand what magnitude of reduction is significant.And to answer your second part of the question, really in those biomarkers what we've seen routinely and what we think is significant is a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in baseline levels no matter whether they are very high or very low.Okay.That’s helpful.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then I mean, ultimately as you develop this drug I know you are thinking, kind of, this is a good drug for patients with cirrhosis, so will you be looking at more advanced NASH patients or how should we think about kind of next steps after that assuming that you’ll see the changes you want to see?</span>Sure.I think the decision we need to -- first off, we believe this drug is etiology indifferent and we are testing that in the two cirrhosis trials that we are doing right now.So we’ll have some information on that against those validated surrogate biomarkers in a mixed etiology patient population in the timeframes I have talked about.From a registration perspective there are other issues that need to be considered which is homogeneity of the population, diversity of the population, compliance in the population that I think need to be addressed upfront in discussions with the regulators.Let me make it clear that ultimately what we would be going forward is a label for all cirrhosis.But from a practical perspective it may make sense to do your -- at least the majority of your registration studies in a defined patient of one etiology.That patient population could be NASH patients.That’s going to be dependent upon the outcome of the NAFLD/NASH studies and discussions with the regulators.But that gives you some context that how we are thinking of pursuing NASH in the future.Thank you [Operator Instructions].Our next question comes from the line of Charles Duncan of Piper Jaffray.Your line is now open.Hey guys thanks for taking the question.It’s Roy in for Charles.Just a quick -- kind of just to my own curiosity.I guess what about -- you mentioned three endpoints -- mentioned in the FDA paper.What about cCK18 as an approvable endpoint, any potential there?Thanks As a component of all of our studies, we are monitoring cCK18 levels really for two reasons to identify and confirm in the patient populations we are looking at that the mechanism is engaged, so it’s elevated.And two, accumulating evidence that we -- consistent with that we've seen in the past rapid and sustained reductions in cCK18.Many other developers in the liver disease field are also looking at cCK18 as a biomarker of liver disease, status and damage.In their case they are looking at it in the context of a more generic marker.In our case it’s absolutely mechanism specific, which is a plus.And there is good data and the literature supporting what we've also observed that clearly cCK18 unlike, for example, the more generic transaminases does continue to increase with severity of liver disease, in particular in patients with cirrhosis.In our own studies in the organ impairment trials, the cirrhosis patients had normal or near normal transaminases, but had significantly elevated cCK18 levels.With respect to validation as an endpoint, I will point to what we said in the AASLD/FDA manuscript that it was objective and measurable, not something today that I think we would be seeking as a surrogate marker for approval.But certainly a marker that over time could evolve into something like that especially as we link that marker with progress in the clinical trials.The reference that was used in the -- or the references that were used in the AASLD/FDA manuscript pointing to the fact that cCK18 levels did correlate well with improvement in fibrosis in NASH patient population, so we think the biomarker is an off to a good start and the data that we are accumulating in our trial is only going to make it better.Just with respect to the baseline POLT data that we’re going to be getting in 2Q 2015, can you just give us a little bit of color around what baseline data we’re going to be getting and what you think some of that baseline data might infer about what we could be seeing out of that study.Well, one thing I want you to know is that.We have the option in the study of looking at the data earlier, because it’s potentially sponsor open.So one of the things we are looking at is whether we will execute that option or not.So the thing that we are confident we can report in the second quarter is baseline data.The kind of baseline data we would be expected to speaking about or what kinds of patients we are seeing, what level of fibrosis are we seeing in their baseline biopsies, proportion of patients with cirrhosis and potentially some baseline biomarker data to see how the mechanism or how the levels of say the mechanism biomarkers -- how engaged they are in these patients.Okay.And then what respect to the NAFLD study can you say at this point what percentage of those patients within that subset may have NASH?As I mentioned we did not require biopsy -- diagnosis of biopsy proven NASH, but if you look in the literature the transaminase increases are much more variable and not sustained in the NAFLD population.So away without asking patients to when they will biopsy to enrich for the later stage patients, the NASH patients, is to require persistent elevation in ALT, so ALT elevations have to be demonstrated twice over a one week interval.We think that effectively will enhance the proportion of patients with NASH, but we won't have a direct measure of that based on biopsy proven NASH.Okay.And then just to follow-up, it sounds like then you will be pursuing regulatory input in some of these potential accelerated approval endpoints with FDA over the course of the next few months and that's presumably before we get any of the data out of the cirrhotic patient population.So I'm just wondering if you will be communicating any of that feedback from FDA in conjunction those data readouts.I think as the clarity and the discussions continue, when appropriate we’ll be speaking candidly about what that pathway is.I think it’s important to do that.And we have a pretty good idea of where are going.And the good news is that everything that we did in 2014 basically tells us full speed ahead, as I mentioned in the call, in at least 80% of the patients currently diagnosed with cirrhosis right now.So it’s a huge patient population.That’s a mild to moderates in there.No roadblocks to development there.Our key now is to make sure that we decide to make an informed decision on which population to specifically do the majority of registration studies, an etiology specific or indifferent, like the studies we are doing right now.And to make sure that we get some clarity on how to analyze those validated surrogate endpoints.And the manuscript -- the AASLD/FDA manuscript identified the endpoints, but they didn’t go into the kind of detail that you get with personal interactions with the FDA and say the European regulators on specifically how to analyze those endpoints.Is it mean, changes, is it even based.Those are the kinds of discussions that I think will point and help us not only clarify exactly how to do those trials, but help us from a powering perspective and duration of dosing in those trials to come up with a robust registration strategy.We want to do this once and we’re doing our homework.Okay.And then just quick follow-up to that, I guess, some of the historical data suggest regarding the rates of progression in cirrhotic patients relative to baseline etiology.And is there really enough data to suggest that post the onset of cirrhosis and the development of some MELD score presumably that your rate of progression at that point is entitled to whatever was the insult to begin with.Very good question.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>There is actually more data on earlier stage disease than in patients with cirrhosis.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So what's reported in literature right now is in general progression of earlier stages of liver disease pre-fibrotic and fibrotic appears to be slower in patients whose etiology is NASH and for example HCV or HPV where our large database is.</span>Less information in the cirrhotic patient population and that's one of the things that we are going to be doing and that's why we are looking at mixed etiology patient populations in our trials right now.We do believe though based on the information we have and the literature.That as the disease severity increases that the severity of the disease trumps etiology.If that indeed is the case it wouldn’t matter what etiology you used, if you used the single etiology in your cirrhosis studies.But that’s the component of the discussions with the regulators.Because as I said, we want to develop a registration strategy that allows us access to all cirrhosis patients on the label, not just a subset population of a single etiology.Well, I think all for your participation in today's call and for your continued support of Conatus.We look forward to seeing some or all of you at one of the upcoming events between now and our next call in early May.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.Thank you once again for your participation.You may now disconnect.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright
