a good chunk comes due next year and in 2018.It is indisputable that Warren Buffett is one of the best investors of all time, but one of his portfolio positions may not be the best investment.The position I am talking about is USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ).USG is a manufacturer and distributor of building materials.It is the nation's largest distributor of dry wall and related building products.The company makes sheet rock panels, underlayment, joint compound, ceiling tile, and other building materials necessary for home building.Mr. Buffett's investment in USG has been far from easy.On November 27th, 2000, Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A , BRK.B ) filed a 13-G disclosing it had purchased 6.5 million shares of USG, or 14.98% of the shares outstanding at that point in time.Unfortunately for Mr. Buffett and other shareholders, in 2002, USG sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from a potentially large asbestos litigation.Asbestos was used as a fire-prevention material in some of USG's wallboards, which was found to cause certain types of cancers.A precursor to the eventual filing was a large drop in the price of USG's stock.To be fair, there were a lot of companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to asbestos litigation as well, so USG was not the only one.In 2006, USG emerged from bankruptcy with Mr. Buffett's help.They had set up an agreement to create a trust to settle the asbestos claims with $3.95 billion.To fund this trust, USG used some cash from its operations and sold additional equity.Mr. Buffett agreed to backstop and buy any shares that were not purchased through the offering, which eventually increased Berkshire Hathaway's holdings to 6,969,274 shares.When USG emerged from bankruptcy, all creditors were paid in full and all equityholders retained ownership throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings.Since Mr. Buffett did not sell any shares during this period, this meant that he did not realize any losses even though the share price was depressed.He did see some mark-to-market losses on his holdings, though.Before the housing bubble, USG's shares were sky-rocketing.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Unfortunately, Berkshire Hathaway decided to buy even more shares of the company at pre-crisis inflated prices, bringing its total ownership to 17,072,192 by October 4, 2006.</span>This was right before the crash.During the housing bubble, the demand for USG's products were so strong, the company issued a mix of short- and long-term debt in anticipation that this would continue.Shortly after the crisis, the company needed to roll over some of its short-term liabilities.USG needed to raise $400 million, so the company called its favorite investor.Mr. Buffett stepped in to buy $300 million of convertible senior notes that matured in 2018 from USG.The additional $100 million was placed to another investor, Fairfax Financial Holdings ( OTCQB:FRFHF ).The convertible notes offered a conversion price at $11.40 per share, and were callable by the company on and after December 1, 2013.As this date arrived, the company decided to redeem the convertible notes, in which Berkshire elected to convert its holding into shares of common stock.This increased Mr. Buffett's total holdings to 43,387,982 shares, giving Berkshire Hathaway ownership of 30.5% of the company at that time.There was a misstep during the conversion into stock, where Berkshire Hathaway did not abide by the proper filing notice, violating the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, and had to pay a fine of $896,000 to settle the civil penalty.In simple terms, once a company wants to go over a certain threshold of ownership - in this case it was 15% - the acquiring company must file a pre-merger notification notice with the government.Once it is filed, the waiting period begins - which is usually 30 days - after which the acquisition may proceed.When converting the notes into equity and going over the threshold, Berkshire Hathaway forgot to file the proper forms, which led to this violation.It's unfortunate, but this investment has plagued Warren Buffett with continuous miscues and paper losses in the past.I am sure with the stock price currently where it is and the average cost of Berkshire Hathaway's shares plus any interest the company received from the debt it held, this investment is surely profitable now.But unlike most of Mr. Buffett's other investments, this has not been a great one.Especially if you consider from October 6, 2000, when Mr. Buffett initially started purchasing, all the way to March 6, 2015, USG is up 12.27% versus the S&P 500 Index, and Berkshire Hathaway shares are up 41.29% [BRK.A] and 281.31% [BRK.B] respectively.Not to mention, he added to his holdings during the highs of the stock.But let's also be clear in the fact that this investment represents a small portion of Berkshire's portfolio, and Mr. Buffett could spare the money necessary to help USG's liquidity with neither thorough analysis nor debate.Some may also speculate that Mr. Buffett initially bought his stake as a hedge to his insurance business.If there was ever a disaster that the insurance business would need to pay out huge sums of money for, surely there would be a need for rebuilding.The disaster would hurt Berkshire Hathaway's Insurance business, but should benefit USG.So what's the deal now?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>USG must be in much better shape than it was previously, and if the shares happen to drop, certainly Mr. Buffett can buy the entire company so other investors' downsides should be limited.</span>Well, let's answer the second question first.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Mr. Buffett cannot buy the company, even though he has more than ample capital to do so.</span>He could, but that would void the company's Net Operation Losses (NOLs) asset, which, at the end of last year, was a total of $944 million.NOLs are losses that a company gets credit for when it arises from bankruptcy.Companies can carry forward these losses for up to 20 years to offset any gains, meaning they will not get taxed on any profit if it is offset by any NOLs.They can also carry back these losses 2 years prior to bankruptcy to get a tax refund.One of the stipulations of keeping this asset is that there cannot be a 50% ownership transfer within a certain amount of time.So Mr. Buffett could not purchase the entire company without negating the NOLs, which is currently substantial for USG.But Mr. Buffett could provide the company with another loan.This might not be so great for the equityholders.It would increase the debt of the company, and have interest that USG must pay, which would decrease net income.Or, if the company issued another convertible bond, there would still be interest, but it would also have the potential to dilute the equityholders if it is ultimately converted into shares.It would increase the shares outstanding and dilute the earnings per share.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In regards to providing more capital to the company, these are Mr. Buffett's options.</span>Both are not equity shareholder-friendly.Now let's answer question number 1.How is the company doing now?At the end of last year, the company had $228 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which was a decrease of 72% from 2013.USG has $2.205 billion of long-term debt, which is a decrease of 4% from 2013.Net Sales were $3.724 billion, up 4% from 2013, but net income was $37 million, down 27% from 2013.The net income decrease was attributed to slight increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and also some one-off charges in relation to litigation settlement, long-lived asset impairment charges, and contract termination charges.A large part of the one-off charges was due to the long-lived asset impairment.USG owns two freight ships which it no longer needs, and wrote down the value of these assets by $60 million.The company owes around $20 million on the ships, which would be around their selling price, as stated by the CEO.In 2014, USG's sales breakdown was 83% in the US, 10% in Canada, and 7% in other foreign countries.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe this is okay, since foreign country sales make up a small portion of USG's entire sales, which shouldn't hurt net income with the stronger US dollar versus weaker foreign currencies.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What the stronger US dollar may hurt is the 50/50 joint venture that USG entered into with Boral Ltd. ( OTC:BOALF ).</span>This joint venture sells certain building products, natural and synthetic gypsum, and mines raw gypsum throughout Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East.This joint venture may not be that profitable with the current strong US dollar versus any revenues made in these countries, but it makes up a small portion of USG's current overall sales.USG stated its diluted earnings per share for 2014 was $0.26.This would imply the last twelve months' price to earnings ratio of 108x, using a $28.14 stock price.As we look toward this year, analysts have lowered earnings estimates and believe the company will earn $1.86 per share in 2015.Using the same price of $28.14 per share, this implies a 15x forward price-to-earnings ratio, which doesn't sound too inflated.But if you take into account that the company has continuously missed earnings estimates in the past, as seen by the last 4 quarters, it might be expected that this trend will continue and earnings estimates will come down further.What is most concerning for the company is its debt.USG has $2.205 billion in long-term debt.Out of that, $590 million comes due in 2016 and $724 million in 2018.My thought is this debt may be difficult to roll over, and may cost the company more to do so as the Fed starts raising rates.Also, compared to its competitors, USG has the highest debt-to-equity ratio at 5.41.This ratio compares debt to shareholder equity, not to be confused with market capitalization.To be fair, USG's CEO stated on the earnings call that the company is focused on deleveraging the balance sheet, but shareholders will have to wait and see how this can be achieved.USG is a cyclical company.Nobody can deny that the company is intertwined with the economy and with housing.We will not focus on overseas economic data, as USG's main business applies to the US.The last data point on US housing starts showed a decrease of 2% in January from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.065 million.And with the cold and wintry weather, it's safe to assume that housing starts for February may miss the mark as well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Also, US GDP was revised lower for the fourth quarter last year to an annual rate of 2.2%, which was much weaker than the 2.6% first estimated.</span>Perhaps housing and GDP estimates may be too optimistic, which will affect the company's business.What's also concerning about the company is its margins.Gross margins were 18%, up 2% from 2013.Operating margins were 4%, down 3% from 2013.And profit margins were 1%, flat from 2013.With margins razor-thin, this leaves little room for error.In all, the company may be a good short.USG has consistently missed earnings.It has high debt loads, some of which comes due soon.It is a cyclical business that hasn't had recent encouraging economic data to support the business.And it has low margins on its products.The company may have the best investor backing, but does not have the best financial state.I hate to say this because of my admiration for Mr. Buffett, but USG could be a compelling short.Source: Is One Of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Holdings A Compelling Short?Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
