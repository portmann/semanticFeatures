class='textDiv'>Kornit Digital Plans For Ambitious IPO - Kornit Digital (Pending:KRNT) | Seeking Alpha Kornit Digital is an Israeli company that creates digital printing for the global textile market.Although Kornit was founded 13 years ago, it was acquired by Fortissimo Capital in 2011 for just $16 million after an Israeli IPO failed in 2010.Kornit Digital (Pending: KRNT ), an Israeli company that manufactures and sells digital printers and ink for the textile industry, filed with the SEC to raise a maximum of $115 million through a US IPO.In 2014, Kornit generated revenues of $66.4 million.This was an increase of 34.4 percent over 2013 and the company reported net income of $3 million.It employs 251 people in Israel, the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.The company develops, designs and markets digital printing solutions for the global printed textile industry.Kornit's business includes its proprietary digital printing systems, ink and other consumables, associated software and value added services.Kornit pioneers what it calls "Green" fabric printing, which is essentially a shift from analog processes to digital methods.However, the fact that much of its processes are patented and protected means the company is uniquely placed to capitalize on a lucrative market.The textile industry is undergoing a revolution with new inks and digital printing methods enabling printing with one ink set on all types of fabric and with no additional finishing process.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This has brought fabric printing to a much wider consumer base, allowing fashion designers and retailers to produce custom-printed garments at low cost and high volume.</span>Kornit promises that its inks are entirely organic, 100% non-toxic, vegan friendly and are safe for infants and young children.The company was founded 13 years ago and is based in Rosh Ha'ayin, Israel, but has sales, marketing and support offices in the United States, Germany and Hong Kong.Kornit has kept a low profile since it was founded.It has not raised money from venture capital funds and has approximately 100 customers, primarily in the United States.One of its largest customers is CafePress, known for its customized T-shirts and cigars.The one blemish on Kornit's reputation for success occurred during 2010 as it attempted to file for an IPO in Israel.The attempt failed and the company was acquired by Fortissimo Capital for $16 million the following year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Prospects for the impending IPO seem brighter.</span>Less than a year ago, Kornit hired Gabi Seligsohn as CEO of the company.He came from Nova Measuring Instruments and led the company through a significant period of growth.Ofer Ben-Zur, Kornit's founder, remained as president and CTO of the company."Over the last several years, Kornit has been revolutionizing the textile printing industry by leading the transformation from silk screen printing to digital" said Yuval Cohen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Kornit, per PR Newswire ."As founder and CEO of Kornit, Ofer did a fantastic job, taking his initial idea from concept to what has become a global company, with multiple products, leading edge technology and a strong and innovative team."The move to bring Seligsohn onboard may be the motivating factor in the IPO.Kornit is expanding and will need money to continue pushing into new markets.Seligsohn has proven himself capable of leading a multinational company through an expansion period.While at Nova Measuring Instruments, where he served as the President and CEO, Seligsohn defined and implemented a strategy which transformed Nova from a single product OEM company to a multi-product leading-edge solution provider.Shareholders will be hoping this IPO injects a similar transformation at Kornit.Although the number of shares and share price has not been set, Kornit is a thriving company that is expanding aggressively into both the Eurasian market and trying to expand its influence in the Asia Pacific area .With a solid base for its business, going public is a good move.The company will be able to raise money for expansion.However, investors should also be warned that Kornit isn't alone in the direct-to-garment printing market.Both M&R's i-Dot and DTG Digital's Viper printers have a substantial following among boutique t-shirt manufacturers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What's more, the industry also is attracting more established names in printing, such as Epson and Brother, which have both launched their own garment printers in recent years .</span>This should give investors some pause.As a young business, it's still uncertain where this sector will go in the coming years and how Kornit will deal with competitors.But at least for the short to medium term the company has a distinct advantage in the field and continues to innovate with new products and inks .For investors, Kornit is a solid multinational company with ties in the U.S., Europe and the Asia Pacific.The proprietary equipment and process makes the company's product in demand.There's little chance of a repeat of the Israeli IPO failure this time around.Source: Kornit Digital Plans For Ambitious IPO Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate
