(NYSE: GCI ) and McClatchy Co (NYSE: MNI ) are some of the only large companies that have some form of operations in this current arena.A review of MaxPoint IPO filing reveals that the competitive advantage is clearly creating value for customers.On a year-over-year basis, revenue from MaxPoint's 25 largest customer's doubled.This same-customer growth was compounded by a steady increase in the overall number of customers.In 2013, MaxPoint averaged 84 campaigns per customer, compared to just 37 per customer in 2012.The growth in existing customers demand clearly speaks to the ability of MaxPoint to create value for businesses.MaxPoint's growth was recognized by Deloitte as number 40 in the Fast Growing 500 .IPOs come with a large amount of risk from imperfect information to misaligned objectives between buyer and seller.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That is why IPO investors need to think more like early-stage investors.</span>Key to early-stage investment strategy - exit strategy.Investors should always be thinking about how and when they leave the stock and what are the likely future outcomes and developments.For MaxPoint, it is an attractive IPO because it offers a potentially great exit opportunity - acquisition.Think about like a large-corporation - theirs value in acquiring a high-growth, strong margin company that currently carries little debt.Take a company like Gannett for example, it is a slow-growth media and marketing conglomerate that has been recently reorganizing and changing focus towards emerging technologies.A company like Gannett could easily acquire MaxPoint and quickly reap benefits from a variety of synergies, plus the additional sales force to propel continued growth.MaxPoint's market valuation post-IPO should come in around $260-$300 million, this would be a small drop in the bucket for the current $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents on hand at Gannett.MaxPoint offers a great opportunity to IPO investors.They sell a great product with fast-growing demand.On top of that, not only have they proven the ability to grow their customer base quickly, but also they have shown drastic increases in same-customer sales.MaxPoint offers a technology that could quickly consolidate a highly fragmented fast growing market.Investors should be very excited for the long-term outlook.On top of this, large media and marketing companies looking to enter segments like MaxPoint's.For these companies, there is a compelling argument to enter a segment by acquiring an already successful company.Source: MaxPoint Interactive An IPO For An Attractive Acquisition Target Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Additional disclosure: The author is long the following ETFs, which may have exposure to one or more of the stocks mentioned in this article: SPXL, TNA, DVY, and EEM We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
