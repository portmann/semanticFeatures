former risk executive of Deutsche Bank AG repeatedly warned senior managers of the German bank�s U.S. unit that they were painting a far too rosy picture of the bank�s health.The warnings weren�t about this year�s stress test.They were written by William Broeksmit in December 2013 and January 2014 as the bank was preparing its Fed-mandated, internally run stress test.At the time, Broeksmit was serving as a director of the U.S. unit.The bank needed to �stress harder,� Broeksmit wrote in one email to senior managers.The bank�s forecasts were �way too optimistic,� he wrote in another.In others, he said that forecast losses were �way too small compared to history,� and that the full board had to be briefed on the discrepancies, which were �way too important� to be glossed over.Deutsche Bank�s senior U.S. managers rebuffed Broeksmit�s warnings, according to the emails, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters.Wedding Costs of $31,213 Show U.S. Consumers Reengaging

Codreanau-Windauer of the Bavarian State Bavarian Bureau for the Conservation of Historic Monuments said the pretzel was found alongside other baked goods including rolls and a croissant dough during an archaeological dig last summer in Regensburg.It is an archaeological sensation,� Codreanau-Windauer told NBC News.In my 30 years in the business I have never found an organic object.She said carbon

the baking process,� Codreanau-Windauer said.Utah Passes White-Collar Felon Registry (Dealbook) With just a point and a click, you can browse a face book of felons, a new government website that will

build the nation’s first white-collar offender registry, appending a scarlet letter of sorts on the state’s financial felons.The registry — quirky even by the standards of a legislature that this week

with family members every year.But after developing a knack for algorithms at Stanford University, he stumbled upon �the nerd way� to compete.I�m the type of person who loves playing cards but would
