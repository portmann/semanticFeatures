Eonia has dropped to around its most negative fixes from the middle of January when the Swiss National Bank was last "forced" to act.Even the Danish krone has been trading back toward illiquidity levels despite repeated assurances from the Danmarks Nationalbank that it would unleash monetary hell to save its version of the euro peg.That would seem to suggest not just Swiss problems, not just euro problems, but multi-system liquidity heading backward toward January levels again.But it wasn't just Europe that has seen "dollar" problems reignite, as Brazil's currency plunged well below 3.00 in a debasement pace that has, again, quickened dramatically in the last week.With the mostly tight relationship with gold, as a proxy for "dollar" collateral liquidity, it is not surprising that gold has fallen again in parallel fashion to the real.Apart from the divergence in December and the first half of January (owing to safety bids, I believe, on the Swiss end of all this), gold and Brazil's currency have been mirroring each other in at least rough correlations.While these are disparate indications spread across all sorts of markets and geographies, the one commonality between them is the "dollar."<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If we are to attempt any kind of more realtime indication of what eurodollar function looks like, it probably doesn't get much more clear than this as all these market rates and prices are suggesting the same thing at the same time - look out for another "dollar" episode potentially just getting underway.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It may or may not be coincidence that US stocks are falling quickly also in the past week, which, if more like the October 15 even than January 15, might suggest another larger and more direct (from the US perspective) brand of dysfunction.</span>Though the UST 10-year sold off last Friday (illiquidity played a role there ), the bond is already back down to 2.13%, a 12 bps drop in just the past two days.In other words, all the players are once more in place.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
