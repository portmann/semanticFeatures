MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) | Seeking Alpha The underdeveloped Indian economy is set to grow sharply, with a rising number entering the middle class in the coming years.MakeMyTrip continues to show sharp growth despite being in the red.MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ: MMYT ) is among the largest OTA (online travel agency) players in Asia today.It is the parent company of MakeMyTrip - India, USA and UAE, Luxury Tours -Singapore, Malaysia and other ventures in Thailand and Netherlands.The company owns some of the leading travel websites like makemytrip.com, hoteltravel.com and easytobook.com.The company earns revenues from hotel booking, holiday packages and its ticketing business.MakeMyTrip has an alliance with all the major airlines in India, Indian railways, main bus operators, ~20,000 hotels and guest houses in India and ~190,000 hotels abroad.The company recently announced results for Q3 2015 that missed analyst estimates on both revenues and EPS.However, MakeMyTrip is all set to capitalize on the rise of consumerism and smartphone penetration in India.E-commerce in India is rising at an incredible pace due to growing smartphone usage.Many Internet companies such as Flipkart, Ola Cabs, Snapdeal etc. are sporting billion dollar plus valuations due to the massive growth opportunity in the Indian market.1) Secular growth of the underdeveloped Indian economy - The Indian economy is going to be the fastest growing economy among major economies in the coming years.Inflation has declined and interest rates are on a downward trajectory.The country is seeing its image improve globally under its PM Narendra Modi at the Centre.Middle class in India will not only grow in absolute numbers, but will also see an increase it its disposable income.The new Budget has increased the number of countries which are allowed visa-on-arrival for their citizens visiting India.This will give a boost to the tourism in India.All these factors work in favour of the OTAs operating in India.2) New Airlines to boost business - The airline business in India is also seeing a revival with the sharp decline in crude oil prices and an increase in the growth of passengers.Low cost carrier Spicejet was spared the bankruptcy fate of Kingfisher airlines, with a rescue by its original founder.New airline Vistara was launched in January 2015 after the launch of domestic services of Air Asia in 2014.New launches are a good sign for the company as they open new revenue streams for its air ticket business.3) Increase in Organic traffic due to Smartphones - India already ranks third globally in terms of internet users, thanks to the growth of smartphones.Over 40% of the monthly unique visitors to MakeMyTrip come from the mobile apps.The total accumulated downloads of mobile apps increased from 4.1 million in Q215 to 5.5 million in Q315.Also 20% of total online transactions are now booked through mobile phones.The company is enriching the whole experience too by providing additional services like easy pay, cancellations, check booking, check-in and even seat selection.MakeMyTrip became the first OTA to introduce vernacular support to its mobile users.3) Launch of Travel Innovation Fund - MakeMyTrip introduced an innovation fund in September 2014, to invest in travel start-ups.The amount of investment will be up to $15 million.Later in December 2014, the company acquired a 25% stake in Simplotel Technologies Private Limited, which helps in hotel bookings through its websites."The fund will focus on start-ups in travel technology, with a special focus on mobile and IP-based companies," MakeMyTrip said in a statement.4) Hotel & Packages segment shows sharp growth - The number of transactions in this segment increased by 47% in Q3 2015, when compared to Q3 2014 increasing revenues by 43.5%.The company has also been successful in increasing the number of properties to 20,000 from 15,500 reported in the last quarter.The company was successful in increasing its share in the aviation industry from 13% in the last quarter to 15% in Q3.The number of transactions in this segment increased by 47% in Q3 2015, increasing revenues by 10.2% when compared to Q3 2014.5) Potential Acquisition Target - MakeMyTrip could be an attractive buyout candidate in the online travel industry.The company has a market capitalisation value of $971 million and can be easily bought by the other two giants in the industry - Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ) and Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ).Both the companies have been on an acquisition spree since the last two and a half years.The latest ones being OpenTable and Orbitz Worldwide being acquired by Priceline and Expedia respectively.Priceline has cash and investments worth $8 billion as at the year end.a) Rising Competition - Competition has always been high in the online travel industry in India.Yatra, and Cleartrip are the large domestic competitors for MMYT.Priceline and Expedia which are the world's largest OTAs are also trying to penetrate the Indian market now.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) has recently launched flight search option on its webpage in India.This could be big issue for the Indian OTAs since a large amount of traffic to these OTAs come from Google.b) Foreign Exchange Fluctuation - Any fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates, will affect the international travel.For example, if the Indian rupee depreciates sharply against USD, Indian overseas travel might be reduced sharply.It happened in 2013, when the Indian rupee had depreciated sharply against the US dollar.The stock is currently trading at $21.52 near to the mid-point of its 52 week price.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company has a market capitalization value of $897.3 million with a P/B of 5.7x, which is lower than PCLN's 7.4x and EXPE's 6.4x.</span>The graph below shows that the prices have remained quite volatile in the last five years.However it has consolidated in the $19-36 price range in the last year.MakeMyTrip is a top player in the online travel industry in India.The Indian economy is showing signs of strong resurgence with both airline and hotel growth projected to be strong in the coming years.Competition from both domestic and international players is an area of concern.However with the sentiment around India improving and the company taking customer focused steps, I think it is set on the right CorpusPath.MMYT is also focusing on expanding its hotel inventory and increasing the revenues from this segment.The company has a presence across the hospitality industry and has a strong brand name in the Indian travel market.The stock has corrected sharply from the highs and I would look to add the stock on dips.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Indian e-commerce industry is set to keep growing in high double digits for the medium term, as more and more citizens of the 1.2 billion population in India get connected to the Internet.</span>Source: MakeMyTrip: A Good Way To Capitalize On Rising Consumerism And Mobile Penetration In India Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
