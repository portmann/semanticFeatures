Melco Crown Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:MPEL) | Seeking Alpha China’s continuing crackdown against gambling/casinos will not last forever.Seasoned Chinese gamblers will find ways to gamble abroad or online.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I opine that Melco’s new Manila casino can help it recover faster than Las Vegas Sands.</span>Melco, unlike Las Vegas Sands, has a friendly relationship with PokerStars – the world’s biggest online poker operator.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The online casino industry can grow big enough to deliver higher revenue numbers than what land-based casinos make in Macau.</span>I live in the Philippines and I am a former grinder on PokerStars .Gambling is a plague that can never be cured by government-initiated actions.People will always find a way to satisfy their gambling addiction.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Yes, China's more expanded crackdown on Macau's casinos will continue to hurt gambling-related firms.</span>However, I firmly believe that unless the Communist leaders of China threaten to jail its casino-loving citizens, millions of Chinese gamblers will not stop from travelling to and gambling in foreign countries.Investors should also understand tha the government's harsh anti-gambling program is only against its mainland citizens inside the domestic territories of China.The excuse is that China is implementing the said anti-casino measures to aid in its anti-graft campaign.However, newly-rich Chinese capitalists and politicians could still go abroad to gamble.The affluent Chinese population are the world's top exporters of domestic money.China's government is already unable to slow down the illegal export of its citizens' money.It also cannot stop Chinese gamblers from going abroad.Many Chinese, gamblers or non-gamblers, already have fat bank accounts ($1.4 trillion estimated total) in foreign countries which they can easily withdraw.The money that is not being spent on Macau casinos are likely still being spent in casinos of foreign countries.The pessimistic outlook of the stock market over Macau-related casino operators is therefore temporary.Bargain hunters who are patient enough will find beaten down casino stocks as cheap bets with potential to return big rewards.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The $131.35 billion casino/gambling industry is bigger than Macau .</span>There are other more tolerant, non-Communist countries that can host casinos to gradually replace Macau's $44.1 billion annual contribution.Furthermore, once Macau's economy suffers huge losses from flight of casino operators and gamblers alike, Chinese politicians will likely find it prudent to loosen its newly-imposed tight policies over gambling.Other countries are salivating over the possibility of replacing Macau as the world's top gambling destination.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am highly confident that Melco Crown's (NASDAQ: MPEL ) recent expansion in the Philippines would help it recover faster than its American peers like Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS ).</span>Chinese gamblers will still use the visit-to-Boracay as an excuse to fly to the Philippines.Junket operators can still bring Chinese high-rollers to other countries without any problem .Melco made the right decision to open the $1 billion City of Dreams Manila casino resort complex.The Philippines is just 1.5 hour flight away from Macau/Hong Kong.The City of Dreams is a Vegas-style luxury hotel casino complex which is comparable to Las Vegas Sands' The Venetian in Macau.Chinese gamblers will find Melco's Manila casino as lavish as the ones found in Macau.The City of Dreams is actually the second international casino complex that got built before China started its campaign against gambling.The $1.2 billion Solaire Casino was opened in 2013.Former President of Las Vegas Sands, Bill Weidner and his team were the initial management team of Solaire.The Philippines long-running tolerance for legal and illegal gambling makes it a perfect haven for Chinese/Asian gamblers.Unlike in China, Melco found (and will always find) very cooperative political leaders to protect its casino interests in the Philippines.The Philippines' love affair with gambling even brought down the former President Joseph Estrada.Estrada's removal from office stemmed from the expose that he was once the Lord of all Jueteng Lords.Jueteng is an illegal numbers game that dates back to the Spanish Colonial times.Jueteng and other forms of illegal gambling still persists in the Philippines today because politicians need the kickback (money from jueteng lords) to finance their election campaigns.A legal, government-sanctioned casino like the City of Dreams Manila is therefore a long-term tailwind for Melco.The Philippine government could be trusted to never repeat China's anti-gambling acts.Aside from Melco's City of Dreams and Solaire, Pres. Benigno Aquino Jr. also approved two other multinationals to build and operate casinos in Manila.Japan-based Universal Entertainment Group will open a $2 billion casino complex in 2016, and Alliance Global will open another $1.1 billion casino in 2018.The centuries-old gambling-friendly attitude of the politicians and citizens of the Philippines also inspired Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR ) to ask for Pres. Aquino's blessing for a $1 billion casino in the Philippines.The success of any gambling-related business is always subject to the whims of political leaders.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I opine that Melco is a better buy than Las Vegas Sands now because of its judicious investment in City of Dreams Manila.</span>Melco's Philippine-based casino has a good chance of offsetting the declining revenue from its Macau operations.It is true that Las Vegas Sands has a casino in Singapore (Melco does not).However, that island nation's strict political leaders will not be as pliable as Filipino politicians.Singapore's politicians has a hardline policy toward casinos.Gambling junket operations are banned from Singapore and local Singaporeans must pay $76 to get inside a casino.Singapore's tight oversight over gambling might have been one reason why Melco opted to build in Manila.As long as a Filipino wear shoes and has clean clothes, he or she can enter any casino without paying any fees.Casinos and online sites are not also banned from advertising to local residents of the Philippines.Furthermore, the millions of Europeans, Americans and Asian tourists who visit the Philippines annually are also potential customers for City of Dreams Manila.The stock market doesn't seem to realize that the gambling bug is not exclusive to Chinese people.Like I said, the Filipino people are probably more hard core when it comes to gambling compared to Chinese citizens.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>One more reason why I believe Melco is a better buy than Las Vegas Sands is due to Melco's friendly ties with PokerStars.</span>Las Vegas Sands' CEO Sheldon Adelson is adamantly against online poker.Adelson has lobbied for U.S. politicians to permanently ban online gambling .Unlike Adelson's intense dislike for online poker, Melco Crown has a good working relationship with PokerStars.City of Dreams Manila allowed Amaya (OTCPK: AMYGF ) (new owner of PokerStars) to open a PokerStars Live Poker Tournament Room.Melco also hosts a PokerStars Live Poker room in Macau.Lawrence Ho and James Packer, majority owners of Melco Crown Entertainment, have not made any complaints against online gambling.I therefore assume that Melco Crown is not averse to operating or investing in online casinos.Canada-based Amaya took on a lot of debt in its $4.9 billion purchase of PokerStars and Full Tilt.Amaya is likely betting that the global online gambling business will continue to grow.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Statista's chart below estimates that online gambling revenue this year will be more than $41 billion - nearly equal to land-based casinos' $44.1 billion revenue in Macau in 2014.</span>My point is that Melco Crown is more likely to engage in online casinos than Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corporation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It is just speculation on my part but I insist that online casinos are cheaper to build, operate, and monetize than land-based casinos.</span>Melco doesn't need to spend a billion dollars to come up with an online casino.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Macau drama could eventually turn for the better because that autonomous Chinese territory's industry could die without its gambling industry.</span>Macau's government revenues were 85% acquired from gambling-related taxes/licenses.Economic hardships could lead to political unrest in Macau.The Chinese government already has a hard time coping with Hong Kong's lingering political unrest, getting Macau restive could complicate matters further.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I also conclude that Melco Crown, which has a higher P/E but has smaller revenue, might be safer to bet on compared to Las Vegas Sands.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The tale-of-the-tape below says LVS has better fundamental numbers than MPEL.</span>However, the gambling business is not all about numbers.It is my all-in bet that political factors are often more important when considering an investment on the casino industry.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Melco's management was astute enough to build a casino in Manila earlier than its U.S.-based rivals.</span>The better-than-Singapore political tolerance of gambling in the Philippines gives Melco a hedge against further deterioration of its operations in Macau.I firmly believe that online casinos could help offset the declining revenue from Macau casinos.As long as the octogenarian Adelson is at the helm of Las Vegas Sands, that company will remain blind to the opportunity of online casinos.Adelson is fighting a quixotic crusade.China, Russia, and European countries have a huge population of online gamblers.If the United States did not ban PokerStars in 2011, Americans would still be the biggest contributors to PokerStars' cash registers.Caesars Entertainment has seen the light and has joined Amaya to lobby legislative bodies of U.S. States to legalize online gambling.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Global online gambling is thriving and U.S. casino operators want it legalized perhaps to help them rake in more money or offset the decline in their Macau casino operations.</span>Betting on casino stocks has its risks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The most prominent of these dangers is that Macau will continue to see lower revenues as more gamblers go to other casino havens.</span>However, if proper marketing is implemented for City of Dreams Manila, Melco Crown might not suffer another 20% drop in revenue like it suffered last Q4 2014.Lawrence Ho and his team needs to comp VIP Macau high-rollers to entice them to go to Manila instead of Singapore.I expect MPEL and LVS to continue its downtrend for the next sixty days.Seeking Alpha readers should remain patient and wait for casino stocks to bottom out before making a buy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.</span>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Source: Melco Crown Can Survive And Thrive Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
