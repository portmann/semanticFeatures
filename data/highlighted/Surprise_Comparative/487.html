class='textDiv'>Eclipse Resources Sets The Table For A Binary Q1 Reporting - Eclipse Resources (NYSE:ECR) | Seeking Alpha ECR has been a great trader for me since its IPO but with equal risk on either side of the trade the name is an avoid at this point.ECR reported good incremental progress to operations but it's impossible to get an accurate read on growth trend lines this early into production.ECR is also still highly dependent on natural gas which introduces huge risk into the narrative to both longs and shorts at current pricing.After riding Eclipse Resources (NYSE: ECR ) from $22.50 in late-July of 2014 to the mid-$5's in late December and subsequently riding shares from the long side for 13% I am out of the ECR game.At least for now, at least until Q1/15 earnings can shed some light on the mid-term direction of the company.I also recommend readers avoid ECR at this point as the clouded narrative of the company provides substantial risk to a trade on either side.With Q4 results showing both positives and negatives I think any definitive statements about how to trade ECR that don't involve using hedged trades would be irresponsible.I'll elaborate.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The positives will take a bit longer to detail so I'll start with those.</span>Also, it should be noted that these positives are hard to get a really good trend line read on because of the immature operations at ECR.For instance, if I were to tell you that ECR increased adjusted net production (MMcfe/d) from 10 to 131 Y/Y for the quarter this would normally be a jaw dropping figure percentage wise.But, again, ECR was essentially non-operational just one year ago so the results are going to be highly skewed.The other positives to come from the quarter fall into the same category of being embellished: proved reserves grew (Bcfe) from 78 to 356, proved PV-10 grew from $161 million to $509 million, and revenue grew from $12.9 million to $137.8 million.Now, it's true that these are good starts to building some long-term asset value for shareholders but the rate of growth, even if we broke these figures out sequentially, isn't going to be a reliable indicator of health for probably at least 8-12 quarters.What can't be denied as positive as detailed in Q4 results are the gross lateral feet per well and the average days spud to rig release numbers which came in showing increases from 5996 to 7173 and decreases from 49.8 days to 19 days.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Both of those are big pluses to the longer term bull case if one remains on the other side of Q4 results.</span>The other big positive is something I detailed in a prior article as the primary reason that I recommended at the time shorts buy to close.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ECR has much greater pro forma liquidity as a result of a private placement of $434 million.</span>Prior to this as of 12/31/2014 ECR's liquidity would have been a measly and alarming $141 million.Pro Forma ECR has liquidity of $600 million inclusive of a borrowing base redetermination increase of $25 million.With this in-total, liquidity is a non-concern at this point.I also should note when it comes to liquidity that ECR does have prime Utica Fairway assets that it could, in a worst case scenario, sell in divestitures if current pricing environments persist.Further, because of these assets and the general sectors at least stated willingness to M&A (underlined by Exxon Mobil Corporation's (NYSE: XOM ) CEO recently coming out and saying as much) I'm also not considering BK a final option.So the bad with ECR is actually quite simple.The bad basically boils down to the fact that ECR has a poor hedging program in place for 2015 and in parallel to hedging that natural gas pricing remains at multi-year lows.Of ECR's 28 operated producing wells detailed in its Q4 investor presentation six of them, 6 of its largest producers, are 100% natural gas producing.ECR only has 4 wells that are majority oil based and of those four the highest percentage of oil based production is 44% of the total.Again, ECR is and always will, without acquisition and proper hedging, be substantially exposed to natural gas pricing.As goes natural gas, so goes ECR's financial and operating health.That said, I reiterate that I have natural gas pricing modeled to improve substantially by year-end (which provides the upside case for ECR) but can't be certain of this and if I'm wrong ECR will face significant further impairments (which provides the downside case for ECR).I'm not in the business of taking purely speculative chances on opportunities with equal risk and reward unless there are perfectly convenient vehicles with which to do this (see SandRidge).This of course explains my reluctance to guide to readers a clear direction for ECR.All told I've taken nearly 100% from ECR since it's gone public in a mix of trading the long and short side.Unfortunately for me and the trading community ECR is currently an avoid.Source: Eclipse Resources Sets The Table For A Binary Q1 Reporting Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks
