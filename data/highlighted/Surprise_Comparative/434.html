(NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha Altria has increased its dividend payments for 45 consecutive years, easily qualifying it as a Dividend Achiever.See how cheap/expensive the stock looks accounting for its SAB Miller ownership.Altria (NYSE: MO ) is the leader in the U.S. tobacco industry.The company owns Marlboro, Benson & Hedges, and Virginia Slims in the cigarette category.Altria's e-vapor brands are Mark Ten and Green Smoke.In the smokeless tobacco category, Altria owns both the Skoal and Copenhagen brands.Finally, in the cigar space, Altria owns Black & Mild.Additionally, the company owns 27% of SAB Miller.Altria also owns the St. Michelle's Winery brand of wine.Altria's high quality brands have allowed it to increase its dividend for 45 consecutive years.The company is a member of the Dividend Achievers Index.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Dividend Achievers Index is comprised of businesses with 10 or more consecutive years of dividend payments.</span>You can see the current list of all 238 members of the Dividend Achievers Index here .This article takes a look at Altria's current events, competitive advantage, and future growth prospects.The company will be examined using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing .The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing take a systematic approach to building a high quality dividend growth portfolio.Altria's business operations are best analyzed after adjusting for the company's SAB Miller ownership.As mentioned above, Altria owns 27% of SAB Miller.Altria's market value ownership of SAB Miller is worth about $22.5 billion.Altria reported earnings of $1.006 billion from its SAB Miller ownership in full fiscal 2014.Removing the SAB Miller investment from Altria's current Market Cap of $104.8 billion gives the company an adjusted market cap of $82.3 billion.Removing SAB Miller's earnings from Altria's earnings of $5.06 billion gives the company adjusted earnings over fiscal 2014 of $4.05 billion.Removing the SAB Miller investment, Altria has a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.3.With an adjusted market cap of $82.3 billion, Altria is one of the largest consumer goods companies in the world.Unlike most consumer goods companies, Altria's income is generated entirely in the U.S.The company's international operations were spun-off years ago and now go by Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM ).As a result, an investment in Altria gives investors exposure to U.S. markets.Altria's competitive advantage in the U.S. comes directly from its market leading tobacco brands.Since there are severe restrictions on advertising for tobacco, it is very unlikely a new cigarette company (or even a competitor) will be able to take significant market share from Altria.The image below shows the Marlboro brands dominance in the cigarette industry: Source: Altria 2015 CAGNY Presentation Recent Growth History & Future Growth Prospects Despite declines in the cigarette industry, Altria has managed to compound smokeable operating income at 4.5% a year since 2009.Altria has managed to grow its smokeable operating income by reducing controllable expenses, increasing market share, and raising prices to more-than-offset the rise in cigarette taxes.Altria's smokeless category has grown at around 5% a year over the same period.Altria's St. Michelle's Winery division has compounded operating income at an impressive 12.9% a year over the last 5 years.Despite stellar growth, the wine division makes up only a tiny portion of Altria's overall profits.Over the last 5 years, Altria has grown earnings per share at 7.7% a year, and dividends per share at 8.7% a year.Management expects the company to continue growing earnings per share and dividends per share at 7% to 9% a year going forward.I believe management's projections are achievable and accurate.They match growth over the last 5 years for Altria.The cigarette market has not changed substantially over the last 5 years, so it is very reasonable to assume the company will continue on a similar growth trajectory.Combined with the company's 3.9% dividend yield, this gives investors an expected total return of 10.9% to 12.9% a year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Altria's future growth in its smokeable segment will be driven by continued efficiency gains and higher prices that more-than-offset rising cigarette taxes.</span>The company's strong brands should help it achieve modest growth in cigarettes and cigars despite overall volume declines in the industry.The company is experiencing a similar growth trajectory in smokeless tobacco.Altria's real potential growth driver is e-vapor and heated tobacco products.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company is developing heated tobacco products in partnership with Philip Morris International that are being billed as "less harmful" cigarette products.</span>By heating tobacco without burning it, the amount of carcinogens are reduced while still providing a nicotine buzz.U.S. consumers spent an estimated $2 billion on e-vapor cigarette products in 2014, up from $1.3 billion in 2013 for a growth rate over 50%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Still, growth was slower than expected and the adoption rate for e-vapor products remains lower than what was expected.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It appears that the vast majority of consumers still prefer traditional cigarettes to e-vapor products, despite e-vapor being less harmful.</span>Interestingly, (and admittedly anecdotally), many consumers seem to smoke both traditional cigarettes "sometimes" while using e-vapor products in addition.This dual use could be a temporary phenomenon, or consumers could use e-vapor products in places where cigarettes are not acceptable and switch back to "traditional" cigarettes where they are permitted to smoke them.At this point, it is safe to assume that 99.9% of people in the U.S. who smoke cigarettes know they are harmful and that there are a litany of alternatives, but prefer to smoke them anyway.The sections below will compare Altria to other businesses with a long history of dividend increases using the 5 Buy Rules from The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing .Each rule has a short "why it matters" section, explaining why the rule is relevant.Altria has increased its dividend payments for 45 consecutive years (excluding the effects of spin-offs).Altria easily passes the first rule of dividend investing.Why it matters: The Dividend Aristocrats (stocks with 25+ years of rising dividends) have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years by 2.88 percentage points per year.Altria's current dividend yield of 3.9% is the 22nd highest out of 155 stocks with 25+ years of dividend payments without a reduction.The company's high dividend yield should appeal to income-oriented investors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Why it Matters: Stocks with higher dividend yields have historically outperformed stocks with lower dividend yields.</span>The highest-yielding quintile of stocks outperformed the lowest-yielding quintile by 1.76 percentage points per year from 1928 to 2013.Altria has a high payout ratio of around 80%.Normally, a company with such a high payout ratio would be at some risk of cutting its dividend.Altria's stable cash flows leave little doubt the company will continue raising its dividends year-in-and-year-out.The company has the 146th lowest payout ratio out of 155 stocks with long dividend histories.Why it Matters: High-yield, low-payout ratio stocks outperformed high-yield, high-payout ratio stocks by 8.2 percentage points per year from 1990 to 2006.Altria's EPS growth rate of 7.7% is the 30th highest in the Sure Dividend database.The company's surprisingly fast EPS growth rate is driven by margin increases and strong share repurchases.Why it Matters: Growing dividend stocks have outperformed stocks with unchanging dividends by 2.4 percentage points per year from 1972 to 2013.Altria has a low stock price standard deviation of just 19.5%.The company has the 14th lowest stock price standard deviation out of 155 stocks with 25+ years of dividend payments without a reduction.Why it Matters: The S&P Low Volatility index outperformed the S&P 500 by 2 percentage points per year for the 20-year period ending September 30th, 2011.Altria ranks in the Top 25% using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing .The company's high dividend yield, solid growth prospects, and low stock price standard deviation should appeal to investors seeking both current income and growth.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Altria's fairly high (based on its historical average) price-to-earnings ratio of around 20 keeps it from ranking even higher.</span>In the final analysis, Altria is a high-quality business that investors should hold for long-term dividend growth as well as current income.On the downside, many people believe Altria sells an unethical product, so this stock is certainly not for everyone.Source: Nasdaq Dividend Achievers: Altria Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks
