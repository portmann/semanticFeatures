Hikaru Nakamura (中�?光) � is this your obscure reference to Haiku, the poetic pun on #5?Naka�s the current #1 US chess player, just edging out the Philippines� So, who switched allegiance to the USA (and paid the transfer fee, which can be $50k euro out of his own pocket?!Hard to believe as So does not have much money, even after winning the $100k pre-tax Millionaires Open in Vegas; I bet he got a steep discount for the transfer fee).So what, you say?What you say?Indeed So.To my fans: slow internet has prevented me from summarizing all the links AND being first to post.You notice the cheap imitators who only comment on one story�sad but true yet the market supports these guys as nowadays quality means nothing, people only compete on price and nobody complains.@myself � just to complete the pun, it�s well known in chess circles that Naka is a bit of an arrogant snob as grandmaster�s go, hence nemo�s reference is complete.Bonus trivia:  Naka�s adopted father is a FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry, which shows that chess can be taught rather than genetically acquired; another example being the former woman�s world chess champion Judit Polgar, who reigned for a generation (recently retired), and who was taught by her father to play chess, along with her two other sisters, who also played very well, which would argue against a genetic predisposition, given that siblings are not often the same genetically.7.He [Putnam] never once mentions genetics as a factor in inequality.Was Kling a member of SAE at the University of Tennessee?No, not really, I�m just confident that Bob Stoops recruits based on the unique characteristics and qualities of the recruits not their ancestors.I don�t know about the University of Tennessee.That�s a silly statement.Superior athleticism has a large genetic component.The Left-wing trolls all seem to be obsessive about some topic or other and try to connect them to completely tangential issues.Matt Buckalew March 11, 2015 at 3:53 pm The Anti-Gnostic March 11, 2015 at 1:27 pm Of course not, some people have slightly more or less chromosomes.I�m sure you�re gifted in that regard.Let me refine the question a bit: do you believe all people with the normal complement of chromosomes will turn out equally with equality of inputs?Come on, fulfil your own burden of proof.How much of �the� �IQ� �gap� (sorry, hard to take any of the words in this concept very seriously) is based on subjective Norteamericano perceptions of skin colour?The Anti-Gnostic March 11, 2015 at 2:10 pm Who mentioned race?Do you think all whites are equal genetically?So Much for Subtlety March 11, 2015 at 6:40 pm How much of “the�?“IQ�?“gap�?(sorry, hard to take any of the words in this concept very seriously) is based on subjective Norteamericano perceptions of skin colour?To paraphrase Trotsky grossly, you might not take IQ tests seriously, but IQ tests are still very serious.The IQ test is done on paper.Graded by someone who usually does not see the candidate.Thus we can conclude that any result is not based on perceptions of skin color.We also know that IQ tests are excellent measures of pretty much everything we want to measure.They are an excellent predictor of job performance.Even for truck drivers.They are the single best predictor of academic outcomes.Now as it happens I think on the whole they are not measuring IQ but willingness to do stupid tests.That hardly matters.They work.How they work, I don�t know.What they measure, I don�t know.But work they do.There is an IQ gap and it has a strong correlation with race.These are just facts of life you need to accept.There is clearly a strong genetic component to intelligence.After all it evolved.No matter how many enrichment classes I give my dog, he ain�t going to get a good SAT score.The Left is like Alfred Russel Wallace in that they accept evolution right up to the human brain.Then they insist it is a miracle caused by God.You�ve made the whole argument yourself SMFS if you�d only connect your own dots.1.Under a pessimistic theory that�s popular now, civilations never reach a stage of development that would allow for inter-planetary travel, which explains why aliens haven�t visited us.Under this theory, as civilizations on  planets advance and exploit the resources available to generate energy (fossil fuels here), they reach a ceiling, as the planet cannot absorb the byproducts from the exploitation of the resources, resulting in catastrophic events that set the planet back eons.Welcome to my world!The Great Filter, an intriguing thesis.Heh.In Hocus Pocus, Vonnegut conceived the idea that developing antibiotic-resistant superbugs was the whole point of life on Earth, unbeknownst to us.1.Under a pessimistic theory that’s popular now,�� Whatever Paul Krugman�s problems may be, he at least (a) argues about contemporary policy topics and (b) doesn�t resort to scientific racism as a go-to.Look to whom Tyler links favourably and unfavourably.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Again, I think Kling was actually referring to assortative mating contributing to greater IQ differences between classes over time, not race.</span>But don�t let facts get in the way.He didn�t say anything about race.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I�m smarter than my siblings and have a lot more money than them, Sorry, couldn�t help it when grammar and irony come together so comically.</span>(Not that I�ve never �stepped in it� myself.)You�re not by any chance advocating the absurd genteelism of the �understood`� verb are you?It�s all baloney.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You should have gone to a better school.</span>You must have had a lot of trouble with imperative commands as a kid.And it is hardly a genteelism seeing as how treating �than� as a preposition instead of solely as a conjunction was a 16th century innovation.Please point me in the direction of a place where I can be corrected, rather than just having to accept some assertions by random internet people.We all know that grammar changes, but you would get that question wrong on the GRE/SAT/ACT.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I trust their accuracy more than yours.</span>https://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/than-i-and-than-me/ The writer�s general conclusions and analysis  are supported by the discussion he mentions in the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, if you would like an authority.But I�m still telling kids it�s wrong on standardized tests To Hanson�s point, I�ve often considered the thought that Federal taxes should be progressive on an IQ basis.I don�t read much Kling, but I did notice the sub-title of his blog: �taking the most charitable view of those who disagree�.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Do you think even your mother would agree you were taking a grown up, much less charitable, approach to what he said?</span>The criticism is not for being mean to Charles Murray.The criticism is for, basically, re-producing his book and not citing him.There is essentially zero chance that Putnam did not read it, but he declined to engage with it.He simply ignored it.That is a genuine criticism whatever you think of Murray.Race blame?The book by Charles Murray in question specifically ignored race.Murray presumably did not want the same torching he got for The Bell Curve.Thus it did not contain one little shred of race blaming.Try to find any.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What is more Kling does not mention race once either.</span>All he says is: He never once mentions genetics as a factor in inequality.This biases the analysis much more in favor of policy remedies than is reasonable.Genetics is not the same as race.And if you assume people are a blank slate, that will bias your solutions in a certain way.Putnam should at least justify his assumption that any child can win the Fields Award with enough special Ed classes.That too is an entirely reasonable criticism � whatever you think of race.Putnam is arguing about contemporary policies.So is Kling in critiquing him.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Neither of them has resorted to any sort of racism much less scientific racism � criticizing books is so much easier when you don�t actually read them isn�t it?</span>But the fact that Stalin and Pol Pot both had a strong interest in contemporary social policy and were deeply opposed to racism in all its forms does not make them good guys.Donald Pretari March 11, 2015 at 3:52 pm #6�Well, Dugin is right in that by being an admirer of any philosophy that�s authoritarian, nationalistic, racist, anti-reason, anti-enlightenment, for an established state religion, that he�s directly in conflict with liberalism, at least as I understand and adhere to it.I find the deporting undesirables idea having a very disturbing resonance of war crimes past.Dugin�s vehement hatred and annoyance of being told what to do is symmetrically matched by his orgasmic pleasure in telling ( really ordering ) other people what to do.Too bad people can�t see that, for all his talk about volk, his entire philosophy is directed at being worshipped and serviced.There�s really no telling what he�ll really want when, except that it will be at the expense of lots of decent, innocent, human beings.Not pleasant reading.#3  makes complete sense to me, the key thing about entrepeneurship is that most people are parlyzed by both fear and ignorance of how to go about it.If you have seen, and even better, lived, an example you are much more ready to give it a shot.Guess it depends on what kind of entrepreneur the parent was.I�ve seen plenty of people scared off of entrepreneurism by their parents failures in that area.Conversely, if your parent succeeded as an entrepreneur, that is going to dominate your perception of the concept.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Donald Pretari March 11, 2015 at 5:46 pm Maybe I�ve been reading Murray incorrectly, but I thought his position is that, while we certainly could alter outcomes of middle and lower class children, it would be incredibly expensive and also incredibly intrusive, involving serious intervention or interference, however you see it.</span>This was shown years ago when children who were given intensive help for only a short time generally reverted back to prior levels of performance without that intensive help.If this view is correct, and I think it is, we are left with pragmatically experimenting with different programs to find out which ones can, even if marginally, help children out.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Perhaps a number of them could, in conjunction, produce better outcomes.</span>But this pragmatic experimentation, in order to work, needs people assessing the programs to leave ideology and personal biases behind.Could that be the stumbling block?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Yes, but also the sunk cost fallacy and the preference for one grand plan instead of many smaller scale plans.</span>Number one was best covered in the Daily Mail of all places.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Separating first contact scenarios into the three most obvious groups,  the most likely first news of first contact from an alien civilization is the reception of inadvertent high-energy information from such a civilization at an earlier stage of its development, the second most likely first news of first contact comes from inefficiently directed information from such a civilization somewhere after the earliest stages of its development, the third most likely is the traditional individuated flying saucer take me to your leader method.</span>Only the third is amenable to movies, because only the third has a quick resolution of mysteries.Predicting alien contact from movies one has seen � or movies one has imagined making, if one is inclined that way � is contrary to the type of secular  logical reasoning which clearly explains that early stage civilizations are more common than advanced civilizations which are more common than very advanced civilizations.Previous post: Why Paul Krugman is wrong to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership Launching The Innovation Renaissance The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the
