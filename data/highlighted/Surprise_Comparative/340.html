of the year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some of its decline might be due to investors taking profits after a huge rally in 2014, but there seems to be a bigger set of issues at play.</span>Investors are once again questioning Intel's growth prospects, since the PC market continues to shrink and Intel's mobile business is fraught with problems.But just as the pervasive negativity set the stage for Intel's massive rally last year, the same dynamic could soon play out again.While I think Intel can continue to decline below $30 per share, if it does, it will be a fantastic buying opportunity.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) had a fantastic run last year.The stock performed extremely well, rising approximately 40%, not including dividends.After such fantastic performance, it's not unreasonable to see a dip.Indeed, Intel is now about 15% off its 52-week high.But Intel isn't a typical case of a high-flying stock correcting due to a lofty valuation.In fact, Intel was still fairly cheap on a valuation basis, even at its 52-week high.Rather, something else appears to be going on with Intel.Specifically, I believe there are some very real reasons why the stock is coming down, and these challenges are significant enough to lay the tracks for a continued sell-off.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But the good news is, should Intel continue to trade lower, it will once again set up a great buying opportunity.</span>When a company sees its most important market shrink, it's cause for concern.That's exactly what's happening to Intel as it relates to the personal computer.In a recent report , IDC stated that global PC shipments fell 2.4% in the fourth quarter last year.PC sales were 80.8 million for the quarter, down from 82.2 million units the previous year.Not only is the declining PC market cause for concern, but the nature of PC sales is changing as well.IDC noted that consumer purchasing decisions were based on simply refreshing very old PCs.It would be far more encouraging to see that consumers were buying new PCs because they really wanted to, not simply because they had to.In addition, IDC estimated that some fourth-quarter production was attributed to getting ahead of holiday-related production constraints in Asia in the first quarter.This means the better-than-expected fourth quarter results likely just shifted volume from early 2015 into the end of 2014.This sets the stage for a disappointing first quarter 2015 shipment total.This matters a great deal for Intel, since PCs still constitute the majority of Intel's business.Intel's revenue totaled $55.8 billion last year , of which $34.6 billion came from its PC business.That means Intel still derives 62% of its revenue from personal computers.This is significantly weighing on Intel's growth prospects.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>PC revenue grew just 4%, which overshadowed much stronger performance in Intel's higher-growth areas such as data centers and the Internet of Things, where revenue grew 18% and 19% last year, respectively.</span>Intel is still chained to the PC, and equally troubling is the fact that Intel's venture into the mobile business has gone very poorly.As if the decline in the personal computer industry, Intel's biggest market, weren't bad enough, investors have a separate problem on their hands, which is Intel's very poor performance in mobile.At the beginning of 2014, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich vowed to get Intel's chips into 40 million tablets by the end of the year.To be sure, Intel actually succeeded on its goal, and then some.Intel shipped 46 million tablets last year.But this is not cause for celebration.The reason Intel was able to ship so many tablets is because it offered massive subsidies to device makers.This was essentially a price-war strategy, and created "contra-revenue" that deducts from sales growth, and at rising volumes, Intel's mobile losses escalated quickly.Intel lost $4.2 billion in mobile last year, up 35% from a $3.1 billion loss in 2013.Contra revenue actually caused Intel to report negative revenue in mobile in the fourth quarter.For 2014, mobile revenue collapsed 85% to just $202 million.I believe that investors now seriously doubt Intel's mobile strategy, and are beginning to worry about the very viability of Intel's mobile business.This uncertainty is compounded by Intel's decision to consolidate its mobile and PC businesses.Going forward, these two businesses will report under the same operating segment.This seems like a weak attempt to hide the mobile business.Fortunately, investors should take comfort in the fact that if Intel continues to sell-off, it will create a fantastic buying opportunity.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel looks cheap now, but as we all know, even cheap stocks can get cheaper.</span>If Intel keeps falling, investors will have a great opportunity to initiate a new position at a very favorable price or add to their existing position.That's because, despite Intel's troubles, the company is still massively profitable and generates a ton of free cash flow.Intel produced $10.3 billion of free cash flow last year.Not only does the company generate huge cash flow, but it returns a lot of it to investors.The company paid $4.4 billion of dividends, meaning Intel maintains a very comfortable 42% free cash flow payout ratio.In addition, Intel bought back $10.7 billion of stock.Investors are likely questioning Intel's growth prospects, just as they did a few years ago before Intel's massive rally.Back then, Intel got too cheap, and if the stock continues to decline it will once again become too cheap.This is the all-too-typical pattern of investors overreacting.Pervasive negativity is exactly what set the stage for Intel's rally last time.Because of this, there will reach a point when Intel is once again a screaming buying opportunity.I don't think we're there just yet, given its various challenges, but if Intel trades below $30 per share it will trade for just 12 times earnings, which will be a big enough discount considering the company's issues.At that point, I'll consider buying shares.Source: Intel's Sell-Off Might Continue, But Get Your Buy Orders Ready Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
