(Pending:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha The long awaited Etsy IPO is getting closerâ€”the company filed its S1 last week.The peer-to-peer crafts marketplace presents an impressive GMS, top-line, and EBITDA growth.Etsy also uncovers remarkable growth in its payment processing units that compete with PayPal.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even though Etsy presents impressive growth rates and greater innovation, its high valuation may drive investors away from this niche e-commerce company.</span>The online crafts marketplace Etsy (Pending: ETSY ) filed its S1 with the SEC last week and formalized rumors about its plans to go public.For those not familiar with Etsy, it is a niche online peer-to-peer marketplace that specializes in handmade crafts, arts, and vintage items.Etsy has almost 20 million active buyers and 1.5 million active sellers who engaged in 2014 in deals worth almost $2B.Even before filing for an IPO, Etsy was far from being secretive about its growth, and it has published a monthly " weather report " since 2008 on its blog, summarizing previous month highlights that include the total number of items sold, the number of new users, the number of new items listed, and the amount of gross merchandise sold ("GMS").Investors that are interested in Etsy stock in secondary markets of private equity can get a pretty good sense of its top-line numbers and growth figures from these reports.Now, as Etsy filed for public offering, it unveils its entire financial statements to the public and presents impressive top-line and EBITDA growth along with an increasing net loss.Etsy generates revenues by various fees charged to the sellers for listing and selling items on the site, promoting their shops on Etsy and processing payments.Sellers are charged a listing fee of $0.2 to list an item on Etsy and an additional 3.5% of every transaction completed on the site.Sellers who would like to receive prominent placing on Etsy search engines could promote their stores through Etsy's "Promoted Listings" that is charged on a cost-per-click fee.Sellers can also use Etsy's direct checkout service that enables merchants to process payments directly through Etsy for 3.5% and $0.25 of the deal, and save them the trouble of engaging with an external payment processor.In addition Etsy's direct checkout allows buyers to remain in the shop during the checkout process.The direct checkout mechanism allows Etsy to increase their income from each sale by shifting fees from PayPal that used to be the primary payment processing choice to Etsy.Etsy breaks its revenues into three segments: marketplace, seller services and other.Revenues from listings and transaction fees are reported in the Marketplace segment; revenues from promoted listings, wholesale enrollment fees, and payment processing fees are reported in the Sellers Services segment; and revenues from third-party payment processors are reported in the Other segment.As shown in chart 1 below, the vast majority of Etsy's revenues are generated by the Marketplace and Sellers Services sectors, while revenues in the Other segment accounted for 1.4% of the company's quarterly revenues.As mentioned above, Etsy has published its GMS figures since 2008.This enables investors to understand the growth trend of the company since 2008.The amount of GMS every quarter has a direct positive impact on the company's marketplace revenue, and starting in 2012, when Etsy introduced its payment processing service, GMS also impacts the revenues from payment processing.As shown in chart 2 below, Etsy has expanded its GMS by 16% every quarter since Q1'08, when sellers experienced increased sales and used more Seller Services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season.Seasonal shopping patterns are responsible for the fourth quarter being the best quarter in terms of revenue each year; it is followed by a drop in the first quarter.The impressive growth in GMS translated into a 12% quarterly increase in the company's revenues and adjusted EBITDA, making the niche marketplace a rapidly growing company.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These impressive growth rates are a direct result of Etsy's innovation and its constant endeavor for more revenues.</span>Originally, Etsy generated revenues from transactions and listing fees only.In 2011, Seller Services revenues were added when Etsy launched its advertising platform (which was recently replaced by promoted listings as the company's advertising platform).In 2012, Etsy introduced its payment processing service, which further increased Etsy's Seller Services revenues, contributing to 47% of the total revenues as of Dec 2014.In 2014, Etsy launched two innovative solutions that are expected to expand GMS and revenues even further.The first solution is a point-of-sale solution -- similar to PayPal (NASDAQ: EBAY ) Here, Square, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Register -- that will allow Etsy sellers to use its payment processing in offline in-person transactions.In an announcement, Etsy estimated that 90% of retail purchases are made offline, highlighting the potential for this service.Existing sellers who already have an Etsy shop will be able to integrate the new POS seamlessly and consolidate payment processing vendors to a single vendor.Etsy charges a competitive 2.75% fee per card swipe, replacing the 3.5% transaction fee, and the card reader is delivered for free.Etsy's bold move to expand its payment processing business further to offline transactions is another swing at PayPal, and, in my opinion, it has a very good chance of succeeding.The second solution is a wholesale platform that will allow designers to increase their sales quantities through Etsy.Wholesale selling was available through a limited beta release for a while, and now, Etsy is opening the platform for an entire audience of sellers.In order to join the wholesale platform, sellers will have to pay a one-time $100 fee and a 3.5% transaction fee for every sale made on the platform.Besides the revenue from the sign-up fees, the wholesale platform is Etsy's attempt to increase the number of transactions, GMS, and fees to increase revenues eventually.Etsy has raised almost $100M in six funding rounds and has had two third-party tender offers.As shown in chart 3 below, Etsy's valuation reached $700M in the latest round, reflecting a P/S ratio of 4.45 to the company as of May 2014.As Etsy is yet to disclose its IPO share price, I believe that a price that reflects a P/S ratio between 4 and 12 can make Etsy an attractive investment.I used two leading e-commerce companies with significant marketplace business and payment processing units: eBay and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ).The high bar of the range is on par with eBay.ebay has a substantial marketplace business and payment processing unit (PayPal, before the split) that has a revenue multiple of 4.2, which reflects its mature stage and magnitude of business.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The low bar of the range is slightly better than Alibaba 's P/S ratio of 18.2 which reflects its fantastic growth potential and its enormous target market.</span>Both eBay and Alibaba has significant marketplace business and successful payment processing unit that could be compared to Etsy.Of course, Etsy is no eBay, nor Alibaba, and an attractive P/S ratio that remain a good investment alternative should be between eBay's ratio and a slightly more attractive ratio than Alibaba.According to a recent estimation on the WSJ , Etsy might evaluate the IPO at $1.7B, reflecting a P/S ratio of 8.5 which is within the range provided above.A valuation beyond the $2B will bring Etsy close to the top bar of the range and might become unattractive.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Peer-to-peer marketplace, Etsy filed for IPO after a long waiting period.</span>The company that is focused on a niche market of arts, crafts, and vintage goods presents impressive growth in GMS, revenues, and EBITDA, but this growth might be limited due to the nature of its business focus.Etsy proved in the past that it could deliver innovative solutions that increase revenues such as the payment processing business, promoted listings, and, now, wholesale platform and in-person card readers.However, as Etsy's market is relatively small and with limited growth, investors should not buy this one in any cost.I don't think Etsy is a strong enough brand to attract high demand for shares in IPO price that reflects a high P/S ratio as has happened in other trend IPOs like Alibaba, Box (NYSE: BOX ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), etc.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In case Etsy pricing will reflect a P/S ratio higher than 10, I will consider buying Etsy as a short-term trade than a long-term purchase until it lands within the range I mentioned above.</span>Source: Etsy IPO: Buy Into This Growing Niche Marketplace Only In
