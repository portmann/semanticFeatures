Essentially, the bank gave up trying to defend the ruble by keeping it within a traded "band" of two prices, and resolved to let the currency find its floor, notwithstanding financial crisis or bank runs.In December, however, the bank hiked the key lending rate by 6.5 percentage points (that's right, whole points) to 17 percent in an effort to stave off inflation and strengthen the ruble; in January, they lowered the rate back to 15 percent "due to the shift in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth and cooling economy."It seems like the CBR is adjusting policy on the fly, and the February ruble rally in the face of such mixed messages is all the more impressive.The conditions that led to the fall of the ruble in 2014 will continue to determine its potential rise in 2015.Last year, Ukraine erupted in strife as large-scale protests led to armed opposition in the nation's eastern parts.Crisis in the Ukraine has continued, if wavering at times, into this year.Donetsk remains a rebel stronghold, its heavily contested airport shelled and shattered.A February 15th ceasefire has been altogether ineffective.However, the rise in the ruble this year in the face of continuing violence in Ukraine and previously enacted sanctions is a positive, contrarian sign for the currency.It doesn't seem like lasting peace will come to the region anytime soon, negotiations have stalled - and yet, Western governments seem reluctant to enact new sanctions.The situation in Ukraine is entrenched, representing a "new normal" to which the ruble is now acclimated.The price of crude oil, on the other hand, can still sway the Russian currency.As Bloomberg notes, the rise in value of the ruble this year has almost mirrored an identical rise in crude.April Brent crude futures closed above $60 a barrel on February 25, at $61.25, a 15 percent gain since February 1.Russia's crude-export intensive economy, long tied to the fate of oil prices, stands to gain from a rise in such prices - and we should expect the ruble to continue to as well.The ruble (black) and April Brent Crude futures (blue), since February 1, 2015 To say that the currency's fate depends solely on the crisis in Ukraine or on the price of crude oil is a simplification, at best, though such a claim does delve into some of the myriad factors influencing the value of the ruble and other exchange rates around the world.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What's more, a strong ruble doesn't necessarily imply a strong Russia, and it seems that Putin (together with many of his counterparts around the world) doesn't buy into the fallacy that a strengthened currency belies a strengthened country.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
