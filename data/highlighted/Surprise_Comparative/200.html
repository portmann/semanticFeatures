(NASDAQ: SQBK ) in the fourth quarter of 2015 with few steps left.Square 1 has $3.1 billion in assets at Dec. 31, 2014.Investing in PACW seems like a good decision, but one has to be extra cautious in adverse conditions in the future.Source: PacWest Bancorp: Looks Promising, But Extra Caution Needed Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
