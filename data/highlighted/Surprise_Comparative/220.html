however, leases aren't bonds and most lease contracts have rent growth (contractual, CPI-based, and/or percentage rent).Here's a snapshot that illustrates the spread between cap rates and the 10-year Treasury: Most REITs are buying net lease properties in the 7% range, depending on credit, and there's a substantial demand for income as evidenced by the growing capital in the REIT sector.Joey Odom explains, While low interest rates have assisted, it is this imbalance of demand over supply that has held down cap rates.As a company, Stan Johnson Company has been at the forefront of the net lease market and is the largest company solely focused on net investment sales.We experienced a 35% increase in transaction volume as a company in 2014, beating a then-record-setting year in 2013, in which we grew our transaction volume by 30% over the previous year.As a company, we are a bridge between private and institutional capital and are seeing record transaction volume to not only Institutional buyers (which have large allocation appetites) but also to individual investors, family office, private equity and global capital.As I see it, there's a lot in common with winning the NCAA bracket and being a best-in-class net lease REIT.The winners will both have the best models of repeatability.I'm not just talking about shooting free throws or paying dividends, but unmatched consistency that provides a high degree of predictability.This year I'm putting together a "Sweet 16" list, and in my "bracketology" model I have included the following REITs: All of these REITs are measured by predictability metrics including dividend safety, balance sheet management, diversification, and overall reliability.STORE Capital (NYSE: STOR ) just listed recently so they will be judged based on the merits of management and the portfolio, not so much historical performance.All others have a track record (good and bad), here's the bracket: Now the first round is based on historical performance - this is my way of weeding out the good from the mediocre.It's not hard to compare recent performance (as I did above) but instead to examine the 2014 full-year performance stats.As you can see below, the 8 REITs are being removed from the list.American Realty Capital Properties (NASDAQ: ARCP ) had the worst performance in 2014 and of course that was accented by a more recent suspension in the dividend.The good news is that the company has a new coach, Glenn J. Rufrano, and he is well-respected for his 30 years of experience.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He's no rookie to turnarounds so I expect that ARCP will get an easier seed in 2016.</span>Government Properties (NYSE: GOV ), Getty (NYSE: GTY ), and One Liberty Properties (NYSE: OLP ) are not in the same league.I have scouted these teams in the past, and I don't see much potential in my quest for dividend supremacy.Chambers Street (NYSE: CSG ) has also been a disappointment.I still own shares in this REIT but my patience is being tested.With no full-time CEO (Cuneo has retired) and a mis-mash of industrial and office properties, I'm beginning to wonder whether the institutional investors are feeling the love, I know I'm not.Spirit Realty (NYSE: SRC ) has performed well in 2014 but that's because they focused and executed.With the recent resignation of the president and no real differentiation offered, I don't consider SRC a finalist.In fact, I think Mr. Market has already graded the company above its true caliber and the takeout premium is already in-place.Now as we advance to the next round (of 8 teams) we have a more competitive playing field.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To advance to the "Final Four" these 8 REITs must demonstrate a higher level of predictability.</span>That means, of course, that the winners must demonstrate they can fill up the scoreboard with steady buckets (free throws win games).The first game goes to STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG ).This Industrial REIT has demonstrated consistent dividend growth (averaging 12% over the last 2 years), while Monmouth Real Estate (NYSE: MNR ) has not increased its dividend in over ten years.The second game goes to Realty Income (NYSE: O ).EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR ) is a solid performer but no match for the "Monthly Dividend Company".The third game goes to W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC ).As I explained above, STORE has a limited track record as a public company but I'm sure we'll see this REIT in the finals one day soon.Finally, National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN ) wins easily to Gramercy Property Trust (NYSE: GPT ).A few years of experience (and a dividend boost) will put Gramercy in the finals.Now we're down to the Final Four.Coincidentally, I own three (of the four) of these today (could be some bias here).While STAG has performed well since listing (April 2011), there's just no comparison with Realty Income.One thing worth mentioning, STAG is really an industrial REIT but it gets included in the net lease peer group.If you were to compare STAG's valuation (P/FFO 15x) with the Industrial peers you would see that the shares are not as expensive.But also remember that Realty Income's average lease term is 12 years and STAG is north of 4 years.The next match up is a tough one.W.P. Carey and National Retail Properties are both experienced players - they have increased their dividend for long periods.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In terms of valuation, W.P. Carey is the cheaper bet today (P/FFO of 16x); however, in terms of predictability, NNN wins.</span>The company has increased the dividend for over 25 years in a row.Now, we are down to the home stretch - what we've all been waiting for!The showdown has proven to be a true fist fight and no player is taking any prisoners.The coaches are well prepared - Craig Macnab vs. John Case - and the players are in excellent shape (both rated BBB+ by S&P).The portfolios are considered best in class and the diversification attributes are comparable.Pound-for-pound these two REITs look almost identical�so who wins?Realty Income has evolved into a truly diversified machine.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company owns retail, industrial, and office properties and accordingly, it's the broader diversification that, in my opinion, makes Realty Income a better REIT.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While NNN focuses exclusively on retail (including restaurant) investments, Realty Income has a much wider net to cast and that has enabled the company to pursue large-scale corporate deals.</span>That's the differentiator.I thought the following quote from Chris Zook and James Allen, co-authors of Repeatability: Build Enduring Businesses for a World of Constant Change , would be a fitting close to the Nothing But Net Lease REIT showdown: The power of the repeatable model lies in the way it turns the sources of differentiation into routines, behaviors, and activity systems that everyone in the organization can understand and follow so that when a company sets out on a particular CorpusPath, it knows how to maintain differentiation that led to its initial success...
