(NYSE:ABBV) | Seeking Alpha There has been some differing opinions on the value of AbbVie's acquisition of Pharmacyclics and whether it paid too much.Sometimes acquisitions need to be evaluated for their long-term strategic impact, which could be hard to quantify.Regardless of whether the deal terms were favorable or not, AbbVie is a good prospect to add to the income portion of your portfolio.Since the recent announcement that AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) was acquiring Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC ) in a deal valued at $21 billion, there has been several dozen articles written stating that AbbVie overpaid for Pharmacyclics.And another several dozen articles arguing that the upside potential of the deal was worth the price.The stock dropped over 5% on the day of the announcement, which is the market's way of communicating its disagreement with either the acquisition itself or the price paid.In this case, I think the reason for discontent was the price.The deal was worth $21 billion to be paid 58% with cash and 42% with stock and it would give AbbVie a well-rounded portfolio and a drug that has considerable upside potential and is still in its early stages.Pharmacyclics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on cancer and immune mediated diseases.Its main product is Imbruvica, the primary reason for AbbVie's interest, a very effective treatment for a variety of blood cancers.It was approved in 2013 and has been approved in over 40 countries.In 2014, it had revenue of $730 million of which Imbruvica was almost $500 million in the U.S. alone, and another $55 million outside the U.S. in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ )).But Imbruvica was only part of the reason why AbbVie was interested.Pharmacyclics has a very talented and innovative team that AbbVie can combine with its nascent focus on oncology to grow not only the potential for Imbruvica but for the oncology business in general.By therapy area, Oncology is the largest segment of the market with expected sales of almost $36 billion by 2018.Without Pharmacyclics, AbbVie could potentially grow market share in this segment over time, but with the PCYC acquisition, it has an immediate foothold in the space and is less reliant on the autoimmune and infectious diseases therapies.In my opinion, it wasn't a matter of whether they paid too much for the deal, it was critical for its growth strategy.The terms of the deal valued Pharmacyclics at a price to sales of almost 25, and according to APBK Capital, this multiple is extremely high relative to other deals completed in recent years.Initially, earnings per share could be negatively impacted by the acquisition by approximately $0.20 per share, according to management.But by 2017, management thinks that Pharmacyclics can be accretive to earnings.Meanwhile, while analysts and strategists are crunching numbers to figure out if AbbVie overpaid, Robbins Arroyo LLP, shareholder rights attorneys, are investigating the proposed acquisition and suggesting that the 18.6% premium paid by AbbVie was significantly below the previous 5-year average of a 39% premium on other deals.This is an interesting contrast to comments made by several analysts that AbbVie overpaid.Either way, with the acquisition, AbbVie not only owns the rights to the Imbruvica drug, but significantly strengthens the rest of its oncology offering which is expected to reach $20 billion in peak-year sales and puts AbbVie in the thick of the attractive oncology drug market.AbbVie will have three formidable drugs in its portfolio and the potential for continued growth: 1.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Humira - Humira is a treatment to treat autoimmune diseases and is AbbVie's leading product, with revenues in 2014 of more than $12 billion.</span>Humira patents expire in 2016 but the company thinks it has additional uses for the treatment of certain skin diseases as well.It has also been approved in Japan for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis and plans are to seek further approval for spinal arthritis and Crohn's disease.2.Viekira - The drug provides a competitive alternative to Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ: GILD ) blockbuster Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.The Hepatitis C market is large.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the United States alone, the disease affects more than 3.2 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</span>Without treatment, up to 30 percent of those people go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver, the CDC says.Gilead's Sovaldi produced $8.6 billion in revenue through the third quarter of 2014.The drug costs $83,000 for a 12-week course of treatment.But Gilead's third quarter revenue missed analyst expectations, in part because Sovaldi sales aren't hitting the marks the drug set in the first half of 2014.That's partly because alternatives, like AbbVie's Viekira Pak, are poised to eat into Sovaldi's sales.AbbVie's strategy is to grab share of the Hepatitis C drug market through deals with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers that will favor AbbVie's less expensive treatment and exclude Gilead's drugs from the preferred list of drugs that they will cover.3.Imbruvica - AbbVie already has a few oncology products in the pipeline and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics would strengthen this portfolio and add resources to grow this part of the business.According to management, the hematological oncology market is estimated to be $24 billion and growing rapidly.Current sales of the drug are approaching $1 billion and is expected to peak at around $7 billion.Whether AbbVie paid too much for Pharmacyclics is less important, in my opinion, than gaining immediate access to a blockbuster drug in one of the most attractive sub-segments of the drug industry.We could all point out an occasion or two where we might have overpaid for a car, a dress, a vacation, or a cup of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) coffee, but that coffee cup makes us more productive throughout the day.Sometimes that added value can be easily calculated, other times not.We all know how 'accurate' analysts are with their forecasts and predictions so their estimates of overpayment should be taken with a grain of salt.Just ask the attorneys over at Robbins Arroyo LLP.For investors looking for retirement income and ways to diversify their portfolio with some exposure to pharmaceuticals, AbbVie starts to look like a good candidate with the addition of PCYC.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company also has a decent dividend yield of 3.4% and recently increased the dividend twice in less than a few months.</span>It was raised by 17% in early 2015 and again more recently by an additional 4%, increasing it from $0.42 per share to $0.49 and subsequently to $0.51.In addition, management has announced a share buyback program of $5 billion expected to be executed over the next several years.The stock itself does look a bit pricey at the moment, so it may be best to wait for an additional pullback.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Drug manufacturers are outpacing the S&P 500, so far this year so if the sector pulls back, it may create a better entry point.</span>That being said, if you're a long-term buy-and-hold type of investor and are looking to deploy cash and round out your portfolio, I wouldn't wait too long.Source: Does AbbVie's Acquisition Of Pharmacyclics Make Cents?Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
