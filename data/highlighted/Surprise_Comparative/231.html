HIBB , HON , HRL , JACK , LOCO , NKE , PAY , PM , SHAK , UA , ULTA , UNFI , URBN , WWAV , ZOES by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Cash is a very important part of a portfolio.Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Friday, March 6.Cramer started the show by discussing his gameplan for the coming week.Stocks and earnings that he will be watching are as follows: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ): Apple is expected to unveil the iWatch details and pricing on Monday.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer reiterated his belief that Apple is a cheap stock to buy as it trades at a lower PE multiple than the average stock in the S&P 500.</span>He said that CEO Tim Cook is underrated, although he has performed on every aspect as a company's leader.He added that whenever Apple releases a new device, the app developers find a way to turn the device into something that rules the world.Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: URBN ): The company reports earnings after the close and Cramer said he will not be surprised if the company breaches the 52-week high mark.United Natural Foods (NASDAQ: UNFI ): Cramer will be watching this company's earnings to take a reading of how the organic food industry is doing.His favorite stocks in this space are WhiteWave Foods (NYSE: WWAV ) and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ: HAIN ).Verifone (NYSE: PAY ): Cramer is not expecting blowout numbers, but will instead watch what the company has to say about the future, and how it will play the mobile payment technology with the roll out of Apple Pay.Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK ): The stock price of Shake Shack shot through the roof after the IPO and hasn't come down."Shake Shack is a little like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).Its product is so spectacular that people feel they should own a piece of the company," said Cramer.He however believes that the stock is too expensive to own at these levels, but will grow into its market cap over time.Zoe's Kitchen (NYSE: ZOES ): Cramer thinks that this stock will turn out to be a great regional and national story.El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ: LOCO ): Cramer is not recommending the stock to investors even when in the 20s levels.He prefers Fiesta (NASDAQ: FRGI ), Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) ( CMG.B ) and Jack In The Box (NASDAQ: JACK ) over El Pollo.ANN (NYSE: ANN ): Cramer will be watching ANN to see the pulse of women's apparel.Hibbett Sporting (NASDAQ: HIBB ): Cramer will be listening to the conference call closely to take a judgement on Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ).Reviewing Honeywell International (NYSE: HON ) When a company's shares have run too much, it is advisable to either book profits, or not buy if one has missed it as it could mean a value trap.However, this rule applies to companies that have stopped re-inventing or have a saturated product cycle.For companies that are constantly innovating, it's not late to buy.Cramer believes that Honeywell is one such company.As he interviewed CEO Dave Cote last week, he realized how the company is innovating and has a futuristic product pipeline.He added that while similar companies are spinning off divisions to grow, Honeywell is more valuable as a combined unit as all the divisions depend on the software technology from each other.Honeywell has products coming out that did not even exist some years ago and hence the sales and earnings from these products are not anticipated, which makes the stock cheap when people are calling it expensive.Cramer said that no one likes rules when it comes to trading.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He did not like it either when he first started trading as he believed that rules stopped him from making more money by cutting his upside.</span>However, after being burned many times, he realized the importance of discipline when it comes to stocks.Cramer discussed the value of discipline in stock trading and said that he still gets worried when a stock in his charitable trust is going down while the market is going up.This is a sign that someone knows something he doesn't.He added that there are many things that can go wrong with a stock.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Many times, the management will make a press release look better than it actually is.</span>There are also scenarios when an investor owns too much stock and runs out of cash.Due to this, the stock cannot be bought on the way down and the investor decides to borrow money for buying the stock.Cramer said it is a terrible decision to finance your portfolio with borrowed money."Stocks aren't houses.You can't fall back and live in them if you have mortgages on them.They just get taken away," said Cramer."Discipline trumps conviction," said Cramer.He adds that investors should form a method when things go wrong.He himself ranks stocks based on how good they are and knows which ones to fall back on when the market is awry.He said that there will always be time when you will not know something others do, and other factors that are beyond acumen.There will always be events that one cannot foresee, and in those times, the discipline will get you through.Cramer has seen many times that investors are unprepared when a market corrects.They are all over stocks when the market is rising but unprepared when things go bad.Investors assume that a correction means something is wrong and a stock should not be touched.This is a big mistake that people make and corrections happen all the time after big runs.Another mistake he noted is that people stay fully invested all the time and are out of cash when there is an opportunity to buy in a correction.He added that having cash on hand is the key to protect a portfolio when things are going bad.There will be times when the market stinks and it's ok to sit on cash."In fact one of the chief reasons that I outperformed pretty much every manager in the business during my 14-year run as a professional money manager is that there were substantial blocks of time when I was largely in cash," said Cramer.Cramer said that cash is the most underrated investment of all.He starts selling on strength to build supply of cash and buys on weakness.Having cash in your portfolio will help during a correction as many buying opportunities will come.Hormel
