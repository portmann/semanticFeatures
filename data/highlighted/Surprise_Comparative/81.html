class='textDiv'>The Importance Of How To Invest, Not What To Invest | Seeking Alpha The Importance Of How To Invest, Not What To Invest The big difference between the HOW and the WHAT.Why you shouldn't always listen to guru advice.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am a fan of Tim Ferriss and his obsession with doing things better, smarter and more efficiently.</span>Reading through some old material related to The 4 Hour Chef, it is amazing to see examples of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.Shinji Takeuchi, a Japanese man who started swimming at the age of 37, is the #1 watched swimmer on YouTube and blows Michael Phelps and Ian Thorpe out of the water.But why?The theme throughout Ferriss' book is that ordinary people can excel beyond the pack and achieve phenomenal tasks by knowing how to train instead of what to train.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I found myself thinking how relevant this information is for people wanting to learn or get better at investing.</span>A lot of investing blogs, books, papers and other materials tell you what to learn, but not how to learn it.This simple concept can be the difference between struggling for years to break through a learning plateau and leaping through it with newfound confidence.As much as I admire Warren Buffett, the only difficulty that I have with his letters, speeches and books about him is that there is no real practical information on how to invest for the small investor.This goes for a lot of the value gurus.It is understandable because gurus have moved on to a different level and have different agendas.They don't have the luxury of writing weekly newsletters or blogs to explain every detail.This is why, when they do put out reports, books, paper, interviews, etc., it is all based on big ideas.There's nothing small and actionable enough for people like you and me to handle easily.To really improve your investing, you have to understand that Buffett was going to be successful no matter what happened.He was born with investing and businessman blood.Ask the most muscular guy in the gym how he works out and do the same routine.It won't work for you.The gym guy was born with great genes, while some people gain weight just drinking water, and others find it difficult to gain and maintain muscle unless they consume 4,000 calories a day.Same concept with the gurus.They may be gurus but they are cursed.They have the curse of knowledge.They forgot what it's like to be a beginner.I once listened to my vet talk for one hour about the structure of my dog's teeth and the surgery involved.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All I realized at the end was that my wallet was $1,000 skinnier.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Buffett is a great role model for analysts and investment managers, but not a relevant role model for retail investors who are trying to get to know more about their own stocks.</span>He was born to be an investor, as this timeline of his life shows.His words are gold, but it can confuse and mislead you unless you know exactly what context he is talking about.After he says something, there is still great debate about what he meant.You need to find the Shinji Takeuchis of the investing world because you will learn exactly how to invest through these people.If you've read my articles, you may have the wrong perception that I'm some smart numbers guy.That couldn't be further from the truth.I didn't study in the USA, and if I converted my academic score to a GPA, it is probably between 2.5-2.8.I would get thrown out the door if I applied for a job at an investment bank.I didn't thrive in my studies.The world is full of people smarter and better than me.Combine that with never having taken any finance, business, accounting or economics classes, and it's amazing to see how I got here.It just turns out that the educational system does not suit my style of learning.It was only after I figured this out, that things started to turn around because I found a method that worked for me.First, take a look at this familiar question from Quora .Here is the second top rated answer.(I skipped the first because it's by Burton Malkiel and is super long and difficult for beginners which also confirms what I'm posting about) Although the very first investing book I read was the Intelligent Investor, it was a horrible experience.I didn't understand anything, the text was extremely dry and there was no practical advice that I took from it.The only thing I remember is the concept of Mr. Market.Nothing else.I realized I needed to write notes to organize and clarify the jumble of information I had been reading.I started with my blog and publicly posted notes, articles and analyses for critique.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I got slammed and chewed in the beginning, but it helped with learning and growing a thicker skin.</span>The second vital part was realizing that investing is extremely tedious and redundant.Being an efficiency nut, I needed a way to simplify and speed up repetitive tasks.That's when I started making excel spreadsheet models.In the process of building financial models, I combed through books and technical papers to understand how a specific model worked.Figure out what your strength is and twist it in a way so that you can apply it to investing.Make investing relevant to your interests.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Just want to get better at writing investment analyses?</span>Find a stock analysis style that you like, break it up into manageable sections, find the information and fill up the sections.Think of your business as a public company instead of a small family business.Go through your accounting books and try to convert it to a full set of financial statements In no time, you'll be an expert in your industry and will be confident in analyzing and investing in such companies.Same thing applies to any day job.Don't just do it.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Think of yourself as the CEO and look at the bigger pictures.</span>Do You Handle the Money in Your Home?Personal finance is just like a business.Think of your household as a business.Go through your bank statements and try to create your household financial statements.Budgeting, projecting, allocating, depreciating is something you do everyday already.Why not think of it like managing a business?Create an easy investment game or just a simple stock portfolio spreadsheet Investing math is just simple addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.Create a simple glossary of the terms that you hear and use all the time from Investopedia.Keep it as a cheat sheet.This isn't school.It is encouraged.I recently hired a part time virtual assistant for $600 a month.A full-time assistant for $600 a month is a steal.My virtual assistant helps with research, performing tasks that eat up a lot of my time so that I can focus on analyzing stocks and building my own business.Convert Khan Academy YouTube videos to MP3 format and take it with you.By starting even something small and insignificant like selling on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), you will learn about an entire industry.Try to import something cheap and sell it on eBay.You'll learn what companies have to go through in the import/export business.Or just try to sell things around the home.Selling on eBay requires that you know how to position your product, market it, word it and make a successful sale.Shipping multiple items gives you insight into the shipping industry.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Starting your own business opens a can of worms and you will be a better investor for it.</span>Heck, you may know more about eBay than all the analysts once you've personally gone through the system and worked out the kinks.I don't know everything about your situation so it's difficult to try and come up with a recommendation for every scenario, but you get the point.No matter what your skills are, there is a way you can benefit from learning how to invest.And best of all, doing it your way will make it stick.Follow and learn from people who are like you, but managed to make the jump to elite status.These are the people who will understand your situation and can help you get to the next level.Gurus are not good role models for the layman.You know what you are good and bad at.Use it to your advantage and make it relevant to investing.Source: The Importance Of How To Invest, Not What To Invest Disclosure: The author has no
