(NYSE:ED) | Seeking Alpha Sometimes when we look at our portfolio and see a dividend aristocrat selling at an all-time high with a very low dividend yield, taking profits makes sense.Along with selling a dividend aristocrat, redeploying the cash right into another one that has had a recent sell-off but has a very high yield makes even more sense.There is nothing that I can say negative about Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ) aside from getting the new ticker symbol confused with the "Women's Basketball Association," but I would chalk that up to my brain cells working overtime.The truth is, WBA has done very well for my portfolios (all of them) and has reached all time high share pricing.First of all it never hurts to take a profit no matter what anyone might say.When the profit comes at a time when the stock has reached an all- time high , then I feel pretty good that it may be time for a pullback , for no other reason than because it reached an all-time high.By selling WBA in the Frothy Market Beginners Portfolio , I am booking very solid gains and am filling my cash register with lots of cash.Not for long, though because I will be buying another dividend aristocrat with the cash, which has been dipping in share price (interest rate hike fears) but has a wonderful current yield that will help my income, right this second.I am in no way shape or form suggesting that WBA is a stock to sell as this is strictly a portfolio management maneuver to increase my income immediately.WBA has a dividend current yield of just 1.60% and even though they have been increasing dividends at an aristocratic pace it will take quite some time to catch up to a current high yielder, which also happens to be a dividend aristocrat; Con Edison (NYSE: ED ).Utilities do move much like a bond; that is, as interest rates and yields rise in treasuries, utilities usually dip in price.I will not argue that point, but ED has already dropped by a rather significant amount and I believe the interest rate question has mostly been baked into the price.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As you can see, the drop in price has not affected the dividend yield or the aristocrat status, albeit at a slower rate of increases.</span>While the pricing trend over the long term has been up, the recent pullback from its 52 week high of $72.25 down to the current price reflects a drop of roughly 14%-15% for basically no other real reason (yes, it had a weak quarter just as every company has from time to time.It is called business) than the Fed toying with an interest rate hike.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With about a 40-year track record of increasing dividends, ED has faced increasing interest rates, (much higher than what is anticipated these days) and reduced interest rates (obviously not as low as they are now admittedly).</span>Along with the fact that the company is in the heart of the USA that uses an extraordinary amount of energy, the company is basically as solid as a rock.Consistent, reliable and steady.Boring can be another adjective applied.Of course I am using ED as a bond alternative, but it is an alternative that has increased dividends for 40 consecutive years!A current short ratio of over 6%, which could move the stock significantly IF the Fed decides to hold off raising rates, and with the ECB just now starting its own QE, money flows into US treasuries could keep a lid on our interest rates regardless.Selling my 200 shares of WBA at $83.11/share and buying 200 shares of ED at $60.50/share also gives me additional cash to use later to once again increase my income (I now have roughly $5,005 in cash reserves ready to be deployed!).Keep in mind what the goal is for this portfolio, and at least review my previous article for the basic details you may require to follow along.I have now been able to increase my annual income with this portfolio by roughly $1090 or right at 15%+ from the beginning of this strategy (I began with $7,008 in annual income and now have $8,097).It has not been three months and I have already reached my 2015 goal of increasing income with basic portfolio management.Many investors may look at me cock-eyed with this strategic move, but the portfolio does have healthcare with JNJ, and had no utilities at all.That does not make this perfect, but it does achieve a precise goal more income and a rather defensive stock), and there is still nine months left in 2015.If WBA happens to pull back over the course of the next few months, I may even add it back, if it makes sense!Disclaimer: The opinions of the author are not recommendations to buy or sell any stock.While the portfolio management approach works for the author, you may have different goals and this is NOT a suggestion to follow the author blindly without knowing why you are investing and what your goals are.Please do your own research prior to making any investment decision.Source: Retirement Strategy: Selling One Dividend Aristocrat And Buying Another Makes Sense When Reaching For Income Disclosure: The author is long ED, WBA.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
