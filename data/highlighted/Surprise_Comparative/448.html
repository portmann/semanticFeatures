class='textDiv'>Softbank: The Mobile Games Business Is Booming - SOFTBANK Corp.ADR (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) | Seeking Alpha The mobile games business is a long-term tailwind for Softbank.Softbank-owned Supercellâ€™s top grossing game, Clash of Clans, generated $49 million in revenue last month in the U.S. alone.I made it very clear last year that Softbank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ), not King Digital (NYSE: KING ), is the world s biggest player in the lucrative mobile games business.I reiterate my thesis that Softbank will do well if it keeps expanding its mobile games assets.Aside from King Digital, there is no other worthy rival to Softbank's subsidiaries, Supercell and GungHo Entertainment .It may not be possible for Mr. Son to buy a controlling stake in King Digital but I insist there are other game studios that are still worth buying.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Expanding in mobile games is easier done via mergers & acquisitions than by making new games.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The surging sales of cheap Android phones and tablets means more and more people are becoming potential buyers of in-app items inside mobile games.</span>As per Flurry's research, people spend a lot of time playing mobile games.The aggressive campaigns of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to increase their Direct Carrier Billing partners allows gamers in emerging countries to buy premium items for their games without the need for credit cards.High-income Americans and German citizens were found by Flurry to be the most prolific daily gamers on Android phones.Monetizing this penchant of people to spend a lot of time and money on mobile games is a great opportunity for Softbank.As per the App Annie data shared by the Wall Street Journal, there's a game made by a small studio that is raking in big money in daily sales.Among American gamers, Clash of Clans is the top-grossing app with $49 million in monthly sales.King's Candy Crush Saga was unseated by a game made by little known startup.Game of War: Fire Age is No. 2 with $20 million in monthly revenue from U.S. customers.Game of War is made by a privately-held game studio called Machine Zone, a startup established only in 2008.If Softbank was able to afford to pay $1.5 billion to buy a 51% controlling stake in Supercell in 2013, acquiring Machine Zone will not be impossible for Mr. Son.ThinkGaming's daily tracking supports the data of App Annie.Softbank-owned Clash of Clans and Boom Beach games are among the top-grossing games among iPhone gamers in the U.S. Game of War: Fire Age makes an average daily sales of $1.16 million just from American iPhone gamers.This is a game that ought to be added to Softbank's catalog.A free-to-play game is a great product when it gains a large enough number of devoted players.Supercell sells virtual items that require no production or manufacturing expenses to produce.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The iPhone version of Clash of Clans boasts more than 5.36 million daily active gamers.</span>The addictive nature of mobile strategy games appeals to competitive players.Unfortunately, Supercell made it impossible to enjoy Clash of Clans' later stages without gamers spending much money.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I already spent more than $200 in just one Clash of Clans account.</span>Upgrading defenses, heroes, troops and spells in Clash of Clans takes a lot of time and money.Busy professionals who cannot play daily have no choice but to buy gems from Supercell.A maxed-out base in Clash of Clans will cost around $12,000 if a player opts to use the power of their wallets (instead of free playing the game daily for 8-16 hours) to get to the top.Supercell's revenue (including other games) from U.S. customers is already $62 million per month.If we conservatively double that to include non-U.S. sales, $124 million per month is impressive.The mobile games business is a high-margin, high-growth sector that Softbank is greatly benefiting from.Son's investment in Supercell and GungHo were genius moves that echo his early bet in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ).My ideal future scenario is for Softbank to buy King Digital.However, owning the No.2 mobile game from Machine Zone can already help service Softbank's $90 billion debt.The possibility of adding $20 million per month from Game of War: Fire Age is still highly desirable.Doubling the U.S. numbers of App Annie's U.S. estimates to include global sales produces Supercell: $124 million x 12 = $1.49 billion If we add GungHo Entertainment's estimated $1.2 billion 2014 revenue, I estimate that the mobile games division of Softbank generates enough sales that can help the company gradually reduce its debt.The mobile games industry, unlike the wireless telecom business of Sprint, is a high-growth opportunity.Taking Supercell or GungHo public will likely be another golden bonanza for Softbank.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Newzoo estimates that mobile games will be bigger than console gaming.</span>Newzoo's prediction is that mobile games will post around $30.3 billion this year, while console games will only do $26.4 billion.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Smartphone and tablet gaming is estimated to be worth more than $40 billion in 2017- a boom-time opportunity that Softbank should continue exploiting.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on
