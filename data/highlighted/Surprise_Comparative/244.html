on the back foot after Friday's strong U.S. jobs data stoked concerns that the Fed could raise interest rates as soon as June.In Asia, Japan GDP revisions also hurt sentiment, following a new report that estimated the economy grew an annualized 1.5% in the October-December period, down from an initial reading of 2.2% in February.German export figures similarly kept markets subdued, after January's seasonally-adjusted exports posted their biggest drop in five months.Looking to stimulate the eurozone economy and avert the threat of deflation, the ECB began its �60B per month QE program today by buying German government bonds, Bloomberg reports quoting two traders in government debt.While European equities slipped, eurozone yields held steady, and the euro added 0.6% to $1.0903 to regain some ground after its slide to an 11-year low last week.Congress will be in no hurry to raise the federal government's borrowing limit, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, but will act in time to avoid Washington defaulting on its debt.The government is expected to use up its borrowing authority around March 15, but it can take emergency steps to continue paying its bills.The extraordinary measures will likely exhaust sometime in October or November.Another standoff is looming between Greece and its European lenders before today's gathering of the Eurogroup in Brussels, after Jeroen Dijsselbloem called the list of measures Greece sent to eurozone's finance ministers last Friday "far from complete."Greece�s anti-austerity government, elected in January on a promise to renegotiate the terms of its �240B bailout, is rushing to present detailed proposals to European creditors as it risks running out of cash as soon as this month.General

will cut jobs in China as it continues to grapple with slow sales in the world's biggest car market.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) declined to specify how many jobs would be cut, but China's Economic Observer reported earlier that the automaker would eliminate 30% of its Chinese staff, or about 180 of its 600 employees.According to a Reuters report last month, Tesla only sold 120 cars in China during January.Documents released by a Brazilian court have now outlined the alleged use of Swiss bank accounts for the payment of bribes in the ever-widening Petrobras (NYSE: PBR ) scandal.The news comes as Brazil's Supreme Court signed off on investigating 54 politicians last Friday, and an increasing amount of probes and raids into corrupt banking practices in Switzerland.PBR shares dropped over 10% last week as Brazil's largest graft case expanded.Pressed by the tanking price of crude oil and having cut its 2015 capex in half, Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL ) is now for sale, WSJ reports.The $5.8B company just closed on its $3.8B acquisition of Kodiak Oil and Gas in December but is now entering its own auction process, sources say, although there are no clear suitors on the horizon.Whiting considered a sale in 2012 but backed off without finding its asking price.WLL +7.2% premarket.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Despite all thirty-one global banks passing the first round of the

losers: Citizens (NYSE: RBS ), HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ) and Santander (NYSE: SAN ).The U.K. government has taken advantage of Lloyds' (NYSE: LYG ) recent jump in share price to sell a further 1% stake (�500M of shares) in the lender, FT reports.The government now owns 22.9% of Lloyds, down from a peak of 40% in 2009, when it bailed out the bank during the financial crisis.Lloyds also announced a significant milestone in its recovery last month, saying it would resume dividend payments for the first time since the crisis.Just weeks after the group announced a 10% drop in annual earnings and just days after iron ore tumbled to a six-year low, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO ) is bracing itself for one of its biggest internal restructurings since Sam Walsh took the helm at the mining group two years

engineers to build a version of the Android operating system to power virtual-reality applications," sources told the WSJ."Tens of engineers" are said to be working on the project, which was launched
