finally, they are getting what they have craved for.Consumer inflation was at 5.11% for January 2015, slightly increasing from 5% in December 2014 and well below the RBI's medium-term target of 6%.Moderating inflation raises the hope for another interest rate cut in the next monetary policy in April, after surprising interest rate cuts in January and this month .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Low interest rates increase consumer spending that improves industrial growth, resulting in more loan production for banks.</span>While it takes some time to reach an interest rate level that will kick start loan production, recent interest rate cuts are an entry point to a gradual decline in interest rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, there are risks to more interest rate cuts.</span>The significant decline in inflation that caused interest rate cuts is not due to the efforts of new government eliminating too many parties involved (intermediaries) in the supply chain.Rather, it is due to the sharp decline in oil prices that has led to the decline in inflation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If the oil prices rise, then the hopes of more interest rate cuts will go in vain.</span>How the new government manages the demand and supply of food items ahead of southwest monsoon is another critical factor that can change the inflation outlook in the near future.Disciplined management is the real recipe behind the consistent growth results of HDFC Bank.Management has tactically changed its focus towards corporate loans to keep the earnings growth steady.Moderating inflation strengthens the case for improvement in loan growth rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I expect much better days ahead for HDFC Bank if interest rates continue to decline.</span>Source: HDFC Bank: A Bank One Cannot Avoid Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
