class='textDiv'>Sony Hopes To Turn 'R' Rating Into Positive At Box Office This Weekend With 'Chappie' - Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE) | Seeking Alpha Sony’s ‘Chappie’ hits theaters a week after fellow “R�?rated drama ‘Focus’ won the box office with a under-performing total.As with ‘Focus,’ ‘Chappie’ is expected to win the box office but not score the same totals the film’s director has earned with his previous two films.Sony’s slate is more backloaded in 2015 with its major tentpoles slated for the fall, but has a few reliable features to bridge the gap.For every Kingsman: The Secret Service there's a Focus and that's a lesson that Hollywood is well aware of and yet constantly seems to have to re-learn.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The truth is an "R" rating doesn't draw to the same level as a "PG-13" rating and if you want to make money, you make a tamer film, but if you want to be more creative (and potentially shoot for an Oscar), then generally you can go as off the rails as you want.</span>It's a fine line and it all depends on your goals.Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) Chappie isn't likely Oscar bound, but it is rated "R" and expected to test the box office waters one week after Warner Brothers Focus got knocked around by rough tides.Let's start with Sony as Chappie is still expected top the charts in the mid-teens to possibly low twenties.The $49 million production is not going to appeal to all audiences but investors shouldn't be shocked given the source.Neill Blomkamp has been a Sony fixture since his debut film in 2009, the Oscar nominated District 9.He followed that success up with Elysium in 2013 which was similar in tone but different in price.Both were hard "R" rated.District 9 was a sci-fi actioner made for $30 million while Elysium was a sci-fi actioner made for $120 million.District 9 netted out domestically with $115 million after a $37 million opening while Elysium hit $93 million after a $29 million opening.Both films hauled in over $200 million when counting international receipts.Chappie likely won't have the same luck, especially given its March release date as District 9 and Elysium both opened around the same time in late summer.Despite the presence of stars Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman, the film about a deadly robot reprogrammed for good will probably top out around $17 million to $19 million.Like Focus which was also made for roughly the same total, it would be a solid but not spectacular debut.Sony has already got off the year to a good start with The Wedding Ringer comedy pulling in $63 million off a scant $23 million budget.The Kevin Hart/Josh Gad film was slightly sabotaged by the wildly unexpected debut of American Sniper which got off to a record breaking debut.Still Ringer served its purpose and was a nice table-setter for the studio which will next release Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 in April.The light action comedy is the sequel to Kevin James' shockingly strong family film that earned $146 million in 2009 (off a $26 million budget).The studio then goes right into its summer slate with Cameron Crowe's Aloha fronted by Sniper's Bradley Cooper and Birdman's Emma Stone before giving way to the animated comedy Pixels which features a voice cast including Adam Sandler as well as both James and Gad.It's a nice trio to have on their roster.Although remember that Sony is heavily backloaded this year with investors clearly in it for the long haul as they know the pipeline includes something for everyone including family fare like Hotel Transylvania 2, the adaptation of the tweeny Goosebumps series, Oscar bait Concussion (with Will Smith) and of course Spectre, the next film in the James Bond franchise.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Chappie, like Focus is just one piece of a much larger puzzle and shouldn't have too much of an impact on Sony's bottom line, but that doesn't mean investors still wouldn't have preferred it come in close to Blomkamp's past films.</span>Yet a film that at the very least will break even and earn a box office win is still a big deal and an accomplishment.Source: Sony Hopes To Turn 'R' Rating Into Positive At Box Office This Weekend With 'Chappie'
