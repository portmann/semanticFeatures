that would put McKinsey�s clients in position to �tax� the existence of everyone in that emerging continent.It�s my guess that the Supreme Court will, once again, rule in favor of ObamaCare.That�s because the Supreme Court, both left and right, is very much a pro-corporatist court and ObamaCare is very much a pro-corporatist law.Oh sure, providing federal subsidies to purchase health insurance greatly benefits poor and low-wage working class families, but above all else, these generous subsidies greatly benefit the corporate healthcare industry.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ever since the passage of ObamaCare, there is no other good reason to explain why the healthcare sector has been, by far, the bigger gainer on Wall Street.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is NOT because ObamaCare has mandated that more free-market principles be introduced into the business of providing healthcare.</span>No, not at all.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It�s because ObamaCare has mandated that more corporate welfare be given away to the healthcare industry, both provider and payer alike.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Thanks to ObamaCare, the healthcare industry has now surpassed the defense industry as the bigger beneficiary of the corporate welfare state.</span>I suspect you�ll hear the term �medical-industrial complex� being thrown around more often to describe our healthcare industry.But unfortunately, we don�t have anything equivalent to the antiwar community to vocally oppose these corporate giveaways.And because ObamaCare does absolutely nothing to reduce overall healthcare costs, it is also harming our competitiveness in the global economy.However, labor unions won�t complain about this as long as they continue to receive generous healthcare benefits.And industry leaders outside of healthcare won�t complain about this either as long as the �employer mandate� remains on hold.This leaves the largest bulk of ObamaCare now being paid for by the taxpayer, who�s spread too thin to have a meaningful voice against ObamaCare.Healthcare costs are being shifted in a very seismic way onto the taxpayer, but no one speaks out about this because the taxpayer doesn�t fall under any particular interest or lobbying group.Perhaps if taxpayers would see themselves as a special interest group to lobby against ObamaCare, we will finally see an end to this budget-busting, job-killing corporatist law!Because ObamaCare does absolutely nothing to reduce overall healthcare costs, it is also harming our competitiveness in the global economy.You bet.Medicare and Medicaid, often reckoned to constitute half the market, impose their own low prices.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Health insurers accordingly pay higher prices, and uninsured individuals charged the �rack rate� may pay ten times the Medicare price.</span>Government-mandated price discrimination isn�t working.Medicare and Medicaid customers shop for health care based on [limited] availability, not price.For all other participants, prices are opaque, so competition is a joke.Yet it�s almost impossible to find any explicit discussion of this fundamental policy choice in official studies.When it comes to cost control, the official sector earnestly focuses on treating the patient�s inflamed hangnail (primarily through criminal prosecutions of physicians and labs who overbill Medicare), while studiously ignoring the broken bone protruding through the skin (opaque pricing).<span style='background-color:

“medical-industrial complex�?being thrown around more often to describe our healthcare industry.But unfortunately, we don’t have anything equivalent to the antiwar community to vocally oppose these corporate giveaways.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Have long believed the BIGGEST and most under-reported error made by non-elites who supported Obamacare is not realizing that giving trillions of tax dollars to the medical-industry complex, it�s power to make future changes to Obamacare will be so greatly increased as to make any improvement totally impossible and what will actually happen is that it will be made vastly worse over time, thanks to greatly increased political power of the medical-industry complex derived from all those tax payer subsidies.</span>Agree.Roberts will probably do the same thing as last time (on the government enforced and taxation paid for mandate for putting humans, rather than fish, in the corporate carnival � hey look what good aim I�ve got � shooting for profits barrel) and break a tie that lets everyone else stick to image.Yes, and will also �change� his position at the last minute from gutting Obamacare to supporting it, for appearance sake?Anytime there�s a serious problem that no one in power really wants to do anything about, the solution is usually to send it off to committees until everyone forgets about it.Amazing to me that people still buy that tripe.On that topic, I saw a bumper sticker yesterday with the face of W. on it and the words �I screwed everyone and blamed it on the black man�.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I would have said before then that it�s offensive for the powers that be to consider the American public to be so thoroughly stupid that they buy such obvious sleight of hand,  but I guess they�re more less right.</span>A lot of people really are that stupid.And God shoots himself while cleaning gun?Well that�s a good thing.Obviously there is a selective pressure against stupid entities(?)owning firearms.With any luck enough will remove themselves that the collective intelligence of the deity demographic raises enough for them to easily

State Department in December, nearly two years after leaving office.But she said she had deleted nearly 32,000 others.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/us/hillary-clinton-email.html The NSA has got to have all 65,000+ emails.All we need to do is put in a FOIA request and problem solved.As Jeremy Scahill�s twitter feed showed of ex-CIA comment to WAPO, if they were in her email, no telling who else has them, and countless prospective security breaches.This is impossible to fathom.Even low-level hospital interns and admins working with hospital medical records have high security on HIPAA controls and the mindfulness that goes with it.Time to stop blaming Wikileaks on Julianne Assange and let Chelsea Manning out!?!(although there is no point in thinking Clinton was the only beltway-bot unsecured�.more likely the same is true for whole of US Senate, Congress, staffers, etc.) Every Tom, Dick & Harry from Beijing to Buenos Ares no doubt has copies of all unsecured emails out of DC from the past.and also about John Kerry� does he have control over Victoria Nuland or not?Why do we even have a �Secretary of State�?Reminds me of the inflatable tanks of Patton�s Ghost Army in southeastern England during the weeks surrounding D-Day in 1944.It�s hard to believe this woman is seriously running for President (although she won�t mind if the job is just handed to her).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I�m increasingly convinced that her real role is simply to block more progressive Democratic alternatives.</span>That valuable service is ample reason for the money boyz to give her lots of support.We give this divinity, the puppet masters, too much credit for imagination.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>They have noticed that a Democrat in the White House works very very well with a Republicn majority in the legislative branches (one or two of them have even connected the dots with the name, Clinton) and they want more of the same.</span>So that�s what the people will choose.I suggest it�s the puppets in the consent-industrial complex who go about imagining *for* dull elites that one ought not underestimate.Around this time in the 2008 cycle, how many people though Barack Obama was serious contender for the Democratic nomination?Heck a lot of people probably hadn’t even heard of him, let alone considered him a viable candidate.The standard narrative was that Hillary Clinton had the nomination locked up and everyone else should basically get out of the way, or at least not waste their time running.Low and behold, here we are in 2015 and we’re hearing the same thing: Clinton has the nomination virtually locked up.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In some ways,  Hillary Clinton is worse off this time—of the mistakes she made in 2007 or 2008, I can’t recall anything close to the recent revelations about her use of private email—than she was last time.</span>Will this email scandal destroy Hillary Clinton’s presidential prospects?Not necessarily.However, I seriously question whether she has learned from her past mistakes.If she continues to approach a presidential bid with this much hubris, it will be game over much sooner than 2008.Two news stories featured Blackstone, the giant private equity underwriter (PEU) founded by Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson.The first involved a Blackstone Senior Managing

suspended fighting mainly in order to get the IMF loan package.Its rada parliament is still set on making war.Christine Lagarde said last month that the IMF does not lend to countries at war.Its articles of agreement also prevent it from lending to countries that can’t pay and have no foreseeable way of paying.So if the IMF does lend to Kiev, it is breaking radically from its two rules.This gives future Ukrainian governments the right to claim that the loan is illegitimate and reject it.2.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The previous loan proved to be a drop in the ocean of Ukrainian economic collapse � will the discussed tranche have a bigger impact?</span>The money apparently will be used mainly to pay existing creditors and bondholders.This will provide a quick gain for speculators who gambled that Ukraine would get the money.3.Speaking of the previous loan � do you think Kiev could�ve managed the money better?Well, the managers are basically the kleptocrats.They managed the money by giving it to themselves – and taking the money and running.IMF staff members protested two years ago, at the 2013 meetings, that IMF forecast of the ability to pay were pure fantasy.The forecasts of how much austerity will help have been way, way too optimistic.By making a loan to Ukraine, the IMF is further destroying its credibility when it comes to forecasting the result of its loans.4.Is there a danger of Ukraine repeating the financial fate of Greece?Yes, in two ways.First of all, the IMF and Eurozone use debt leverage as a means of forcing privatization sell-offs.This is where negotiations have broken down with Greece.Seeing that Ukraine has no visible way of creating a foreign-exchange surplus to pay the euro-denominated debt it owes, there is only one way to pay: to sell off its farmland, its public infrastructure and real estate to U.S. and European buyers.Ukraine�s Finance Minister Natalia Yaresko said on Wednesday Ukraine expects the first tranche of aid from the International Monetary Fund to amount to $5 billion, news agency Interfax Ukraine reported.The Washington-based fund announced a preliminary agreement for the new four-year loan program last month.Its board is widely expected to approve the package when it meets on Wednesday.http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-ukraine-crisis-imf-idUSKBN0M71D620150311 �Christine

prudence, and that it�s pouring good money after bad, down a black hole (Martin Sieff).It�s an obvious extortionist setup for looting the country, straight out of Perkins� �Confessions of an Economic Hit Man� and Klein�s �Shock Dotrine�.The IMF�s goal is not financial stability; it is a tool for the neoliberal kleptocracy.Reading your comment, I thought, gee, this sounds like Greece, then sure enough I got to #4.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It would seem that Greece has a sound basis for repudiating the similarly fraudulent bailout of 2012, but are apparently unable to do so and

Greece are being treated really is an elephant in the room.I suppose the fundamental difference is the involvement of the US with Ukraine but not Greece.They are both, yet another way, for an

commanded so much as a battalion in action.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And their nuclear force posture is purely (and inadequately) built on sufficiency (just enough to deter attack and nothing more).</span>Things like ecological degradation, lack of raw materials, and water and soil problems aren�t even addressed.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is another moronic scare article that too many people who should know better take seriously and quote as if it had any relevance to reality.</span>Pathetic.They pale compared to the Teutons, Mongols and Visigoths as far as

just manufactured to protect their oil interests in the South China Sea, but that�s like swatting mosquitoes.I keep thinking about how vulnerable the invulnerable are.NATO is a joke because it has no oil.So no NATO troops can be guaranteed a back-up by all the military stuff necessary to hold ground � and newsflash � war is still about holding ground.War is not about ICBM mass devastation.That�s counterproductive.Funny, all this silliness.In DeLong�s link, isn�t microfoundation-based macroeconomics, guilty of the very thing he�s accusing hyper-rationality based macroeconomics of?DeLong might reject hyper-rationality based models, but then if you aggregate all of the flaws in the type of modelling he appears to advocate there, you get pretty much the same type of poor modelling, no?I don�t see how microfoundation-based macroeconomics can ever be a good idea � you need to start from the top-down, modelling the macroeconomy (particularly the monetary system) first; you have definite rules for how that works (much of it is basic accounting, ala sectoral balances and such, which all other models pretty much must follow).Heterodox economists try and deal with reality as DeLong is trying to get at and this can be hard to model.Varoufakis is in this group.They consist of pure �describers� and those who try and create a model based more on social connectedness rather than the individual actor.Despite the well-known theoretical differences between Marx, Veblen, and Keynes, there is a common theme that unites these �worldly philosophers� and that sharply distinguishes heterodox economics from orthodox economics.They offer causal explanations of the social provisioning process�� (Tae-Hee Jo �Social Provisioning Process and Socio-Economic Modeling�, editied by Fred Lee) um�.yet again, this is just a political conversation in disguise...this description of heterodox/orthodox in economics is how i have always understood left/right in politics� am i wrong?the exeption (annoyingly) being the austrians� also heterodox� though no social provision thingy� I would say political conversation is the point.As has been mentioned, Syriza seems to be an example of �true� social democrats that we haven�t seen in awhile with most parties buying into the neoliberal concepts.Social provisioning is quite different from rugged capitalism and takes a different mindset.I suggest that �orthodox� economics strives to adjust the world to behave in accordance with its tenets (orthodoxy, in the sense of normativity), whereas heterodox economics, in not doing so, is forced to describe the world as it is.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You could also think of it as theology on an average day vs. life science on one of its better days.</span>Not sure if it�s the

mention that after seeing Yves lament that the quality of discourse may have gone a little southwards lately, I must admit I may be one who has played a part in lowering the standards by commenting on things that I have only a marginal understanding of, and I apologise for that.I have always been amazed at the high level of intelligence evident in the articles here and amongst the commentariat, and I may have waded in out of my depth on occasion.To do my part to maintain the high standards expected at NC, I pledge that from here on out I will not use unnecessary profanity in any of my posts and
