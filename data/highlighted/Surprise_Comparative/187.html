(OTCMKTS:TCCLF) | Seeking Alpha TCLC reported February shipments growth of +18% y/y.TCL Communications ( OTC:TCCLF ) reported February shipments of 4.43m units, representing a 18% y/y increase.Smart devices once again saw decelerating shipments with +59% y/y to 2.7m units, representing 62% of the total mix.China shipments pulled back to 10% of overall shipments with only 456k units due to the impact of Chinese New Year.For TCLC investors, decelerating smart device growth should be seen as the "new normal" as this segment matures.Additionally, China shipments are likely to bounce back from the CNY lows to account for roughly 20% of the overall shipments in March.After a recent trip to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress, I came away cautious on TCLC's growth.On the one side, I believe the company's recent product launch with the IDOL 3 smartwatch and wearable will allow the company to be part of the smart device trend where a typical user will have multiple connected devices on them wherever they go (i.e., smartphone, smartwatch, tablets).Alternatively, the company's growing reliance on the competitive Chinese market is the very opposite growth strategy that the company should pursue.While I have been traditionally bullish on TCLC's growth prospects given its ex-China exposure and its compelling offering in developed markets versus those of the Korean OEMs, my view is turning increasingly cautious.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As China becomes a bigger contributor of TCLC's overall revenue, the company could see further margin pressure given the competitive dynamic of the market.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ultimately, revenue growth will be challenged as more competitive players enter the market.</span>I recently attended the Mobile World Congress at Barcelona and visited TCLC's booth.A number of new products appear to be somewhat interesting with the IDOL3 devices, which features a 4.7" and a 5.5" display and unique front-facing JBL and Clari-Fi speakers.The smooth user interface, coupled with dual microphone seems to be useful to consumers, while the Android smartwatch appears to have a compelling value proposition compared with that of Huawei or Moto360.Unlike Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch that may require daily charging, the TCLC smartwatch has a 2-5 day battery cycle and is both water- and dust-resistant, a useful trait in my view.I have always argued that TCLC should focus on the more profitable North American market rather than the competitive Chinese market where OEMs compete on razor-thin margins.TCLC's device plays into the recent trend in North America where subscale carriers are aggressively offering both affordable wireless and hardware products to compete against the incumbents such as AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ).Worth noting that TCLC has been aggressively promoted by T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) as part of its smartphone upgrade plan and we could see other carriers such as Sprint (NYSE: S ) joining the mix.As such, North America, rather than China, should be the focused market for TCLC.Cautious on TCLC.Within China's smartphone space, my preference is Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.</span>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Source: TCL Communication February Shipments: Cautious Going Forward Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
