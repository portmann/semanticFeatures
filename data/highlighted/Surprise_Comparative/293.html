class='textDiv'>The Real Tax Rates of the Rich - The Wealth Report - WSJ That fact that America�s tax code is progressive�i.e., the wealthy pay more�has been largely a given since the first income-tax was levied in 1862.Yet the Buffett Rule and the ensuing debate over Mitt Romney�s  taxes has painted a picture of America�s tax structure as regressive.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Polls show that many Americans think the wealthy now pay a lower share than the rest of America.</span>While this may be true for a small number of rich people, it is broadly inaccurate.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to the most recent data from the IRS, America�s tax code remains progressive all the way up the income ladder�until you get to a tiny sliver of Americans who earn more than $10 million a year (there are about 8,000 of those out of 104 million filers).</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What�s more, the wealthiest earners are paying a higher tax rate than they did in 2008.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Consider the following chart, which shows adjusted gross incomes and average tax rates, i.e., total income tax as a percentage of adjusted gross income less deficit: We all know that the one percent (those making around $340,000 a year) as a group pay a higher rate than any other income group.</span>Yet the new IRS data show that even the $1 million-plus earners (the top fraction of the one percent) pays the highest rate.It�s only when you get to somewhere between the $10 million-plus earners and the �Fortunate 400?the 400 highest earners�that the tax rates paid start to dip.And when they dip, they still dip to levels far above the average rates paid by 90% of Americans.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Fortunate 400 paid a rate of more than 18% in the latest period.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This isn�t to argue against higher taxes on the wealthy.</span>Nor does it deny that some rich people reduce their taxes to well below the official rates through tax avoidance schemes and capital gains.Yet the charts do support the previous findings that a growing number of today�s wealthy make their money from salaries rather than capital gains.And those top earners as a group still pay the highest rates in the country.We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.Please

along with your website.If Your Not RICH Or Even On The High Side Of What's Left Of The Middle Class Why Are You Fighting So Hard For Somebody Else TAX CUTS & LOOPHOLES???<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Top 0.1% Pay Less Then The Top10% The More You Make the More You Should Have To Pay A % Of The Group Belo You.</span>TAXES Can Be To High Like They Were In The 50's At 90+% But Since Reagan Got Them Below 50% They've Hurt More Than They Could Ever Help.But Even He Knew He Went To Far From% Down to 28% & Back Up Around 50%.The Right Like To Use Kennedys Tax Cut Speech FYI It Was Still Around 90% When LBJ Followed Through To Around 70% But Was Raised Back Up To Nearly 80% Because Of The Vietnam War .That Points Out Another History Breaking Thing About This Current Dept BUSH Jr Took A Surplus & Gave Nearly 2Trillion In TAX CUTS Manly To The SUPER RICH & Then Put To WARS On The CHINA Credit Card.The First Time In US History TAXES Didn't Go Up In Time Of War.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But Even Worse They Were Cut.</span>Learn Fro History the Last Time TAXES Were This Low Was Leading Up & During The GREATE DEPRESSION & Didn't Recover Until TAXES Were Raised.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As An INDEPENDENT I Hear The RIGHT Complain About The LEFT TAX & SPENDs When The Right CUTS TAXES (Manly On The RICH) & Spends (Manly On The Military) During BUSH Jr Had Some Of The Worse Job Creation & Probably Even Worse Since He Deserved The First Year Or So Of Job Losses Under Obama.</span>But Had He Not Created Public Jobs By The Gov (Manly Military & Law Enforcement Homeland Security Border Patrol Police National Guard Along With Some Firefighters & Teachers) He Would Have A Net Loss In Job Creation.Under Obama It's Ben The Exact Opposite, For The First Time In History Under Either Party In Charge.During A Recession Recovery Public Jobs Have Not Gone Up.Because Of The (2010+GOP) Have Not Only Stopped All Job Creating Fixing/Building (Infrastructure Dams Bridges & Roads) They Have Actually Ben Cutting Public Jobs (Firefighters Teachers & Police) Which Hurts Unemployment The Private Sector & The Country's Economy Overall Just For Some Possible Political Points.(((Patriotic))))???They Also Closed The Gov Causing INTEREST RATES TO GO UP.Making The Dept The Help Create During The First Years Of The 21st Century.They Also Continued To Collect Their BLOATED Paycheck $175,000+ They Tell Tax Payers To Pay Them Regardless Of their Job Performance (13%) While Other Working Family Effected Directly Or Indirectly Had To Go Without Their Paychecks.("BUT THIS WAS OK BECAUSE PPL WOULD BE REIMBURSED & JUST USE THEIR SAVINGS") Just Another Problem Of Out Of Touch Congress Not Their To Serve The PPL & COUNTRY But A Place To Go After A Career Of Making A lot Of Money To Help Fiends Family & Specially Donors With Hope Of Making Even More When They Get Out.THE RESULT: Of Not Voting Based On Your Own

higher than our place Australia .</span>The rics must be paid more taxes or they should donate some of their wealths to the poor's I assume this is federal taxes only.Once you include state and local taxes, the percentage the highest earners pays drops.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I agree with other commenters that those percentages of what people making over a million make is a drop in the bucket to them while even the lower percentage on the middle class in poor still really hurts them in many cases.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's also important to note that while the rich are paying a rate of 25% at the top, this is still lower than in many progressive countries, and still lower than they paid in the 50's and 60's in America when we were most productive and prosperous as a nation.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The fact that largest *amounts* of taxes collected is from their group is no surprise, since they are increasingly taking larger and larger chunks of the income in America.</span>The Wealth Report is a daily blog focused on the culture and economy of the wealthy.It is written by Robert Frank, a senior writer for the Wall
