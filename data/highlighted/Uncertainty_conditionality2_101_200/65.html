(NYSE:AUY) | Seeking Alpha Yamana's all-in sustaining cash costs are declining due to its high-quality assets that are delivering higher grades.Yamana's silver and gold production will rise at a steady pace going forward as the second graph shows, driven by key assets such as Chapada, El Penon, Gualcamayo, Mercedes, etc.Driven by higher grades and a drop in all-in sustaining costs, Yamana's gross margin will continue improving.Although gold miner Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY ) has declined 18% on the stock market this year, there is no doubt that the company is progressing in the right direction as far as its operational performance is concerned.For example, Yamana was able to increase its production by 17% in the previous fiscal year and reduce its cost by 5%.A look at the following chart will make it clear that Yamana is constantly focused on reducing its all-in sustaining costs, a move that will allow it to increase its margin performance in the future.In fact, Yamana's actual all-in sustaining cash cost of $807 per ounce was well below its expected range of $825 to $875 per ounce of gold equivalent.Production and cost outlook: A graphical overview Now, it is clear that Yamana has improved its cost structure.The company is now focused on improving its production metrics.The chart below illustrates Yamana's production guidance for 2016 and 2017.Its gold production is estimated to increase 5% each in 2016 and 2017, while silver production is forecasted to increase 17% from 2015 to 2017.In addition, Yamana is focused on keeping its all-in sustaining costs in the low $800s, a feat that it managed to achieve in the second half of the previous year.As a result, the company is primed to benefit from an increase in gold and silver pricing going forward.According to a report by The Bullion Desk : The metal could fall as low as $1,170 per ounce, Norman added, and climb to a high of $1,450, up significantly from the current level of around $1,260.In other metals, Norman believes that silver will average $18.56 per ounce, favoring the metal that was the worst performer from the precious metals complex in 2014.Silver will hit a high of $21.75 and a low of $14.50, with the metal currently trading around one month highs at $17 per ounce."Gold price averaged $1,267 per ounce last year, enabling Yamana to improve its financial performance toward the end of the year as shown in the chart below.Now, since the company has a number of low-cost assets such as Chapada, El Penon, Gualcamayo, Mercedes, Minera Florida, and Jacobina in its portfolio, it will be able to improve its financial performance further this year as the gold price increases.Together, these assets delivered 3% extra production last fiscal year, with all-in sustaining costs of $747 per gold equivalent ounce.As a result, Yamana will be able to use the low-cost production from these assets to its advantage in an improving gold price environment.Furthermore, Yamana's Cerro Morro project in Argentina can act as another important growth driver due to its even lower all-in sustaining costs and higher grades.The company expects this project to deliver 135,000 ounces of gold and 67 million ounces of silver in its first three years of operation.The interesting thing to note here is that this project will incur all-in sustaining costs of only $557 per ounce of gold and $7.80 per ounce of silver.As a result, Yamana will be able to improve its margins further.There are a number of tailwinds that can drive Yamana's performance going forward as we saw above.However, investors should also keep an eye on the company's weak balance sheet, which carries a debt of just over $2 billion and a cash position of just $264 million.Also, its current ratio of 1.07 tells us that Yamana's short-term liquidity is weak.But then, Yamana's cash flow is impressive.The company has generated $518 million in operating cash flow in the last twelve months.Thus, it seems to have enough resources to invest in key assets.Finally, Yamana's earnings are estimated to grow at a CAGR of 11.55% over the next five years, and this can improve further as Cerro Morro comes into operation.Hence, considering the expected improvement in gold pricing, Yamana's decreasing costs, and the prospects at Cerro Morro, it looks like a good investment going forward.Source: Why Yamana Gold Can Deliver Upside, In 3 Charts Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
