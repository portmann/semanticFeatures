field.The recreational marijuana sector is a minefield of dubious plays.Dichotomy between attitude of the federal government and that of individual states is a negative.Cancer pain relief could be the biggest revenue potential for cannabinoids.As I outlined in my article in December, UK-based GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: GWPH ) has been a good play for the investor in the cannabis sector.I gave details of their drug pipeline in that article, but since then they have produced financial results that beat the expectations of analysts and their share price in February benefited accordingly.One thing that GWP does have is access to funds, with cash and equivalents totaling US$243.9 million so it should not run out of cash or need to dilute its shares in the short-to-medium term.By the nature of developing pharmaceutical companies, GWP is running at a loss as it seeks to bring new products to market, but with at least a credible CorpusPath towards profitability and with Q4 revenues up 65% on the same period of 2013, albeit from a low base.Crucial in 2015 will be the results of its Sativex trials for the relief of cancer pain: the first of these in 2014 was a bit disappointing but two more trials are due to report during 2015.Trials continue on its Epidiolex drug mainly targeted at epilepsy, especially for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and for which they are also trialing a new drug, GWP 42006, using a different cannabinoid.Interesting and promising details of this were given by CEO Justin Gover at the Q1 2015 results conference call .Other diseases targeted by GWP include schizophrenia, brain cancer and diabetes.Sativex is already being sold in Europe and many countries in the world as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.To my mind, one major advantage that GWP has is its distance away from the U.S. Federal Government, though long-term for a drug to be successful worldwide it helps a great deal if it has FDA approval.Sativex does however have approval in many countries worldwide.The use of cannabinoids for the treatment of cancer pain seems to be a particularly promising field, and would help to alleviate the large number of deaths which are actually caused by overdosing on current opioid analgesics used for this problem.Additionally, current drugs used for cancer pain are often only partially effective.GWP has a partnership with Japanese drug-maker Otsuka Pharmaceutical for further development of this, with its obvious huge potential market.Already, many cancer sufferers smoke marijuana recreationaly (either legally or illegally) and are convinced by its pain relieving properties.GWP's share price rose 63% in 2014 and the share price is currently at US$ 83.26 with a 52-week high/low of US$111.46 and US$41.86.My own preference has been to trade this stock, accumulating on dips and taking some profit on rises in the price whilst slowly building up the total holding.Insys Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: INSY ) has just produced excellent results for its most recent quarter .Net revenue for the fourth quarter was up 65% and more than doubled for the year as a whole.However operating expenses also more than doubled, and legal costs soared.The company has the advantage of not being a pure cannabis play, but it is developing two cannabinoid drugs along with others in its portfolio.Firstly there is an oral solution of Dronabinol using the cannabinoid THC for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, now in phase 2/3 studies.Secondly there is early- stage development of a CBD-based oral solution for Dravets Syndrome, a rare but deadly type of childhood epilepsy which is under FDA fast-tracking (GWPH is already quite well down the line in its own drug for this condition).In addition the company is looking at cannabinoids for the treatment for brain cancer.Whilst these developments slowly move forward as new drug treatments always do, they have other drugs in the pipeline and existing drugs such as Subsys, an opiate spray whose sales have been promising.The company has less international exposure and less international approvals than GWP though, and this might make it hostage to political developments in the USA.However despite the good Q4 results and doubling of Subsys sales in 2014, there were some warning signs in its results, including its big increase in operating expenses.Subsys was also excluded by Express Scripts, which as Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) found out recently, can have short-term negative effects on a company's share price.More worryingly, the company is the subject of a DOJ investigation into sales and marketing practices: this might well be defended successfully, but once Government investigates companies in this way, historically this has been a reason for investors to at least exercise some caution.There is also an aggressive class action suit against the company under way.The share price is currently at US$57.69 with a 52-week high/low of US$61.52 and US$20.52.It is one for an investor to watch and buy/sell on news which can be very positive or very negative.Nemus Bioscience Inc ( OTCQB:NMUS ) is a reputable company and is only "bad" in the sense that its share price has recently cratered.It trades on the Over-the-Counter market with the restrictions that brings.Nemus has a corporate vision to develop condition specific drugs based on cannabinoids to treat a range of conditions, which will be based on a proprietary product pipeline, and is in partnership with the University of Mississippi to develop and commercialize such drugs.Specific areas being investigated focus around glaucoma, muscle spasticity, anxiety, epilepsy and MRSD infections.This university has a special agreement with the Federal Government to cultivate cannabis and do research accordingly.A biopharmaceutical start-up such as Nemus will always be a long shot, but at its present pricing it could be worth a play with funds one is willing to risk.Nemus has quite a small market cap of US$40 million and the share price is currently at US$2.50 with a 52-week high/low of US$11.00 and US$2.50.There are plenty of fly-by-night companies one could cite here which have been costly for investors who have tried to jump onto the cannabis band-wagon."Pump and dump" penny stocks have proliferated and investors have been accordingly and predictably burnt.One company that had attracted much positive interest and apparent talking up on Internet discussions boards, and indeed on Seeking Alpha, was Growlife ( OTC:PHOT ).Like many others in this genre, it got suspended by the SEC, in March last year.The company is trying to get back to respectability and normal trading, as this K filing shows.At present its grey sheet trading status means there is no independent market maker.Whether or not it has a viable "raison d'etre" as a company if it succeeds in this is of course a matter for the investor's due diligence.The share price is currently at US$0.0375 with a 52-week high of US$0.80.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In the fullness of time companies in this recreational marijuana space may well elicit good returns for investors, but it seems a random exercise at present to see if any of the current crop will make the grade.</span>Investors can check the 420 Investor website which is an interesting read if nothing else.My December article also gave some brief details of some of the other losers in this sector."Caveat emptor"!My own hunch is that Big Tobacco may well get successfully involved in the cannabis sector, and that of course would leave investors with their own ethical investing dilemmas.Some venture capital funds are starting to dip their toes into the water, most notably the Founders Fund run by Elon Musk acolyte Peter Thiel, who reckon the cannabis market is currently worth approximately US$50 billion.Another possible route in to a cannabis play is that Big Pharma companies might try to buy in to such plays.As we have seen recently with the purchase by AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) of Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC ) for what some observers consider an inflated price of US$21 billion, because many major players have drug pipelines that are coming to an end, small companies are in the firing line for takeover.GWP, with a market cap of US$1.6 billion and enterprise value of US$1.4 billion, and Insys with a market cap of US$2.06 billion and enterprise value of US$2.0 billion could be targets.There is little doubt that marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes will continue to be legalized on a worldwide basis.As for the USA, the opposition of the Federal Government will continue to be a barrier, though individual states are moving quite rapidly in the opposite direction to the central government.The Federal Government still regards cannabis as a schedule 1 drug, but various opinion polls have all shown that the majority of Americans are in favor of legalization.23 states have legalized medical marijuana and 4 states (Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Alaska) have legalized recreational marijuana.Apart from anything else, cash-strapped state governments see taxing cannabis as a welcome addition to their exchequers.On a Federal level, the results of the 2016 elections might have a meaningful impact on how much the industry can develop in the short-to-medium term.Major worldwide conditions that appear to be beneficially treated by cannabinoids include diabetes, Alzheimers, epilepsy, various cancers, cancer pain and schizophrenia.This shows the huge potential market for such drugs, but at the same time of course the investor has to bear in mind that it is usually calculated that only 10% of drugs that make Phase 1 trials actually come to market.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.Please be aware of the
