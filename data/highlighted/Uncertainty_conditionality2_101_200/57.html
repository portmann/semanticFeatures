(NYSE:VALE) | Seeking Alpha Growing debt is a real problem for Vale: more of it likely to come to fund planned CAPEX.Too much exposure to iron ore: most among the Top-5 players.Unsustainable dividends and worsening credit rating add to the problems.After a thorough analysis of Norilsk Nickel I have decided to write a short overview of Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE ): Vale S.A., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research, production, and sale of iron ore and pellets, nickel, fertilizer, copper, coal, manganese, ferroalloys, cobalt, platinum group metals, and precious metals in Brazil and internationally.Its Bulk Material segment produces and extracts iron ore and pellet.This segment is also involved in the production and extraction of manganese, ferroalloys, and others ferrous products and services; and extraction of coal, as well as in the provision of railroad, port, and terminal logistics services.The company's Base Metals segment produces and extracts non-ferrous minerals, including nickel and copper.Its Fertilizers segment provides a group of nutrients, such as potash, phosphates, and nitrogen.The company also invests in energy generation through operating hydroelectric plants and centers, as well as produces steel.The company was formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and changed its name to Vale S.A. in May 2009.Vale S.A. was founded in 1942 and is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Source: Capital IQ ).Vale operates in the same markets as its top competitors: BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American , and Glencore .Similar to Anglo American, the company has been experiencing profitability problems, mostly because it is as Rio Tinto immensely exposed to iron ore and China: (Source: Capital IQ .All infographics by author) During the last three years, Vale has failed to grow revenues or improve margins.Even worse, the company has paid out almost $8B in dividends since 2009, while it has incurred Free Cash Flows of less than $1.2B at the same time.In conjunction with that, Net Debt has increased from less than $10B in 2009 to whopping $24B+ as of the end of 2014.In addition to that, interest expense has almost doubled from $594M in 2009 to $1.1B last year.Capital expenditures totaling $56B over the past 6 years, which were largely financed by the debt, have failed to produce any meaningful returns: (Source: Capital IQ.All infographics by author) Secondly, the readers may see that Vale's Asset Retirement Obligations have been on the rise.Although it is fine for the company to grow AROs in line with assets, it is not a good sign to see them increase in proportion to PP&E: this is exactly the case with Vale (an uptrend from 1.5% in 2009 to 3.3% in 2014 and growing over the years).For comparison, BHP Billiton's AROs decreased from 8% of gross PP&E in 2009 to 6% in 2014.Rio Tinto's AROs-to-Gross PP&E ratio was at 10% in 2010 and at 7% in 2013, respectively.The point is that AROs decrease Terminal Value of the business, thus putting pressure on the fair value of the company's stock (currently, AROs are worth about $0.55 per share.Vale is almost religiously dedicated to iron ore with over two thirds of revenues coming from this product group (manganese included).The company's EBITDA is even more skewed to iron ore: three quarters coming from Ferrous metals.Vale has plans to increase iron ore production from 340 mt in 2015 to 459 in 2019.This is not a great idea given World Bank's forecasts indicating 1-2% CAGR in real prices for iron ore over the same timeframe .Like Rio Tinto, Vale incurs over a third of its revenues in China, where demand on iron ore is dictated by expected construction activity and steel industry expansion.Although China is expected to grow at approximately 7% in the near future (similar growth rates for steel manufacturing), the market for iron ore is clearly saturated.Vale has a real problem with growing debt: equity concentration has reduced from 68% of total assets in 2012 to 62% in 2014.This is one of the reasons that caused the EV/EBITDA multiple to shrink, as investors perceive more risk: (Source: Capital IQ.All infographics by author) The debt situation is confirmed in the credit score report, in which Vale has received unsatisfactory points compared to peers: (Source: Capital IQ.All infographics by author) Also, please notice the noticeable difference between the Net Income margin and the EBIT margin which is caused by one-offs such as write downs, losses on asset sales, and goodwill impairments (total effect: down to $305M Earnings from $6B in EBIT in 2014).As seen in the chart above, these factors fairly place Vale in the bottom quartile in peer valuation.Growing debt: invested in value-destroying assets; Overexposure to iron ore, whose market is saturated.World Bank's forecasts promise no bettering in the next few years for iron ore price; Vale is to spend another $34B in CAPEX by 2020.This program, although revised a number of times by the management, cannot be eliminated altogether; Asset Retirement Obligations are on the rise which puts a downward pressure on fair value of equity; I believe Vale is a SELL stock.Even with management being realistic about returning to good numbers in 2018, there is too much risk involved during the waiting period.And I think this risk is not adequately compensated for by the current stock price.Although shares are down 25% year-to-date, I think there is a lot more downside to be seen in the near future.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
