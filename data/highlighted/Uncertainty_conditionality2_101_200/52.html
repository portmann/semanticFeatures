(NYSEMKT:BTG) | Seeking Alpha Shares of B2Gold are down more than 35% over the past two months, compared to a 34% drop in the gold miners index and a 14% decline in GLD.However, the company just announced commercial production ahead of schedule at its low-cost Otjikoto gold mine in Nambia, which will be quite profitable at current gold prices.Perhaps no gold miner has been hit as hard during the past two months as B2GOLD.Shares are down from highs of $2.25 per share in early February to current prices of $1.41.You'll see in the below chart that shares have underperformed both the benchmark gold miners index (NYSEARCA: GDX ), and, of course, the price of gold (NYSEARCA: GLD ).While B2Gold deserved to correct a bit following the drop in the price of gold, I believe severity of the sell-off is a bit unwarranted, especially given the recent news that B2Gold has achieved commercial production ahead of schedule and under budget at the Otjikoto Gold Mine in Nambia.The company achieved better than expected performance mainly due to additional mill availability (89.6% versus budget estimate of 70%) and better than anticipated throughput (34% above budget), according to the release.This is excellent news that's going rather unnoticed by the market.The reason: Otjikoto is expected to greatly reduce B2Gold's overall cash cost profile - for 2015, the company expects the mine to produce between 140,000 to 150,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $700 per ounce.So even with gold at $1,150 currently, margins per ounce should be strong at $450.With 140,000 ounces of production and margins per gold ounce of $450, investors should expect approximately $63 million in annual EBITDA from this mine for 2015.For 2016, things should get even better as B2Gold expects 200,000 ounces of gold production per year in 2016 and 2017 as the company completes the expansion.Also, the current mine plan does not contain any ounces from the recently discovered, high-grade Wolfshag zone at Otjikoto.This resource contains 702,000 ounces of gold at 3.2 g/t, with the aim to commence open-pit mining at the deposit by 2016, which will likely improve both production and the mine's economics.An updated mine plan is expected by the end of 2015.Next, I'd like to remind investors that most of B2Gold's other producing mines are low-cost assets.For 2015, B2Gold expects all-in sustaining costs to range between $950 to $1,025 per ounce.If the company hits on the lower end of its guidance at $950, produces on the low-end of its production guidance of 500,000 ounces, and the price of gold remains at $1,150, then we can expect full-year EBITDA of approximately $100 million.Besides ramp-up of production at Otjikoto, investors can look forward toward the completion of a feasibility study at the Fekola project in Mali, which contains 3.91 million gold ounces and could begin producing gold as early as 2017.Once in production, this mine should add approximately 300,000 ounces of gold per year to B2Gold's production profile, or more than 50% to its 2015 production.However, like Otjikoto, Fekola looks like it will be a very low-cost gold mine - a pre-feasibility study released by the deposit's former owner, Papillon Resources, projects all-in sustaining costs of just $725 per gold ounce, and average annual pre-tax cash flow of $130 million at a $1,100 gold price.So B2Gold's all-in sustaining costs will likely be far lower than $1,000 per ounce by 2017 if it can successfully get Fekola to production and deliver on budget.The bottom line: While gold miners like B2Gold deserved to correct a bit following the dip in the price of gold, many gold miners have overreacted to the price drop, including B2Gold.In my opinion, this sell-off has a created an outstanding long-term buying opportunity for the reasons mentioned above.Source: B2Gold: A Buying Opportunity Is Here Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in BTG over the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
