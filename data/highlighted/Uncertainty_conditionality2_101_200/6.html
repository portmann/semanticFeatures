(NASDAQ:WFM) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 10, 2015  6:30 AM ET �|� About: Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) , Includes: KR , SFM , TFM by: Michael Carter Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � Whole Foods Market has seen its stock run up 10% YTD and over 40% since Q4 2014 earnings, after tumbling most of last year.The market's opinion about Whole Foods Market is a lot more optimistic the past 6 months, even though the same problems lurk within the company's growth strategies.Whole Foods Market is likely to see competition eat away at both its gross margins and its same-store sales in the short term.Long term, there is a chance, given the catalysts discussed in this article, that the company slowly becomes irrelevant in the broader grocery market industry.Overall, this article explains why everyone, including both Wall Street and Main Street, is wrong about Whole Foods Market again.Back in February, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM ) reported first-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings .The leading retailer of natural and organic foods revealed a revenue jump of 10.2% to $4.7 billion, while its net income climbed 5.7% to $167 million.Comparable sales rose 4.5%.Below is a quarterly chart looking at how Whole Foods Market has performed as far as top and bottom line numbers go since the first quarter of fiscal 2012.During the conference call , management was positive overall on recent company initiatives like the new national marketing campaign - a first for the company which was founded back in 1978, and both the Instacart and Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ) additions which add 1-hour delivery services and additional payment options for customers, respectively.Among the company's fiscal 2015 targets include at least 9% sales growth and comparable sales remaining in the low-to-mid single digits.However, due to the increased investments the company has planned this year, including the millions it will cost to run the national marketing campaign, Whole Foods Market expects greater declines in gross margins.Over the past couple of years, long investors have been wrong about Whole Foods Market twice.The first time was back in 2013, when the overall market believed that the company could hold off newer entrants and competition within the natural and organic food grocery sector.That turned out to be false, as the stock peaked at over $65 per share in late 2013, before dropping to well below $40 per share in mid-2014 after lowered guidance and dismal earnings announcements by the company.I believe now marks the second time in recent years that the overall market has been wrong about Whole Foods Market.The stock has climbed over 10% year-to-date, and over 40% since fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings were released in November of 2014.The problem revolves around the presumed catalysts that pushed the stock back up past $55 per share.Going back to fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings, Whole Foods Market merely beat reduced expectations after the company had reduced its guidance several times throughout the year.Revenues actually were in line with analysts' expectations.The increase in dividend going from $0.12 a share to $0.13 a share helped fuel the momentum that was largely overblown for a company that had not solved the problem of newer competitors.In the most recent first-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings, the same situation occurred.Whole Foods Market exceeded lowered expectations, while its revenues met market expectations.(Source: Whole Foods Market SEC filings) Comparable sales have been in a decline the past few years, and it appears that management is starting to wave the white flag on this issue.This is because in the most recent quarter's earnings announcement, there was a definition change on what comparable-store sales are defined as for Whole Foods Market.The revised definition means that comparable-store sales will go from meaning after a store is open for 52 weeks (1 full year) to now meaning after a store is open 56 weeks (1 full year and 1 full month).Unsurprisingly, this slight tweak in definition improved comparable sales numbers in the past two quarters (Q4 2014 and Q1 2015) for Whole Foods Market by four and five basis points, respectively, while also increasing comparable sales for the first three weeks of the current quarter (Q2 2015) by 19 basis points over the old definition.Essentially, the current quarter is currently on pace to report a comparable sales growth of 4.9%, rather than 4.7% under the previous method.Management believes the new definition minimizes the impact of stores cycling over high opening sales volumes.In short, the new definition helps reduce seasonality changes, improve both transaction and basket size numbers, and reduce the impact of the first-month sales for new stores that are launched.However, this seems suspect for a company that's been around since 1978 to suddenly make changes to a metric that has received more and more scrutiny in recent quarters.Additionally, the metric of comparable sales within the industry has almost always been defined using the 52-week method.Lastly, this could be Whole Foods Market's way of shielding itself from its competitors on quarterly earnings.If comparable sales continue to drop off for the company as its peers maintain their own numbers, Whole Foods Market can use its new 56-week method as a possible reason for the discrepancy.Since comparable sales fall outside of GAAP coverage, and since no universally accepted definition exists, this gives Whole Foods Market the opportunity to change this definition again in the future as it sees fit.With 408 stores nationwide and company goals of 1,200 long term, the decline in comparable sales suggests that the market is already approaching saturation well before the halfway point in long-term store count.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If possible market saturation wasn't bad enough, the growing competition only makes things worse for Whole Foods Market.</span>During the recent conference call, company President Anthony C. Gallo discussed growing competition and how newer entrants are stocking their own shelves with comparable or identical products to Whole Foods Market: "And some of them (vendors) were telling us that as soon as the product hits our shelves they get calls from other competitors saying we want that product too.So we kind of take the pride of being the first of getting products on the shelf."Later in the call co-CEO John Mackey said: "They (analysts) think we're going to sit still and let people catch us.But we're not going to sit still.We're going to rapidly innovate and improve" Essentially, Whole Foods Market is well aware of the competition, while recent earnings from its main competitors continue to top estimates.In its most recent earnings , Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM ) saw revenues climb 21% and net income skyrocket 91%, while comparable sales hit 8.5% on a year-over-year basis and 22.3% on a two-year comparable basis.Smaller rival The Fresh Market (NASDAQ: TFM ) saw its recent quarterly revenues go up 12.8%, while net income jumped to $20.2 million, improving from the below $2 million in net income in the year prior .Even Kroger (NYSE: KR ), which is several times larger than Whole Foods Market, had comparable sales of 6.0% that exceeded that of Whole Foods Market in its most recent quarter .In regards to John Mackey's comments during the conference call, Whole Foods Market is well underway in its attempt to innovate and improve operations, as shown on the table below citing recent new programs the company has initiated in recent months.Yet, this brings up additional problems for the company in the coming quarters.When management was asked on the conference call about which of the new initiatives were working the best, it couldn't pinpoint to anything in particular.This could pose problems down the road when some of the programs prove to be more of a liability than an asset to the company's bottom line.Some analysts on the call suggested the possibility of Instacart home delivery cannibalizing in-store operations.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This could become a serious problem if customers stop being exposed to impulse purchases throughout the store.</span>This domino effect runs down to where Whole Foods Market's store space starts to become wasted space if there is less traffic.The rewards program, which is still in the testing phase, but expected to go national in late 2015, doesn't really solve Whole Foods Market's biggest problem - keeping customers from flocking towards lower-cost competitors like Sprouts Farmers Market.In 2014, a Bloomberg Intelligence study revealed that comparable items at Sprouts Farmers Market, on average, were about 13% less expensive than at Whole Foods Market.It is highly unlikely that even with a reward program, Whole Foods Market will be able to undercut prices of many of its competitors.In regards to the company's first national ad campaign, it all looks like one big misunderstanding by Whole Foods Market.Management stated during the conference call that there is now a 100% increase in awareness due to the campaign so far.However, this was largely unnecessary and doesn't really change anything long term.Those that wanted to shop at Whole Foods Market already were aware of its existence.The same goes for those that don't.Everyone knows that Rolex watches are expensive.Therefore, it makes no sense for Rolex to suddenly invest in TV ads about the brand in an effort to improve sales.Other decisions in recent months by Whole Foods Market seem like desperate attempts to upgrade the technology portion of the stores.The company has made improvements to its point of sale systems, check-out lanes, and has added new displays and scanners.Nevertheless, all of these enhancements do little to prevent the inevitable for Whole Foods Market - the gradual loss of its distinction within the grocery market, and losing market share to the increasingly fragmented natural and organic foods industry.The obvious near-term catalysts that can move the stock in either direction is the company's ability in showing the market any evidence that its new programs and initiatives are having an effect on the top and bottom line numbers.More importantly, the market will want to see whether comparable sales show any improvements in the rest of fiscal 2015.The bigger story in Whole Foods Market is the long-term picture.Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE: JLL ) did a study in 2014 on the evolution of the grocery market industry.The chart below shows that while fresh-format and limited assortment chains like Whole Foods Market will see huge increases in market share by 2018, it is actually supercenters like Kroger and even Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) that will see the greatest increase in market share.This is bad news for Whole Foods Market, since supercenters will have pricing leverage to slowly steal price-conscious customers away.Yet, the chart below may prove to be a far worse prediction for Whole Foods Market.While fresh-format chains will see significant increase in store count by 2018, this number also includes current and possibly newer entrants in the niche sector.As a result, there will be more choices for customers to choose from, and Whole Foods Market will likely not be the only natural and organic grocer on the block.(Source: JLL Retail Research - September 2014) This collision in competition is bound to occur in the next few years, since Sprouts Farmers Market and The Farmers Market have locations in 10 and 27 states, respectively, while Whole Foods Market is already present in 42 states.When head-to-head, which stores will customers end up choosing long term?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If other industries foreshadow the end-game, it will be the natural and organic food grocer that offers the lowest prices - and that is not Whole Foods Market at the moment.</span>A much longer-term catalyst will come from a less obvious source - the restaurant industry.As more and more restaurant companies and even fast food chains like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) - which recently announced it were ending the selling of chicken treated with human antibiotics in its U.S. units - start to make the quality of their menu items a top priority, the intrigue of natural and organic foods will slowly disappear.It won't happen overnight, but I believe that on a longer-term scale, specialized grocers like Whole Foods Market and even its peers will become irrelevant.Whole Foods Market currently trades with a price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 35.This is much greater than the S&P 500 index average of 19.5.Taking a different approach to the stock, the current stock price of approximately $55 per share is over twice that of the famous Peter Lynch P/E 15 share price line.More importantly, the stock's actual price has been diverging away from this line since September 2014 - right before fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings.Looking at how Whole Foods Market is priced against its competitors, its forward P/E of 29 is less than that of Sprouts Farmers Market at 34, but much greater than Kroger's 19.This should correct eventually, as it is clear that Kroger has been outperforming Whole Foods Market as the former continues to expand its Simple Truth organic brand in its stores, with long-term goals of making the brand produce sales of at least $1 billion annually.In the end, future earnings for Whole Foods Market are likely to decline on a year-over-year basis as the company sets aside millions to invest in its newer programs.As a result, at today's share prices, Whole Foods Market offers too much risk for not quite as much reward in return.The recent 6-month run for Whole Foods Market has it outperforming both its chief competitors and even the S&P 500 index.However, both Wall Street and Main Street are wrong, given that the recent catalysts responsible for the company's recent run are largely unjustified and mostly due to reduced expectations by both the company and the market as a whole.It is unlikely that Whole Foods Market and its newer programs and marketing initiatives will boost comparable sales to the levels they were consistently at just a few years ago.The industry has changed and quickly caught up to the company.As it loses its niche and competitive advantages, customers will start to go by prices to decide on where they shop for their natural and organic foods.Source: Why Everyone Is Wrong About Whole Foods Market (Again) Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
