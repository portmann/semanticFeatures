(NYSE:CDE) | Seeking Alpha Silver accounts for 55% of Coeur's metal sales and the rest comes from gold, and this is why the company has been under pressure in recent quarters.Silver consumption is expected to reach nearly 680 million ounces by 2018, and it is expected that the metal can be worth as much as $500 an ounce.An improvement in silver dynamics along with the discovery of higher grade ore at its mines will allow Coeur to sustain its turnaround.Coeur Mining (NYSE: CDE ) is in turnaround mode.The company outperformed Wall Street's expectations last week with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter.However, the company saw a drop in both its top and bottom lines, with revenue dropping almost 15% year-over-year and its adjusted loss increasing to $37.5 million from $25 million in the year-ago period.But Coeur didn't do as bad as expected, and it looks set to get better on the back of an improvement in its operating structure and the silver market's dynamics.Coeur has struggled due to weakness in gold and silver pricing in recent times.The company gets 55% of its metal sales from silver while the rest comes from gold.Hence, it is heavily reliant on the end-market dynamics of both these markets.Now the good thing is that both gold and silver are expected to improve going forward.Since consumption of silver is expected to increase going forward, its price should increase as well.As per The Silver Institute : "Total silver industrial demand is forecast to grow 27 percent, adding an additional 142 million ounces of silver demand through 2018 compared with 2013 levels, according to a new report issued today by the Silver Institute."The report forecasts that silver consumption will reach nearly 680 million ounces by 2018.In addition, certain analysts forecast that silver will be worth as much as $500 per ounce in the next five years, primarily driven by demand for the metal in countries such as China.As a result, the silver market's dynamics look positive for the long run, and this will act as a catalyst for Coeur.Keeping the expected growth in demand in mind, it is important for Coeur to increase its production.As a result, the company is focusing on certain key assets with high grades and low costs.For example, it is seeing an improvement in grades at the Guadalupe deposit at Palmarejo.Consequently, it will be able to extract more metal, which will ultimately bring down its mining costs.Additionally, the company plans to mine 1,500 tons per day going forward from Guadalupe, up from around 500 tons per day in December.Hence, it will be able to mine more silver at lower costs going forward, and this will have a positive impact on its bottom line.Similarly, its Kensington mine also reported the discovery of higher grade gold ore, which has reduced Coeur's cost to $937 an ounce from $1,008 per ounce.In addition, Coeur sees double digit increases in silver production at the Rochester mine, along with a reduction in unit cost.The company will be able to achieve such reductions on the back of higher crushing rates, greater mining efficiency and higher grades.Coeur has made a couple of key acquisitions that will act as tailwinds in the future.It recently completed the acquisition of Wharf Gold Mine, a subsidiary of Goldcorp (NYSE: GG ), for $105 million.It is expected that Wharf will produce 85,000-90,000 ounces of gold in 2015 at an all-in sustaining cost of $800-$875 per ounce.This will consequently increase Coeur's EBITDA for the next fiscal by more than 30% and also boost its free cash flow.Apart from this, the deal will reduce Coeur's consolidated unit cost, enhance its overall geopolitical risk profile, and increase its total gold reserve by 24%.On the other hand, Coeur's recent acquisition of Paramount Gold and Silver for $46 million adds another asset with potential to its portfolio.Paramount has a key silver asset in the form of the San Miguel project, which includes the Don Ese deposit.Now, this asset will help Coeur tap higher grades at lower costs.Moreover, Paramount's assets in Mexico will complement Coeur's own projects and allow it to reduce unit costs, improve liquidity and generate free cash flow.Paramount's Don Ese Deposit and Coeur's Guadalupe asset require low capital expenses and higher margins.In fact, both these assets are expected to produce around 6 million ounces of silver and 110,000 ounces of gold annually for the next 8 years.The company expects that the average grade from its Guadalupe resource will grow 25% for silver after the acquisition.Hence, Coeur is doing the right thing by acquiring Paramount, as this will allow it to improve its production capability and also reduce costs.As mentioned earlier, Coeur is heavily dependent on gold and silver pricing.JPMorgan has lowered its gold and silver pricing forecast for the current year.In addition, the company's balance sheet is weak, as its debt of $469 million is higher than the total cash position of $295 million.Thus, further weakness in gold and silver pricing will create more pressure on Coeur's financial performance and restrict its capital investments.However, investors should focus on the long-term prospects as stated earlier in the article as both gold and silver pricing is expected to improve rapidly going forward.In addition, the company's short-term liquidity is strong as a current ratio of 4.06 indicates.Also, it has generated levered free cash flow of $155 million in the past one year, so it should be able to continue investing in its key assets.Finally, Coeur's bottom line is expected to grow at 22% a year in the next five years, better than the industry average of 20%.Hence, even though the company's financial performance is not in good health currently, it looks set to improve in the long run.Source: Coeur Mining's Turnaround Set To Continue Disclosure: The author has no
