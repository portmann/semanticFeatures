you.What I’ll do is actually turn it over to Bill to begin this call and then I will provide the financial results.Good morning.In terms of what we’re going to cover up on the call, we’ll take a look at 2014 in review and Jen will go through the financial results and then I’ll give a little bit of an operational overview and some comments looking forward towards 2015 and beyond.Really 2014 was an incredibly active year for the company.As I think everybody is aware, 2013 ended with us getting BRINAVESS back and with us completing the Correvio acquisition in the last month of year end.And 2014 was we’ve really got putting everything altogether.I mean, clearly, we experienced a very significant growth in revenue going from 4 million odd in 2013 to 30 million last year driven by the acquisition of Correvio but the company had gone from really not being a revenue generating organization to one that was able to generate significant revenues and you can probably appreciate how much operational execution was into going from nowhere to somewhere.The integration of Correvio for the most part went extremely smoothly.We launched BRINAVESS with our own internal sales force.BRINAVESS growth was close to 50% year-over-year even though we were using a sales force that was probably 20% of size that had carried it previously.AGGRASTAT hung in a lot better than we expected and in fact – despite the fact that we faced generic competition in Germany and towards later parts of the year in France and the UK, which was part of our plan and something we expected, we were able to grow internationally now that AGGRASTAT really hung in quite well for us.We did two financings.We had enough equity financing available to us that in fact we’re able to use some of the proceeds from that to reduce some private equity position that came about as a result of the Correvio acquisition.And we put in place a facility with MidCap that allowed us to use some debt to function a little bit more like a revolver.And we have another $10 million tranche available for business development, which I think will be quite relevant to us in 2015, and I’ll come back to that later on.A lot of other things that we had to do in terms of assuming over the commercial rights and organization we submitted for BRINAVESS reimbursement, dossiers in Italy and Belgium and France.We expect to hear back on those three files in 2015.We announced positive clinical trial results from Asia Pacific where the primary endpoint of the trial was met and in fact reinforced everything we knew clinically about the performance of our product in previous clinical trials.We did countless distributor agreements.As I said, we needed to grow out of the international portfolio of the business and we did that with distributor agreements in Ireland and Greece, South Africa, Argentina, Denmark and I’m sure actually just a few.But we built out kind of a rest of world business at the same time.And I think when I finish up and then talk a little bit later about our plans for expansion and our plans for business development that was really a big part of it.I think we set the table in 2014.We have an international distributor business now.We have a fully functioning European business right now with direct sales and all the infrastructure and support that goes with that.And we have a base business that comes fairly close to supporting that.So when you look at that, we really are a business that is capable of taking on new products and expanding, because we had to do all this work to get there.Last but not least, just towards the end of the year we completed an agreement with Eddingpharm to develop BRINAVESS in China and that will be a true development program that won’t involve clinical trials and all the like and lead up to a submission to the FDA and which we think will be a very good market for us.So that’s almost the last piece of that puzzle, but the company’s now well positioned to do that.So keep that in mind as Jennifer goes through the financials and keep that in mind as we talk about what we expect to do in the coming 12 months.Thank you, Bill.I will now provide an overview of our 2014 full year and fourth quarter financial results.Amounts, unless specified otherwise, are expressed in U.S. dollars and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America.We’ve recorded a net loss of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to net earnings of $4.8 million in 2013.The net loss for 2014 was largely due to cost incurred to support the commercialization of BRINAVESS and the continued sales of AGGRASTAT.The net income for 2013 was primarily due to the gain on settlement of debt owing to Merck.Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30 million, an increase of $25.5 million compared to revenue of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.AGGRASTAT sales continued to be stable and above expectations, as Bill had mentioned, by generic entry into markets.We continue to expect the growth in BRINAVESS sales going forward to offset any decline in AGGRASTAT sales from generic composition.Cost of goods sold related to the sales in BRINAVESS and AGGRASTAT was $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.Selling, general and administration expenditures for 2014 were $33.8 million compared to $16.4 million for 2013.The increase was primarily due to costs associated with Correvio acquisition and an increase in sales and marketing costs to support the commercialization of both products.For the fourth quarter of 2014, we’ve recorded a net loss of $6.5 million compared to a net loss of $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $7 million, an increase of $3.1 million from total revenue of $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.This increase is due primarily to the recognition of a full quarter of AGGRASTAT sales compared to six weeks in the fourth quarter of 2013.SG&A expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $9.1 million compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the Correvio acquisition and costs incurred to support again the commercialization of both products.In 2015, we expect to continue to incur net loss with our expenses including cost to fund our development programs are expected to continue to be greater than on revenue from the sale of BRINAVESS and AGGRASTAT.At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $12.7 million compared to $11 million at December 31, 2013.The balance of the deferred consideration related to our acquisition of Correvio was $7.6 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $10.7 million at December 31, 2013.We believe that our cash on hand, expected future cash inflows with the sales of products and expected proceeds from other financial vehicles will be sufficient to finance our operational and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.Thanks, Jennifer.So, as we look at the business right now and I know a lot of our shareholders that have been with us for a long time and heard me express this on numerous occasions.The business really does kind of break into two functional elements; what’s happening with BRINAVESS and the FDA?How is that program going?What’s the U.S. potential of the business look like?And then how are we building out the operational business that I spent time talking about on the first slide?In 2014 – I’m getting my years mixed up already – in 2014, we reengaged with the FDA for the first time.The file had been with Merck and before that had been with Astellas.Our team took it over and took a look at where we stood.The FDA has been very collegiate and very helpful with us in terms of trying to direct us towards a pathway to address the concerns and questions that they had over the length of this file.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We started 2014 by being in a position where we were asked to do an animal study to see if we could understand better the guess that had occurred in the ACT V trial I guess probably four or five years ago now.</span>We did a dog study that looked at modeling out, trying to understand the mechanism of hypotension, trying to understand exactly how that comes about and how to manage it.If it does, because knowing how to manage it, one has to know what causes it in the first place.And so we designed animal studies to look at that.They took the better part of a year to complete.And towards the end of the year, in December, in fact we met with the FDA and went through those studies and discussed them with the FDA and we received some feedback from them as to their interpretation of those studies.And now the next step for us is to meet with the agency again in early April.It is our hope that in April, we’ll get further feedback from the FDA as to what the next steps would be going forward.And if that sounds somewhat vague, it’s because I think at this point in time we are still in discussion to see what that CorpusPath does look like going forward.To the extent that we have further disclosure and further clarity as to what next steps are, obviously we’ll make that disclosure at that time.But right now we’re waiting on a meeting in early April and our hope is that we’ll learn more at that meeting and will allow us to inform people better as to what the next steps are.So, what is next in 2015?So, obviously, we want to continue forward and is our hope and expectation that we will develop BRINAVESS in the United States.If we are successful in doing that, I think the company will take a very hard look at what we can do with the oral program.For the first time, I think we can think about how we might move that forward.We have some definite ideas.In fact, they’re not just ideas.We are taking steps operationally within the company to look at how to extract some value from the oral program and see what we might be able to do.I think a lot of folks have heard me say in the past that we believe the oral might be best as a niche pharmaceutical product with a very particular target patient group and we’re looking at how to move forward on that, and how to make that happen.And again, I think that will rollout afterwards.But what about within the company?Well, in 2014, I think we really did have a year of operational excellence.One of my favorite analogies is the concept of a duck and that’s to appear clam and placid above the water and be paddling like crazy underneath it, and that’s really what last year was like, an awful lot of stuff went on.I mean, when you see those distributor agreements come out, they may seem trivial but they’re not.Each one of those has to be negotiated and played out and signed.We did literally scores of corporate agreements.The integration of the company many times our size was non-trivial.That went really quite smoothly.Probably the biggest concern at the time we bought Correvio was the status of the AGGRASTAT supply chain.I think that really got corrected and moved forward, and I think we feel very good about that.That’s very stable and well managed and now we’re starting to integrate the supply chain of BRINAVESS into that.We put the sales force together and there’s always a little bit of turnover that goes with that, but now I think we have a really first-class sales organization.It’s supported by Medical Affairs.We have a number of clinicians on staff, we have cardiologists on staff, we have a cardiovascular surgeon on staff.And now we have a supply chain, Med Affairs, quality, pharmacovigilance, all that is all set up and we did it really in a year.And so while we could talk a big game about being a partner in the past and we could discuss we might be a partner of choice or we could bring new products in, you got to have the supply chain, the pharmacovigilance and the Med Affairs and the sales force and everything else to actually do that.Now I actually think we really are a legitimate partner.And when we go out and we pitch to people, I don’t think it’s smoke and mirrors, I think it’s something that we’re actually really able to do.And I think we are a legitimate in-hospital specialty pharma company in Europe right now and that’s obviously something we need to exploit.As you saw, we burned around $18 million last year and so I think the big question on the operational side of the business, outside of the FDA is how do we find $20 million a year going forward?I think from the first moment we spoke about building this out, you’ve probably heard me say that you need to do about $50 million a year in Europe if it’s actually going to be an operational functional business that breaks even and makes money, and our financials don’t lie.That is exactly what we need to do.I think there’s a couple of ways to do that.I mean first, we have to exploit the portfolio we have.We’ve talked at length about trying to access the U.S. market.I mean obviously that’s a big step function for this company if we are ultimately able to do that.But what about outside of the U.S., because how do we build that business intrinsically?Well, Canada is something that I think you’ll see us do a lot of work on in the coming year.We actually do have AGGRASTAT right in Canada.The high dose bolus formulation and the semi-indication were never brought forward from a regulatory point of view in Canada.Correvio was not inclined to develop the Canadian market, so there is some regulatory work to be done in AGGRASTAT but there is nothing stopping us from going forward with AGGRASTAT.It is a country that we own the rights to and something that I think we should do the regulatory work with and put some effort on, and put some direct sales force behind that as well.There’s really nothing to stop us from filing in Canada on BRINAVESS either.As I think everybody is aware, the Canadian regulatory bodies take their own lead.They are not depending on FDA decisions or any other for that matter.And so it’s a separate discussion with a separate agency with their own questions and concerns, and that’s something that we plan to engage on shortly.This is a G7 country that can managed quite easily with a small sales force and we have the potential to have two drugs to sell there.In Europe, as we look towards our internal goals for BRINAVESS, which are quite aggressive, our plan now that we are fully set up is to grow more than double BRINAVESS sales in this coming year if not better than that.We’ll do that through our existing sales force but we need to add other countries.As I said, we filed for pricing reimbursement in Italy, France and Belgium last year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The regulatory environment being what it is, the reimbursement environment being what it is, I would be surprised if we succeeded in all three of those countries.</span>But my hope is that we’ll succeed in one or more and we’ll have additional countries to rollout.By the way, just because one doesn’t succeed doesn’t mean that one doesn’t continue to reapply and continue to try and get reimbursement.But as I think those of you who follow the European companies know that it can be an interactive [ph] process and it can go on for a while.But we believe that we can add those countries this year.In Russia, we’re looking to move AGGRASTAT forward there.We think that’s a big opportunity for us.And last but not least, we did talk about China.We are already selling AGGRASTAT in China now, but we need to get BRINAVESS actually approved and go through the clinical trial process there to go forward.And everything we have heard from our partners there, Eddingpharm, that this could be a very good drug and it could be very well received in China.I think their expectation is that the revenues there could be quite surprising if we can get forward.So, clearly, there’s a lot we can do just with the portfolio we have.There’s geographic expansion.I guess the bad news is we need to find $20 million in revenue but the good news is, we only need to find $20 million in revenue, we don’t need to find $200 million.And so chipping away 1 million here, 2 million there, 5 million there is something that will have a material impact on the business going forward.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>On the business development side, as I said, I do believe we are a fully integrated EU commercial hospital organization and we have 25 sales reps. I think if we took on another product, we would consider expanding that.</span>Again, the good news is I think a fully built out organization in Europe would only be 35, maybe 40 reps, it wouldn’t be 400 reps. So at 25, we’re not really undersized in any way, shape and form.We’re probably the right size for the products we have.We aren’t spending a lot of time promoting AGGRASTAT.We’re starting to switch more over to promoting BRINAVESS particularly as we get generic conclusions in some of the Western European markets.And so we certainly have the bandwidth to take on another product.And I think scaling up, in quotation marks, from where we are to take on more products is actually not that big a deal.It’s a matter of a handful of reps in different places, not a complete do over.And so you’re not going to see the SG&A go through the roof if we take on another product.And so any additional revenues that we bring in, in Europe should really drop pretty closer to the bottom line, because everything that we needed to do, I think for the most part, we have.As I said, I think we’ve got a very robust Medical Affairs platform, one that people would be very happy to use and one that is very skilled and have a lot of clinical knowledge, a lot of in-hospital knowledge and will be able to take on additional products as well.In terms of pricing and reimbursement, we’ve obviously been through that cycle now ourselves with BRINAVESS, so it won’t be a first time.The next time we do this and taking on a product and doing that is something we’re able to do, and distribution and logistics, which I think people tend to just assume as a given until you actually try doing it are all taken care of as well, and we’ve got all the partners set up.In fact, one of the big things behind Correvio that would be something one would normally never talk about on a conference call is moving a few million dollars of product around Europe is actually really, really expensive.Moving $30 million plus in product gets a little bit better and 50 is better still, because we’re a bigger client.We can use bigger providers and it certainly helps us do things like that.So that’s all in place.We’ve already got a couple of products.We’ve got an international distributor network.One of the reasons I highlighted Canada is as we talk to companies about in licensing, we’re including Canada in those discussions.A lot of organizations, even big organizations will use a Canadian distributor that’s separate.Very few companies build out their own Canadian sales force.And I think it’s an interesting little tick mark for us being able to cover both Europe and Canada.It allows them to have one partner instead of two.And as a company ourselves that have set up an international distributor network, it is actually very nice when you can go to a partner that has a regional reach instead of a country-by-country reach.We’ve worked with companies like Aspen and Algorithm that cover more than one territory and AOP, and those have been really good distributors for us and we want to be that same type of business for people looking at Europe.I think we’re looking right now at about three different types of business development activity, classic in licensing but I don’t mean upfront milestones, royalties type agreement that are obviously geographically focused, things that will be done primarily in Europe and Canada.I think we provide an interesting platform for U.S. companies or even bigger, broader international companies but companies that may be interested in developing the U.S. market under their own banner, but do not want the distraction and the complexity of going to Europe, as [indiscernible] who runs Europe for us always says, I think there’s a North American tendency to think of Europe as one.Certainly, of course, there is the EU and one currency and all the like, but actually operating is not like that at all.It’s multiple languages, multiple countries, multiple cultures and in fact is a pretty complicated environment in which to operate.And I think we can service that from one-stop shopping and is something that is attractive to companies looking for that.I also think that focusing on the hospital environment, the pharmacy environment particularly the kind of specialist cell and in-hospital pharmacy cell is not a common call point.There are not a lot of people focused on that.And so I think we are differentiated in that regard and I think that will help us going forward.We’re also looking at co-promotes.One of the next things about actually having a couple of products available, and in fact one of the nice things about having products that are at different points in their lifecycle; one generic, one very early stage and growth oriented and launch oriented is that you can horse trade with those assets and you can move them around.And we can take on some of these drugs in some areas maybe where we have a bigger sales force or potentially maybe in an area where we’re only selling one drug instead of two and vice versa.They can take on our product if they have extra bandwidth or if they have a bigger sales force in a particular area or they have growth needs in a country.And maybe it would be better for our sales force to just focus on BRINAVESS and not on AGGRASTAT, and maybe that’s an opportunity for us to put AGGRASTAT in somebody else’s hand.So those types of co-promotes and one of the things I also always say about this whole situation is that having a couple of drugs available actually gives you a seat at the table, it actually gives you the opportunity to have those discussions.And I think we’ll try and take advantage of those in 2015 as well.Then last but not least is to look at outright product acquisitions.We can carry everything from, quote unquote, branded, generic or kind of small $5 million, $6 million product opportunity all the way up to something that might be in an earlier lifecycle stage.And I know people have been waiting for us to do this and obviously we would have been happy to have got this done two, three months ago.But the reality is it took us almost all of last year to be in a position to be able to take everything on and I think this is the year where we have to go and execute on that.And so when you put that all together, that’s kind of what it looks like as a business.We need to come up with $18 million, $20 million to get to that magic 50 plus.There’s geographic ways to do that with what we have.I don’t think that will be sufficient in and of itself, but it still needs to be exploited.We’ve got to do some business development, put things in.I’d like to bring a new proprietary product into the bag, I’d like to do some co-promote work, I’d like to chip away at that $18 million about four or five different fronts until we finally just get over the hump.And then obviously we continue to work on the FDA program and we continue to think about what we might do with the oral as a way to further expand the business and get us to the next stage overall.So that’s really it.Sometimes even complicated stories are relatively simple.Regulatory work, global expansion, business development that’s really what we have to do in 2015.It all feels quite manageable.I think it will be a lot of work.I’m hoping that next year I’ll show you a slide that looked like the first slide I showed you today where it seems like ho-hum yawn, but when you actually think about all those steps, there was a ton of work done last year.That’s how I feel like this year will be.I hope it will just be like, yes, tick tick tick.That’s what we expected from Cardiome in 2015.It’s a lot of work but it’s all manageable and it’s not black box stuff, it’s all the things that we know we need to do and the business is highly focused on a few areas that I think are obvious value drivers for the company as a whole.So with that, I will turn it over for questions and I thank those of you on the West Coast for getting up early and joining us at 5 AM.Good morning, everyone.You mentioned that you have a goal of at least doubling BRINAVESS sales in Europe.Is that contingent upon getting some of the reimbursement Italy, Belgium, France that you want?It would help.I think as I look at our forecast and our internal forecast is actually to do better than that [indiscernible] is probably pulling his hair out as I say that right now.But to do that, yes, we would absolutely have to get geographic expansion, reimbursement in those countries.But to reach even I think manageable growth targets this year, I think we don’t.So I think what we have and the way that we’re starting to get traction and how we’re going about adding hospitals, I think we can show substantive growth just off of what we have right now but adding additional countries would make that even easier.What we’re seeing about BRINAVESS is that it takes a lot of work in one regard, which is that you really have to drill down on an institution.You have to get the local KOLs onside and then you have to spend some time with pharmacy explaining the value proposition, with administration explaining the value proposition.And then because Europe is a little bit different than North America where in North America you may have a dedicated ER physician group or ER specialists and then that’s all they do, a lot of ERs in Europe are manned by different people, kind of different – anesthesia covers it one night, cardiology covers another night.There’s a bit of a rotation through there.And we’ve seen some reps [ph] who have been very successful where they go in and train the nursing staff and the like, because the nursing staff are permanent.The doctors may rotate through but the nursing staff doesn’t.And so this is kind of a multi-prong approach but when you get it right, it seems like you can really get it right.You can get a hospital that will make this the way they do things and they’ll follow the guidelines that have been put forward by the ESC and so it’s a little bit of work.You got to kind of chip away at it for a while but when it goes, it goes really well.And so we’ve really started to focus on trying to make a wholehearted effort on a hospital at a time.And when we do that, it looks like it’s starting to pay off and there’s certainly more than enough A-fib cases out there that we don’t have to convert a ton of hospitals to see meaningful growth.There’s enough business out there for us right now.Okay.And there’s also an indication in there that BRINAVESS was up 50% year-over-year.Does that mean that it sales were between 6 million and 7 million or so?No, you can say about below base.And we’re still at the law of small numbers.But I think what’s encouraging is that with all the chaos that goes from taking an important product from a big pharma and with all the chaos and greenfielding an entire business really in Europe in a year, we’re able to get growth out of that and we have far fewer people selling BRINAVESS than were selling BRINAVESS in the past, and yet we were still able to crunch some growth out of that.And the fourth quarter was – it showed a lot of encouraging trends for us and so it looked like we were starting to get traction.And so I think we can continue to grow off that base.If I look at 2015, right now in its current iteration, I think BRINAVESS growth can keep pace with any kind of AGGRASTAT decline.We’d obviously like to do better than that and that’s why we need to do some BD [ph] and some geographic expansion to try and push beyond that kind of status quo which obviously is not a status quo, but that’s really where our ambitions lie.Okay.Just two more.When you sit down with the agency, do you feel that they’re motivated to bring in another anti-arrhythmic onto the market or what’s their body language like?As simple an answer as this will sound, I think they look at the file on its own individual merits.I think this is a complicated file.I don’t want to pretend that it’s not.The drug has been around for a while and it’s been through a lot of iterations and ups and downs and different things.And so it’s not your straightforward Phase I, Phase II, Phase III program.As I alluded to in my comments before, they have been very, very responsive and they have given us meetings quickly and I think they are trying to guide us.I think that what constitutes a development plan for anti-arrhythmic in 2015 is different than it was in 2007 or 2008 or whenever this drug had its first go around.I think that simply putting patients into normal sinus rhythm is not sufficient anymore, maybe it was once but it is not anymore.I think one has to show some patient benefits beyond that, one has to show some outcomes beyond that.And I think that everybody involved in this space is trying to figure out exactly what that means both from a regulatory perspective and from a drug developer perspective.And we have had access to people and they are trying to help us figure that out.Okay.Last question just on foreign exchange.It’s been up and down these days.What’s your exposure to the euro?David, it’s Jennifer here.Yes, I mean we certainly have some.We did our financing last year both in Canadian dollars and of course our ATM program is in U.S. dollars.But I would say our exposure to euro is not significant because all our sales are in euros and the majority of our selling expenses and head office costs in Europe are in euros.Of course our Canadian office and our U.S. office are in Canadian U.S. respectively.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But we’ve monitored the situation actively and now should we decide to get into a hedging program, we will do so if we think that would be a good prudent move for us.</span>Your product revenues, it seem a bit flattish quarter-over-quarter and you’ve got a pretty high hopes for driving growth.Can you talk about what maybe the forces were in Q4?Did you see any shift in ordering patterns there?And then are you seeing – what kind of momentum are you seeing for BRINAVESS going into Q1?Yes.I think we’ve got a few moving pieces here.So AGGRASTAT was under a lot of pressure early on in the year.Again, none of that was a surprise to us.It was all expected.But we were genericsizing Germany, which was our biggest direct market but we knew that was happening.But it was a big hit.It was $5 million odd lost in AGGRASTAT in Germany.And we saw similar things happen in the UK and France and the markets that I would say, quote-unquote, where we were genericsizing.And we expected that.So we’ve had AGGRASTAT moving down and BRINAVESS moving up and the net effect was to look at – and then make it seem kind of flattish.But as we did that, we also kind of hit – we’re starting to get closer to hitting the AGGRASTAT flow and that gives us a chance to give us something to push off of going forward in the fourth quarter and we did a lot of distributor work.Our distributor orders are lumpy and so sometimes things move around.One quarter looks better than others because there’s a big distributor order in it and people draw conclusions.One of the reasons why I go to great lengths to tell you guys not to look at that too closely and look more on annual trends, because if we’ve got a distributor that orders everything in one quarter that can make that quarter look great, but actually that’s a full year worth of product and you kind of need to keep that in context.Anyways, AGGRASTAT was moving but now I think it’s really close to the bottom.I don’t think it’s worth genericsizing any of the other markets out there that are there and so now we kind of are getting the AGGRASTAT flow and now we can build off of that geographically and do the distributor work that we did, because we did a lot of AGGRASTAT distributor work last year too and got some global expansions, started to make that curve go back up a bit and then we started to hammer away at BRINAVESS with the direct sales force and with the distributors as well and hammer away at that moving that up.So the net effect, back to the duck analogy, is everything seems kind of calm but there is an awful lot of paddling going on here to get to where we got to.And having said that, as we look in direct sales in the fourth quarter, we started to see more of a slope and we started to see some real success stories.There are places in the world, and I know it is easy to point to a single place and that doesn’t prove a rule, but places like Finland where we were having a lot of success and getting hospitals to use the A-fib guidelines in practice management and put BRINAVESS front and center and accounts where it can be decent sized accounts, a couple hundred thousand dollar accounts when you get a hospital to do that.And it doesn’t take many of those before they start to build up in Europe and we’re trying to focus in on that and why that works in some places and why it doesn’t in others.So I think we’ve kind of hit the AGGRASTAT flow.I think we’re starting to do some stuff with AGGRASTAT that will allow that to maybe even inch up a little bit.And then we’ve got the whole BRINAVESS thing to move up.And then last but not least, we start to look at can we put something else into the bag because clearly our sales force has the bandwidth to do more than what we’re currently doing.Thanks very much.Bill, you mentioned in your opening remarks the distant chatter about the additional dog studies that the FDA requested you to do in order to address the hypotension that you saw in the one and presumably a few other patients in your original ACT studies.Was this reflecting back on your original 2007 FDA advisory panel meetings where you actually had some data on addressing blood pressure in dog models?So I’m just kind of interested in what new insights you came up with in that study and if there are any data that you’re at liberty to share that might provide some insights on the human context?And I’ll leave it there.Thanks.Thanks, Doug.Not surprisingly your knowledge of preclinical Vernakalant studies will exceed mine and so my answer may be insufficient.But there are a number of ways that hypotension can manifest itself.It can be a volume issue, it can be vasodilation, it can be autonomic in nature, it can be any number of different things.And depending on what the cause of that hypotension is, you’d obviously treat it quite a bit differently.And what our belief is, is that the Vernakalant is a mild negative inotropic, most drugs of this class are.And so we believe that that is the cause of hypotension in patients who experience it.And it also explains why the label looks like it does in Europe.If you have Class 3 and Class 4 heart disease and you’ve gotten a pretty severe pump failure, you can’t tolerate further pump failure, you can’t tolerate another negative inotropic and that’s why we don’t treat people with severe heart failure and that’s why we don’t treat people who have an outlet problem like aortic stenosis.And so that’s what the dog phase were designed.I think the dog phase to us confirm that the drug’s a negative inotropic and that if you have a normal circulatory system, the body can compensate.So if you’re normal or Class 1 or Class 2, you can compensate for that and that’s the right type of patient group for us to be treating.I think just to give you a tiny bit more color and maybe one of the things to come out of Europe is we’ve now treated 22,000 or more people.So we’re starting to know a lot more about this drug just from the kind of practice of medicine on a daily basis.And what we’ve seen is that the hypotension – for sure, hypotension does occur with the drug that if you preload the patients with some fluid, if you give them about 500 ml of saline, you just don’t seem to see it very often.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>And if you kind – the docs will tell you if it’s the summer time or the patient is dehydrated or something like that, that’s the patient who is most likely to manifest clinical hypotension.</span>Give him a bit of saline, boost him up a bit and they tend not to see problems with it when they manage it like that.I think there’s things you can do with the infusion rate and the like that also make the drug easier to manage and make the clinical experience pretty manageable.So, I think we know what the mechanism is.I think we know how to address it.I think from spending a lot of time in the field, we’re starting to learn what the right way to administer this drug is.There is still some art to the practice of medicine and kind of spending time on that allows you to figure out the right way to give the drug.Thanks very much.We’d leave it at that.I think a really exceptional year for us.I’d like to thank my staff here in Vancouver and for those listening in Europe, I think a ton of work was done to take a company that had no commercial history at all and turn itself into a commercial organization in a really short period of time, I think that was a tremendous amount of work.I think the execution was really wonderful.And so I’d like to thank my staff for all of that.My hope is that we’ve build something here that matters and than in 2015, we’ve got something to push off of and we can build on top of that and get this company to the next level.Jennifer and I are around all day for your calls.We’re both in Vancouver.We’re both in the office, so we should be pretty easy to reach if you have any follow-up questions.I look forward to talking to everybody again in the very near future.Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today.We thank you for
