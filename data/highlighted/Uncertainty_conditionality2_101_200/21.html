I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (NYSE:DD) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 12, 2015 12:25 PM ET �|� About: E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (DD) by: Dallas Salazar CNBC reports breaking news that Peltz was offered one Board seat as recently as yesterday.Peltz of course turned down this offer in that it would largely still result in DD's Board and management being held unaccountable.I'm closing my short position slightly in the red as I've said all along Peltz and Trian are the answer to waking the sleeping DD giant.It looks like Trian Fund Management, L.P., is finally making some progress in securing Board seats at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (NYSE: DD ).This progress materially changes my short thesis and I will be closing my position immediately as I think DD could soon be an attractive long position.I have believed all along that Peltz and Trian can optimize operations of this currently crippled giant.CNBC is reporting breaking news that Trian CEO Nelson Peltz spoke to DD as recently as yesterday and was offered one Board seat: This is a substantial difference in stance by DD management which has denied all requests by Trian, including one of a simple universal proxy, and has been closed-off to any conversations of allowing Trian influence.In fact, in a recent letter to shareholders DD management accused Trian and Peltz of using figures that weren't "reported in DuPont's public filings" and even went as far as to say "�their arguments are based on inaccurate data illustrated with misleading charts.We have highlighted a few of Trian's many "myths"� (SOURCE: DD letter to shareholders)".I believe DD management's sudden sentiment change has to do entirely with Peltz and Trian's relentless campaign to clarify DD's confusing and constantly changing performance reporting.In a presentation just released this morning Trian details just how muddy something as routine as DD's EPS reporting has been since 2011 - a measure that DD management is paid for performance and a measure in which management used in the above quoted shareholder letter to describe their value-add: Management, in my opinion, realizing that a smear campaign has been ineffective and that the further provoking of Trian would only lead to more presentations of past failure to perform and what appears to be the concentrated efforts to make it be reported as anything but that could soon be close to kneeling to Trian's requests.I just have a hard time believing that after a constant reluctance to allow anything resembling a compromise that management and the Board would suddenly yield to Trian without a final resolution being near-term.I can't imagine that DD can backtrack on this offer of one seat which has been turned down by Peltz.This leaves only the option of finally coming to Trian's terms, something that has been the worst nightmare of a management and a Board that has come to know years of not being held accountable as the norm.Again, I'm closing my short position slightly in the red and may look to go long DD on the hope that Peltz can secure his influence on the company immediately.Source: Nelson Peltz And Trian Make Progress In Securing DuPont Influence Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
