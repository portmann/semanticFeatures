Limited (NAT) , Includes: ASC , NAO , NNA , STNG , TNK by: J Mintzmyer Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � The oil tanker market has struggled since 2011, but is now showing strong signs of resurgence.Despite market improvement, NAT has barely moved, likely due to limited and negative coverage.Long-term data suggests 2011-2014 was the trough of the cyclical oil tanker market.NAT has 50-100% of near-term share price upside based on current market fundamentals alone.Near-term catalysts including a likely huge dividend increase in May and oil volatility should continue to promote share price upside.Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT ) has been mired in bearish commentary and investment coverage for the past three years despite strong recent upticks in the Suezmax market.The most recent example is a well-written bearish article questioning NAT's dividend sustainability, which was published on Seeking Alpha this week.While I have strong respect for Lambros Papaeconomou's contributions, I believe his recent article erroneously ignores significant upside potential in the tanker market, and ultimately comes to the wrong conclusion regarding the risk/reward proposition inherent in NAT.I have followed NAT both through investment coverage and varying personal ownership since 2011.While the company has faced significant headwinds during this time, I believe the value proposition remains intact and tremendous shareholder returns await once the tanker market finally recovers.If tanker spot rates continue to strengthen, I believe NAT could reach annual yields exceeding 20% of today's market price (over $2/sh annually).In this scenario, NAT common shares would likely trade in the $20-$30 range.My current 'fair price range' for NAT is $15-$20/share, which provides 50-100% of upside based on current prospects.Prior to reading this article, and especially prior to making any investment decisions, I encourage you to read Papaeconomou's latest (bearish) article , review oil tanker market prospects and then come to your own conclusions.Feel free to share your views below.Nordic American Tankers was established in 1995 (link to further history), with initial vessel delivery occurring in the fall of 1997.In 2004, NAT transitioned to its current operating company status and began rapid expansion.By 2009, NAT's fleet grew to 18 vessels.Due primarily to weaker tanker spot rates, expansion slowed from 2009-2014, with only four net purchases.NAT's current fleet consists of 22 Suezmax tankers, with two additional vessels scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2017 respectively.NAT has a unique taxation profile due to its Bermuda incorporation.Its vessels are flagged in multiple other countries, which also reduces potential taxation.Due to this structure, NAT pays essentially $0 in income taxes.The company has no need to ever repatriate corporate cash to the US or any other mainline country due to its maritime business model, so the primary tax exposure is left to individual investors via equity gains and dividend streams.NAT operates a pure-Suezmax fleet with all 24 vessels designed to similar specifications.This approach aims to streamline operating expenses and reduces rate exposure to a single market.Although the Suezmax class carries approximately 50% less oil than VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) vessels, they are often preferred by traders for their increased maneuverability and higher port compatibility.The downside to NAT's approach is zero exposure to potential VLCC spot-rate spikes as well as full dependence on the oil trading market (as opposed to other tanker companies that also own gas carriers and chemical vessels).Since inception, NAT has operated as a vehicle for strong dividend payments from operating cash flows with fleet expansion funded through multiple equity and debt raises.This profile has resulted in higher payouts, but investors have compensated for the lack of internally funded growth by demanding higher yields.In January 2015, NAT paid their 70th consecutive quarterly dividend , for a lifetime total of $45.38.NAT first traded on the US markets in 1997 at a range of $16.31-$19.38, so despite the lower share price today, lifetime investors still enjoyed sizeable annualized returns, even compared to most other diverse alternatives such as the S&P 500 index.The stock price dipped towards $10 in 1999, only to soar to $40 by 2008, while returning over $30 in dividends- a remarkable 22% annualized return.Investors who properly timed the last market bottom were richly rewarded.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Obviously, these numbers are somewhat irrelevant for investors deciding on shares today, but I hope to illustrate the potential returns from this business model during boom cycles.</span>The tanker market in the late 1990s and early 2000s was very similar to the run from 2011-2014 with tepid global expansion and tanker oversupply weighting down spot-rates.Full dividend and share price history (Google Finance) is shown below.Papaeconomou ( bearish article link ) provides decent math on his dividend sustainability figures, but I see closer to $11k/day breakeven point based on historical performance.Regardless, his conclusion that funding a $0.22/qtr dividend will require average spot rates of around $23k/day seems valid.However, viewing the yield in its 8.75% yield context clearly highlights the market's doubts of continuing payouts.If the market believed the $0.88 annual dividend was guaranteed, and even likely to grow, then NAT would trade at a yield similar to telecoms and utility companies (4-6%), or a share price of approximately $15-$20.NAT not only trades at higher yields than similar 'yield-plays', but also trades at higher multiples than its closest peers.Unfortunately, this is a trend that has plagued NAT for the entirety of its public life (historical average yield in March (1999-2015) is just over 10%).I believe this trend will continue due to NAT's slightly aging fleet, but I believe the payout growth will buoy the stock.Throughout the public life of NAT, the market has priced in yield drops, and appears to be currently pricing in annual dividends much closer to $0.60/yr, which would only require spot rates of approximately $18,500 to deliver.Yearly spot rates averages have been near or above $18,500 for 14 of the past 16 years (2012 and 2013 under).The below sheet highlights NAT's dividend abilities based on spot rates ranging from $15k/day to $60k/day.I have set in green what I believe to be realistic, perhaps even conservative, TCE figures for the near medium term along with yield ranges of 6-11%.This highlights the $15-$20 stock price range if the market believes a $1.20-$1.60 continuing yield is credible.I believe spot rates need to be compared to long-term historical averages instead of simply the past few years in order to get a bigger picture.Papaeconomou and most other bears often make the near-sighted forecasting mistake of only looking back 3-5 years.Graphs below highlight the long-term view of yearly averages since 2000.As easily observed, 2011-2013 was a tough time for this market.The other 13 years (including YTD '15) witnessed rates over $20k, with 10 years over $30k, and 8 years at or above $40k.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With short-term oil volatility leading to increased ocean storage, with 1M barrels of capacity, even day-rates of $50k are 'affordable' to spot traders who are hoping for higher crude prices.</span>If oil prices go up even $5, up to 3 months of ocean storage would yield a profit.With US storage reaching full capacity , I expect this trend to increase.This is a short-term catalyst for 2015, but volatile oil markets are a strong stimulant for the tanker market.If the US eliminates the crude export ban, cross-Atlantic oil trading could provide a long-term boost to tanker rates, although VLCC carriers would likely see a larger net boost.A recent chart from Teekay Tankers highlights the strong market for early 2015, especially compared with 2013, the record-low year since the 1990s.I don't believe $50k-$60k/day rates (current Spring '15 average performance) are sustainable over the next decade, but just for the sake of a 'bull-case' argument for NAT, this would free up approximately $3.40-$4.20 for annual dividends.Applying this to a 6-8% yield (riskier-end of utility yields) could result in a maximized share price of up to $70 ($40-$70 range).This type of near or medium upside is unlikely, but it's interesting to note the current trading level ($10) prices in zero upside, and actually predicts brutal, unprecedented, rates over the next decade.Investors must examine a company's debt exposure prior to taking any risk on future recoveries.In NAT's case, the sheet is nearly pristine - $100M in cash versus $250M of debt.On a per vessel basis, NAT's debt load is under $7M, with current market value running approximately $16M (1998 vessels) to $37M (mid-2000s) to $57M (2011).As broken down in the next section, NAT's real-time market value Debt-to-Asset ratio is very conservative.Most lenders are comfortable with 40-60% of loan value, which in NAT's case could open the window for up to $200M-$300M in additional debt financing (including new builds) without additional equity required.Obviously, asset valuations change with underlying market conditions, but based on current vessel pricing, there is much more upside than downside.Just the scrap value alone of these vessels is currently close to $10M each.With the combination of subscription broker data (used in above analysis) and help from VesselsValue.com (charts below), I have compiled the live fleet values for NAT.As previously asserted, NAT has a very low D/A of approximately 24%.Expansion to 40%, which is still conservative, would allow an additional $100M of debt, while 60% would allow over $200M.This does not include the likely 50-60% of financing available for the two newbuilds - all together additional debt capacity is in the $200-$300M range.I believe it is very unlikely for NAT to ever exceed the 40% debt/market value range, but I am simply highlighting the flexibility.Expansion to 40% exactly at today's valuations would allow access to $152M in new debt.In nearly any industry, especially near a cyclical bottom, 40% D/A is considered conservative.The key factor in the above chart is how vessel market values have crumbled since 2008 and have barely made a recovery.In other words, 40% D/A at these levels, already a conservative level, is far more conservative than in previous years.Also note the demolition value alone (more relevant as vessels near the 25-year mark), is nearly 1/3 of the total value, and clearly exceeds the current net debt level of $150M (24% D/A).A full list of individual vessel valuations, courtesy of VesselsValue.com , is included below.NAT's average fleet age is over 12 years, with the average economic life of Suezmax vessels at either 25 or 30 years depending on economic conditions.These vessels must undergo a "special survey" every 5 years, which often results in scrapping either at exactly 25 or 30 years.Obviously, with spot prices above $30k/day, these vessels will survive to 30 years, but under a more bearish scenario, NAT's fleet is almost 50% 'expired', and scrapping will begin in 2022.Since NAT has paid for expansion via new equity and pays out close to 100% of operating cash flows, this is a major potential issue for long-term shareholders.However, I believe the concerns are far overblown considering the price of NAT shares versus potential earnings.If rates exceed $30k/day over the next decade, NAT will return over triple its valuation in dividends.Even if the company dissolved in 2030 due to a defunct fleet, investors would still earn annualized returns exceeding 10%.Another positive factor is the $10M value of each ship as salvage scrap.At 60% leverage, NAT can purchase a brand new vessel for every 3 scrappages with $0 in new equity.At a 1-1 ratio, NAT can purchase a new vessel with only $18M in new equity - at current rates this equates to 1.8M shares or a 2% dilution, hardly the disaster scenario Papaeconomou and other bears tout.As evidenced by management's restrained behavior during the 2011-2014 slump, a more likely scenario is that NAT will hold off on large-scale fleet expansion until the market recovers and equity pricing is more favorable.This will allow share issuance at likely 2-3x today's rates and negligible dilution for expansion.It's entirely feasible for NAT to expand to a higher vessel/share ratio (currently at 3.7M shares per vessel including the two new buildings), even at today's depressed prices.In late 2013, NAT announced a new company, Nordic American Offshore (NYSE: NAO ), which would operate platform supply vessels (PSVs) for oilrigs with a similar structure to NAT.NAT provided initial capital of $65M for 26% of the company.During weakness in late 2014, NAT purchased additional shares of NAO, raising their stake to approximately 4.5M units.Despite NAT's investment in late 2014, NAO shares have continued to drop and currently trade around $9.20.NAT's investment carries a market value of $41M, which shows a short-term loss, but the more important factor is the $1.80 in annual dividend payments.This will result in an additional $0.10/yr upside available to NAT shareholders.If NAO struggles, NAT can only lose their small equity investment, whereas any upside will flow to the parent company.NAT is in the driver's seat regarding NAO's prospects.If NAO struggles and must dilute its shareholders, NAT can purchase equity at basement prices, and will benefit when rates improve.This would be similar to a large hedge fund that owned NAT in the late 1990s, then piled in during the 1999 slump, and eventually recouped over 4x of the original investment in dividends alone.I'm not advocating NAO ownership due to the potential for large-scale dilution if a weak oil services market continues, but I like the position NAT is in.Historical Yield and Comparable Companies The fundamental thrust of this valuation case is that NAT trades significantly below its reasonable yield expectations based both on forward TCE possibilities and NAT's peers.I've included my projections for yield potential above, and these projections demonstrate that if current rates of over $50k/day persist, then NAT will be easily capable of paying out over $3/yr.A chart below compares NAT with peers Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK ), Ardmore Shipping (NYSE: ASC ), Navios Maritime Acquisition (NYSE: NNA ), and Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG ).None of these are perfect comps, without any pure Suezmax plays, but global market fundamentals will impact earnings and dividend potential in a similar fashion.An additional chart highlights NAT's historical forward yield range from March of 1999 to March of 2015, which shows that NAT has historically been a very high-yield play.These historical figures suggest that as NAT boosts its dividend, the market may be wary to assign a strong yield premium.Playing a close yield spread average against NAT's projections for a 24-vessel fleet with cash break-even expenditures of $11.5k/day results in the following table of price projections.Note the actual average break even is closer to $11k/day and the model also incorporates 97.5% utilization (average is closer to 98.5%).The pink represents what I believe are current market expectations, yellow is a transition phase, and green is what I believe the current market reality should be pricing in.I believe NAT is tremendously undervalued due to a market that is fully pricing in Suezmax spot rates of under $20k/day for perpetuity.While the bears have decent arguments and the dividend is certainly at-risk if dire conditions return, the market has already priced in huge spot rate declines and has placed nearly a 0% premium on future upside.I believe NAT is fairly priced at $15-$20 in today's market based on a range of medium-term (2-5 years) yield potential.With average TCE rates of $30k/day over the next decade, NAT will be able to yield approximately $1.70-$1.80 per year.I place a 'fair yield' range of 8-11% on these estimates due to the NAT historical averages despite the fact that most similar comp yields are often closer to a 4-6% range.NAT has often traded based on a mixture between yield and long-term tanker prospects.Currently, the prospects are dominating the share price and leading to an artificially high yield.In 2011, NAT traded richly despite weak tanker market prospects because of a high amount of retail investor focus on the yield.In 2011, as the market for tankers diminished, NAT commanded a record 4% yield and ended the year yielding 10%.2012 ranged from 7-12%, and 2013 returned to a 5-8% range (lower payout).I believe that as NAT undoubtedly boosts the dividend for Q1-15, and if rates persist strong (above $40k/day) for Q2-15, the market will take notice.NAT typically makes their dividend announcement in early May, and based on current averages, I believe a dividend of at least 40c is feasible.This dividend and Q2 spot rates alone could push shares above $15 by this summer.NAT presents compelling risk-reward opportunity as a component of an aggressive portfolio.Any decision to purchase these shares should be done with a long-term horizon in mind and with proper consideration to the inherent risks.Although I believe with proper coverage and understanding of the NAT business model, a $15-$20 range is fair, it may take several quarters of sustained Suezmax strength before investors take notice.NAT options for July 2015 also have compelling upside if you believe the market is in a clear disconnect - I have purchased some $11 calls for July.I believe there's potential for these strikes to return up to 10x based on my purchase price of 44c, but obviously, this is a far riskier play.I welcome discussion below, but please remember that I am not your personal investment advisor.I am simply bringing what I believe are compelling opportunities to the discussion table.As always,
