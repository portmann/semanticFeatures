General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) | Seeking Alpha Mar.8, 2015 12:30 PM ET �|� About: General Electric Company (GE) by: Dividend Dreams Love it or hate it, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) is a fantastic stock to hold in a Dividend Growth Investor portfolio.I currently own 32.75 shares at a cost basis of $26.68.On March 5, I purchased 130 shares at $25.61 per share, totaling $3,330.47.I now own 157.75 shares of General Electric stock.This purchase will add $110 dollars to my annual dividend income .I am excited to have the opportunity to add more General Electric stock to my Dividend Dreams Portfolio .GE is an iconic American company.GE has been inventing and first to market with many products we rely on.Today, GE continues to innovate and has a bright future.In 1878 Thomas Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company.General Electric was formed in 1892.From radio, television, water, aviation, healthcare, rail and energy, GE has been at the forefront of technological advances.The highlights of GE are far too many to mention.I have selected a handful of achievements below.General Electric Historical Highlights 1879 - Invented the first commercially practical carbon filament incandescent lamp 1879 - Introduced dynamos, which allowed for the conversion mechanical energy into electrical energy 1910 - GE sells the first electric range under the Hotpoint brand 1914 -

A weakening international economy.GE sells products and services globally and weak currencies will have an effect on revenue.Risk 2 - Energy sector performance.GE will likely suffer losses in the oil and gas sectors.I see both risks as short term, so I am not concerned.For me, GE is a buy and hold stock.I am just fine if the stock price drops for the next few years, while I reinvest dividends.Given the size of General Electric's moat, I am not concerned with risk to the long-term viability of this company.General Electric has a long history of generating value for its shareholders.The company has a history of innovation and excellence.I intend to buy and hold GE stock for the long haul.Source: Buying More General Electric We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
