Rand Paul (R., Ky.) to subject the Fed to congressional investigations of its monetary policy decisions.Is there any room for common ground between the Brooklyn-born economist and the Alabama senator over the Fed’s structure and oversight?One area to watch is the role of directors at regional Fed banks.The 1913 law that created the Fed imposed an odd public-private structure in which commercial banks pay in capital to the 12 regional Fed banks.The commercial banks get dividends from the Fed on the paid-in capital.They also get to choose six of the nine seats on the boards of the regional Fed banks, three of which are bankers themselves.Fed officials insist these directors have no role in the Fed’s regulation of banks.Still, the banks’ unique role creates an appearance of a conflict of interest and has been a source of embarrassment for the Fed in the past.J.P. Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon was on the New York Fed’s board when the Fed was brokering a J.P. Morgan purchase of Bear Stearns in March 2008; Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld was on the New York Fed board before Lehman’s collapse; Stephen Friedman, a Goldman Sachs director, was the New York Fed Board chairman during the financial crisis, when the Fed was supporting Goldman and he was buying Goldman stock .Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) has called for a review of the regional bank governance structure.The Fed might welcome some change on this front to address the appearance problem.While lawmakers are at it, they might consider changing paid-in capital at the regional Fed banks to a user fee for access to the Fed’s discount window.The paid-in capital creates an appearance the banks own the Fed.Fed Leans

Watchdog Warns Government Bonds Not a Risk-Free Investment.A financial markets watchdog group headed by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the risk-free treatment of government bonds in some regulations may lead to excessive investment in these types of securities.A report from the European Systemic Risk Board, which Mr. Draghi chairs, noted that “for decades, the regulatory treatment of sovereign debt has significantly discounted and, in many cases, ignored the possibility of default on exposures that are denominated and funded in the country’s own currency.?ECB’s Cœuré: Bank Will Be Able to Find Bonds to Buy.ECB Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré said the ECB will be able to find enough securities to buy as part of its public-sector
