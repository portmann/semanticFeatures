Morgan and Morgan Stanley – had to make last-minute revisions to their dividend and buyback plans to get themselves through this year’s test with capital ratios intact.A fourth, Bank of America, got approval conditional on changes to its capital planning processes.That’s a testament to the fraught experience the stress test has become for banks and the knee-buckling last steps they have to take before they’re done.The good news, though, is that all of the U.S. banks passed.(The U.S. units of Deutsche Bank and Santander Group didn’t.)The 31 firms tested had combined common equity of $1.1 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2014, up $641 billion since 2009.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Let’s hope the rest of the financial system untouched by the Fed’s annual hazing ritual is

sharply.Accusations of a global �currency war� filled the air,� writes Greg Ip in the Wall Street Journal.Yet focusing solely on the dollar’s fall gives a blinkered view.As the Fed bought bonds, their yields fell, and so investors rushed to other markets in search of better returns.While that pushed those countries’ currencies up, it also pushed their interest rates down and stock prices higher.This wasn�t always welcome, as some of those countries were combating inflation and asset bubbles.Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund concluded the net effect of these impacts on the rest of the world was positive.The ECB�s QE Is Working Well.Opponents of QE had argued not only that it was unnecessary but also that it would not do much,� writes Angel Ubide on the Peterson
