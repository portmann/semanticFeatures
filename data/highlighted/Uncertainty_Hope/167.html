Capital Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � Favorable industry trend is being more than offset by concentration risk within one customer- Wal-Mart.The recent contract renewal with Wal-Mart was just a one-year deal which we think belies the bullish argument that the relationship is in tact and will thrive.We think the potential scenarios with Wal-Mart are all bad ones for even with a longer-term contract renewal next year, expect a significant cut in commissions.Payment processors and prepaid card companies as a whole are a fast-growing industry as they race to serve the unbanked markets.We have written about two names in the 28-stock space including Blackhawk Network Holdings (NASDAQ: HAWK ) and Net 1 UEPS (NASDAQ: UEPS ), both of which we like.There are others as well which have strong fundamental stories and niche areas of the market that provide a moat around the business.One that we see in a weak spot (and weakening) is Green Dot (NYSE: GDOT ).Green Dot Corporation is a bank holding company that is the largest provider of prepaid debit card products and prepaid card reloading services.Their products include the Green Dot-branded and co-branded GPR cards, Visa-branded gift cards, and reload services through their Green Dot network.Earnings Growth Unsustainable and Dependent On Wal-Mart While we like the prepaid and payment processing industry due to its technology-driven growth and massive (and nascent) market opportunity, the space has little to no barriers to entry for the mass market.It is the niche players that are going to capture share and grow sustainably within the industry.Given the new market and increasing competition, Green Dot's growth appears unsustainable.In 2013, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) accounted for approximately 64% of total operating revenues and upwards of 82% of total units sold.The next three largest operators accounted for the next 22% of operating revenues.We think Wal-Mart is going to again reduce the price it pays Green Dot for its cards, similar to what they did back in 2009 when they lowered the commission from $9 to $3.The rest of their large customers pay around $5 in fees.The company and Wal-Mart recently agreed to a one-year contract extension which would extend their deal through May of 2016.We think this is extremely bearish since they weren't able to reach a longer-term deal.Given the amount of exposure that Green Dot has to Wal-Mart, it appears the downside risk from here is extremely high and likely to get higher.We think Wal-Mart played hardball as they clearly know how reliant they are to Green Dot's survival.We also believe that even if they can sustain the account post-2016, it will have to come at a significantly reduced rate, likely 50% below the current commission rate given industry dynamics.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even the CEO on the third quarter call (prior to the news of the one-year extension) seemed hesitant stating, "We have a tremendous amount of employees who work on the Wal-Mart account, so we certainly hope that our chances are good for winning a renewal.</span>We never count our chickens before they hatch."We think the fees once attained, like $9 per Green Dot, are long gone and heading to the sub-$1 area given the technology improvements and scale of the larger players.AMEX's Bluebird technology allows, for a one-time $5 fee, free reloading and no monthly fees, at other locations.Whereas the MoneyCard sold at Wal-Mart through Green Dot, sells for approximately $3 but they charge a $3 monthly fee and $3 to reload money on to the card.We don't think Wal-Mart will allow itself to be priced out of any market, even one where they make very little revenue.We think the downside catalyst comes within the next 12 months as one of three scenarios plays out.The first is Wal-Mart announcing its plans to cease its relationship with Green Dot and going with a competitor.This would be due to the apparent problems in the recent negotiations in finding a longer-term deal and a pricing point that they liked.We think this is the most likely outcome.The second CorpusPath would be if they simply add competition and bring in another prepaid card manager like Amex.Competing products at retail organizations would be nothing new as Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) and CVS (NYSE: CVS ) both took this CorpusPath in 2012, severely hurting Green Dot sales at these locations.Lastly, and the most amicable for Green Dot, would be if they slash the fee rate on their products in order to save the Wal-Mart account.This would significantly impair their revenue generation.We ran through some numbers and believe that fees would need to at least be cut in half to salvage the business.At ~$1.50 in commission rate, revenue would decline by over one-third overnight.But we think it would give their other large retailers a negotiating platform to reduce their commission rates as well compounding the problem.None of these scenarios are likely to play out well for Green Dot.Growth Rates Have Slowed Dramatically Revenue from Wal-Mart continues to decline as a percentage of overall revenue.This has helped EBITDA stay positive given the better fee rate generation earned outside of their Wal-Mart business.However, we think this is simply masking the Wal-Mart problem, which we highlighted in length above.Should the company lose the entire contract, they will see their share price cut in half.However, we have read many bullish stances on the stock note that the percentage of sales derived from Wal-Mart is down significantly over the last few years, diversifying the revenue base away from Wal-Mart.But this is only because the comps at Wal-Mart have fallen dramatically with five quarters in a row of negative revenue growth at the store.The best way to diversify is not to have your largest customer, by far, lose significant share and sales improving, the way your ex-Wal-Mart revenues appear.EBITDA generation is also another area of weakness.Adjusted EBITDA in the latest quarter was just $13.1 million, down 40% from the third quarter.In each of the last four quarters, EBITDA has fallen, from the $31.3 million generated in the first quarter to the most recent $13.1 million.We think this has been aided by significantly high processing expenses which have increased at double-digit rates in each of the last several years and reduced stock-based compensation.EBITDA margins continue to erode recently hitting just 9%, which is anemic for an asset-lite company with high incremental margins.We think the sell-side, which has been way behind the eight-ball on this name, is starting to recognize the cracks in the business model and are reducing their estimates.Over the last four weeks, EBITDA estimates for fiscal 2015 have come down nearly 10%, according to Bloomberg.More troubling is that pre-tax income has come down over 15% with several of the more recent estimates coming in well below that median level of $94 million with one (William Blair) at just $67 million.We would argue that any estimates for 2016 are going to be highly suspect given that the Wal-Mart contract extension will run out in May of that year.Like we noted above, our short thesis rests on that contract not being renewed with a press release stating such coming sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas of this year.We think that without Wal-Mart, the company earns at most $50 million in adjusted EBITDA, and likely closer to $40 million or less.We apply a 6x multiple to that figure and assigning most of the cash on the balance sheet towards the Green Dot bank (for capital requirements), gets us our target price of ~$7 per share by early next year.We think Green Dot is in a precarious position within an industry that we really like and see strong secular tailwinds over the long-term as the alternative banking system grows.The thesis on Green Dot rests 100% on the Wal-Mart dilemma, nothing more.The company's recent investor presentation was quite intriguing for it completely ignored this problem and detailed all these "growth initiatives" that they are implementing.However, those initiatives are not likely to materialize, or will augment growth from a much lower revenue base should the company not be able to lock-in a longer-term deal with Wal-Mart.Even if they are able to secure such a deal, we think it will likely be at much lower commission rates impairing profitability significantly.The only saving grace we see, and a risk to being short, would be consolidation, which we think is going to start materializing in earnest within the industry.Source: Green Dot: Wal-Mart Contract Will Be Lost Next Year Disclosure: The author has no
