and thanks everybody for joining us today.2014 we achieved a number of important milestones, while we continued to implement our strategies for increasing revenue.We controlled cost, secured partnerships and we’re continuing to pursue independent verification of our claims.First of all we’re pleased to report that revenue doubled in the Metal Cutting segment in 2014 versus 2013.And we continue to carefully control cost in this business line and all business lines.Our recent acquisition of Equipment Sales and Service, also known as ESSI is already integrated and should continue to contribute to our growth and bring our industrial gas business to profitability in 2015.Now that we have secured distribution with over 20 years of experience in our metal cutting market we are successfully using this as a springboard for growth.We have fulfilled initial orders and are receiving repeat orders from multiple customers and distributors, both new and existing for MagneGas 2.This also gives us greater access to customers around the Tampa Bay area and is a catalyst to sell MagneGas 2 while allowing the company to grow a steady stream of recurring revenue.We have been marketing MagneGas 2 fuel since to existing ESSI customers and on February 24th we shipped our largest ever single order of fuel to a winery in California for a furnace refurbishment project.This particular customer was interested in MagneGas 2, not only as a safer and more productive replacement to acetylene but also because it’s the only renewable cutting gas available on the market.We received approval by the Clearwater, Florida and New York City Fire Departments for the use of MagneGas fuel as a replacement for acetylene and metal cutting and extractions and demolitions.Both cities have begun to purchase MagneGas as a replacement to acetylene and other cutting systems used by fire fighters.Most vehicles used by the fire departments in United States are equipped with acetylene gas and other systems to use in emergencies.MagneGas is stored in cylinders which are much lighter than acetylene making it easier to handle and is a compressed stable gas as opposed to acetylene which is chemically unstable.In addition, MagneGas produces a much smaller heat affected zone which can be critical to prevent further injury in the event of human extraction from a vehicle or dwelling.On Tuesday we also announced an exclusive agreement with Municipal Equipment Company LLC to carry MagneGas fuel and the MagneTote for the purposes of sale to fire departments and first responders.We are also in a process of setting up demonstrations for large opportunities in the military sector and one particular recent new opportunity at one of the largest military subcontractors in the United States.And in fact just today we spoke with the U.S. Navy about scheduling a gas delivery to perform another test to be confirmed shortly.In October we announced the company purchased new headquarters within an industrial park just outside of Tampa Florida.The facility is 18,000 square feet and that will give us the ability to demonstrate our technology to potential customers, thereby enhancing the customer experience.This additional space will also allow the company for expansion and will include a larger area for research and development.Our new headquarters will provide us close approximately to existing and potential customers, which will further our growth.Turning now to our liquid waste processing business line, in December we announced that we signed an MOU with equipment purchase and distribution agreement with Afnetco Recycling of South Africa.Afnetco selected MagneGas technology to be part of their growth strategy plant based in South Africa and we’re looking forward to working with them.We’re also in advanced stages of negotiations with several potential joint venture partners and distributors for the sale of equipment internationally and initiated grant applications both in United States and in Europe for international expansion opportunities.Just last month we deployed our latest Mobile Venturi sterilization system to a major hog farm in Indiana.The sterilization system is expected to process hog manure and will turn it into high quality low odor fertilizer that can be safely used on crops.In addition, the MagneGas fuel will be produced as a byproduct that can be co-fired with propane or natural gas to reduce the fuel needs.We are in the process of optimizing our system to meet the needs of this hog farm and are integrating complementary technologies to improve sterilization volumes.Once the demonstration is complete, the farmer plans to purchase sterilization system and partner with us to transform the way manure is valued and handled by the agricultural industry, starting with swine farms.We believe that having the ability to test our new high flow Venturi system in the real world environment with such a highly respected stakeholder in the agricultural industry really speaks volumes of our technology.We are now in discussion with other large hog farm producers who are also interested in using our sterilization system internationally.Just yesterday we announced we have filed provisional patents, related to microbiology which enhanced our capabilities regarding non-fish based manure sterilization and we are negotiating with JV partners to take this enhanced solution to market.We have initiated an aggressive new marketing campaign aimed at pursuing international equipment sales in strategic areas around the world, through social media, industry events and a network of independent brokers.The company also retained two experienced consultants to this market; Jim Cohen, who has substantial experience in waste water and hazardous waste remediation and Ambassador Jack Brewer who has international access to funding and partners through the United Nations.Finally, today we announced the panelists of our World Water Day event at United Nations on March 23rd with water and sustainable development as the theme.The World Water Day event will be attended by representatives of the agricultural industry, UN officials and ambassadors to raise awareness to solutions for using water and waste water wisely and more efficiently.I will also provide you an update of our co-combustion activities but at this point I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Luisa Ingargiola, who will review our financial performance in more detail.Thanks Ermanno.Overall revenue increased to $1.023 million in 2014 versus $989,000 in 2013.Metal cutting revenue increased by 101% to $875,000 for 2014 versus $436,000 in 2013.This is primarily due to an increase in MagneGas fuel sales and the revenue we received from the acquisition of ESSI, Inc. on October 27th.General operating expenses excluding stock payments remained relatively flat and were at $4.7 million at December 2014 as compared to $4.9 million during the same period in 2013.This reflects our successful efforts to control expenses and improve efficiency within the organization.Given all the additional opportunities MagneGas is working in 2014 versus 2013, maintaining relatively flat operating expenses was a significant achievement for us.Expenses increased in two key areas, namely investor relations and research and development.Expenses for investor relations and public expenses increased to $475,000 for full year 2014 versus $199,000 for the same period in 2013.Research and development increased to $387,000 for full year 2014 versus $180,000 for the same period in 2013.This is due to an increase in expenses related to the development of co-combustion, the oil [ph] processing Venturi system and the new MagneGas 2 fuel.At the end of December of 2014 we had a cash balance of $5.1 million versus $217,000 on December of 2013.We had a significant equity investment this year which has given the company positive working capital to continue operations for at least the next 12 months during which time we anticipated equipment sales in one of our three business lines.I would also like to discuss the NASDAQ compliance notice.As previously announced the company received notification that it did not meet the minimum NASDAQ listing requirements as it relates to our current stock price.The company has been given until June 9 to regain compliance by achieving a minimum stock price of $1 per share.In addition NASDAQ provides companies on its exchange the opportunity to extend this out of compliance period for an additional 180 days in certain circumstances.We believe that our successful execution of our strategy will continue and ultimately be reflected in our stock price.I will now turn the call back over to Ermanno to elaborate on some of our initiatives then we'll open the call to questions.Thank you very much.Thank you, Luisa.Before we wrap up I just want to give an update about our co-combustion activities which is an exciting opportunity for MagneGas and a potential strategic shift in the energy markets.As we have discussed in the past MagneGas fuel has a very high combustion flame temperature of 10,500 degrees or 1,500 degrees C as independently verified by the City College of New York.Combustion efficiency is highly dependent on combustion temperature, a higher combustion temperature usually results in higher efficiency that typically means lower emissions.Along with our partners we have identified that MagneGas, combined with a cold flu gas or smoke from coal combustion plants allows for a secondary or post-combustion event.The beauty of this simple solution is it not only increases the overall combustion efficiency but our internal tests have shown to reduce emissions to better than natural gas levels while reducing CO2 by 30% to 40%.Once confirmed this could be one of the only technologies that reduces CO2 while saving money through increased efficiency as opposed to carbon capture schemes that had multi-billion dollar investments over the past decade.To-date we have conducted increasingly advance testing in Australia, Florida and in Michigan.Each fuel test resulted in a CO2 reduction of between 30% to 40% and increase in heat output and a significant reduction in carbon monoxide and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We are currently working with a confidential partner alongside a major utility, U.S. utility.</span>We have been demonstrating for over one year now and expect to have final data sometime in Q2.If the data comes back as we expect we believe this would be transformational for the company based on the pollution reduction, emission boon and cost savings we can offer to coal power plants.Not only does that system cost effectively reduce emissions but we believe it has also improved the overall energy output of the plant by literally re-burning the smoke from coal fired power plants.We believe this would be well received by the coal power industry as many plants are slated to spend billions of dollars on complicated scrubbing technology which does not increase efficiency.In conclusion we remain focused on expanding our footprint both domestically and internationally of MagneGas2.We will continue to look for strategic partners who can offer market access and complementary technology while verifying our claims related to coal and energy sector while controlling cost.I would like to thank everybody for joining the call.We are making progress at MagneGas and look forward to keeping you praised of our new developments as they unfold.At this point we would to open the call up for questions.Thank you.We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions].Our first question comes from Susan Harding with Branch Capital [ph].Please proceed.Thank you.Yes, can you tell me what are the next steps after MagneGas receives the final data from co-combustion testing?Yeah, thank you.The next steps really are to assess what could be our future industry partners.We believe MagneGas believes, and our partners believe to take this to the next step we are really going to need a power company or somebody who is involved in the industry to lead the way, cut the CorpusPath through bureaucracy and help us to quickly monetize this for the company.That could mean in initial investment.That could mean further development but certainly if the tests continue as they are and the results come out as we expect this is going to cause a lot of excitement in the industry and a lot of interested parties.That’s a very good question, because that’s been the source of our discussion within MagneGas and our partners.We believe that we would not be actually selling equipment necessarily to that industry.There a lot of ways to monetize it.We could sell the energy savings, we could sell just the gas.There is lots of things that we could do and really there is a whole host of different contracts and ways to monetize it.But we plan on not necessarily selling the units into the industry, that’s our initial objective.Thank you.Can you please give us an update on the navy, any work you are doing with the navy?As you know or as many of you know we have been testing with the navy since July of 2011.The navy is a large organization.Testing can take many different paths as we found over in Tremonton.The new opportunity that we have with the navy is one that’s based on productivity, or the value productivity and they have asked for a completely different type of test, a test that MagneGas is involved in hands on, so that we can provide the right amount of training.This is a facility that’s taking care of refurbishments and modernization of ships.So productivity for them means getting ships out sooner to the war fighters and to the arm forces.So they are very, very focused on anything, any technology that can help them work faster, safer and better.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So we hope to confirm over the next month or so that testing has commenced.</span>As I mentioned we just spoke to them today about arranging shipment of the gas and starting to discuss logistics of actually going up there to perform the test alongside.Great, thank you.One more question, can you also give us the latest update regarding the sterilization system on a hog farm?Yes, our unit has been up there, our sterilization Venturi unit is up there several times [ph].The sterilization system is operating as it should.It has achieved sterilization and we’ve confirmed that through independent labs.That gives you lots of opportunities to handle the manure.The entire market of the swine manure is something that ultimately we are looking to change the way the swine industry treats manure.We are working with the partner, I was up in Indiana with him not long ago and the vision of the solution is much larger than just having a MagneGas solution.It changes a lot of things.It opens up lots of opportunities for actually selling the manure either as sterilized solids or even as liquids.[Operator Instructions].There are no further questions.At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.Well, thank you everybody.As you can see we are continuing to execute on our strategy and as we noticed just today we are continuing to see progress in several areas.We are very encouraged by the MagneGas2 sales.It’s very well received by the industry and as Luisa pointed out we are doing many more projects which are customer focused than were in the past and we are successfully controlling costs.So overall we are - our confidence is growing every day.Those of you who attended the customer day recently held here at MagneGas headquarters in Florida could see that.They could see that the team has changed, that the culture is changed and that we are very focused on executing successfully on our strategy.This concludes today’s teleconference.You may disconnect your lines at time.And thank you for your participation.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the
