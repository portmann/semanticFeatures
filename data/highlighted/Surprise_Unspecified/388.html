(NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha The comparisons between Facebook and Twitter have been rampant in recent years.Many longs claim Twitter finally had its "Facebook moment," meaning effective monetization and a visible CorpusPath for strong revenue growth.I will look at Facebook's meteoric rise from $18 to $80 and determine a range of outcomes for Twitter assuming similar performance at key business metrics.Being short Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) as a hedge to my long portfolio, I was thinking the other day, what if Twitter actually did just have its "Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) moment"?Facebook went from a floundering, desktop-ridden website to an advertising powerhouse and cash flow machine in a relatively short period of time.I needed to obtain a clearer picture of Twitter's upside, should it have a business renaissance like Facebook.Both Twitter and Facebook operate in the social media space and derive the vast majority of their revenues from ads located on their platforms.Even though the content and display mechanisms are different, the content is exclusively user created.Obviously, there are no two companies exactly alike, but I would argue the closest thing to Facebook is Twitter, aside from Instagram maybe.But a larger audience and slightly different content should not make the comparison void.I will look at Facebook's meteoric rise from approximately $18 to $80, impose the performance in key operating metrics onto Twitter, then assign potential valuations under similar market conditions.I will not be discussing the long term viability of either business, logged out users, certain accounting practices or any other hot-button issue.These topics have merit and should be considered before investing with or against either company, but I will confine this article to the following primary metrics and the forecasted growth rates: average revenue per user (ARPU), monthly average users (MAU), "other" revenue streams, total revenue, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA (accepted under current market conditions), GAAP Earnings, and a market valuation.Parameters and assumptions used for the comparison: It was necessary to establish the quarter that each company had its "moment."For Facebook, that period was Q2 13'.For Twitter, let's assume conservatively (from a short's perspective) that quarter was Q4 14', creating a "business time lag" of six quarters.The Facebook data from Q2 13' to Q4 14' will be used in modeling and predicting key metric performance and possible valuations for Twitter from Q1 15' to Q2 16'.It was necessary to split the MAU and ARPU metrics between North America and the rest of the world due to the large differences in ARPU.When possible, I imposed Facebook's growth rates directly into Twitter's numbers.Just by looking at the Twitter and Facebook MAU and ARPU, it is evident they are on different seasonal patterns.This was ignored.Twitter does not provide ARPU as a direct metric, but can easily be found by multiplying ad rev per 1K timeline views by timeline views per MAU (in thousands).This simple table shows Facebook's ARPU, broken down into two demographics: U.S. + Canada and the rest of the world.The growth is quite impressive and actually accelerating for this last quarter, however lumpy it may be.I calculated the second ARPU (World excl.U.S. and Canada) using a weighted average of MAUs and ARPU for the Asia-Pacific, European and Rest of World demographics, as presented in Facebook's 2014 10-K .For Twitter's revenue growth, I modeled a bullish, neutral, bearish and very bearish scenario.ARPU growth was calculated as a percentage of Facebook's growth in this metric.MAU and "Data Licensing and Other" growth rates were independent of Facebook and estimated with historical data from Twitter.Because Facebook's user growth is far superior to Twitter, it was not viable to use the former's growth trajectory to predict the latter's.There is not much growth here other than ad rev per 1K timeline views.Timeline views are essentially flat in both demographics and users are slightly up, although more so with international markets.Now onto the different scenarios for Twitter's revenue growth.The assumptions and growth rates are listed below each chart.The noted growth rates (below each table) do not account for seasonality, but seem reasonable should the company continue heading in the right direction.The MAU growth rates take into account both user and timeline views growth.For instance, a 4% user growth would be virtually equivalent to a 2% user growth with 2% timeline views growth, or 0% user growth with 4% timeline views growth, when multiplied by ARPU to get revenues.Besides, most Twitter longs and almost every Twitter short will tell you this story is no longer about user and timeline views growth, but rather monetization.ARPU growth rates were directly linked to Facebook, subject to the time offset.I'm taking the phrase "Facebook moment" literally here.I imagine Twitter longs would be thrilled with the same level of monetization Facebook has demonstrated over the last few quarters, as it has been impressive.There is no doubt Twitter can dramatically increase revenues over the next few quarters, but it all depends on monetization of the existing user base.Note that Twitter's FY 2015 guidance for $2.30-$2.35 billion is between the "Bearish" and "Very Bearish" scenarios.Another interesting debate is where the ceiling might be for ARPU.Facebook has taken this number from $4 to $9 very quickly, and it appears to have gone parabolic.Where this spaceship ends, nobody knows.Is each MAU worth $10?$20?$100?Whether you believe Twitter can monetize similarly to Facebook, this is a metric I will be closely following on Facebook's future earnings releases.Facebook has done a reasonably good job keeping operating costs down except for, well, this last quarter.We'll give Twitter a break and not include the anomaly (I think) for the average.Once again, I simply looked at Facebook's approximate operating expense growth over the last six quarters, took the average and assigned that to Twitter.The compounding effect in the model would overestimate these expenses over time, but for six quarters it is tolerable.These businesses are extremely lumpy so assumptions must be made.Also note the EBITDA adjustments column.I took the non-cash items Twitter uses as adjustments to arrive at its preferred earnings metric of adjusted EBITDA, added them for Facebook's Q2 13' - Q4 14', found the growth rate and then used that to model Twitter's EBITDA adjustments.I will use those numbers to calculate GAAP earnings from adjusted EBITDA in a minute.My fellow bears will get mad at me for showing Twitter containing its costs based on historical standards, as this would be a true change of personality.Once again, I wanted to see where Twitter would be valued if it operated in a manner resembling Facebook during its great run.And finally, we get to what's really important.The chart combines the revenue, GAAP expenses and EBITDA adjustments.On a side note, my numbers for Q4 14' don't match exactly because I left out the interest expense.Here are two graphs showing the range of quarterly earnings outcomes, one GAAP and the other adjusted EBITDA.The earnings are in dollar terms instead of EPS because guessing the outstanding share count over time is a near impossible endeavor.My modeling, based on Facebook's performance over the last six quarters, has produced a very wide range of outcomes, which would match the perception around the stock.It is interesting to note Twitter's guidance for FY2015 of $550-$575 million in adjusted EBITDA doesn't even come close my "Very Bearish" scenario.This is beating a dead horse, but once again it comes back to monetization.Facebook found a way to massively increase the ARPU metric in a short amount of time.If Twitter can match Facebook's excellence in this metric, the stock will appear cheap in just two or three quarters.If the company cannot find a way to get ARPU to $7 or $8, or begin cutting expenses meaningfully while not giving up too much revenue, the stock will remain expensive.Based on the above revenue, operating expenses and earnings calculations, we have arrived at potential valuations.Please note these valuations assume a constant $30 billion market cap (current market cap).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The first thing to notice is anything less than a world-dominating performance and this company will not be profitable in FY 2015 on a GAAP basis, but that's not much of a surprise.</span>However, look at the "Very Bearish" column for adjusted EBITDA... a 37.4 P/E for FY 2015.A multiple around this area could be within reach if the company handily beats estimates for two or three quarters this year.That would give the bulls some firepower, assuming the company's growth rate and monetization efforts continue to maintain positive momentum.Based on the company's FY2015 guidance of $550-$575 million in adjusted EBITDA, the company would trade at approximately 54x 2015 EBITDA if the market cap held constant throughout the year.After readers go through this article and forecast, I'm sure my assumptions and growth rates will be challenged.But that's okay, this is a forecast.Will this article be perfectly accurate predicting Twitter's business success moving forward?I guarantee it won't.But the objective was to show the evolution of Twitter, should it replicate performance at key metrics similar to Facebook, when applicable.Based on company guidance for FY2015, it appears very doubtful Twitter will make a run similar in nature to that of Facebook over the last year-and-a-half.Twitter is no Facebook.So long as the market continues to accept adjusted EBITDA as a legitimate metric to value a company, Twitter can appear reasonably, or even underpriced, with exceptional execution over the next year.Twitter's future valuation will be determined by absolutely, positively one metric... ad rev per 1K timeline views (due to sluggish MAU growth).If this shows any signs of slowing down in the near or intermediate future and user/timeline views growth remains stagnant, expect volatility, sharply to the downside.Facebook and Twitter will be fun stocks to watch.They are high growth, high expense creatures from a new world.Many value investors, such as myself, are not comfortable investing long in companies with these valuations.But within the next few years, we will know who was right and who was wrong.Sources: Company financial data was taken from Facebook and Twitter 10-Q's and 10-K's for the addressed time periods.Other numbers not directly sourced from these documents were
