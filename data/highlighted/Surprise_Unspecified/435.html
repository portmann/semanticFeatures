Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (NASDAQ: PLKI ) Cramer said that Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen ran up to $66 from $61 as investors anticipated that the company would add more leverage to its capital structure.Although that did not happen, the company reported in-line earnings and 9.8% same-store sales growth.As the stock declined post-earnings, Cramer thinks it's a good buying opportunity.To find out more, he interviewed President and CEO Cheryl Bachelder.Commenting on the stock decline after earnings, Bachelder said, "We have had such a good run.What we are proudest of is that we have sustainable quarter to quarter and reliable performance.Over time the market gets it right with our stock, so one day, no problem."Bachelder also mentioned that the company has high same-store sales growth and they have tremendous opportunities to expand internationally.She added that the company's best use of cash is to reinvest in business.Cramer thinks the current price is an opportunity to buy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer is wondering how two companies which are completely different, could be so alike in growth trajectories - the organic drinks company WhiteWave foods (NYSE: WWAV ) and the inorganic drink maker Monster Beverages (NASDAQ: MNST ).</span>"Both are ragers, just selling product like crazy, and even after their enormous moves, both are still must-own stocks either on an earnings or takeover basis."WhiteWave reported in-line earnings few weeks ago, but that was because the company was ramping up factories to meet the demand for plant-based beverages.Monster, on the other hand, reported higher than expected earnings, and now matches Red Bull's market share of 34.8%.Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) is also looking to up its stake in Monster.Cramer said that while both companies are totally different, they have made huge moves lately.He added that it's still not late to buy these two stocks.CEO interview - Blackhawk Network (NASDAQ: HAWK ) Blackhawk is a leading distributor of prepaid gift cards, serving 600 brands and having over 2000 business partners.Cramer said the company has been on fire and has been taking market share from the competition.Even after reporting good numbers, Blackhawk went down due to soft guidance for 2015.To find out more about the quarter, he interviewed Chairman and CEO William Tauscher.Tauscher talked about the accounting adjustment where they put expenses that were marketing and customer related up as a counter revenue, which showed that the company had missed revenue.He said the company had actually beaten revenue.He added that if you remove the non-recurring numbers from guidance, the core business is growing at 15%.Cramer put a rest to all the chatter about the market being in a tech bubble."I am not at all worried about where we are right now.This is not a bubblicious market, and that includes the high-flying technology stocks," said Cramer.Back in the first quarter of 2014, the market was flooded with IPOs from cloud based companies."In a real bubble, the kind that can devastate on a decent portion of the market, you will often get a slew of IPOs as companies try to cash in on the euphoria in the public markets."Cramer had advised investors to stay away from too many IPOs, as that is a sure short way of ruining a bull market.He however has his eyes on consolidations in tech, like Avago's (NASDAQ: AVGO ) acquisition of Emulex (NYSE: ELX ) and Cypress Semiconductors (NASDAQ: CY ) with Spansion (NYSE: CODE ).Bottom line, we are not in a tech bubble as the high-quality stocks that have been fuelling the market this year are nothing like the dot coms.Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ): "It's a yield play."Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.Start your FREE 14-day trial now!We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
