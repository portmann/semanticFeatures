(NASDAQ:ADHD) | Seeking Alpha Recent secondary leaves the company with almost two years worth of cash.Alcobra is a one-drug company simultaneously going for 3 indications in separate clinical trials.All 3 trials are more or less 50-50 events, the first data announcement may happen as soon as next week.Alcobra (NASDAQ: ADHD ) is an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on developing one drug, metadoxine extended release (MDX), to treat various cognitive disorders.The company has a market cap of $99.84 million and on Feb. 12 reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.On Oct. 6, 2014, Alcobra announced disappointing topline results from the AL012 Phase III study which caused a 1-day drop of 57%.Fueled by a secondary offering on Jan. 9, shares have rallied 19% since then.Now, Alcobra has sufficient financing for a second shot at the adult ADHD market.AL012 was a Phase III study in 297 adults with ADHD.The primary endpoint was in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo as measured by the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-INV).Due to extreme placebo responses from four subjects, MDX treatment yielded a positive, but not statistically significant, improvement in the intent to treat (NYSE: ITT ) analysis of all randomized patients.The mean least squares change in CAARS-INV total scores from baseline to Week 6 was -12.0 for the MDX group vs -9.9 for the placebo group (P = .136).Alcobra has a scheduled meeting with the FDA this quarter to discuss the protocol of a second adult ADHD Phase III study, AL016.If the FDA agrees with the proposed design, AL016 will include elements that Alcobra thinks will lessen the impact of high-magnitude and variable placebo responses.For example, AL016 will have a longer treatment period, as management is trusting some reports that the placebo effect decreases with the duration of treatment.However, that notion may be inaccurate, as placebo response rates actually improve with duration (> 12 weeks).On the other hand, MDX is in two more ongoing Phase II trials for different therapeutic areas.AL015 is the first pediatric trial of MDX in ADHD, and recently completed enrollment.AL015 is a single-dose pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability study of MDX in 82 adolescent ages 13 to 18 with ADHD.Meanwhile, recruitment is continuing in AL014, a Phase IIb study, a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled study.AL014 is targeting an enrollment of 60 adolescents and adults with Fragile X syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by several intellectual, social and learning challenges.The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein.The mutation, which involves excessive DNA segment repetitions, occurs in about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females .Metadoxine has orphan drug status in the U.S. for Fragile X syndrome.Financial position: Alcobra's had $21.7 million cash as of December 31, 2014.Cash burn was $7.7 million since Q3 2014 and $28.4 million for the year.On January 14, 2015.Alcobra raised a net profit of $27.9 million from a secondary offering.Management believes their cash is sufficient to last until 2016 and enough to complete all three major ongoing and planned studies-AL014, AL015, and AL016.Cash flows/expenses: Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2014 were $33.1 million, of which R&D expenses were $25.1 million.Total operating expenses for Q4 2014 were $6.8 million compared to $10.6 million in Q3.In Q4, research and development (R&D) expenses were $4.9 million, declining from $8.8 million in the previous quarter as AL012 wound down.R&D should continue to decrease as AL015 and AL014 complete in the next few quarters.With a secure cash position, Alcobra's next two upcoming catalysts are straightforward binary events with high risk/reward: AL015, the Phase II adolescent ADHD study has a data readout expected later this quarter.AL014, the Phase IIb Fragile X Syndrome study, is on track to complete recruitment this quarter and have outcomes reported in Q2 2015.Also in Q2, Alcobra anticipates launching AL016, the second adult ADHD Phase III study, and expects to have the data available by mid-2016 and the New Drug Application filed by the end of 2016.Regarding AL016, it is understandable that Alcobra wants to keep the entire adult ADHD market in play by not restricting patient selection.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, investors may be wondering if it would be more prudent to pursue a subgroup of patients for which MDX would be most likely to benefit.</span>The company may not have a choice.Alcobra has stated that the Predominantly-Inattentive ADHD (PI-ADHD) subtype, which comprised 38% of AL012 patients, "alone did not produce a statistically significant outcome."These were the type of patients in AL008 which showed significant improvement during subtype analysis (see Figure 1).In AL008, a previous adult ADHD Phase IIb trial of similar design to AL012, the effect size was 0.9 in favor of MDX compared to placebo (P < 0.05) on the CAARS-INV total scores from baseline to Week 6 for ADHD-PI patients.The encouraging sign is that unlike in AL008 where the positive results by the PI-ADHD subtype were driven solely by significant improvement in the Inattention subscale, post-hoc analysis found a mITT population where the MDX group was close to attaining significant improvement in both subscales (see Figure 2).In conclusion, even with more rigorous patient inclusion criteria, the outcome of AL016 will be highly in doubt.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.Please be aware of the risks associated
