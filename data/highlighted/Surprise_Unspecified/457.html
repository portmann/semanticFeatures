I had to save for my first home, a wedding, travel, etc.If I could go back and give some advice to my 20-year-old self, I would tell her to save first in a Roth IRA.I would tell her that renting is not bad, she is not ready to buy a house if she has not saved for retirement AND saved for a down payment.If for some reason, she has to buy a house and doesn�t have enough for a down payment, she can always take the principal without penalty to buy her first home.So fill up that Roth IRA pot first before other goals.Compound interest is indeed the strongest force for anyone�s finances.4.Side hustles (declaring income and deducting expenses): I didn�t concentrate on anything other than my job in my 20s, but with the newest disruptive technologies like Uber and AirBnB, a lot of the 20-somethings are making money from more than their jobs.It is a very welcoming trend and also very relevant for taxes.I have heard a couple of arguments that if it is paid in cash, it need not be reported in your taxes.Wrong!Someone also told me that if they get less than $600 from any one source, they don�t have to declare it.Wrong again!!!Uncle Sam wants his money; so every source of income, whether from a traditional job or a side hustle, has to be reported.Even if you earned $10, it has to be reported.Whether you get a 1099 or not, it has to be reported.On the plus side, you can also deduct almost all the expenses you incurred to make that money.So record every single expense and income.If it comes from a hobby, you have to declare the income and can deduct the expenses up to the amount you made with that hobby.If it comes from a business, you can deduct everything, even if it exceeds the income.(However, if you keep declaring losses year after year, the IRS might not consider that as a business, so talk to an accountant to get more clarification in this area.)5.Interest paid for your loans (even if they are paid by someone else): Do you have a student loan that your parents made a payment on?You might think that since they paid the loan, you can�t deduct it.You still could.The IRS considers that as a situation where they paid you the money and you paid your debtor.So, as long as they don�t claim you as a dependent, you can claim that payment on your taxes.6.HSA by employer: If you are eligible for a Health Savings Account, consider taking full advantage of that.It can serve you as an excellent tax saver, a lot more than just paying for your health bills.(For more info: http://www.fivecentnickel.com/2010/02/22/using-your-hsa-as-a-retirement-investment-vehicle/) 7.Early withdrawal penalties: When I started saving for my goals, I was overzealous and opened a CD for everything, as the interest rates were higher.Unfortunately, I also had to break a CD well before it matured.At the time, I didn�t know that the early withdrawal penalty I incurred was tax deductible if I reported the income, which I did.If you have any kind of early withdrawal penalty and you reported the income, it might be fully deductible.(IRA withdrawal penalties don�t count, however.)8.Educator expenses: If you are a teacher, the money you spend on your class supplies (which teacher doesn�t spend their own money?)is deductible up to a certain limit.9.Lifetime learning: Many college graduates think that all the education deductions only apply to expenses incurred toward getting a degree.But the government encourages lifelong learning; so as long as you are continuing your education in the same field and it will help your career, you can deduct those expenses.You can use this interactive  tax assistant tool from the IRS to figure out if your expenses are deductible and under what category they fall.10.Consider itemized deductions as well: Finally, most people in their 20s with no mortgage assume they have nothing to itemize.It is probably true (the standard deduction is more generous than people give it credit for), but it doesn�t cost you anything other than may be 15 minutes of your time to check if itemized deductions might be better for you, especially if you had: live in a state with a very high tax rate spend a lot out of your pocket for your job, or even if you spent a lot in the last year looking for a job.As I mentioned, these are some of the deductions that everyone uses automatically but misses the eyes of people in their 20s.If we are eligible for a deduction, there is no reason not to take advantage of it to the fullest extent.What other tax deductions apply to your situation?Have you ever discovered a tax break that you were eligible for but didn�t know you could have used it?GRS is committed to helping our readers save and achieve their financial goals.Savings interest rates may be low, but that is all the more reason to shop for the best rate.Find the highest savings interest rates and CD rates from Synchrony Bank , Ally Bank , GE Capital Bank , and more.Regarding educator deductions � teachers can�t deduct pension contributions federally (As they are already taken into consideration on your w2) but can do so in certain states.Also don�t forget to deduct union dues.And for reporting cash income� no one with a side hustle really does this.There�s no way for the government to really track this (unless we�re talkign crazy money) and�well it�s not their�s. Jason, We have to agree to disagree on the �no one with a side hustle really does this�.Cash, credit, stock, precious metals, bitcoin� however you get paid, income is income and it has to be reported as prescribed by the law of the land.Right, but how far does that go?I found $10 on the ground this morning (no one else was nearby).I�m sure the government would say I need to declare that too.I also sold a powertool last year on Craigslist.This is a tool I bought with post-tax dollars and paid sales tax on at time or purchase.The tool then depreciated and I sold for lower than the purcahse price.If anyone asks me to declare the sale as income and then deduct depreciation, they are nuts.I think most people view it similiar to the situation where states that have sales tax ask you to declare out of state purchases so they can then tax you.I don�t know anyone that is really honest with that one and frankly, law of the land or not, demanding tax for this is unjust.Again, disagree.First, as a resident of the state of WA, living on the border of Oregon a lot of stores closer to us are in OR.And yes, I am a nutcase who documents and pays sales taxes to WA states as OR is sales tax free.And second, I don�t think you are understanding the taxation correctly.If you paid for something with post-tax dollars and it depreciates, of course you don�t have to declare anything.On the other hand if it �appreciates�, yes that is income (the difference) and you can deduct the expenses that you incurred to maintain/do whatever to make it appreciate.Suba�s right.Your tool wasn�t tax deductible because you actually lost money on it.It�s only if you profit on items, like collectibles, that you consider it income.Plenty of people with side hustles report their income.My husband was briefly a non-employee of a card shop (Magic the Gathering, etc).As in, he got paid under the table and was paid in store credit.But that�s still a form of payment, so I put it on our return.I�ve known people who even report bartering on their returns.Technically, that is a form of payment and is even listed in the IRS�s instructions book.In the end, why risk it?You�re probably paying under $100 tax, and that could be a lot more if you�re unlucky enough to be randomly selected for an audit.If you think that no one does this, then you are mistaken.I report income from side hustles even when I�m paid in cash, and I also report sales tax due on out-of-state purchases (and pay it).I do this because I believe it�s the right thing to do.Maybe nothing bad would happen to me if I didn�t, but I try to do what I think is right even when there are no consequences for not doing so.I also think that if I didn�t pay, it would be unfair to the people who do.I don�t want my choices to contribute to a system where honesty is punished.You can feel free to disagree with my beliefs, but I at least want you to be aware that there are people who are completely honest on their taxes.And for reporting cash income… no one with a side hustle really does this.There’s no way for the government to really track this (unless we’re talkign crazy money) and…well it’s not their’s.I declare income from my side hustles because that�s what�s required of me as a citizen of this country.Some people might argue against declaring the income on the basis that �well, it�s only $100 or so, who cares?but you could also look at it from the point of view of �I�m willing to break the law/do something unethical for as little as $100?.Debbie, I totally did!A big mistake.I will write that up (credits to you) and send it to Linda to add it to the post by tonight.Thanks!Speaking of early withdrawal penalties, if you switch jobs and cash out your 401(k) you�ll get hit with a ten percent penalty tax (in addition to regular income tax) if you�re under 59 1/2.Lots of young people make this mistake.Instead of cashing it out, roll your money into a 401(k) with your new employer or an IRA.If someone makes very little money, they should look into the Earned Income Tax Credit.Even if you owe no tax, you can get a refund.The job search expenses aren�t deductible if they�re for your first job ever.I�m not sure how to define this myself, but for safety I�m assuming the first full-time job out of full-time school doesn�t count.A very informative post.A lot of these options were relevant to me when I was in my 20?s but I failed to take advantage because of poor financial education.Hopefully this post will help younger adults to take advantage of tax incentives.Thanks for a great post!<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am new to this and was wondering how you can use a ROTH IRA to save for a home (#3)?</span>My understanding was that ROTH IRAs grew tax-free but could only be collected at retirement age (59) or you would incur a penalty.I know you can withdraw the money you put in at anytime, but what is the point of putting your money in a ROTH IRA if you can�t touch the interest?One major tax credit that 20-somethings who don�t make a lot of money are eligible for is the Retirement Savings Contribution credit.This one requires planning ahead but if you are already contributing to a retirement account through work or a personal Roth/Traditional IRA this non-deductible credit has the potential to reduce your tax liability to 0.It may even be worth editing this article to reflect this tax credit as it is basically the only tax credit a 20-something who makes under $25k can take on their taxes.Advertiser Disclosure: Many of
