(NASDAQ:OREX) | Seeking Alpha European Commission (EC) has conveyed that the draft EC decision granting approval for Mysimba will be reviewed during a meeting that will take place on March 16th.</span>Thatâ€™s less than 2 trading days away from happening.As per NASDAQ, there were 39,845,839 shares sold short as of 2/27/2015 with around 23 days to cover making OREX an ideal candidate for a short squeeze on positive developments.Orexigen already has received an overwhelmingly positive CHMP opinion in December 2014, with with 31 member states in favor of approval and only two opposing it.Few days ago, I contacted both Orexigen (NASDAQ: OREX ) and European Commission (NYSE: EC ) regarding the schedule of the Standing Committee which would review the CHMP's overwhelmingly positive recommendation to approve Orexigen's lead product Mysimba (European equivalent of Contrave).And just few hours ago, I received an e-mail reply from EC stating the following: According to the information provided by the responsible department of the European Commission, the draft European Commission decision granting marketing authorization for Mysimba will be reviewed during a meeting of the Standing Committee that will take place on March 16th.Information regarding this meeting will soon be available in the comitology register.http://europa.eu - your shortcut to the EU!Well that crucial little piece of info was hard to find, as the European Medicines Agency too was unaware of the dates and Orexigen refused to provide specific dates beyond stating that "We have not disclosed the date of the EC Standing Committee meeting beyond saying March."and "It's on schedule" in my e-mail conversations with respective parties.Now with the positive CHMP recommendation in hand and recently disclosed favourable interim data from LIGHT study, it's highly unlikely that European regulators will do a U-Turn.That poses a big risk for shorts as the short interest remains very high as can be seen from the latest available data from NASDAQ.Typically, stocks with days to cover ratio above 7 days, are considered risky for short sellers and stocks with high days-to-cover ratios could see significant upside in a short squeeze scenario.Conclusion: Orexigen shorts could avoid significant losses by covering and stepping to the sidelines before the possible EC decision on monday, or even better, go long OREX in anticipation of highly likely European approval.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Source: Surprise: Orexigen Investors Have Catalyst Looming Next Monday Disclosure: The author is long OREX.</span>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I may buy or sell shares of Orexigen anytime.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
