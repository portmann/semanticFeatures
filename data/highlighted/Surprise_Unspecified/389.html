started the show by talking about the lost art of valuing execution.He is of the opinion that stocks run due to good leadership and perfect execution by their leaders, and nowadays, investors are disregarding this important aspect.WSJ in their column wrote that Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) was an overvalued stock and could report zero or negative same-store sales growth.However, the company reported 8% same-store sales growth and rallied 2.7% on Thursday.Cramer said that the CEO Craig Jelinek and and his team are really strong and he sees the stock being undervalued still.Kroger (NYSE: KR ) reported a strong earnings beat and rallied almost 7% on Thursday.Cramer had always seen the management as competitive and notes that it has taken market share from the likes of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ).He called it perfect execution and considers the stock to be cheap despite what most people think.Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC ) which had a market cap of $36M six years ago, received a bid from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) for $21B which according to many was highly overvalued leading to a belief that the pharma sector is in a bubble.However, Cramer thinks this is a part of a larger execution strategy as AbbVie's blockbuster drug Humira was about to go off patent in a few years, which would have disrupted its earnings.Hence the acquisition of Pharmacyclics will give the company some other patent drugs and earnings power."This is execution," said Cramer.Looking at this, one can start questioning the valuation of stocks like Isis Pharma (NASDAQ: ISIS ) and Receptos (NASDAQ: RCPT ).They can be acquired someday with a higher than expected price."Many of these stocks belong to companies that are managed by people who are capable of going well outside what's expected of them, rendering their stocks cheap, even as they seemed very expensive," said Cramer.The aerospace and defense stocks have been giving good returns since lows in mid-October last year.Aerospace and defense stocks like Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) and General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ) have been on fire.Due to countries putting more money in defense, there is good business flowing into aerospace and defense stocks.One such stock which has been under the radar is Orbital ATK, which was created as a merger between Alliant Techsystems and Orbital Sciences.Although Orbital ATK might be a small player with market cap of $4B, the stock is currently much cheaper at 13 times earnings versus its competitors which trade at 17 times earnings.Orbital ATK designs, builds and delivers space, defense and aviation systems around the world.Cramer said that Orbital is the first private developer of space launch vehicles.It is also one of the largest manufacturers of small and medium caliber ammunition.The company is also a leading producer of rocket propulsion systems with a major missile defense business.Cramer said that the company is expected to make $150-200M in annual revenues by next year, along with $70-100M in cost savings due to the recent merger.He believes the stock is cheap right now as the company does not provide a clear picture on its prospects."Sooner or later I bet the rocket that is Orbital ATK will launch into the stratosphere," said Cramer.Cult stocks are those that cannot be valued on traditional metrics like earnings or PE ratio.They are valued based on subscription numbers, market share, no competition etc.While Cramer is not a fan of cult stocks, he said that they are making a comeback.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), which reported weak numbers, is still hanging around $200 even though it sold about 10 cars a month in China.Cramer said that investors are believing in CEO Elon Musk's vision rather than the numbers he is reporting.One other reason for the belief is that no other competitor has come close to delivering a car like Tesla, which makes it most wanted by investors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is another cult stock which is not valued traditionally.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer was surprised that the stock did not cross $400 after it received an analyst upgrade.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He said that, "The cults keep believing that one day Amazon will report its Web service numbers and start making money."</span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which is valued on number of subscriptions, keeps moving higher and is loved by investors.Fundamentally, the stock is worth selling according to Cramer but since it is a cult, it still appears cheap at $28B market cap.Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) also appear cultish as they tend to move higher when there is no news.Cramer thinks both of them are cheap stocks as they have high earnings power.GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) is another cult stock, and Cramer thinks it's too expensive now.Laredo Petroleum (NYSE: LPI ): Cramer does not like the stock.Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS ): Cramer said he is concerned about the stock and is uncomfortable recommending it.Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV ): Cramer said that he had recommended this stock earlier but it has been shot down consistently.He now recommends moving to better places like Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ).eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ): "I think eBay is good."Verizon (NYSE: VZ ): Cramer likes the stock due to a good yield, but he said that people do not want to be in the middle of a price war.Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s
