Gaglio - Chief Utility Operations Officer & Senior VP Good day and welcome to the Piedmont Natural Gas First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.Today's conference is being recorded.Nick Giaimo - Head-Investor Relations Thank you, Orlando.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Piedmont Natural Gas first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.This call is open to the general public and is being webcast live over the Internet.If you'd like to access the webcast of this call or view the slides of the accompanying presentation, please visit our website at piedmontng.com and choose the For Investors link.On the right-hand side of that page, you'll find the appropriate links.On the call today, presenting prepared remarks, we have Tom Skains, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karl Newlin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Other officers of the company are also in attendance to take your questions.Finally, this call may include forward-looking statements and our actual results may materially differ from those statements.More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Piedmont's first quarter Form 10-Q filed on Friday with the SEC.And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.Thomas E. Skains - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.As you know, we filed our first quarter 10-Q and issued our earnings release on Friday.This morning, I'm going to talk about our recent accomplishments and provide you with a general update on the company.Then I'll turn the call over to Karl Newlin to give you a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial results.We're off to a good start in 2015 in line with our expectations.As you see on slide two, we generated net income of $93 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.18 in the first quarter.We also demonstrated another strong quarter of customer growth with the addition of nearly 4,900 new customers, a 15% improvement from last year's growth level.Earlier this year, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for annual rate adjustments of $26.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively under our Integrity Management Riders.While approved in North Carolina, the IMR adjustments are subject to further review and determination of the reasonableness and prudence of the capital investments and associated costs.We continue to work diligently on our $585 million utility and joint venture capital expansion program for fiscal year 2015, including an estimated $265 million of system integrity expenditures.Last week our board increased our quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.33 per share.This is the 37th consecutive year our board has raised the dividend.And finally, we reaffirmed our 2015 earnings per share guidance of $1.82 to $1.92 per share.Slide three shows our first quarter net income of $93 million.Margin was 3% higher than last year, but was offset by increased O&M, depreciation, general taxes, and interest expense as well as lower contributions from our joint ventures.Overall, results were right in line with our expectations for the quarter, but lower than last year because of the extraordinary secondary marketing margins we made in January of 2014 in the wholesale marketplace.On slide four, we highlight our gross customer additions for the quarter.As you can see, our customer gains of 4,892 were 15% higher than the first quarter of last year, reflecting the continuing improvement in the new construction markets in our service territory.We expect this trend to continue, and as a result, we've revised our forecast of gross customer additions upward to a range of 1.6% to 2% for fiscal year 2015.Moving to slide five, you can see that we continue to forecast elevated levels of capital expenditures and joint venture contributions totaling approximately $585 million in fiscal year 2015.This is largely a function of expenditures for customer growth and system integrity, which we've highlighted with the red and blue bars.The green bar in 2015 and 2016 represents utility investments under a power generation delivery contract with Duke Energy to serve their W.S. Lee facility in South Carolina in 2017.At the end of last year, we've added light blue bars to this chart to depict utility CapEx under our Atlantic Coast Pipeline redelivery contracts, the majority of which will be invested in 2018.Of that $190 million in utility capital expenditures, $170 million is supported by long-term contracts and will not be subject to rate cases for cost recovery.Finally, the purple bars represent contributions for our Constitution Pipeline and Atlantic Coast Pipeline joint ventures.You will notice that in fiscal year 2015, our expected contributions have decreased, while they have increased in fiscal year 2016.This is a result of Constitution's revised construction and in-service schedule.We expect Constitution to begin construction this summer and put the pipeline in service during the second half of 2016.Constitution has also revised its total project cost estimate upward to $875 million including AFUDC.Regarding the ACP project, the partners intend to see project financing for 70% of the $4.5 billion to $5 billion of construction cost.So, the amount shown here only represent our 10% portion of the remaining 30%.With that, I will now turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Karl Newlin.Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.As Tom mentioned, we had a solid first quarter with net income of $93 million and diluted EPS of $1.18 compared to $97.6 million and $1.26 in the first quarter of 2014.As Tom also noted, results for the quarter were what we expected and the decline in net income was due to record secondary marketing margin we generated in 2014.I'm going to walk you through the major line items of our first quarter income statement, and then I'll turn the call back over to Nick to take your questions.On slide six, margin of $270 million increased $9 million compared to last year.The increase is due to customer growth, as well as new rates in North Carolina and Tennessee.This was partly offset by the decrease in secondary marketing, as well as lower industrial margin due to rate design changes in our last North Carolina rate case.On expense side, slide seven, O&M of $66 million was almost $6 million higher than last year due to increased contract labor, payroll, overtime, and regulatory expense.Our quarter-over-quarter expenses were up 9% they were in line within our internal expectations, and we expect O&M for the full-year to be up approximately 2%.Slide eight shows depreciation expense of $32 million and general taxes of $10 million.The $2 million increase in depreciation was due to growth in plant in service, related primarily to system integrity projects.On slide nine, income from joint ventures was $8 million during the first quarter almost $2 million lower than 2014.This was a result of lower income at SouthStar Energy due to lower value derivatives stemming from changes in natural gas prices, mainly lower, partially offset by increased AFUDC at Constitution.Finally, on slide 10, interest expense of $18 million was more than $7 million higher than the first quarter of 2014.This was due to lower AFUDC interest income, higher long-term debt expense from greater amounts outstanding and higher amounts due to customers.Nick Giaimo - Head-Investor Relations Thank you.We'll take our first question from Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.Sarah E. Akers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Just a couple questions on Constitution.Can you talk in more detail about the cause of the delay there, and then any milestone we should be paying attention to from here?Thomas E. Skains - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yes.Sarah, this is Tom Skains.I'll address your question first, and ask Victor Gaglio who's here in our board room to elaborate.He serves on the Constitution board of directors.We believe that Constitution is an important infrastructure project that will move low-cost natural gas into constrained high-cost northeast markets.The pipeline will also enhance reliability and provide energy savings to consumers.As you know, it is fully supported by capacity contracts with shippers, and we've already cede the 7(c) certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.We're now in the final stages of safe reviews, particularly around water examinations and the comment period before the New York State Environmental Commission concluded at the end of February.So, the Constitution's next step is to assess those comments and make another filing with the state, kind of organizing our thoughts around those final comments.We have confidence in the project and our operator, Williams Pipeline, and do believe that this project is on schedule for construction later this year and in service in the latter half of 2016.Victor, any additional comments you'd like to make and just about some of the detailed approval processes?Victor M. Gaglio - Chief Utility Operations Officer & Senior VP Well, Sarah, you asked with regard to the delays.They are related to permitting delays.There's certain windows for constructability with regard to tree clearing and stream crossing.So, the delays in the permitting is what caused the schedule to get pushed back a little further than what we had hoped for.Any other clarifying things around that I could help with?Sarah E. Akers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC No.That's perfect.And then I had one other question on how the higher cost works.So, do you get to earn on the higher CapEx?Or do those incremental costs just compress the return a little bit on that investment?Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Hi, Sarah.It's Karl.So, as we contribute more capital to the project, it will accrue additional AFUDC as you know.But, it's a negotiated rate structure.And so, as the costs increase, there's no revenue offset once it's in service.So you're right, returns would compress as the capital costs increase.Like the efficiency of the call.Glad you guys don't pontificate like a bunch of other companies we follow, so that's good.Just on the stock issuance, how much did you guys do in the last quarter?Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President We didn't do anything in the last quarter under the dribble.There's some issuance related to incentive compensation plans that were issued during the quarter, but nothing under the dribble or the ATM program in Q1.Is that because you didn't need as much money for Constitution, or was there another reason?Thomas E. Skains - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer It was really just timing.I would continue for us to be in the market the remainder of this year and into next year with the ATM or dribble program, and we'll be opportunistic as we access the equity markets for that.Okay.I won't torch you on what the markets have done.And then, rate cases in North Carolina, just for modeling purposes over the next couple years, can you kind of just give us kind of a high-level thinking on the frequency of those?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Well, I mean, with seeking rate relief, we're always reviewing our internal models and looking at what the possibilities and options are going forward.</span>We have no plans right now to file rate cases in any of our three jurisdictions currently, but we're always reviewing the possibilities.So, as you know, we have a couple of mechanisms in place.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In North Carolina and Tennessee, the Integrity Management Rider that I think that mechanism is intended, around system integrity investments, at least, to somewhat delay our need for seeking rate relief in those two states.</span>And in South Carolina we operate under the RSA mechanism, which essentially resets rates on a one-year basis.So, I mean, we do our work internally.We're always looking at what the scenarios and possibilities can be, but we have no immediate plans to file.Okay.That's for this year.But as we get out to 2016 or 2017, how should we think about that?Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah.I mean, other than what I've said, Andy, I can't really pontificate on what the future plans would be around rate cases.Got it.That's kind of popular word now.Okay.Thank you very much, guys.Travis Miller - Morningstar Research I wonder, on the marketing side, if you could kind of characterize what happened this year versus last year.Obviously, last year, a crazy weather.But I was just wondering any thoughts on volume versus actual margin per unit versus volatility, just to characterize what happened this year versus last year in the quarter.Thomas E. Skains - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.Thank you for the question.This quarter, as you know, was colder than normal, but not as cold as last year.And last year, we had a series of polar vortexes that came through the market area, and created substantial price volatility in the wholesale markets.And predictably, in the zones that we serve in the Carolinas.We took advantage of what the market offered last year.And the spread on our gas cost versus market prices and the wholesale marketplace, and achieve a significantly higher margins in our secondary marketing activity last year.If you go back and kind of normalize our secondary marketing margin contribution annually to our overall margin, as Karl said earlier on the call, we achieved a record secondary marketing revenues last year.While we did continue to be active in the marketplace this year, the weather and the volatility did not present similar opportunities, and that's the difference.This year was more of a normalized – normal level of secondary marketing activity compared to extraordinary secondary marketing opportunities last year.Travis Miller - Morningstar Research Okay.On the volatility side, how much do you benefit, I guess, from volatility, relative to volume relative to per unit margin, just absolute price level?How much does volatility help you or – I assume it's help, but conversely hurt you?Thomas E. Skains - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.Good question.I'll try to answer it this way.We set up our supply portfolio to meet the design day requirements and average winter day requirements of our firm customers in our marketplace.But we have firm storage and transportation contracts to get these supplies to our market.So, we have significant flexibility and price stability in our wholesale gas supply portfolio.So when there is market volatility in the wholesale markets, we could take advantage of that using our assets on days and at times that our firm customers don't require their use, and make margins in that wholesale market that we share with our customers.We generally share the benefits of any cost reductions in our portfolio or any margins that we generate through the secondary marketing activities from our portfolio with our customers, 75% to them to lower our gas costs and 25% of the margins to our shareholders and then as an incentive to engage in that activity.Travis Miller - Morningstar Research Just two quick questions on my side.First, kind of a housekeeping question.On slide five, can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on the purple bars, the JV contributions?I guess what I'm going for is Atlantic Coast, if you could break out kind of how much is implied in those bars for 2015, 2016, 2017?Karl W. Newlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah, Dan.First of all, we had the purple bar in 2015 had gone from $105 million down to $65 million, and that slide is almost entirely $40 million from Constitution being pushed out into the next year, as well as an incremental $40 million in Constitution, just from the incremental spend that occurs in 2016 and slides into 2017.So, the bulk of it is Constitution in 2016, and then the remainder is ACP in that year and a little bit into 2017.There's no other joint venture contributions that occur under the plan other than those two in development during the timeframe.Great.Thanks very helpful.Just last question for me.Just could you give us – and maybe you covered this.I joined just a minute later.So, can you talk a little bit – little more color on the customer adds?Certainly, exciting to see the kind of 1.6% to 2% target you're now looking at.Can you just talk about kind of what's driving the faster customer growth?Where are you seeing it specifically?And then, I guess, sort of a derivative question, kind of what growth rate do you ultimately expect to settle out at normalize if it were?Do you expect to be kind of back into the kind of historical 2% to 3% range you were before?And just any thoughts on that as well.Franklin H. Yoho - Chief Commercial Officer & Senior Vice President Dan, this is Frank Yoho.What we're seeing in the market today is just a continued economic improvement.It's really across our three state areas, are all seeing this improvement which has driven up our expectations and the big market, it's not necessarily from a geographic perspective, but from a residential new construction, we're seeing some real positive results there, along with the commercial market is all of a sudden starting to follow also.We try to keep within our guidance what we think our expectations are.And we are hopeful.We don't have a targeted place we think will be, but we're hopeful to see continued economic improvement.Appreciate it.That's all I had.Thanks, guys.We have no further questions in the queue at this time.I'll turn the conference back over to Nick Giaimo for any additional or closing remarks.Nick Giaimo - Head-Investor Relations Thank you, Orlando.This concludes our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.Thank you all, for joining us this morning.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.We thank you for your participation.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Piedmont Natural Gas Co Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on March 09, 2015.</div></body></html>
