(NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha T faced material price and margin risk if GOOG aggressively entered the wireless market; GOOG's limited device launch removes much of the short-term risk.The combination of a drop in share price and a removal of some risk creates an opportunity to create income through the sale of put options.AT&T (NYSE: T ) has been facing a slowdown in revenue growth coupled with continued high capital expenditures ($21 billion in 2014 and $18 billion in 2015) which, combined with the $18 billion spectrum auction, the $16 billion required to acquire DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) and $2 billion for the Nextel Mexico acquisition has put a damper on the stock.While T has increased 2.4% in the past year, it has significantly lagged both Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and the S&P 500 over an extended period.Recently, I asserted that T is facing a squeeze from the combination of "regular," intense competition from Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) as well as from potential new entrants Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At the end of last week, GOOG further clarified its plans to enter the wireless market, which in the short-run relieves a potential market share and margin threat.</span>I continue to believe that GOOG and DISH will pressure the market (in different ways), which over the medium term (next two-to-three years) will challenge T (and VZ) from both a margin and market share perspective.GOOG has received a fair amount of publicity in 2015 as it has released its strategy for entering the wireless market.Depending on the search engine giant's intent, its entry could have been majorly disruptive or barely noticeable.Last week, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, GOOG indicated its initial entry into wireless would be in the form of an almost benign, soft roll-out that would occur with the full knowledge of the major players.It further clarified its strategy, as reported in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ subscription required at link) that its wireless service, which utilizes, the S and TMUS networks, would initially only work on special phones, like the Nexus phone manufactured by Motorola Mobility (previously owned by GOOG and now owned by Lenovo Group, Ltd.).By limiting the rollout to a small subset of phones, GOOG is promising its initial launch in will not make big waves with respect to the status quo, and will likely initially cause only a small ripple.This handset limitation means GOOG's entry will not pressure near-term T earnings, which should be comforting to T shareholders.Upon analysis, GOOG is pursuing a capital light, "rent-a-network" approach.The new network will operate as an MVNO with the novel, cost reducing trick of maximizing existing WiFi whenever possible.If GOOG pushes, and the market is receptive to what is likely to be a materially lower cost wireless service, more cell phone manufacturers will develop phones which maximize WiFi usage and minimize usage of wireless networks.The medium term could involve significantly more cell phone manufacturers and potentially be significantly more disruptive to incumbent carriers like T.In the short-run, GOOG has intentionally gone out of its way to not antagonize T and VZ, noting it has shared aspects of its plan with the carriers.By limiting the initial customers to the small subset that use the Nexus 6 device, GOOG is promising the March-April launch will be minimally disruptive to T.In my mind, this reduces short-term risk to T and provides investors with an increased period of the status-quo.Please note the lack of aggressive launch but does not eliminate medium-term risk.For T holders who are true believers, the combination of a drop in stock price (related to the overall market and T being dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average) and the reduction in downside risk presents an opportunity to increase yield to an annualized 12.1% by selling January $32 Put Options.The January $32's recently sold for $2.16.A T shareholder would receive $2.16 in option premium as well as the $1.88 annual dividend for total income of $4.04.Another way to consider this strategy is the net cost of acquiring T shares is $31.32 ($33.48 less $2.16 option premium) with the downside case being the obligation to acquire additional T shares for $32.00.Please note that option premium is ordinary income and in the event T closes below $32/share on January 15, 2016, the seller of put options would be required to either buy T at $32 or pay the difference of the closing price below $32 (if T closed at $31.50 on January 15, 2016, each option would require $0.50 x 100 shares = $50 to cover the difference if the shares were not purchased).I have been asked why I follow T. I have a longstanding interest in the sector, having worked for multiple telecommunications companies; my longer term interest is following a stock that could one day provide me with a stable source of income for retirement.I still see concerns in T's future and do not currently hold T. However, for those who own and love T, I believe a potentially serious short-term risk in the form of GOOG's wireless entry has been reduced (though the potential for disruption in the medium term should be noted and monitored) and an income enhancement strategy should be considered.All investors should conduct their own due diligence.All articles are my personal opinions and not investment advice.Never buy or sell simply based on an article.Source: AT&T Risk Reduced Following Google Announcements; Potential For 12% Income Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
