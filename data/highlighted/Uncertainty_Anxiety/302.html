class='textDiv'>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories: Poised For Growth - Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (NYSE:RDY) | Seeking Alpha Heavy exposure to high growth "phamerging" markets.Don't let short-term risk (Russia/Ukraine exposure) cloud the big picture.The firm is using free cash flow to invest in R&D to expand beyond generics.For those laymen like me with no formal technical experience in the industry, the pharmaceutical space can be a confusing and difficult space to invest in.Understanding the research and development of a new drug, the following clinical trials, and the trials and tribulations of bringing the drug to market, and then translating that information into whether a stock is under, fair, or overvalued is not an easy task.That and the ensuing volatility is not something I feel most investors should expose themselves to.But that doesn't mean you can't have exposure to the drug market.Generic drug companies generally have hundreds of product lines that treat a variety of ailments - diversification is the name of the game.Research and development costs are lower, but so are profit margins.But that doesn't mean there aren't growing value plays in the sector.Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE: RDY ) is an integrated pharmaceutical company based in India.The company operates in three segments - Global Generics, Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI), and Proprietary Products.The Global Generics segment produces and markets a variety of generic pharmaceuticals, and constitutes 80% of Dr. Reddy's revenue.The PSAI segment develops and sells various ingredients used in the drug-making process, which it sells to other companies; Dr. Reddy's derives 18% of its revenue from this segment.Bringing up the back with 2% of revenue is the Proprietary Products segment, which works on discovery and development of new combinations that can increase efficacy based off of existing medicines.The company focuses on limited competition generics, ideally in ones where it can gain a market share advantage by being first to file, so it can capture leading shares of the generic drug market.Usually, limited-competition drugs have some barrier to entry that prevents a flood of market participants, such as technological barriers in manufacturing or requiring complex clinical studies.The company has 68 pending ANDAs and 2 NDAS that aim to take market share from expiring patented drugs that currently command $36B in annual sales.Sales value will fall as competition ensues on these drugs, but nonetheless, the company has a strong pending pipeline of generics.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At a time when big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK ) have to worry about their new drug pipelines as patents expire, companies like Dr. Reddy's are the ones poised to benefit.</span>Dr. Reddy's has grown its revenue based in the tough-to-compete North American market by a 32% annual rate from 2010-2014.But that isn't where the company is putting forth its full weight: It is projected that the largest absolute growth in medicine during the coming years will not come from developed markets like the United States or Europe, but from "phamerging" markets such as China, Russia, India, and Thailand.The vast majority of these countries lie in Asia, where Dr. Reddy's has a competitive advantage, being based out of India.It has long had exposure to these markets, and is better adapted to benefit from growth here.Dr. Reddy's noted in its most recent investor presentation that during the past several years, the company has enjoyed 28% revenue growth in these markets.*numbers in millions, except percentages Total revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9% since 2012, based on estimates for the remaining half of the company's fiscal 2015.Margins have expanded for the company as gross margins have expanded and SG&A has grown at a slower pace.The company has taken that freed up capital and used it to greatly increase its investment in R&D.Dr. Reddy's is investing in its smaller PSAI and Proprietary Products segments, focusing on biologics (proteins derived from human genes to treat various diseases) and being able to produce advanced, difficult-to-produce active ingredients used in medication.The company believes increased investments in these segments will be highly cash-accretive and will be the main drivers of growth in 2020 and beyond.*Dr. Reddy's February 2015 Investor Presentation Unfortunately, despite increased investment, the PSAI segment had a terrible fiscal 2014, with revenues falling 30%.FY 2015 has thus far shown improvement, with revenues up 15-25% over 2014 comps.Nonetheless, investors should pay close attention to results within this segment in quarters/years ahead to ensure that the segment that management is banking on quite a few of its chips beginning to perform more in line with expectations.The company's heavy exposure to foreign markets (it derives most of its revenue from outside the United States) have made its operating results appear weaker when translated to the recently strong US dollar.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Additionally, as a short-term global headwind, more than 10% of its revenue was derived from Russia, which, due to the recent woes of the ruble, has made investors wary, along with the company's exposure to Ukraine, As the US market sits at all-time highs, Dr. Reddy's trades 10% off the highs it made pre-Russian crisis.</span>For long-term investors looking to capitalize on the immense (and growing as the world's population ages) pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Reddy's appears to be a good option to tap the high-growth areas of the market, i.e. the emerging markets.Source: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories: Poised For Growth Disclosure: The author is long RDY.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not
