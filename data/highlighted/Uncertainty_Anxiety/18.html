(NYSE:WR) | Seeking Alpha Proposed rate increase a catalyst for revenue.Operates in one of the strongest markets in the United States.Westar Energy (NYSE: WR ) is Kansas's largest independently operated utility, serving large areas such as Topeka and Wichita.In total the company serves 700,000 customers and generates 7,200MW of power through a variety of sources, including cleaner power like wind and landfill gas (Westar will easily meet Kansas RPS [Renewable Portfolio Standards] requirements for its energy generation).The company has invested extensively in clean energy and upgrading its older coal-fired plants to exceed set environmental regulations.As a traditional, regulated utility, Westar Energy gives investors the opportunity to invest in a transparent, growing local market and get paid well to do so.The stock has legged down considerably since January along with the rest of the utility sector.Does this present an investment opportunity?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Shareholder Dilution and Rate Increase Sometimes it is best to start with the blunt news that often gets markets jittery.</span>The company is issuing 9.4M shares in May as a financing mechanism to raise capital for its five year capital expenditures program.This will dilute current shareholders by 9.3% and raise $250M in proceeds.Westar is doing this because it targets a 50/50 capital structure between equity and debt.This target was set because the company is targeting a similar capitalization ratio that the company held in 2011 when it last made its rate increase request.On March 2, the company filed its request for rate increase ($159M) along with changes to base rate calculations.The catalysts for this increase are the company's expenditures in La Cygne (coal generation) and Wolf Creek (nuclear power generation).Westar notes the costs involved in upgrading La Cygne to provide cleaner coal energy and extensions on Wolf Creek's viable lifespan, along with the general cost increases since 2011.Given the company's commitment to the area and market leading position, I don't foresee issues with this rate increase being granted when the decision comes down in October.As the company operates solely in one market (Kansas), when investing in a focused market utility you want one in an area that is performing well.Kansas has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country ( Ranked #11 out of 50 ) and one of the highest labor participation rates ( also ranked #11 of 50 ).The state ranks in the middle in terms of wages, but has one of the lowest costs of living .All these factors point to a healthy, well-run state which will benefit utilities operating in the state.Those that live in the state can: Organic growth through people moving to the state Revenue has grown at a near 5% pace over this four year period, a healthy clip for a utility.As expected from a regulated market, operating expenses have grown at very similar pace.Kansas has been a standout market over the past few years for prior mentioned reasons and the company has benefited strongly from the outperformance of its home market.Westar Energy pays a 3.90% dividend on a sustainable 60% payout ratio, with room to grow even after the planned dilution given management's payout ratio guidance.The dividend has been consistent and growing for many years (11) and has grown considerably over time as the company has outpaced the overall growth of the utility sector.This growth however, has slowed recently.The company may be acting in the best interest of caution ahead of its rate increase request and substantial capital expenditures coming down the pipe.The market is pricing in some weakness in the name due to the uncertainty of the rate hike and the capital expenditures in the pipeline for the company as it diversifies away from its base in coal generated power.Investors can take advantage of this weakness and get into a stable name with a bright future.Compared to the yield of XLU (3.3%), the company pays a great dividend and unlike other names in utilities, has potential for future top-line growth.Source: Westar Energy: Underrated Utility
