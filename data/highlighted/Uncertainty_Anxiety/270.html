the highest closing level since December 26.This huge reversal led utility and REIT ETFs to post negative returns over the past five trading sessions.A rising interest rate environment raises concerns about the performance of borrowed money, which in turn, would impact the dividend yield.This has led investors to book profits in the high dividend-paying avenues of utility and REIT ETFs.Almost all the funds in the utility ETF space have seen losses in the past five trading sessions, and in fact, are trading in the red in the year-to-date frame.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLU ), the largest and the most popular ETF in its space, with an asset base of $6.2 billion and average daily trading volume of 16 million shares, has shed roughly 2% in the past one week and is down 7.9% in the year-to-date frame.The fund tracks the Utilities Select Sector Index, holding a basket of 30 stocks, and has a solid dividend yield of 3.31%.Apart from XLU, the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA: VPU ), the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA: IDU ) and the First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX ETF (NYSEARCA: FXU ) have also lost roughly 2% in the past five trading sessions.These products are also down more than 5% in the year-to-date frame.Like the utility ETFs, most of the REIT ETFs have also delivered negative returns in the past five trading sessions and are trading flat to negative in the year-to-date frame.Vanguard REIT Index ETF (NYSEARCA: VNQ ) - the most popular product in the REIT space, with an asset base of $27.5 million - is down 3.3% in the past one week.The fund has a dividend yield of 3.63%.Other popular products in the space like the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA: IYR ), the iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (NYSEARCA: ICF ), the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (NYSEARCA: RWR ) and the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: REM ) have also lost more than 2% in the past five trading sessions.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The worries about the actual timing of the first interest rate hike in the U.S. since 2006 is pushing interest rate-sensitive sectors like utility and REIT downward, leading many of the funds to shed their earlier gains and trade in the red in the year-to-date frame.</span>As such, investors should cautiously trade the above two markets and might consider staying on the sidelines until there is some clarity about the timing of the rate hike.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
