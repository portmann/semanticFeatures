(NYSE:WFC) | Seeking Alpha Societe Generale downgraded Wells Fargo to 'Sell' citing slowing earnings growth and lower profitability in FY 2015.Wells Fargo is one of the best run Wall Street banks with very competitive returns on equity and assets.Wells Fargo has outperformed its peers over longer periods of time.Warren Buffett's investment in Wells Fargo and his reluctance to sell his stake speak volumes about the quality of Wells Fargo's banking business and its suitability for long-term investors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Investors need not panic about the downgrade.</span>Should you sell or buy stocks based on analysts' opinions?That seems to be the central question bugging many investors these days.As far as I am concerned, I don't pay a lot of attention to analysts for one simple reason: They are purely short-term orientated.In fact, I think most investors are best served by adopting a long-term investment strategy without worrying about the daily ups and downs in the stock market.If you think about it, that's really how Warren Buffett made his money in the first place.Warren Buffett may be one of the most admired investors of our time, but he is also one of the least understood.See, Warren Buffett has a history of making bold calls, most notably during the Great Recession when he bought boatloads of shares in financial companies such as Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) or Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).However, Buffett's wealth is tied up in a few core positions that stand out from the crowd and that he endorsed on multiple occasions.One such investment is Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), the largest residential mortgage originator in the country.Buffett again singled out his investment in Wells Fargo in his annual shareholder letter and illustrated the positive effects of stock buybacks, which in the case of Wells Fargo has led to an increase in Buffett's ownership stake from 9.2% to 9.4% in 2014.At the end of 2014, Warren Buffett's investment holding Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) owned more than 483 million shares of Wells Fargo valued at $25.8 billion.Wells Fargo is a 'Big Four' investment for Berkshire Hathaway, which also includes notable stakes in companies American Express (NYSE: AXP ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO ) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ).Source: Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Letter 2014 But there are two more reasons why I would consider Wells Fargo despite the recent Societe Generale downgrade .There is a simple reason why Buffett likes Wells Fargo: Peer group-leading returns on capital.At the end of the day, that's what it's all about: Investing in businesses with high profitability that gives investors a reasonable shot at valuation growth over time.And Wells Fargo certainly doesn't have to shy away from comparison.Source: Wells Fargo Investor Presentation The second reason relates to the often cited high valuation of Wells Fargo.Wells Fargo isn't a cheap bank by any means.From a price-to-book value perspective, Wells Fargo is actually the most expensive bank in the peer group - by a wide margin.WFC Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts However, it is very easy to see why Wells Fargo trades at large premiums to both tangible and total book values: The bank left its peers in the dust in recent years in terms of performance.Over the last five years, Wells Fargo's shares have returned 75% to shareholders - almost twice as much as the second best-performing Wall Street bank JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ).The recent Societe Generale downgrade citing a "challenging near-term outlook" with respect to Wells Fargo's profitability doesn't affect me one bit.Wells Fargo, over longer periods of time, has not disappointed shareholders at all and it was actually the bank that recovered from the financial sector meltdown the fastest.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With Warren Buffett being invested in Wells Fargo and reluctant to sell, and with Wells Fargo's excellent return on assets, I think investors have little reason to panic over the recent downgrade.</span>Long-term Buy.Source: Wells Fargo: Why I Don't Care About The Societe Generale Downgrade Disclosure: The author is long WFC, BAC.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
