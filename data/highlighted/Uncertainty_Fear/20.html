class='textDiv'>Teva Pharmaceutical - I Don't Think This Is The Time To Buy It - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) | Seeking Alpha I have sold my entire position in TEVA.The company has fair fundamentals and fair valuation.Copaxone is still over 20% of TEVA's revenues and 25% of its EPS.My investment thesis is mainly dividend growth.When I picked Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE: TEVA ) back in 2009, I believed that it can be a great addition to my dividend growth portfolio.However, after tracking the company for over 5 years, I decided to sell my position, not from the dividend perspective, but because of the value.According to Yahoo, "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes generic, specialty, and other pharmaceutical products worldwide.The company operates in two segments, Generic Medicines and Specialty Medicines."Teva is the largest generic drug manufacturer, but its main single source of income is Copaxone, a patent-protected drug.Teva is probably the crown jewel of Israeli industry.It combines high-tech with low-tech, and has managed for years to bring fantastic returns to its shareholders.In Israel, it is sometimes called the "people's share."Over the past decades, Teva has grown from a small local company to the pharmaceutical giant it currently is.When looking at revenues, one can see that the company has been able to raise them significantly over the past 10 years.The CAGR of the revenues is 14.3% for the past 10 years and 4.75% for the past 5 years.Over the last year, revenues actually declined by 0.2%.These numbers show that although the company managed to grow revenues, they have stagnated as of now.For 2015, Teva forecasts a decline of 6.3% in revenues.The story is similar with the company's EPS.Over the past decade, the EPS CAGR was a staggering 12.36%.Over the past 5 years, however, the EPS CAGR was only 2.35%, and the change from last year was even smaller, at less than 2%.Teva forecasts that its EPS will stay more or less the same for 2015 and 2016.So the revenues and EPS are stuck.However, Teva managed to reward its shareholders with high dividend growth.Its 10-year growth rate is 15%, which is way above average, and even over the past 5 years, the company raised it by a CAGR of 12%.The dividend is paid in NIS, and my calculations are based on that currency.Currently, Teva yields 2.2%.Not bad at all, because its payout ratio is pretty low at around 30%, according to the current exchange rates.I am not sure the company will be able to keep raising its dividends at that pace, due to the stagnated EPS and other reasons that I will write about in this article.Teva's valuation is fair by any means.When compared to its peers like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) or Novartis (NYSE: NVS ), it might even look low.The current P/E ratio is around 12, and this is the forward P/E for 2015 and 2016 as well.The reason behind this valuation, in my opinion, is the inability to grow EPS and the major risks that the company is about to face in the near future.After stating that Teva is not a good investment choice, I must address its strong points and opportunities.The most reasonable one is the company's potential to create organic growth by adding new generic drugs to its portfolio.The latest news in that area is that the FDA has approved the sale of Teva's generic version of Nexium.Nexium, by AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN ), has a market of 6 billion USD, according to IMS.In addition, Teva is constantly developing generic drugs to compete with patent drugs as soon as the patent expires.When Viagra's patent will expire worldwide, Teva will be ready to step in.Another opportunity is its ability to acquire other companies.In 2010 and 2011, the company made three major strategic acquisitions.It bought Taiyo, Cephalon and Ratiopharm for over 12 billion USD.The current CEO, Erez Vigodman, declared lately that Teva is looking for another major acquisition to strengthen its core business.That is an opportunity for non-organic growth.I think the biggest opportunity for Teva is a merger with one of the behemoth pharmaceutical firms.Lately, it was heard that Pfizer was interested in acquiring the company.According to the rumor, the offer was declined.Last year, Pfizer tried to acquire AstraZeneca and failed.It offered a major premium over the current share price.If Pfizer now attempts to acquire Teva with a higher offer, Teva's price might jump significantly.Teva has fair valuation and fundamentals.In addition, there are several opportunities in its business, but the risks, in my opinion, are more significant.The first risk is common in the generic drugs industry, and it is the lack of a business moat.Teva is manufacturing generic drugs that aren't defended by patents.Different drug companies can try and take market share if their drugs are approved by the FDA.I don't believe that people who buy generic drugs care about the brand of the drugs.The focus is on the price.Another risk is the company's business environment.Teva is incorporated in Israel.The corporate tax in Israel is 26.5%.However, Teva, as a leading exporting company, enjoys significant tax reductions from the Israeli government.In 2012, the company paid only 0.3% tax; in 2013, due to a one-time agreement with the government, it paid 15% tax on its earning.In 2014, it once again paid only 6.9% tax.Increasingly, more voices in Israel are calling for this policy to cease.They believe Teva can have some tax reductions in order to encourage it to stay in Israel.However, they hold that the current tax policy is not suitable, and that small businesses and growing businesses should enjoy the tax cuts, and not only giants like Teva and Intel.A change in the business environment might pose a threat to the company.Another risk is the company's acquisition policy.The acquisitions should reduce costs following synergy of Teva with the firms it acquires.In addition, it should increase revenues and market share.However, Teva is having problems integrating the companies it has bought into its core business.Teva's CEO said at its latest conference call that in 2014 the company worked on bringing order internally.I am not sure whether it was enough, because the revenue and EPS forecasts are still flat.Also, these acquisitions came with a price.Teva paid for them mostly by issuing debt and with shares.This caused its debt to rise significantly.Even today, Teva has over 10 billion USD in debt.That's not too much, but it makes the company's balance sheet a bit leveraged.Furthermore, the issuance of shares raised the number of shares outstanding by around 13%, and even today, it is 10% higher than the amount in 2010.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am afraid that Teva's hardships in integrating the acquired companies, together with its will to acquire more companies in 2015 and the rising amount of debt and number of shares are not positive signs for investors.</span>One of Teva's hopes for maintaining its EPS in line with its forecasts is spending cuts.In 2014, the company saved 600 million USD, and it plans to save 500 million USD more in 2015.However, it mainly planned to do this by firing 10% of its workforce in 2014.Looking at the numbers, we see a different picture.In the U.S., Teva did manage to decrease its workforce by 10%, but in Israel, due to the strong unions and public protest, it only let go of 4.3% of the workforce - and in view of the coming elections, I don't see this number changing soon.Furthermore, in the rest of the world, the workforce actually grew by 6%.In 2014, Teva managed to cut costs without fulfilling its goal, but in my opinion, it will be hard for it to maintain the same spending cut figures without decreasing its workforce more significantly, especially if acquisitions are planned.All these risks are significant, but they are not even close to the major risk to Teva - Copaxone's patent expiration.Copaxone is the company's blockbuster drug.It is a popular treatment option for Multiple Sclerosis.Teva is highly dependent on this drug.In 2014, it was responsible for 20% of the company's revenue and 25% of its earnings.In 2014, Copaxone's sales declined by 2.5%, even after Teva raised the price twice, by 10% each time.Currently, it costs over 60,000 USD a year.Teva's patent for Copaxone expires in May.Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL ) is already working on its generic version for the drug, but it hasn't been approved by the FDA yet.Teva is now arguing in court that the patent should expire in September 2015, but this is just a delaying tactic.Sooner or later, the company is about to be hit by the expiration of the patent.Teva is trying to replace the use of ordinary Copaxone with a slightly different version that uses 3 injections a week instead of a daily injection.With all due respect, I don't think people will pay 60 thousand USD a year in order to use the newer version and take 3 injections a week.Furthermore, I am sure that in Israel, and probably in the rest of the world, insurance companies will not agree to pay for it if there is a decent replacement.In my opinion, Teva is going to get hit by the patent loss very harshly.The company's moves to slow the earnings decline are insufficient.Together with the other risks I mentioned, I believe that Teva is going to have a rough time in the years to come, and I don't believe that its valuation reflects the risks.New addition: On February 12th, 2015, Israeli newspaper Globes published a report saying that according to Teva's internal investigation, it was apparently in violation of the law against bribery in foreign countries (FCPA).The investigation will continue in 2015, and Teva does not know the consequences yet.The company may be subject to big fines, limitations on its activities in these particular countries and criminal and civil punishments.Teva is a company with fair fundamentals and valuation.It has some growth prospects, but the risks are overwhelming.In my opinion, the stagnated outlook by the company itself, and the risks - including the main one involving Copaxone - pose a big downside.The opportunities don't show an upside that is high enough to justify the risk.In conclusion, I don't think that this is a good time to invest in Teva.Source: Teva Pharmaceutical - I Don't Think This Is The Time To Buy It Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
