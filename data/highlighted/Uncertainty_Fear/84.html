We didn�t have access . . . .� 9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said �We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting� 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: �It is a national scandal� ; �This investigation is now compromised� ; and �One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America.But this White House wants to cover it up� .When asked in 2009 if he thought there should be another 9/11 commission, Cleland responded: �There should be about fifteen 9/11 commissions� The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) � who led the 9/11 staff�s inquiry � said �At some level of the government, at some point in time�there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened�.He also said �I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described �.The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years�.This is not spin.This is not true.No wonder the Co-Chair of the congressional investigation into 9/11 � Bob Graham � and 9/11 Commissioner and former Senator Bob Kerrey are calling for either a � PERMANENT 9/11 commission � or a new 9/11 investigation to get to the bottom of it.An FBI informant hosted and rented a room to two hijackers in 2000.Specifically, investigators for the Congressional Joint Inquiry discovered that an FBI informant had hosted and even rented a room to two hijackers in 2000 and that, when the Inquiry sought to interview the informant, the FBI refused outright, and then hid him in an unknown location, and that a high-level FBI official stated these blocking maneuvers were undertaken under orders from the White House.As the New York Times notes : Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused the White House on Tuesday of covering up evidence �.The accusation stems from the Federal Bureau of Investigation�s refusal to allow investigators for a Congressional inquiry and the independent Sept. 11 commission to interview an informant, Abdussattar Shaikh, who had been the landlord in San Diego of two Sept. 11 hijackers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government �minders� obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses (and see this ) The 9/11 Commissioners concluded that officials from the Pentagon lied to the Commission, and considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements The tape of interviews of air traffic controllers on-duty on 9/11 was intentionally destroyed by crushing the cassette by hand, cutting the tape into little pieces, and then dropping the pieces in different trash cans around the building as shown by this NY Times article (summary version is free; full version is pay-per-view) and by this article from the Chicago Sun-Times As reported by ACLU , FireDogLake , RawStory and many others, declassified documents shows that Senior Bush administration officials sternly cautioned the 9/11 Commission against probing too deeply into the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 The CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations .</span>9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote : The chief lawyer for Guantanamo litigation � Vijay Padmanabhan � said that torture of 9/11 suspects was widespread.Indeed, some of the main sources of information were tortured right up to the point of death .Moreover, the type of torture used by the U.S. on the Guantanamo suspects is of a special type.Senator Levin revealed that the the U.S. used Communist torture techniques specifically aimed at creating false confessions.(and see this , this , this and this ).At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being �tortured� One of the Commission�s main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:57 | 5882251 Billy Sol Estes Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:49 | 5882189 oudinot I don't know �what happened on 911;
