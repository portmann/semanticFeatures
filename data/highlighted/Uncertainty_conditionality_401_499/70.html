35 years ago.US culture is improving and not getting worse.2)  Economic mobility was big in the 1950s ? 1970s because of the creative destruction and labor shortage after WW2.It was the post-WW2 is the historical outlier than the historical norm.3)  David Brooks forgets it was the college educated couples who had a higher divorce rate in the 1960s and 1970s that ?had the culture problem.(I believe this turned around in the mid 1980s)  Now we have seen the opposive in terms of divorce rate and I believe that is because college educated people wait until they are 30ish to get married.Putting off marriage until your career is settled and you mature at 30ish might be the keys to culture success.Getting married after 30 might be the key to culture success, but not to demographic success.Every developed country faces a birth rate crisis because of that kind of behavior.But that is not the solution the Murray/Brooks/Douthat/Caplan are identifying for the poor people.They say find religion (Ok not Caplan), get married/have children, and work hard for success.These are good recommendations but I would suggest even marrying too early may hinder your success when a person should focus on their career.I think focusing on careers until somebody is 30 will lower poverty but it is following the Singapore/Japan Solution which create birth shortage.That is so funny about reading Bryan Caplan which is like the Woody Allen relationship/chicken joke from Annie Hall.The poor people are immoral and lazy and deserve to be paid less but the economy needs the eggs of cheap labor.The birth shortage in Japan and Italy (and perhaps Singapore) is due to the (perhaps) retrograde views of many in those societies to women working.Women in those countries spend all kinds of time and money getting education and employment credentials and experience (just like everywhere else), and then are expected to stop working when they have kids.Not surprisingly, rather than do that, they just don?t have kids.The last time I brought this up around here, I was told that professionals are actually a pretty small part of the Japanese population, so they can?t be driving the birthrate problem.I didn?t have an effective rebuttal to that.Bemoans the lack of criticism and critical discussion in the left, while not allowing any comments.I?m sure there?s some convoluted rationalization for that though, so it?s OK!Bruenig?s problem is that she doesn?t see the difference between a norm and an aspiration.Her saying that poor people ?want to get married? is no response at all to the claim that we need to reintroduce proper marriage norms.At the level of costless declarations, everyone wants motherhood and apple pie, but when you actually have to make tradeoffs, that?s when the differences emerge and norms matter.I want to be thin, and I also want to eat the cake.If eating the cake is socially tolerated and even encouraged by a permissive society (lack of norms), I may well end up fat.#4: Never heard the term ?gaslighting? before, but ?the tendency to try to make someone feel crazy as a way to win an argument? must be awfully tempting in the circles Freddie deBoer travels.in.3.and 4.At least today Cowen isn?t linking to another Mercatus affiliated economist arguing that poverty in the black community is the result of genetics, which is progress of sorts.It?s also an example of the drift described by deBoar (in 4.), although in the opposite direction.deBoar deplores the creeping generalization,?mansplaining? being one example given, where a phenomenon (a mn explaining to a woman something about which the woman has superior knowledge), although it certainly exists, is the exception, but, over time, the term is applied to an ever expanding set of circumstances until it becomes the rule.It?s like the explanation for poverty in the black community, in which culture no doubt plays some part but over time has become the explanation for black poverty among those of a particular political persuasion.Grow up.I know the comments get a little dicey, but I?ve never seen Tyler link to something sympathetically that was actually racist.http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/03/11/the-rich-uncle-pennybags-test/ Here?s a niche for a sustainable population of drones.I set up a USB charging port, and the drones bring me things.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If we had standardized drone parts, I could even replace a worn-out motor or a damaged propeller.</span>Poor little drone, I?ll help you.Of course, I?m not interested in shiny buttons or pieces of glass.U.S. currency and iPhones would be nice.Previous post: South (North) Korea fact of the day Next post: How much of a drag on growth is a strong U.S. dollar?How good is a weak euro?Launching The Innovation Renaissance The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will(Eventually) Feel Better Judge and Jury: American Tort Law on Trial Markets and Cultural Voices: Liberty vs. Power in the Lives of Mexican Amate Painters (Economics, Cognition, and Society)</div></body></html>
