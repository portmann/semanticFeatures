Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:54 | 5881723 MisterMousePotato ~120Mbs of the ~440Mbs are 'stored' in pipelines, locally, or on ships and the like (tanker trucks in Detroit), and thus not included in the amounts in true storage, such as the Cushing facility.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:54 | 5881725 wrs1 Maybe you should go look at the data yourself and see what you are missing.You should also understand there are over a billion barrels of storage for petroleum products and crude gets moved from it's storage to refined product storage after it's processed.Last week, refinery capacity was at 86.6%, normally it ramps up over 95% when there are large inventories of crude and it will soon again.That is why that chart shows dramatic dips.There is no past history in that chart that supports the fantasy extrapolation line that has been drawn by the moron who wrote the article.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 10:57 | 5881491 winflation Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:04 | 5881763 wrs1 Well that is because refinery utilizaiton is at 86.6% and inventories are not very high right now.When the refineries begin ramping up for the summer driving season, the builds will turn to draws.There is also a pipeline opening in April that will move 250k bbl/day from Permian to CC which will reduce input to Cushing by 2m bbl/week, that alone will eliminate the inflows that are causing the build.That pipeline is called the Cactus line if you are interested.Thu, 03/12/2015 -

11:33 | 5881602 Kirk2NCC1701 Isn't it perversely ironic that only Tertiary Wealth (paper assets) seem to have value right now -- and only US paper at that?And isn't it perversely ironic that Primary Wealth (PM and Energy Resources) is getting crushed, when world population and its demands for modern goods keeps growing?This seems counter-intuitive to Austrian economics theory, but there it is.For now, as in the last 6 years, the Keynesians are still winning and getting richer (wealth transferring from weak hands to strong hands).I guess if the Consumer won't buy things (lack or full-time or decent paying jobs), then the Finance clans will buy ownership of companies that are making all these things, and are also buying Primary wealth on the cheap -- now that they've beaten down the prices.The Wall St guys must be laughing their butts off, now that Main St has blown its wad on buying pricey PM in the last few years  (with unintended help from the likes of ZH), and they can buy it for 40% off.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:49 | 5881689 Pasadena Phil I don't know Tyler.Here we are producing all of this oil and yet why do you present the only choice is to stab US producers in the back?If we are EVER going to be oil independent, we have to WANT it and when the opportunity presents itself (and it's got its hands around our throat and announcing itself loudly right in our faces trying to get our attention!), the answer is to surrender to OPEC and defend the imports?I don't get it.We don't have to cut back domestic production.We need to decide RIGHT now whether being oil independent is important or not.Whether it is better to keep funding state-sponsored terrorism via the petrodollar and OPEC than to just make a political decision to start commiting to the refineries, pipelines, storage facilities, LNG plants and more necessary to achieve that goal and become an oil exporter again.What is so bad about the US regaining control of the price of oil?Do you want chronic shortages in a world of $200 oil from our enemies or would you prefer a reliable source of $85 oil from our own backyard.?What am I missing here?What is wrong with everyone?STOP IMPORTING OIL!!!Thu, 03/12/2015 -

13:51 | 5882207 Totentänzerlied The US can be oil independent when it can reliably produce 19 million bbl/day at or below about $30.At $85 it could be oil independent - with roughly the economic conditions of Belarus or maybe India, though 85 would still be below production cost for many fields, it wouldn't matter, as the entire energy sector would have long since been nationalized outright (see:every petrostate ever).Careful what you wish for.Find the decades where US was relevant on a global scale.Bonus: find the point where Nixon ended convertibility and marginal utility of debt?began its relentless decline.This is all a mystery to the smartest people in the room.The only thing you need to understand is the floor beneath production costs for that marginal barrel, which is just physics plus supply and demand.http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Crude_oil_prices_sinc... (log scale) "We don't have to cut back domestic production."Pretty soon it will be more profitable to leave it in the ground.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:51 | 5882213 crazybob369 You are either completely naive, or simply don't understand how the real world works.TPTB have no interest in the US becoming energy dependent and will block any attempts at doing so (Keystone).By funding terror through petrodollars, they keep the defense sector well funded with drone contracts, weapons, surveillance tech, etc.There is a $10 differential between WTI and Brent.With Houston back on line that means the refiners in PADD1 will be importing WTI instead of Brent Oil.Rail car transport of WTI is much more expensive and limited than via oil tanker.Meaning East Coast gasoline prices will level off and then drop.Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!03-12 13:39: Zillow's (Z) Trulia unit could lose an appeal to block ListHub... 03-12 13:39: Garmin (GRMN) has adopted rule 10B5-1 plan in a USD 300mln share... 03-12 13:39: To note for Charter (CHTR), Bright House spokesperson reports that... 03-12 13:39: XOMA Corp (XOMA) upgraded from neutral to buy at Ladenberg 03-12 13:39: NGL Energy Partners (NGL) CEO Michael Krimbill bought 20,000 shares... 03-12 13:39: Hutchison Port price their USD 500mln 3y issuance at +127.5bps and... 03-12 13:39: Banking sources say Sabadell (SAB SM) is looking to raise... 03-12 13:33: Publicis acquires omni-channel services firm Expicient 03-12 13:33: Red Hat April volatility elevated into Q4 and outlook 03-12 13:33: NYSE market internals summary 03-12 13:24: 30-Year Bonds Draw 2.681%, Allotted at High 98.37%, Bid/Cover 2.18 03-12 13:24: Stifel Shares Quiet Following Earlier Bloomberg Headline CRT May Be In Talks to Purchase Sterne Agee's Equities from Stifel, Could Pay ~$40M 03-12 13:24: Intra-Cellular Therapies Shareholder Sosland Buys 250,000 Shares @$24.00/Share -Form 4 03-12 13:24: San Francisco Judge in Trulia, ListHub Case Has Tentatively Denied Prelim.Injunction 03-12 13:24: Net Element's TOT Money Achieves Record Milestone of 1M+ Recurring Mobile Payment Subscribers 03-12 13:24: Garmin Announces Adoption of Rule 10b5-1 Plan Related to Share buyback Plan 03-12 13:24: Books on Valeant's $9.6B High Yield Bond Near $29B, According to Source -Reuters 03-12 13:24: Disney's Annual Holder Meeting Recently Getting Underway: Title of Next Star Wars Film 'Rogue One,' Co.Will Undertake Three Star Wars Films Between Present and May of '17 Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!03-12 12:09: What Americans Think Is The #1 US Problem 03-12 11:55: The Mystery Of America's Missing Wage Growth Has Been Solved 03-12 11:15: Why I Don't Want An Apple Watch (And It's Not Battery Life) 03-12 9:24: Are Alarm Bells Ringing Over Greece's Pivot To Russia?03-12 7:45: Two Police Officers Shot Outside Ferguson Police Department: Shooting Caught On Tape 03-12 9:57: Is This Why Stocks Are Soaring, And Some Context For Today's Melt-Up 03-12 8:02: Fed Will Open "Pandora's Box" With Rate Hike, UBS Warns Make sure to read our " How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters] " Guide It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .Here's our Cookie Policy .Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Copyright ©2009-2015 ZeroHedge.com/ABC Media, LTD; All Rights Reserved.Zero Hedge is intended for Mature Audiences.Familiarize yourself with our legal and use policies every time you engage the site: they're updated constantly without notice.Don't poke around on the site without reviewing our Cookie Policy ; you expressly agree to our serving cookies unless they're disabled on your browser (instructions included).Happy surfing.Review our notice on Racial Discrimination .Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!</div></body></html>
