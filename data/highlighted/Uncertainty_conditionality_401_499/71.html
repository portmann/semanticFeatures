Current Affairs , Economics ?| Permalink Even if South Korea grows at only 3 percent per year, it is expanding annually by an amount equivalent to the size of North Korea?s economy.That is from the new and noteworthy The Korean Economy: From a Miraculous Past to a Sustainable Future , by Barry Eichengreen, Wonhyuk Lim, Yung Chul Park, and Dwight H. Perkins.And part of that Sout Korean growth is the complete avoidance of taking on any obligation at all to deal with almost inevitable re-unification.Whether this makes the South Koreans wiser than the West Germans (in the sort of material terms this web sites seems to value as a pearl beyond price) will be seen in another couple of decades.I don?t see your point.Even if reunification is inevitable ? which i doubt, how is South Korean growth made higher by avoiding an obligation ? also a questionable proposition, to said reunification.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In fact if reunification were to take place higher growth in the South would make the process easier.</span>What exactly do you mean by avoiding an obligation?What should they be doing right now to be ready for re-unification in the future?Please read below.It was posted before reading your notably succinct summation of why someone just might want to use a historical example of how one of two nations divided by the Cold War reunified ? including the immense costs associated with it.Well, to answer both ? some societies/cultures seem themselves in terms of identity, not national boundaries.This most certainly applied to Germany (note that the East Germans supporting reunification in the face of a still functioning totalitarian state said ?Wir sind das Volk,? with its slightly embarassing tone to West German ears of nationalism), and there is little question that Koreans also consider themselves to be a ?Volk.There is a further parallel in terms of Brandt?s Ostpolitik in terms of East Germany, and the danger of supporting a totalitarian system in charge of a state comprised of people you consider to be your fellow countrymen.Not to mention what your allies (in both cases, the U.S. and its stationed military forces) feel is correct, particularly in regards to providing a security guarantee in the face of a notable military threat.The South Koreans are, apparently, simply hoping that re-unification will never be something they face, so they are apparently not making any provisions for the possibility that it may occur.This is not completely irrational ? but in contrast to East Germany, with a Soviet Union at the end of its imperial ambitions, South Korea seems to to feel that avoiding the question in its entirety is its best course.And if China is willing to add another historical province to its realm, for example due to the sort of simple compassion and desire for stability that has marked so much of China?s foreign policy since the 1950s (yes, that was Realpolitik sarcasm), it is quite conceivable that those individuals who measure things by growth will be immensely pleased at such Chinese willingness to have taken on what is likely to be an extremely long term, and extremely costly, project.Those slightly less enamored of China reacquiring former imperial realms may object, but compared to 3% annual growth a year, what do they have to offer to Very Serious People in comparison?Certainly not asking South Korea to sacrifice any growth to support fellow Koreans.As for what they should be doing?That is a real challenge ? how about making a downpayment on something like the German/American KfW ? ?The KfW, formerly KfW Bankengruppe (banking group), is a German government-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt.Its name originally comes from Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (?Reconstruction Credit Institute?).It was formed in 1948 after World War II as part of the Marshall Plan.It is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany (80%) and the States of Germany (20%).[2] It is led by a five-member Managing Board headed by Ulrich Schröder, which in turn reports to a 37-member Supervisory Board.The chair of the Supervisory Board changes annually between the German Federal Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs; the chairman for 2014 is Sigmar Gabriel.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KfW And what does this mean in the sort of pragmatic reality this web site preens itself on presenting?How about the merging of the currencies?With the Monetary, Economic, and Social Union of Germany on 1 July 1990 (in preparation for German reunification on 3 October 1990) the Deutsche Mark became the currency of East Germany.Around 4500 tonnes of now-obsolete East German coins were melted down at the Rackwitz metal works in 1990.Most of the paper money was placed into storage in 1990 and 1991, but destroyed in 2002 following a theft in 2001 (see below).Many examples of notes and coins, however, remain in private hands.Almost all the paper money of the GDR (about 100 billion Mark, in 620 million banknotes with a volume of 4,500 m3 (160,000 cu ft), about 300 boxcars), including all the currency collected at the time of the monetary union and the never-used 200 and 500 Mark banknotes, was placed into storage in 1990 and 1991 in two 300-metre (980 ft) long sandstone caverns in the Thekenberge near Halberstadt.In total, 3,000 tonnes of banknotes, passbooks, and checks were stored there, having been brought by military convoy from the Staatsbank der DDR in Berlin.The currency became the property of the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) in 1994 through its merger with the Staatsbank Berlin (the post-reunification name for the Staatsbank der DDR).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_mark I could tell just from the length of your response that you weren?t going to answer my question.I reiterate: Well, he did claim that South Korea should get the U.S. to provide start-up capital for an internal development bank that could also conveniently provide lots of support to the North 40 years after its inception.You never said they had to be good recommendations.prior_approval March 12, 2015 at 10:04 am Create a bank like the KfW ? was that too buried in the long text?and implement something like the ?Soli? (the German income tax surcharge ? see below) before reunification, if only to capitalize a future ?Korean Bank For Reconstruction.(The U.S. could even get in the action, much like with the KfW.)One hopes that was succinct enough, being based on the now decades long experience of one of the two nations that were divided by the Cold War.And as is certainly gospel at this web site, increasing taxes to finance re-unification would inevitably lead to lower growth.And it is considered banal, at least in West Germany, to point out that the costs of re-unification had a major impact on West German growth.For example, simply assuming the pension payments of millions of retirees who had never paid into the West German system was a major public expense.Somehow, I doubt that the South Koreans, seeing how this has played out in the Bundesrepublik, are setting aside adequate reserves to support North Korean retirees which a Korean state re-unified under ROK leadership would be forced to support.Better to avoid such questions, and just concentrate on growth.prior_approval March 12, 2015 at 10:11 am ?Well, he did claim that South Korea should get the U.S. to provide start-up capital for an internal development bank that could also conveniently provide lots of support to the North 40 years after its inception.Except for the fact that the KfW took over the East German central bank ? and currency.And that the start-up capital (see below) would come from South Korea, using something like the German ?Soli? ? things look a bit different in 2015 as compared to 1948.Which just happens to the date that Korea was officially divided into separate nations by the U.S. and the Soviet Union ? one year before Germany, by the way.You never said they had to be good recommendations.Because after all, Germany is such a bad example of how to re-unify a nation divided by the Cold War, right?Dave Anthony March 12, 2015 at 10:17 am It also is not clear why the South Koreans have ANY obligation to the North at all.http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/04/17/70-of-south-koreans-will-donate-to-fund-for-unity-with-north-want-us-and-china-to-cough-up-too/ South Korea already has a bank that provides development aid, and they have already provided humanitarian aid to North Korea.Also, your reference to a lot of stuff that Germany implemented after the fall of East Germany (solidarity tax, currency union, etc.) is not credible as a proposal of what SK should do now.He?s saying they should start stockpiling money now ? not using it to fund further development of the South ? as a massive rainy day fund in case the government of the North finally falls.But that?s not what West Germany did.They just became a wealthy society, and then started paying subsidies (and still are) to the East after unification.South Korea should be thinking about it at a high governmental level and have contingency plans on how to respond to a Northern regime that is interested in detente / unification, but the South Koreans are ambivalent about a unification because of the costs.It has been so long that they view the other side as foreign.German unification came only 45 years after the end of WW2 and the division of the country.Helmut Kohl, head of the West, was born in 1930.Park Gun-hye, President of South Korea, was born in 1952, after the end of the Korean war.She has known no other Korea but that divided, and grew up in the devastation caused by an attacking North Korea.She still supports unification, but there is a greater gulf between her and the North, and it grows every year.There is no exclave like West Berlin in the North? Judah Benjamin Hur March 12, 2015 at 1:54 pm I think he means they should have a reunification tax and then make sure to put all the money in a lockbox.The North Koreans won?t have access to the lockbox until they agree to unification.In the meantime, it will be necessary to camouflage the lockbox and hide it in a secure location.(Not That) Bill O'Reilly March 12, 2015 at 10:03 am This is asinine.Virtually all of the costs of German Unification were borne post hoc, because the terms and timing of unification were so unknowable as to make ex ante investments foolhardy.Yes, Germany set up a variety of institutions to (1) encourage a continued feeling of national identity across the divided nations and (2) provide internal developmental assistance that could be easily directed towards the East German states if and when unity was achieved, but South Korea already engages in the former, and the latter can hardly be described as bearing an ex ante cost of unification.Virtually all of the costs of German Unification were borne post hoc? Ostpolitik says nothing to you, does it?Or the assumption of all of East Germany?s financial obligations, a fact that was clear long before actual re-unification became possible?West Germany had always planned for re-unification ? though when actually confronted with it, the costs were much higher than had been expected.The South Koreans are undoubtedly not making that mistake of West German optimism ? which just might be one reason they would rather ignore the entire situation.Another reason, of course, being the especially vile nature of the North Korean regime.It isn?t as if South Korea is facing precisely the same conditions as arose in 1989.@p_a your claim that South Korea is ?ignoring? the possibility of reunification is utterly ridiculous to even the most casual observer of Korea.And so in your mind the cost of a KFW style bank would negativly effect SK?s growth enough to make some kind of difference?According to Wikipedia, SK?s annual GDP is 1.7 trillion, how much of that should have been set aside to deal with reunification?Im assuming, of course, that you are just ignoring the links that Dan1111 offered below because, as you like to say, you are creating a narrative and those facts run counter to it.Please see above about the KfW ? after all, it was American policy to encourage German re-unification at the start of the Marshall Plan, just as it is official American policy today to encourage Korean re-unification.As noted here ? ?United States support for Korean reunification is firm, reflecting the strong U.S. interest in seeing a united Korea that is free, democratic and led by the ROK.When Korea is inevitably reunified, the major U.S. policy interests will include ensuring a peaceful and stable region, preventing the emergence of new security threats, and supporting Korea as it creates a unified, democratic, market-oriented society and economy that benefits all the Korean people.http://www.brookings.edu/research/presentations/2015/01/20-korean-reunification-revere The South Koreans have little desire to look at the costs of re-unification, much less mitigate them.And as ?TC? is undoubtedly aware, the comparatively mild ?Soli? remains a sore point of German politics.Do you see the South Korean government collecting any extra taxes at all to face the likely, and officially U.S. supported, possibility of immense re-unification costs in the future?( German only ? I?m sure ?TC? and so many of the well informed commenters here will have no problem with the text, of course ? http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidaritätszuschlag ) And part of that Sout Korean growth is the complete avoidance of taking on any obligation at all to deal with almost inevitable re-unification.South Korea?s govt debt to GDP is at 35%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If they were to increase this to 100% (which looks manageable given the experience in the US/Western Europe), this would raise roughly $1trillion or $40k per North Korean citizen.</span>Surely that should cover most of the costs.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And if we expropriated all your and prior approvals money and maxed out  your credit cards we could probably make a 10000 dollar dent in that number.</span>Plus whatever we could get for two pink mopeds.It?s not like North Korea gradually became more and more socialist.It was invaded by Stalin, and Stalin set up a Korean Stalinist dictatorship that continues until today.This wasn?t a ?slippery slope? type of thing.Name a country that elected Socialists and then gradually evolved to a North Korea.Doesn?t exist.If anything, it goes the other way; look at China and Vietnam.They may may have started as extreme communist dictatorships after bloody revolutions/wars, but they recognized the need to open their economies or to stagnate and die like the USSR.Meanwhile, France has a socialist president.It?s not about to become a North Korea.And other European governments regularly elect socialists without any danger.What if? they never re-unify, and North Korea gets absorbed into China, and South Korea becomes then Korea?Politically NK and China are much more similar than NK and SK.SK and USA are much more closely aligned.North Korea might benefit from being placed under a Chinese trusteeship, if China were willing to be a disinterested party and not flood the place with Han Chinese colonists.The disjunction in standards of living and the indubitably warped cultural development of the North render re-unification inadvisable.As for South Korea, they better start breeding again.Right now the place looks like the site of an incipient demographic death-spiral.Thoght experiment, what if instead of reunification North Korea simply ditched its communist regime and opened itself up?International investment would no doubt come crashing in as suddenly a new market would open up offering plenty of cheap labor and high returns to those who make capital investments there.NK would experience rapid growth, probably much like China did in the last several decades.How would this be different from a reunification case where the South simply takes over the North and puts its economic policies inplace?There?s nothing the South as to do to ?pay for? anything here.The world simply has to have enough savings to fund an investment surge in North Korea, which shouldn?t be that difficult as the global money markets is awash in trillions of dollars in cash, much of it earning near 0% interest rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sounds like if an opened North Korea enjoyed an investment boom, the gov?t could impose a modest capital gains tax.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That would certainly provide North Korean retirees a better standard of living than they would get if North Korea remains as it is forever.</span>If/when NK fails, it?s assumed there will be streams of refugees trying to get into China and South Korea and Russia, since the anemic food distribution network would lead to lots of starving people.If you believe those governments are cosmically stupid, they haven?t planned for this.Now, whatever their plans are, they may be wrong and/or insufficient, but it?s certainly not ignored.SK probably considers the problems of NK collapse more seriously than they consider the problem of NK invading them.Rapid growth is one thing, and aligning North Korean living standards with one of the world?s wealthiest countries is another.Reunification implies uniform policies across the nation, and that relies on living standards, income, etc., being roughly similar.There would be a big cost to make that happen.Look at it another way: China may have experienced rapid growth in recent decades, but imagine if you took 150,000,000 people with typical Chinese income levels and added them on to the U.S., applying the U.S. tax brackets to their income and all of the U.S. poverty and welfare programs according to current rules?The balance sheet would not look good.This is analagous to what South Korea would face, except North Korea is starting from a far lower baseline.It would also experience mass migration to the South.The wage differential is at least 20X and growing.Fortunately, South Korea has a greying population so importing millions of workers could help offset its own demographic decline.And for the HBD folks, Koreans are coethnics.There are bound to be fewer problems integrating North Koreans into South Korean society than there would be importing millions of, say, Ethiopians.Is the average NK refugee capable of finding employment in the SK economy?They?ve been starved physically and mentally for decades.The brilliance of the american foriegn policy that created South Korea had to be corrected, so they created a north Korea equivalent run by Isis.Honestly officer I didn?t know that shaking the shelving would make all the glass trinkets fall and break.The Korean peninsula was as bloody and messy as anything in the middle East, with armed militia murdering and geopolitical posturing.The US stuck it out, and the results are apparent.The north is as much a showcase of rigid communism as the south is to free market democracy.Iraq is a great showcase for feckless US forgotten policy and taints anything any american president says as much as north Korea taints any thing a communist says.They? stuck it out, the political class forum both parties, the military and society that kept the course in Korea.They? left an utter disaster in the middle East.They are going to need that border secure for a long, long time.Yes, sock some of that money away for future aid, technical assistance, etc., but put more of it into assuring you can turn away the would be fence jumpers when the time comes.The probability of unification is very low.I would say a DPRK invasion of the South has a higher probability.And I think it?s very complicated to estimate North Korea?s GDP.Launching The Innovation Renaissance The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will(Eventually) Feel Better Judge and Jury: American Tort Law on Trial Markets and Cultural Voices: Liberty vs. Power in the Lives of Mexican Amate Painters (Economics, Cognition, and Society)</div></body></html>
