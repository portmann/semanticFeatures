(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is by far the most talked about, highly-praised company in the world, and for good reason.</span>The stock has had an incredible run over the past year.But Apple's capital allocation program - heavily skewed toward buybacks over dividends - leaves income investors in a tough spot.Apple is likely to pass along another modest dividend increase next month because it prefers buybacks, and also since the vast majority of its cash is held overseas.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At a 1.5% yield, income investors might want to think about taking some Apple profits off the table and reinvesting in a higher yielding stock, of which there are many.</span>It goes without saying that there is no stock more obsessed over than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) right now.Apple is the subject of much stock market discussion, and because of this, I'm starting to wonder whether all this Apple hype is a sign of a contrarian indicator.After all, it wasn't that long ago that Apple was in a similar position of "do no wrong" territory, then proceeded to lose half its value.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Apple might be ripe for a correction, because after its 62% rally over the past year, it's likely that Apple now represents a disproportionate percentage of an investor's portfolio.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For me personally, Apple now constitutes approximately 20% of my retirement portfolio, which concerns me.</span>And I'm betting that many other investors are in a similar position.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It may be appropriate for income investors to consider taking some profits if your exposure to Apple has gotten too high.</span>Here's why income investors should think about rebalancing their portfolios to use Apple's huge stock price gains to generate more income.Income Investors Are In A Very Tough Spot Before Apple's tremendous increase in stock price, it offered a great opportunity for income investors.My own cost basis is $63 per share, meaning I personally enjoy a 3% yield on cost, based on Apple's current $1.88 per share annualized dividend.But yield on cost is not a perfect metric, as it is a purely backward-looking measure.Apple's dividend yield when I bought was far higher than it is now.Apple's current yield is just 1.5% at a stock price of $125 per share.That is the reinvestment rate, and the yield that investors should be concerned with, more so than the yield on cost.The yield on cost being significantly higher than the current yield has much more to do with Apple's huge increase in stock price rather than dividend growth.Apple delivered just a 7.8% dividend increase last year.It's due to increase its dividend again next month, and Apple needs to go big on a dividend raise if it wants to keep income investors satisfied.Another 8%-10% increase simply won't be enough to convince income investors to hold the stock, as even a 10% raise would only lift Apple's yield to 1.65%.If Apple is serious about retaining income investors, at both the retail and institutional levels, it will need a much larger dividend increase.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But for Apple, this is harder to do than it seems.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>On the surface, it seems that Apple should have no trouble passing along a huge dividend raise, since analysts expect another 33% earnings growth in fiscal 2015, to $8.60 per share.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Considering the fact that Apple pays just $1.88 in dividends and has $177 billion in cash and marketable investments on its balance sheet , it seems crazy for Apple not to pass along a major dividend increase.</span>However, it's also true that a lot of Apple's cash hoard, 89% , is held overseas.Apple doesn't have access to this cash, unless it pays a high repatriation tax, which it has signaled no intention of doing.The only other option for Apple to access its own cash to finance its capital allocation program is to take on debt, which it has done.Apple's long-term debt went from $16 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 to $32 billion at the end of fiscal 2014.Apple has conducted some bond sales more recently, such as a $6.5 billion debt issue last month .But even in this case, Apple clearly prefers to utilize these funds for buybacks, and chooses not to pass along very high dividend increases.Use Apple's Massive Stock Price Gain To Your Advantage I'm an income investor, and my personal investing goal is to generate high income from my investments.When I bought Apple and formed my position, the stock was yielding well over 2.5%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But Apple's massive rally and small dividend increases might force my hand.</span>As much as I admire Apple as a company, love its products and am glad to see my position double in value, my core income goal is not being satisfied to its fullest.Apple now yields well below the overall stock market, and unless it significantly increases its dividend, this will remain so.At 20% of my IRA, I can significantly increase my portfolio's income generation by trimming some of my Apple position and reinvesting in a higher yield.This makes more sense given Apple's massive stock price increase, since investors are essentially playing with house money.The good news is that even within the technology sector, there are many highly profitable companies that offer higher yields and stronger dividend growth than Apple, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and the list goes on.While it's easy to get caught up in the never-ending Apple hysteria, practical portfolio management needs to be maintained.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I'm an income investor, and in support of that philosophy, it might be time for income investors to consider taking some of their Apple profits off the table and reinvesting in a higher yield elsewhere.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Source: Why It Might Be Time To Take Some Apple Profits Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.</span>(More...)The author wrote this article
