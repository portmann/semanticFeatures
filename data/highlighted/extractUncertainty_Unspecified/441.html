Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSEARCA:VXX) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 10, 2015  8:28 PM ET �|� About: iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) , Includes: SPY , TVIX , UVXY , XIV by: Markos Kaminis A month ago, I suggested investors short the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN.</span>Intense concern about Greece was quelled and a peace accord happened in Ukraine, easing stress from the market as expected.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The VXX dropped more than 20%, but volatility is on the rise now due to expectations the Fed will remove important language from its policy statement next week.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Because of the importance and the timing of the Fed's forward interest rate plans and the price of volatility today, downside is less likely.</span>Investors short the VXX should close out those stakes, take the gain.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some might consider using the security long now as a hedge against risk.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>About a month ago, I suggested investors short the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSEARCA: VXX ).</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Volatility is back now, and the CorpusPath of the VXX is more difficult to determine over the near term.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The VXX is no longer excessively overvalued in my opinion, and so I suggest investors take the approximate 15% 1-month gain here and close out positions.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some may consider going long volatility now into the Fed's March meeting and thereafter if the Fed removes important language from its policy statement.</span>1-Month Chart of VXX at Seeking Alpha The chart above here reflects the captured opportunity I recommended to followers on February 3rd.The Greece situation was mitigated, Ukraine signed a peace accord with rebels to the east, Europe progressed with its non-standard easing measures and markets in the U.S. looked forward to better days.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The market has new worries now, and they are significant enough to take off volatility shorts here.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In fact, investors might consider holding the VXX security long at this point as a hedge against risk.</span>So what is causing this latest concern?It's clear that since the Employment Situation Report was published for February on Friday, the market has been in a tizzy.The reason is clear.The data was too good, showing better-than-expected gains in nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate.It forced the market to look ahead to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for March 17-18.After that meeting, I expect the Federal Reserve will publish its monetary policy statement absent of the term "patient" from this sentence in its monetary policy : "Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."However, it's important to recall the sentence that precedes this one, which says: "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."International developments include the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and other currencies.The Fed would like to see the dollar strong, yes, but not so strong that it limits the sales of American exports overseas.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Given that the dollar is sharply on the rise, it is now possible the Fed could hold off on its policy statement change until different circumstances exist, but I'm not anticipating that and neither is the market.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The best action for the Fed with regard to dollar strength risk could be to act sooner rather than later, and let the market digest its inevitable reality.</span>The reason the wording change matters so much is because it would then open the way for a Fed Funds Rate hike at any moment thereafter.I do not see a rate hike happening until September, based on my interpretation of what Fed Chair Yellen said in her testimony to Congress recently, but that is of no matter to investors today.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The actual hike in interest rates should be preceded by market volatility about six months prior to the first event, in my expert view.</span>March is six months prior to September, and if the language is removed in March, it will gear investors toward significant changes in the investment environment.Higher interest rates matter because they raise the cost of capital to American businesses, consumers, and corporations.Most importantly and directly for investors, a higher cost of capital to corporations raises the bar for economic value creation, which is a key factor in market value creation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>When rates actually do see increase, at that point, the market will have priced this in and stocks may even do well considering that a relatively low cost environment will still exist.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This reality may even help stocks between the Fed's removal of "patient" and its first rate hike.</span>The cost of capital will not really increase all that much and not all too fast either.So the operating environment will still be fertile for American companies this year.I expect as that is realized, this initial reaction in stocks will be hemmed some.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, of immediate concern for the protection of capital at risk, the market will focus closely on the Fed's March meeting, which is just a week away.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Being short volatility now is not recommended, so close out your iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN stakes we bought a month ago (I used puts) and take your gains.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If you used any other security to capture the decrease in volatility we anticipated, I would close those out as well.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You'll note that all the volatility instruments are down sharply today save for the inverse volatility play.</span>Also note the year-to-date shows some of the loss we captured in our short stake of the past month.However, the trailing twelve-month performance illustrates that these instruments are not to be held long term.Because of how they function, they will lose money over the long term.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These are costly instruments used to hedge risk though they are also used to speculate now that all investors have access to them via securities like these.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In conclusion, the prospect of increased volatility ahead of the March meeting and thereafter if the Fed removes the language gives cause for concern.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We have achieved a paper gain while short volatility over the last month.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Things have changed now, and so I suggest investors capture the capital gain here and close the short volatility stake I suggested a month ago.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some may find value in being long volatility now, but keep in mind the long-term performance of these securities when doing so.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If the reader found value in this discussion, he may find value in following my column .</span><span style='background-color:
