Seeking Alpha Chicago Fed President Evans is willing to risk higher inflation in the future with current low inflation environment, and his conditions for liftoff are noted.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Evans suggested that the FOMC is considering 2 rate hikes, each in 2015 and 2016 at 25 basis points each, and this is an important forward guidance.</span>This unofficial forward guidance is bullish on the USD and bearish on GLD.Despite Evans' dovish speech, GLD is not affected and continues its downtrend, and is being pulled down further by the strong labor market report.The impressive 06 March, 2015, labor report saw 295,000 new jobs added to the market and the unemployment rate down to 5.5%.In this context, we can take a look at the Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans' speech on 04 March, 2015.A point to note is that Evans is a voting member of the Federal Open Monetary Committee (FOMC) and a noted dove.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The point of this article is to explore his dovish views with his attention to the low inflation environment and speculate if the latest labor report will sway his vote in the next week's FOMC meeting.</span>We will then translate this into the movement for gold prices, as the current low inflation environment is reducing the appeal of gold and the prospect of higher interest rates is increasing the holding cost of gold.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These twin pressures are pulling investors away from gold, as the worries of financial instability over Grexit fades from Europe.</span>Right now, the key point of contention and a major decision point facing the FOMC is the pace and magnitude of its rates liftoff and the subsequent rates increment.There are those who are in the dovish camp, such as Evans, who are in support of a later rate hike, then there are those in the hawkish camp, such as the New York Fed President William Dudley, and finally, there are those in the centrist camp as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.It is noted that the dovish camp focuses on the current low inflation environment for prices and wages, even as it acknowledges the strong economic growth as the reason to push off the rate hike.Those on the hawkish camp emphasize on the strong economic growth, along with the accompanying strong labor market, and they discount the current low inflationary environment as transitory.The low energy price is seen as a boost to consumers, especially those in the lower income tiers who spend a larger portion of their income on energy needs, and it allows them to spend more on other areas for their enhanced welfare.They will then note that the effects of the monetary policy happen with a time lag, and hence it is important for them to act early even before high inflation rears its head.I am biased towards the hawkish view and would expect the Fed to liftoff in mid-2015 or earlier.However, it is still advisable to consider the dovish view, especially if one of them is voting on the FOMC.A key point of the hawks is that the period of monetary easing has been extended and more than sufficient.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>They would like to avoid the mistake made by the Greenspan Fed to keep rates for too long before lifting it in 2004 and causing financial instability, which led to the formation of the housing bubble.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The risk of waiting too long is also that inflation might overshoot the 2% inflation target once the low energy prices fade and interest rates remain too low.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The most radical part of Evans' speech is to condone the possible higher inflation, given the low interest rate environment.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is of the view that it is better to err on the side of caution than to risk persistent low inflation environment.</span>"Now consider the problem posed by waiting too long to raise rates and, subsequently, inflation picking up faster than we now expect.I simply do not see high costs to this scenario.Given how far inflation is from our target, some greater-than-expected pickup in inflation would actually be welcome.Furthermore, there is no great cost even if we were to end up with a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent."The bigger problem for Evans would be that the Fed will be forced to lower rates post rates liftoff after it finds that the higher interest rates are too restrictive to the economy.Evans painted an interesting view of history in the sense that he acknowledged that his inflation views were painted in the era where inflation is above 10%.It forced the Volcker Fed to take some dramatic actions with interest rates to reduce inflation to 4%.Despite his experience with high inflation, Evans sees that inflation is currently too low from the perspective of traditional inflation measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (currently at -0.1%) and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (currently at -0.2%).He credited the Fed's decision for QE3 in September 2012 to purchase $85 billion of bonds per month, as seen in the quote below.QE3 was credited with further recovery of the economy and was subsequently ended in October 2014."One of our most notable and controversial responses followed our September 2012 meeting.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At that time, the unemployment rate was over 8 percent and forecasts showed a strong risk that improvements in the labor market were about to stall.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It was clear that more accommodation was needed, but just how to provide that accommodation was unclear.</span>Against this backdrop, the FOMC announced that the Fed would steadily purchase $85 billion of long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.This open-ended program is often referred to as the third round of quantitative easing, or QE3."The point of him quoting history is to put into context that it is better for the Fed to maintain an easy monetary environment, as the economy recovers and until there are strong signs of inflation picking up.The common ground between the hawks and the doves is that they agree rates have to go up from the current 0%-0.25% range bound at some point in time.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Their difference rests on the timing.</span>Evans proposes 3 conditions for rates liftoff.His first condition is that the economy must be growing strongly.He acknowledged the current strong growth in the economy, but has the opinion that it is still not strong enough.The second condition is that he has to be confident that inflation has to reach the 2% target within a reasonable time frame of 1-2 years.His current view is that inflation will not reach the target until 2018 at least.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A second component is that he expects wages to rise by 3%-4% per year, assuming productivity progress of 1%-2% per year on top of a 2% inflation.</span>His point is that the tighter labor environment caused by economic progress will force employers to increase wages higher than the 2%-2.5% seen in the last 5 years to retain talent.One notable point is that this is actually better than the Japanese experience.Despite the mild inflation environment caused by the Bank of Japan, there were widespread reports of Japanese employers not willing to pay their employees more.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>They are basically ignoring despite Prime Minister Abe urging to do so, due to economic uncertainty and/or preference for share buybacks.</span>His last condition is that he would like to see market-based inflation compensation to be at least 2%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He acknowledged the point made by Chair Yellen that lower inflation compensation could be due to lower risk premium, but he is not convinced.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He views that it could be due to lower inflation expectations instead.</span>Evans' Hint Of Pace Of Rates Liftoff This is one piece of economic nugget that I did not expect to come out from his speech.There are no hints of it from the title of his speech urging patience and it is buried in the middle of his speech."In other words, according to the median CorpusPath for the target fed funds rate as projected by FOMC participants, rate increases of about 100 basis points for this year and next are to be expected.The FOMC meets eight times a year.So, the projected CorpusPath is consistent with a 25 basis point increase at every other FOMC meeting.I should note that this is a considerably slower, more gradual pace of rate increases than those implemented in 2004 through 2006 - the last time the Fed normalized policy following an extended period of very low interest rates."This is an interesting and valuable information, as this is not his personal view and rather it is the view of the entire FOMC.This would mean that we can be seeing 2 rate hikes this year, and in my opinion, in the mid and end of 2015 of 25 basis points being the most likely scenario.This is likely to be repeated in year 2016.Impact On The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ) The latest jobs report saw an average of 288,000 jobs added over the 3-month period from December 2014 to February 2015.This is higher than the average of 265,000 last year, as noted by Evans.My opinion is that even with such a strong labor figure published last week, it is unlikely for Evans to change his mind.However, it is more likely that he will be persuaded to go with the majority of the FOMC.After all, according to the projections done by the staff of the Chicago Fed, he thinks that the natural rate of employment is at 5.0%, which is significantly higher than the official FOMC range of 5.2% to 5.5%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>My view is that Evans' urging of patience may no longer find traction with his FOMC colleagues when he meets with them next week in Washington.</span>This is after the strong labor report which will give noted and influential hawks more ammunition in advancing their cause.They include New York Fed President and FOMC Vice Chairman William Dudley and Governor Stanley Fischer who is also the Fed Vice Chairman.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In fact, Chair Yellen who was considered to be dovish in the Bernanke Fed in her position as San Francisco Fed President and later Fed Vice Chair with her focus on employment slack is now seen as relatively hawkish with her interpretation of market-based inflation compensation, as a result of lower risk premium and not lower inflation expectation.</span>We can see from the chart above that the SPDR Gold Trust ETF remains on the bearish trend after Evans gave his speech on the 4th of March, as pointed by the arrow above.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even if we were to consider that the market needs 1 more day to digest his speech in different parts of the world with different time zones, there is also no notable bullish impact.</span>The impact of the strong labor report is clear with a gap down 2 days later as seen on the chart.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>GLD tracks the performance of gold after fees, and it is the easiest way to gain exposure to gold or short it in terms of time and expenses.</span>GLD has a market capitalization of $28.35 billion and daily transaction volume of around 7 million.Hence, it is one of the most liquid ETF in the market.This would mean that there are still people willing to sell GLD to you and with less slippage.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The golden nugget in Evans' speech about the possibility of 2 rate hikes in 2015 should not be discarded.</span>It would serve as an anchor in our expectations of higher interest rate and as clear of a forward guidance as there is in the market.It should be noted that this is an unofficial forward guidance, and coming from a noted dove has added weight.The official version would be released by the official FOMC statement by Chair Yellen.In my opinion, this would be the most useful part of his speech overall.Source: Chicago Fed Evans' Forward Guidance And GLD Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
