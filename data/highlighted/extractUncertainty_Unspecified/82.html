(NYSE: AGN ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), being ripe for disruption as I believe SIEN to have superior and safer products.</span>That said SIEN did well to drive sales, growing revenue 27% on the full year and 31% in Q4 (full year 2014 sales were at gross margins of 74.3%), with what should show to be its smallest sales team in company history.What I mean by this is SIEN ended the year with just 39 total sales reps after starting the year with just 33.Sales team expansion is the primary initiative for SIEN heading into 2015 and the single most important key metric that I'll be watching for growth from at Q1/15 reporting.SIEN has guided it would like to end 2015 with 47 sales reps on payroll.SIEN, thanks to its IPO funding, finished the year with $96.7 million in cash which should be enough to achieve any of its hiring and product development efforts.Also, SIEN guided on its Q4 CC that it should have an additional product debuting in "late 2015".I'm excited to hear additional updates on this as the quarter's roll of the books.Getting back to the sales team and the hiring efforts, longs and potential longs should take note that it generally takes a SIEN sales rep about 6 months to begin net contributing to the bottom line at SIEN.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This means that the full year 2014 sales growth seen should accelerate on a same sales person basis heading into roughly 2H/15 with newer sales team cohorts ramping up ~2 quarters from on-board date.</span>I expect the rate of sales growth to accelerate in 2015.This view is in direct conflict with management given guidance of full year sales growth of ~19%, which would be a downtick of 5% on the full year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe this to be management being conservative with guidance so as to price in any delays in sales hiring or any slower to development sales people.</span>While incremental, SIEN's Q4 did move the needle in showing fundamental progress at the company.I'm of the opinion that in the near-term SIEN can develop a reputation of being a "boutique" type product of higher quality and higher safety, to which it is, that with the right branding efforts should become the implant of choice in offices located in areas of higher income.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Regardless of it SIEN can execute on this specific branding effort I believe the company should continue to be able to move the bull case forward with each quarter and that SIEN is a safe place to park monies needing a medical device/healthcare allocation home.</span>Source: Sientra: Sales Team Expansion And Product Portfolio Additions Big News Into 2015 Disclosure: The author is long SIEN.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
