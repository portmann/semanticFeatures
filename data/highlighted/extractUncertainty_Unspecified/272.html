(NYSE:ZEN) | Seeking Alpha ZEN's two most recent PR's detailing a data center launch in Germany and an Asian HQ are meaningful.Don't overlook Zendesk, Inc.'s (NYSE: ZEN ) two most recent PRs detailing a ~Q2/15 data center launch in Germany and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Both of these have much larger long-term implications than may first meet the eye.</span>ZEN has been slowly growing into a highly diversified global powerhouse with ~45% of its Q4 revenues being comprised of international revenues.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As ZEN continues to slowly fragment its risk away from the US and continues to slowly build out its global infrastructure I believe this will serve to position ZEN as a much more viable option for a multi-national competitor to acquire.</span>I think that ZEN's ability to replicate data and provide disaster recovery to a greater degree with a German data center now running in conjunction with its 2013 Dublin Ireland opened center matters greatly and significantly moves ZEN's "outside looking in" value-prop forward.ZEN's platform has always been attractive to suitors, in my opinion, but now it's logistical and infrastructural additions are becoming a prize bargaining chip as well.ZEN has made Europe in particular a focus for 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Further, with its second operational location in Germany I feel it could rapidly expand its presence overall in the country and use this central hub as its European Headquarters in the near-term.</span>Previously, ZEN deployed capital in the country via a sales office and an expanded sales team to increase sales, both have been highly effective uses of capital.Notable German customers of Zendesk include Deutsche Post, eDarling and Rewe Online.In regards to using Germany as a Euro HQ it should be noted that ZEN's EMEA region is the largest of its sales regions.(ZEN now has European offices in Berlin,Dublin, London and Copenhagen) so the idea would make sense in execution as it does in theory.As for ZEN's Asian announcements, this to me is the beginning of a period of major investments into the Asian region in general.Now, with an official commercial HQ established look for ramped spending to the region and revenue weighting growth.ZEN's previous acquisition of Zopim was a convenient entry channel into the region and should serve to provide it instant credibility and access to the area.I would like to see ZEN ramp spending to this region as well as I feel in general Asia is in the early innings of a customer service revolution that ZEN should be able to lead with its platforms competitive advantages.Source: Zendesk Is Making International And Infrastructural Advances Disclosure: The author is long ZEN.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
