A Cheap Stock To Leverage The Indian Economic Resurgence - Tata Motors Limited (NYSE:TTM) | Seeking Alpha The company has lined up a strong pipeline of new vehicles to be launched in the near future.Its luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover has been doing well consistently and the domestic market is showing good growth.Tata Motors Limited (NYSE: TTM ) is a part of the Tata conglomerate and is one amongst the top 5 commercial vehicle manufacturers worldwide.The company earned revenues of $38.9 billion in 2013-14, with operations in India, UK, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.The company recently gave its Q3 FY15 results where it showed improved performance in its international segment, especially its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) subsidiary which was the star performer.The Indian automobile market has been going through a tough couple of years, as volumes have fallen due to a slowdown of the Indian economy.Tata Motors has been weak in the Indian automobile market, where companies such as Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki are much stronger.TTM is mostly strong in the commercial vehicle market."Nano" never really lived up to its promise and is not giving TTM the volumes it desired.However, TTM is making new launches in the entry sedan (Zest) and the hatchback segments.The company overall has done very well, thanks to the strength of its JLR subsidiary.This acquisition has proved to be a gold mine for the company, allowing it to post good growth in overall profits and volumes.The Indian market should start to see decent growth with the advent of its pro-business government.Given the company's brand value, its overall international presence, strong pipeline of new launches and Jaguar Land Rover's performance I would recommend a buy for this stock.1) Set to emerge as an automobile leader worldwide - Tata Motors has operations in the UK, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.It acquired various companies internationally in the past to emerge as a global competitor.Jaguar Land Rover was acquired in 2008 and South Korea's Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company was acquired in 2004.Tata Motors has joint ventures with automobile companies in Brazil, Thailand and Africa.The company has also gained traction for its commercial and passenger vehicles in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia, South Asia, South America, CIS and Russia.It also has joint ventures and franchisee arrangements for assembly operations in Bangladesh, Ukraine, and Senegal.2) Will benefit from the economic rebound in India - Presently the company has vehicles covering all types of transport like cars and utility vehicles, trucks, vans, buses and mini trucks.In 1986, it was the first company to launch an indigenously developed light commercial vehicle, and in 1998, it launched India's first fully indigenous passenger car -the Tata Indica.The Indian market has been seeing a tough time, as volumes have fallen for passenger vehicles.The anemic industrial environment has also seen its mainstay commercial vehicles segment underperform.However, the Indian economy is set to become the fastest growing major economy in the world.The automobile industry being highly leveraged to the business cycle should benefit more than other sectors.There is a stronger government in the centre now, which is more investment friendly.This will boost industrial activity, increase incomes and rekindle the consumption pattern in the country.Domestic sales grew by 8% in December .Zest and Nano were top selling cars in Q3.The commercial and passenger vehicle sales have already improved growing by 14% to 40,314 units in February 2015.Performance in the last couple of months have been quite good for the auto industry and this trend should persist for the next few years.3) Strong growth in the Chinese and Brazilian Markets - China and Europe have been the biggest markets for JLR.While European revenues registered 4% growth during the quarter, China has seen growth of 28%.Tata Motors is going to set up new production lines in China, which will launch two new products in the next one and a half years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It is expected that the Chinese market will generate sales of nearly 1.2 million units by 2020 .</span>The company has also invested $400 million in Brazil to set production facilities there.Setting up local production plants will help the automaker to be more competitive in the local market and reduce the company's cost of production.4) Strength of the new Product pipeline - TTM is aware of its weakness in the car segment and is putting more emphasis on launching stylish new cars like the Zest to take on the completion from Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Maruti Suzuki and others.Tata Motors has plans to launch 12 new models during the year.The company gave an outlook to achieve a sales target of over 500,000 during the year.Some new vehicles lined up are Jaguar XE, F-Pace, Discovery Sport etc.Tata Motors is known for making affordable cars, but it fails on the design front.If Tata Motors can get its design in order, then the company can become a major force in the domestic market.5) Good Stock Performance with cheap Valuation - The stock is currently trading at ~$47, which is very near to its 52-week high price.The market capitalisation is ~$24 billion, with a P/E of 9.7x , which is amongst the lowest when compared to most of its peers in the industry.The stock has returned close to 36.5% in the last one year, while the broader S&P market returned 11.4%.In the last five years, the company returned close to 157%, while returns by the S&P market were ~82%.China and Europe are the two largest markets for Tata vehicles internationally.However, both these countries are suffering from economic slowdowns.While Europe has been "muddling through" for the last few years, China has sharply cut down its GDP growth forecast for 2015 to just 7%.With "Grexit" being a constant threat, I don't think the European economy is going to see robust growth anytime soon.This will be affecting the spending power of the European consumers.Tata Motors has shown good results in the recent past, mainly due to the strength of its international sales.The headwinds in these markets will be a challenge for Tata Motors in the coming years.The demand for luxury cars is gradually gaining traction globally.Even in countries like India, where the growth in the automotive industry has been slow, growth in luxury cars has been stronger.JLR is a very strong brand in the luxury car market and JLR recently established a sales network in India.Tata Motors is expanding globally, setting up new production lines and launching new products.The company has already delivered good numbers in February 2015, where it recorded an 11% increase in total sales of its commercial and passenger vehicles (including exports).I would advise adding the stock to one's portfolio, given its strong brand (JLR) and strong potential for growth in emerging markets.Tata Motors also benefits from being part of the Tata Group, which is well known for its strong corporate governance practices.I would look to buy TTM stock on weakness.Source: Tata Motors -
