Instructions] Good afternoon.Thank you for joining us to discuss highlights of Ocera’s fourth quarter and 2014 full year financial results as well as our recent progress and outlook.With me today are Linda Grais, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rajiv Patni, our Chief Development Officer.Earlier today, we issued a press release and filed a form 8-K with the SEC announcing recent business highlights and detailing our fourth quarter and 2014 full year financial results.You can also find both of these documents on our website at ocerainc.com.Today, we’ll be making certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances including projections about our clinical development programs and cash usage for 2015 and beyond.These statements are based on current expectations.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as our subsequent filings with the SEC.</span>Ocera disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone.We appreciate the opportunity to review the tremendous progress Ocera made in 2014.We are also excited to update you on our expected milestones for 2015 and beyond.2014 was a transformational year for Ocera.From a corporate perspective, we completed our first full year as a public company, strengthened our management team and board and raised significant capital, providing a solid foundation for our clinical development of OCR-002, our patent protected ammonia lowering investigational drug.From a clinical perspective, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2b study, which we call STOP-HE to evaluate intravenously administered OCR-002 for use as a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy or HE in the acute care setting.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Including Europe, we now have approximately 94 sites activated worldwide.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the past year, we’ve also made significant progress in developing an oral formulation of OCR-002, which we believe will be an important therapeutic for managing chronic hepatic encephalopathy.</span>Thank you, Linda.Our STOP-HE is a Phase 2b trial that is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of OCR-002 in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis and an acute episode of hepatic encephalopathy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study.</span>Either OCR-002 or placebo is administered to patients intravenously for up to five days, along with standard of care.The OCR-002 arm is dosed with up to 20 grams over 24 hours.We enrolled the first patient in January of 2014 and we expect to enroll a total of 140 patients in the trial.As a reminder, the primary endpoint in the STOP-HE trial is timed to meaningful clinical improvement, meaning the number of hours from the beginning of the infusion until patients experience a reduction in their HE severity score.I am pleased to announce at the end of this month, we expect to receive a recommendation following a planned interim analysis from the study with independent Data Monitoring Committee or DMC.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The DMC will conduct a futility and a conditional powering analysis.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The conditional powering analysis will result in a recommendation from the DMC to either proceed with the current number of planned patients of 140 or to increase the sample size.</span>The DMC will be reviewing safety, PK and efficacy data, however, we as the sponsor will continue to be blinded to the data.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Assuming that DMC does not recommend a change to the study sample size, we believe that we are on track to complete enrollment by the end of 2015.</span>This expectation is based on a projection of enrollment in Europe that is comparable to what we had experienced in the U.S. to date.We look forward to sharing the DMC’s interim analysis recommendation and any resulting impact to our enrollment projections very soon.Turning now to our recent exciting developments without our oral dosage form of OCR-002.Over the last few quarters, we have evaluated several prototypes of a sustained release formulation of our drug candidate.We have tested these prototypes in vitro and more recently in vivo and are poised to initiate a Phase 1 human trial in the second half of 2015.Our strategy is to bring an oral formulation of OCR-002 to market to offer continuity of care for patients with HE, following an acute episode and as a maintenance therapeutic for HE remission in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.We are initiating chronic toxicology studies later this year to support a Phase 2 program with our oral formulation in 2016.Lastly, turning to our two investigator-sponsored studies.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In February, we reported the preliminary topline results from the Phase 2a investigator-sponsored study evaluating OCR-002 versus placebo in 38 patients, randomized one-to-one with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</span>This study was the second part of a two part study conducted at two sites in Spain and led initially by the acclaimed late hepatologist, Dr. Juan Córdoba.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The drug demonstrated a favorable safety profile was well-tolerated, and showed nearly a 20% reduction in plasma ammonia at 12 hours versus 3% in the placebo group.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Given the higher than expected variability in plasma ammonia levels, these results did not achieve statistical significance.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, there were statistically significant differences in urinary excretion of ammonia, as expressed by a key metabolite, phenylacetylglutamine or PAGN.</span>It's important to note that this study used a 10 gram dose of our drug, whereas we use up to a 20 gram dose in our STOP-HE study.Also noteworthy is that unlike most HE patients, those with upper gastrointestinal bleeding often had a constant rich source of ammonia, which is not depleted until the patient digest the blood that resides in the gut.Ultimately, we were very encouraged with these results from the study and look forward to further analyzing the data.The other external study is an NIH-sponsored study of OCR-002 in patients with acute liver failure or acute liver injury, due to acetaminophen or other acute toxicities.This is an open-label study with all patients receiving active drug and escalating doses up to 10 grams over 24 hours.The first cohort of patients with normal renal function has fully enrolled and the second cohort in patients with compromised renal function is currently enrolling.We expect that the study will be completed later this year.Let me now turn the call back over to Mike for a brief discussion of our recent financials, as well as our financial outlook.Thank you, Rajiv.The details of our financial results were reported earlier today.So let me just note the highlights for you.For the fourth quarter 2014, we reported a net loss of $5.5 million or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.3 million or $0.54 per share in the same period of 2013.For the full year 2014, we reported a net loss of $23.4 million or $1.34 per share, compared to a net loss of $17.5 million or $2.85 per share for 2013.Research and development expense was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $1.7 million in the same period of 2013.Research and development expense was $14.9 million for the full year 2014, compared to $3.5 million in the full year 2013.The increase in R&D for all periods was due primarily to costs associated with the clinical development of OCR-002, including the initiation of the STOP-HE study in late 2013.General and administrative expense was $2.1 million for the fourth quarter 2014, compared to $3.2 million in the same period of 2013.This decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees and personnel-related costs.General, administrative expense was $9.9 million for the full year 2014, compared to $8.5 million for the full year 2013.This year-over-year increase was due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense and professional fees.Turning to our cash position, which we bolstered in 2014 through a $25.2 million public offering, we ended 2014 with $51.2 million cash, cash equivalents and investments.Net use of cash in 2014 was $19.4 million, which was lower than our most recent guidance of $25 million.We came in lower than our last projection due to less than expected clinical development costs associated with lower than expected enrollment and site activations in Europe in our STOP-HE trial, as well as the timing of certain payments to our contract research organizations.As a reminder, net cash utilization excludes the net proceeds generated from our recent financing.Looking forward, we expect to use between $28 million and $32 million to fund our operations in 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Based on our current operating plan and cash position at the end of 2014, we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations into late 2016.</span>Thank you, Mike.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As I said earlier, 2014 was a transformational year for Ocera and we have set the foundations for what we believe will be an exciting 2015.</span>We remain steadfast in our mission to help people with acute and chronic orphan liver diseases, for whom, few treatment options exist.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe that OCR-002 has the potential to significantly improve upon the current standard of care for people with HE, with the potential to result in earlier hospital discharges and a better quality of life for these very sick patients.</span>Hi, guys.Thanks for taking the question.A quick one on the upcoming interim analysis, will the statistics be run around -- I’m sorry, this futility statistics be run around PK as well as efficacy?And will the board be looking at the relationship between the two measures?Thanks for the question.So yes, the data monitoring committee will be looking at pharmacokinetic as well as efficacy.And as per the DMC charter and our statistical analysis plan, we have defined the criteria for what would constitute futility.Okay.Is there any additional detail as to how the individual components are weighted, whether it’s more PK or more efficacy?So ultimately, the decision of the DMC will be a recommendation to us.But again, there are mandate as to look at all the data and make a recommendation on how we as Ocera should proceed with the study.Okay.Got it.Thanks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And second question, Linda, when do you think you might know at what clip your European sites are enrolling?</span>It sounds like you just got most of them up and going very, very recently, is that true?Yes.That is correct.We saw good uptake in February and we hope to continue to see that activity over the next month.It’s still a bit early to know if we have that sort of traction going forward but we are encouraged by what we've seen in the last month.So you have a better handle on European enrollment rates right about the same time that we know about the powering of STOP-HE in the interim?Yes.We’ll certainly have another month worth of activity.We expect to get the DMC recommendation at the end of March and we’ll at that time no more about enrollment in Europe as well.Yes.Hi, guys.Congrats on all the progress.A couple of questions, I guess, first starting with STOP-HE.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Could you maybe talk about the different drivers of HE?</span>It is a multi factorial disease and ammonia is one contributor.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So maybe just talk about what the drivers are?</span>What you’ve done to try and reduce the heterogeneity of the population you are studying?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And maybe just a bit on why you believe reducing ammonia will have a benefit in the trial?</span>And then I have a few others.Thank you for the question.So with respect to the drivers or precipitants to an acute hepatic encephalopathy episode, indeed they’re multi factorial.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The common drivers could be dehydration, infection, non adherence with a patient’s outpatient regimen.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe that ammonia is a critical mechanism behind the development of an episode of acute hepatic encephalopathy.</span>And this is well supported in the literature, as well as in the work of many, many experience of expert hepatologists.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And that’s why we remain very committed to the mechanism of action of OCR-002 as a differentiated ammonia scavenger for the treatment of acute HE and also for the prevention of recurrent HE episodes.</span>Thanks, Rajiv.And just on the second part of your question.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What we have done to try to control for those other factors in our study, we are very careful to rule out patients who might have some of the other precipitants or to wait to see if their HE resolves upon rehydration, upon lactulose administration, et cetera.</span>And we only enroll the patients who remain in encephalopathy despite those interventions.And then I just want to follow-up on the earlier question on futility analysis and powering around that futility analysis.I mean, ultimately if you are -- if one of the outcomes is to upsize the trial, I would think that’s driven by a very specific result as opposed to sort of global assessments or overall the STOP.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Could you talk about what would precipitate an upsizing of the trial?</span>Sure.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The trial was initially designed with certain assumptions about the rate of response and the time to response in both the placebo patients and in treated patients.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And at the time of initiation of the trials, those assumptions were based on the data that was available but there really is not a lot of data out there about those specific factors.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So the reason, we put in this interim analysis was to be able to take a look at those assumptions and test them to see if the powering is adequate based on those assumptions.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If we learn that those assumptions are not -- the DMC will take a look and see if those assumptions are not accurate, then we may need to resize the study in order to have adequate power for what we are seeing in terms of response rate and time to response.</span>So that’s really what would cause a change in the size of the study.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That’s the conditional power analysis that they do based on response rate and time to response that they see.</span>Great.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then -- so maybe just one other question and that is obviously, we are hopeful that the upside case will occur here and that the study will continue and be successful.</span>In the event that things didn't work out in STOP-HE, does that impact the chronic study with oral?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And I guess in asking that, is there a different hurdle in acute HE that might not inform whether you go forward with chronic HE, I just want to get a sense of what there might be to mitigate any downside risk?</span>Sure.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We don’t believe that a negative STOP-HE result, although we are not expecting negative results.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But if that were to occur, we do believe that there is still value in the oral program for the chronic patients that would be a different sort of trial as we’ve seen in some of the other studies in chronic HEs.</span>That is the prevention of a new onset.So it is patients who are stable as outpatients and they would not have the same sort of factors that we see in these acute very ill patients that we are currently testing in the hospitals.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So, we think it would be a somewhat different study design and we do believe that the oral has value independent of the IV.</span>But we still are optimistic about the IV.[Operator Instructions] I am showing no additional questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Linda Grais for closing remarks.Thank you, again for joining the call.We look forward to updating you on our progress, as we develop OCR-002 for the treatment of acute and chronic orphan liver diseases.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe we are on track to achieve several key clinical milestones in the next 12 or so months, including completing enrollment in our most advance study, STOP-HE.</span>Thank you again
