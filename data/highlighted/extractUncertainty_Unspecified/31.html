Seeking Alpha Mar. 10, 2015 12:20 PM ET �|� About: JSC MMC Norilsk Nickel ADR (NILSY) , Includes: AAUKY , BHP , RIO , VALE by: Alexander Valtsev Norilsk Nickel is a cost leader among global peers and its product mix consists of metals most likely to soar in 2015.Ruble devaluation drives margin expansions and reduces 90% of CAPEX.USD/RUB should stay in place at least for the next three years.Management plans to return earnings and proceeds from asset sales to shareholders in dividends.Equity participation in future projects is limited - little to no reinvestment of earnings."I built this town in frost and blazing sun.To make it higher than the mounts, I made my soul a stone.And paved it into the roads."<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Lev Gumilev, a Russian anthropologist, who spent almost 20 years of his life in Soviet labor camps, wrote these lines about his experience in Norilsk, a town built by political detainees like himself in 1930s.</span>Norilsk is the most northernmost city in the world.Located inside the Arctic Circle with an average annual temperature of -9.7 degrees Celsius, it is home to 170,000 people and the world's biggest producer of nickel and palladium, Open Joint Stock Company "Mining and Metallurgical Company Norilsk Nickel" ( OTCPK:NILSY ).(Source: Google Images.Compiled by author) Norilsk Nickel, together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in prospecting, exploration, extraction, refining and metallurgical processing of minerals, and production, marketing, and sale of base and precious metals.It is the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium with strong positions in copper, platinum, cobalt and rhodium, as well as in various by-products, such as cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, iridium, ruthenium, selenium, tellurium and sulfur (Source: Capital IQ).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It has operations in the Russian Federation, Finland, Australia, Botswana and South Africa (continually reduces exposure to this geographic area).</span>The company's sales offices are located in the US, Europe, China, and Russia.(Source: Norilsk Nickel presentation at UBS GEM Conference in New York, December 2014) The company was incorporated in 1997 and is based in Moscow, the Russian Federation.Its origins date back to 1935 when the NKVD (better known as KGB) took control of "Norilsk Combine," built by the Soviet government.In the present time, Norilsk Nickel is an international company with assets across the globe and its trading business serving clients through the world's major ports.Note: Gray bars show companies I covered in my previous articles.The company with a market capitalization in excess of $28B caught my attention immediately after I analyzed its financials and product mix.I have decided to give it a thorough analysis, after which I concluded that the stock is a strong buy.I will attempt to prove the case for Norilsk Nickel.Metals market overview pertaining to the company's product mix Valuation: Comparable companies and DCF analyses ( excerpts from my model ) Metals and mining stocks have long been underperforming the broad market indexes.The decline started in 2012 when metal prices reached a peak and started falling.Many companies of this sector are now trading near the 2008-2009 levels.This situation offers many risk-tolerant investors unprecedented long-term buying opportunities.Norilsk Nickel's share price peaked earlier in mid-2011 in tandem with nickel prices.Since then, the stock traded 25%-35% below its post-crisis maximums in a sideways trend.In mid-2014, the shares tested a two-year maximum only to drop to 2010 price levels within 4-5 months.The sharpest fall took place in December 2014 when a massive Ruble devaluation took place amid record capital flights.However, compared to the world's biggest metals and mining companies, Norilsk Nickel has been a top producer of investment returns in its sector.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The stock currently has a beta of 1.08 and a cost of equity of circa 17% (country risk accounted for).</span>Most importantly, Norilsk Nickel is not on the sanctions list and has access to international capital markets.Cheap debt plays an important role in the company's capital structure: Net Debt (~$3.4B) brings the weighted-average cost of capital down to 12%, which makes the company's projects economically viable.With the exception of palladium, whose prices have been growing since the crisis of 2008-2009 without major shocks, all other metals, which comprise more than three quarters of Norilsk Nickel's product portfolio, have been in decline over the last three years: World Bank forecast for basic metals is grim: Their real prices are expected to continue declining, with the exception of iron ore, which is expected to grow 2%-3% annually in real terms over the next three years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Norilsk Nickel's price expectations are different: Backed by Citi Research, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg and Macquarie Research as of Q4 2014, the management's forecast is as follows: (Source: Norilsk Nickel presentation at UBS GEM Conference in New York, December 2014) Note: In the DCF model, I used both forecasts.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>World Bank's forecast serves as the foundation for the conservative scenario while the management's forecast drives the optimistic scenario (you may switch to either of them in the valuation tab in order to see the impact on the stock's fair value).</span>Nickel ore ban in Indonesia, underinvestment in nickel mines in China in 2012-2013, Chinese stainless steel capacity expansion, which expects to grow 6% CAGR in 2015-2017, and gradual depletion of nickel ore grade.Palladium demand steadily growing in the automotive industry (expected 1.5% CAGR in 2015-2017), growing deficit in palladium stocks in 2012-2014 is expected to continue through 2016, and supply side issues in Africa (accounts for 80% of world's output) associated with growing operating costs, strikes, and mine closures.Platinum demand on the rise in South Korea, US, EU, Mexico, Japan, and China, driven primarily by increasing car production, only a third of platinum stock is available for immediate consumption, and the market overestimates the size of available platinum stock, which currently sits at 6 months of consumption, according to Norilsk Nickel estimates (versus Standard Bank's data).Copper's global supply and demand are balanced, but its consumption is recovering in the US and EU, although this slow-paced recovery will not drive copper prices significantly.However, this should gradually stop the 3-year-plus slide in price.To compare, Anglo American's ( OTCPK:AAUKY ) gross profit margin is at 17%, Rio Tinto's (NYSE: RIO ) is at 29%, Vale's (NYSE: VALE ) is at 33%, and BHP Billiton's (NYSE: BHP ) is at 80%.None of them, except BHP Billiton, can compare to Norilsk Nickel in net income margins (14.5% vs. 20%, respectively).(Source: Capital IQ .All infographics by author) Over the past year, Norilsk Nickel managed to restart growing revenues after three years of declines.Margins have stabilized and net income is expected to be near $2B for FY 2014 (LTM data shows $1.7B as of June 30, 2014).These events have improved return-on-asset, return-on-capital and return-on-equity ratios.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The differences among them are minimal, which can be explained by high-equity concentration in the capital structure and low operating leverage due to high margins.</span>Further reductions in net debt caused debt ratios to continue falling.(Source: Capital IQ.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All infographics by author) (Source: Norilsk Nickel presentation at UBS GEM Conference in New York, December 2014) Revenues from sales of nickel comprise over 40% of revenue mix while copper and palladium make up approximately a quarter each, and platinum contributes 9% to the corporate coffers.</span>Other metals, many of which are precious, play an insignificant role in revenue generation.Geographically, Europe contributes to over 50% of Norilsk Nickel's revenues.Asian clients contribute 30% of total sales while North America and Russia equally share 9% in the revenue mix.Overall, sales are USD denominated while costs are primarily paid for in Rubles.CAPEX is 90% RUB denominated.In terms of credit management, Norilsk Nickel demonstrates caution: With 38% of assets financed by debt and even a lower ratio of net debt-to-enterprise value, the company is actually underleveraged compared to peers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Among competitors, Norilsk Nickel holds second place in credit scores: On the other hand, amid current uncertainties on the commodities market, it may be prudent to have a larger cash cushion and extra debt capacity.</span>Norilsk Nickel has both.Dividends Overview and Historical Return Analysis At current prices floating around $18 per ADR, Norilsk Nickel offers a 7.7% dividend yield (interim dividend included only).The company has a long history of dividend payments to its shareholders.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In late 2014, the company's management has approved the following shareholder-focused dividend plan: (Source: Norilsk Nickel presentation at UBS GEM Conference in New York, December 2014) Dividend payments at 50% of EBITDA roughly translate into a ~100% payout ratio.</span>This is in line with management's plans to exclude equity participation in future projects.In other words, Norilsk Nickel will likely start to increase debt levels in order to capitalize on metals prices' expected reversal.As Norilsk Nickel's shares have been trading sideways in the last three years, dividends have been the primary driver of returns for shareholders.As for capital appreciation solely, Norilsk Nickel has demonstrated a 31% annual IRR over the last 15 years with a 7x multiple on invested money.(Source: Corporate website .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some infographics by author) To compare, private equity funds have returned circa 20%-plus annually in the same time period albeit at a lower perceived risk.</span>Of course, past returns are not indicators of future gains, especially as Norilsk Nickel has entered maturity stage.However, the company is now primarily focused on developing high NPV projects and continues to divest its non-core assets and some African holdings.To value Norilsk Nickel, I have employed two methods: comparable multiples and discounted cash flow (DCF model).Dividend yield analysis has already demonstrated that the company is undervalued compared to its global peers.Now it is time to dig further to see if other factors confirm that.Note: The list excludes the Big 4 M&M players (BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, and Vale).A few companies on the list are also Russian.Biggest on the list, Norilsk Nickel enjoys the highest revenue multiple.It is 4th on the list in EV/EBITDA multiple, which has ranged between 6.0x and 8.5x over the past two years.(Source: Capital IQ.All infographics by author) The EBITDA multiple has been recovering in Q1 2015, but has yet to reach mid-2014 levels.Increasing free cash flow figures should strengthen the trend.(Source: Author's own work.Data from Capital IQ and Corporate Data Book ) To sum up, data show that there's a substantial upside potential for Norilsk Nickel shares (15% to 40% in conservative and optimistic scenarios, respectively).These expected returns are in excess of normal returns indicated by the cost of capital (CAPM, WACC).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Investing in Russian stocks, especially in Russian metals and mining stocks, involves many risks.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The following are, but not limited to, the main risks faced by Norilsk Nickel: Proposed strategic initiatives are aimed at enhancing shareholder value by expanding NPVs of existing core assets and increasing dividend payments.</span>Market overreaction toward Russian stocks made the company's shares plummet in late 2014.On the other hand, a strong FX rate is a major tailwind for Norilsk Nickel, which incurs revenues in USD and costs (including capital expenditures) in RUB.The company is best positioned among peers and has been delivering better results than its competitors ( Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton, Anglo American , Vale and even Glencore ( OTCPK:GLNCY )).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For the above reasons, I give Norilsk Nickel a Strong BUY recommendation in spite of current commodity outlook, market, country, geopolitical, and other risks.</span>Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Please be aware of the risks associated
