boosted Japanese stocks due primarily to massive government stimulus.While some parts of the economy have improved, others have not, resulting in a status quo.The Japanese stock market has done well in recent years.Ever since the Abe government took office in late 2012 and implemented its economic policy of Abenomics, the Japanese stock market has more than doubled.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>An ETF for Japan such as EWJ (NYSEARCA: EWJ ) is up by almost 45 percent.</span>It's therefore fair to say that Abenomics has had a big impact on Japan.At the same time, it's not all that clear that Japan is better off with Abenomics.Since Abenomics has had such a big role in the market rally in Japan, it's important to take a closer look at Abenomics to determine how likely it is that the rally will last.What Abenomics was supposed to do and has managed to accomplish The main goal of Abenomics is to basically revive the Japanese economy, which has been stagnant for quite some time.In contrast to what previous administrations have done, Japan would accomplish this through a combination of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms.This includes Japan's own version of Quantitative Easing.The greatest impact of Abenomics can be found in the exchange rate of Japan's currency, the yen.Abenomics has managed to accomplish its goal of weakening the yen.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The yen has gone from around 80 to almost 120 against the dollar.</span>In theory, a weaker yen should help boost exports which in the past has been a big driver of Japan's economy.Abenomics has managed to solve Japan's problem with inflation, which for a long time has been below target or even in deflationary territory.Insufficient inflation and long periods of deflation has in turn led to many other problems in Japan.Abenomics has, at least temporarily, put an end to low inflation and deflation.Unlike many other developed countries, Japan does not have a significant problem with unemployment.Since the introduction of Abenomics, the unemployment rate has actually fallen even more from an already low level of about 4.3 percent to slightly above 3.5 percent.Despite the massive depreciation of the yen, Japan's balance of trade has not improved and the trade deficit remains.Japan used to be known for its huge trade surpluses which in turn helped boost the economy, but those days are long gone.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Abenomics has not made a difference here.</span>Japan even saw a record trade deficit in 2014.More importantly, Japan has not improved the general decline of many Japanese companies on the world stage.For instance, Japan, especially in its heyday during the eighties, used to be known as the standard that everyone else would follow in consumer electronics.Nowadays, top brands such as Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and so on just don't carry the same weight any more.They've been mostly surpassed by other brands and companies, although Japan has still managed to hold on in certain areas.For example, the smartphone industry is one which has seen tremendous growth in recent years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's probably the one device that people need to have and can't do without.</span>Yet, Japan has very little to say when it comes to smartphones.This would have been unthinkable in the past.Abenomics hasn't changed that.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If this had been the eighties, a revolutionary mobile device like the iPhone would have probably come out of Japan.</span>It's after all the country that invented the Walkman/Discman, yet Japan did not come up with the iPod, which replaced the Walkman/Discman.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Japan seems to have been left behind by the Internet revolution and the Digital revolution as a whole.</span>Part of the reason is that Japan has not paid as much attention to structural reforms, even though that was supposed to be one of the pillars of Abenomics.Instead, most of the focus has been on monetary policy by the central bank and fiscal spending to a lesser extent.Abenomics has also not helped with retail sales.The tax increases have effectively reduced the purchasing power of the Japanese consumer and made them poorer in real terms.Wages have not risen enough to compensate for lost purchasing power.The fact that the yen doesn't buy as much as it used to due to depreciation hasn't helped either.Is Abenomics a success or a failure?The government policy of Abenomics has yet to conclude and therefore remains a work in progress.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, while it may be premature to make a verdict, Abenomics is looking increasingly more like a failure than a success at this point in time.</span>While progress has been made in some areas such as inflation, they are all a means to an end and not an end in itself.Deflation is usually considered a bad thing because it often indicates a lack of demand and consumption in particular.While inflation has gone up in Japan, it's not clear if consumption has gone up along with it as indicated by retail sales.If inflation just goes up and nothing else happens, then there is no real improvement.Similarly, the depreciation of the yen is a mean to an end.It's supposed to discourage imports and encourage exports, which should improve the balance of trade.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So far, that is not what is happening as the trade imbalance remains, even though exports have increased somewhat.</span>If neither exports nor consumer spending is going to drive growth in the economy as they have done in the past, then it's not clear what will take their place in a manner that is sustainable.Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") has essentially gone nowhere and has remained the same for the last two decades.Some parts of the economy are better off, but other parts are in worse shape resulting in them canceling each other out.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Stock prices may have risen strongly in Japan, but the average Japanese person seems to be worse off.</span>All in all, the status quo remains with the economy being stagnant.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>One could argue that Abenomics has been more like a rearranging of the chairs.</span>While there has definitely been a change, there has been no real improvement in Japan's economy.Making the country as a whole better is after all the ultimate goal of any government.Not achieving that means that the government has failed.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The perceived lack of progress due to Abenomics raises doubts as to how sustainable the stock market rally is in the long term.</span>While Japan is not cheap, it's not expensive either.For instance, the MSCI Japan Index trades at about 15 times earnings.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The stock market may continue to remain strong in the near future due to the impact of Quantitative Easing.</span>In fact, Japan has already increased the amount of Quantitative Easing late last year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The government could very well continue to stimulate in the hope that real progress may yet come to Japan.</span>However, stimulus cannot last forever and the economy will have to stand on its own at some point.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If stimulus is removed with no real progress made in the underlying economy after the inevitable end of Abenomics, Japanese stocks could quite possibly fall back to levels seen before Abenomics.</span>That's a big problem in the case of Japan.Source: Has Abenomics Been Good Or Bad For The Japanese
