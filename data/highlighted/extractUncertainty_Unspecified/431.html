outstanding performance award winners touch upon a similar theme - temporary Indian macro weakness - as a way to zig when the market zagged.Sneha Shah showed how ICICI Bank's strong assets and growth meant it would outperform as India returned to normalcy, leading to a double for investors.Street Smart Investor made a similar case for HDFC Bank to maintain its high multiple after a temporary speed bump, a call whose return also peaked in the triple digits.This week's Outstanding Performance Award winners share a lot of features.They both cover large-cap foreign bank in the summer of 2013, after country-level macroeconomic trends had led to ~30% sell-offs in the banks' respective stocks.Both went beyond making a mere contrarian bet, explaining in detail why the macroeconomic struggles would not last and why each bank should be valued higher in the long run.Both, of course, played out fantastically, but comments at the time show how this wasn't a no-brainer call.Both articles are great picks and great examples of the Seeking Alpha contributor community's long reach.We're excited to tab them this week for our awards.Sneha Shah for her long idea on ICICI Bank (NYSE: IBN ) published in September 2013.Return to date: +115% Street Smart Investor for her Top long idea on HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB ) published in August 2013.Return to date: +96% Both authors have updated their thesis on the original article.The HDFC article is part of the SA PRO equity research archive , available exclusively to SA PRO subscribers, but will be made available to all readers for 48 hours in honor of its winning the award.The ICICI Bank article will be added to the archive after 48 hours.Sneha Shah is the Editor-in-chief of Greenworldinvestor, and a Chartered Accountant by profession.She's been a contributor on Seeking Alpha for over two years, with a focus on the solar and tech spaces.She's had several winners on the site, including one of her first articles, a well-timed bullish call on Corning.Other winners include picking Triquint and RF Micro Devices over a few weeks in August, long before those two companies merged; correctly calling a triple for Jinko Solar; and consistently successful bullish coverage on Nokia.Shah's article on ICICI Bank ventured away from the tech and solar space, but into another area of expertise, India.Macro concerns had driven IBN down ~40%, leaving it trading at single digits P/E despite a long growth track record, good governance, and strong assets.Arguing that the rupee had bottomed out at 68RS to the USD, she said IBN was a great buy for when India's economy normalized.The rupee corrected quickly after the article, and has not returned to such lows even amidst the dollar's recent global rise.The company has continued to grow profit and has seen its multiple restored to typical levels, leading to an over 100% gain.Not a shabby return for what was a $15B company.(Note: IBN did a 5-for-1 split, so stock prices in the original article reflect pre-split levels).Street Smart Investor is a quantitative analyst with over 5 years of experience in the investment industry.A long-term, value-oriented analyst, she has also focused on the energy sector for much of her ~18 months on Seeking Alpha, especially on foreign-domiciled stocks.Many of those calls are struggling given the sector sell-off, but the way calls like Golden Ocean and DNO International have gone offers confirmation of the quality of her work.One of her most recent successes involved straying from the energy space to write up CDK Global, a spin-off that has returned big numbers over the past few months.Street Smart Investor's article on HDFC Bank was another example of success outside the energy field for the author.Touching on many of the same themes as Shah's article a few days later, Street Smart Investor went in depth on the quality of HDFC Bank's business, explaining why the bank deserved a premium to its main peer, ICICI Bank.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>She also went into detail on why India's macro environment was likely to improve, including touching on the possibility that BJP would win the election in 2014.</span>The stock moved up in more or less a straight line ever since, as BJP did win the election, HDB maintained its premium multiple, and has likewise grown its profit and net interest income .This provided another double for readers, with another strong call.Congratulations to this week's winners!Look out for a new pair of Outstanding Performance award winners next Monday and each Monday
