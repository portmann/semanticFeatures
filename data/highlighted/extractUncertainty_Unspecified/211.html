2/13, NTDOY's New 3DS sold out in the US in just days.Wii U sales woes have left NTDOY increasingly reliant on handheld sales for its profits.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>New 3DS's success could give NTDOY an even longer life for its current handheld generation.</span>For video game hardware makers, the release of a new system is usually an event of huge import, with financial ramifications that will span several years.It is hard to imagine, then, that Nintendo (OTCPK: NTDOY ) has managed to launch its de facto successor to the wildly successful 3DS handheld system, which they are uncreatively calling New 3DS, over the past week with virtually no attention at all.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With Nintendo's Wii U trailing its competitors in the home console market, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Xbox One and Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation 4, both by a wide margin, the company is heavily dependent on its handheld game sales for profitability.</span>Luckily for them, the future of their handheld market is bright indeed.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Nintendo has sold over 50 million 3DS systems worldwide so far, a strong successor to the DS system, which itself sold in excess of 150 million units and almost a billion games.</span>Nintendo's handheld strategy has long been to sell successor systems as a sidegrade, rather than an outright upgrade.The 3DS supported DS games, and the DS supported Game Boy Advance titles.Instead of relying on a totally new software library for a totally new hardware system, they've maintained their lead by convincing people to buy new, improved hardware, initially for their existing software libraries, and then for exclusive content as it comes out.New 3DS takes this strategy to an absurd length, with new hardware that includes significant upgrades being sold entirely as a new, high-end version of the existing 3DS, and no exclusive new software content expected for months.In one way, it's a console launched with no games, but the improvements it offers to existing 3DS titles means it is launched with a huge library of proven, successful games.It's a gamble, but the indications are it is working, with New 3DS selling over 300,000 units in the US and Europe alone in its first week of availability.Even better, the New 3DS has sold out pretty much nationwide in the US, and is all but impossible to find.Even in the notoriously slow first quarter, the New 3DS is a hot product, and Nintendo's limited edition Legend of Zelda version of the New 3DS was so highly sought it sold out within a half hour of being available for pre-order.In addition to opening up the market for exclusive New 3DS software, which will further drive hardware sales, the release of highly improved hardware for the existing library should extend the life of the 3DS as a platform in the coming years.Nintendo is also looking to expand into the increasingly popular interactive toy market with its Amiibo figures.The figures were initially targeted at the Wii U hardware, but will also support the New 3DS.The Amiibo plastic figurines are already selling by the millions with their Wii U hardware support, and are becoming a nice new niche product to further monetize their huge library of popular characters.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Given how much broader Nintendo's handheld installed base is than their Wii U base, linking the Amiibo sales to the New 3DS is a no-brainer, and in the months to come could quickly turn sales in the millions into sales in the tens of millions.</span>The early success of the Wii hardware and the relative failure of the Wii U, its successor, has put a lot of pressure on Nintendo's stock price, and driven it far below its previous levels.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While the Wii U's struggles mean that a return to the $40 range is probably unrealistic in the near term, the combination of strong handheld sales and the Amiibo mean that the stock is entering dramatically undersold territory.</span>Nintendo's strong recent profitability is making its current price, not far above multi-year lows, hard to justify.This is a company, after all, with an extremely strong balance sheet, a library of beloved characters, and virtually no competition in the handheld market.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Combine that with the company openly projecting a 20% dividend increase at the end of this year, and it seems like a classic target for contrarians awaiting a turnaround in market sentiment.</span>Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Please be aware of the risks associated
