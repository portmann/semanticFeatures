(NYSE:EGY) | Seeking Alpha Lower oil drilling fees will allow VAALCO to keep its margins intact in a weak crude oil price scenario.VAALCO has a positive net cash position, which means that the company doesn't have to bear the burden of interest expenses.The EIA projects that oil prices will start picking up going forward, and this will complement an expected decline in VAALCO's costs.After losing 35% of its market capitalization in 2014, VAALCO Energy (NYSE: EGY ) has managed to start 2015 on a positive footing.The stock has gained slightly over 2.6% in 2015, bettering the S&P 500's negative performance.Looking ahead, since crude oil prices are expected to improve as the year progresses, VAALCO should get better.Additionally, VAALCO is executing some key projects in Africa that will bolster its cost profile.In this article, we will see why VAALCO is positioned for better times ahead.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The federal Energy Information Administration (NYSEMKT: EIA ) suggests that oil prices will make a comeback during the latter half of the year.</span>The EIA, in its short-term energy outlook, points out : "The forecast Brent crude oil price averages $58/bbl in 2015, unchanged from last month's STEO.Based on current market balances, EIA expects prices to be relatively flat in the first half of 2015, when global inventory builds are projected to be significant.EIA projects that Brent prices will average $67/bbl during the fourth quarter.The monthly average WTI crude oil spot price fell from an average of $59/bbl in December to $47/bbl in January, its lowest level since February 2009.EIA expects the WTI crude oil price to average $55/bbl in 2015 and $71/bbl in 2016."Such a forecast will come as a relief for VAALCO investors, after the company reported a massive decline of 35% in its revenue in the third quarter.However, VAALCO has been able to maintain healthy margins despite a huge drop in crude oil prices so far.The company has an operating margin of 46.5% and a profit margin of 28.95%.As crude oil prices start inching up, VAALCO should be able to arrest the slide in its revenue and bolster its margins further.Moreover, VAALCO will also benefit from a few external factors that will lead to lower costs.For example, the company will have to pay lower oil drilling fees as rig contractors will need to lower prices in order to compete in the current pricing environment.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This will give rise to stiff competition among drillers and might even result in a price war.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As Bloomberg points out : "Oil production margins won't be as severely squeezed as some observers are predicting because the drilling companies will have to cut fees to retain customers, Chazen said during the call.</span>"We expect, since the service competitors were happy to raise prices when oil was going up, that they will be just as happy to have their prices lower in the future."Now, another reason why VAALCO should continue getting better is because of its strong asset profile.Most of the company's assets are in Africa, with VAALCO executing some major growth opportunities in Angola and Equatorial Guinea.For instance, in Equatorial Guinea, it has a 31% interest in the Block P offshore area.It is now closely working with GEPetrol and the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea for shifting the growth of the discovered resource at the Venus Field, much before the start of any investigative drilling on the block.The oil and gas drilling major is estimating total production in the gross range of 10,000 barrels to 12,000 barrels per day from the field at Equatorial Guinea, forecasted to start production in 2017.VAALCO has also started drilling the Etame 8-H well as per schedule by leveraging the Transocean Constellation II jack-up rig.This is expected to be the first of at least six new growth wells that VAALCO plans to drill on the Etame Marin block.VAALCO is targeting on drilling three wells at Etame, coupled with three wells at SEENT in the first campaign on these platforms.Going forward, VAALCO expects to develop its first Block 5 investigation well.The company has also entered into a successive exploration phase on Block 5 offshore Angola, with drilling of the first well already underway.The consequent investigation period on Block 5 will enable the contractor to independently widen the Block by three years, and allow VAALCO to increase production as a result.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Thus, VAALCO seems well-positioned to improve from a number of angles.</span>An increase in oil pricing and lower costs will allow the company to strengthen its financial performance, while its exploration moves in Africa will enrich its production and allow it to meet an expected increase in demand for crude oil.Moreover, even if crude oil prices decline, VAALCO should be able to sustain its profitability since it already has strong margins.Finally, the company has a net cash position of $118 million.This means that it doesn't have any debt, and so, it doesn't have to pay interest expenses that would hurt its margins.So, VAALCO looks like a good investment due to a number of reasons and should be able to get better in the long run.Source: VAALCO Energy: Lower Drilling Fees And A Recovery In Oil Pricing
