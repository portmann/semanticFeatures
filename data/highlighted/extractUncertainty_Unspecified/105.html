the Japanese have experienced two lost decades - and it has learned.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Deflationary price-wage spirals are so toxic that extraordinary measures are always justified whenever a state at the zero lower bound perceives a risk of one.</span>This is what is going on in Europe and Asia at the moment.Legitimate concern about potentially catastrophic, endogenous threats to growth prospects in both the short and long terms, like deflationary pressures and the need to maintain central bank credibility, have led central banks to do exactly what they are supposed to do - stabilize their at-risk economies.Currency wars are born out of a prisoner's dilemma effect in the push to boost exports.They involve states deliberately depreciating their currencies through expansionary policy as fast as they can in an attempt to lose the most relative value and thereby see the greatest gain in exports.But the primary goal here has not been to boost exports as a means of gaining a relative economic advantage in the zero-sum game of export math.As long as domestic impacts reign supreme and international strategic impacts are ignored in monetary policy formulation, the simple fact that the consequences of monetary policy decisions are reminiscent of a currency war does not mean that there is one going on.Sweden exemplifies this distinction.Growth in Sweden is actually fairly healthy, and employment is rising along with it, but looming deflation poses a disconcerting threat.Because of this, the Swedish central bank recently cut interest rates below zero in an act of dramatic monetary expansion to head off these deflationary pressures.The thing is, Sweden doesn't have any particular reason to be concerned about its net exports - its growth rate isn't an issue.Domestic deflation, on the other hand, needs to be addressed.Even if this were a currency war, however, there is a legitimate question to be asked about whether the negative impacts of a global currency war are actually substantively worse than the negative impacts of monetary restraint at a time like this.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's true that currency wars breed long-term instability and structural inefficiencies, and they do make it harder to do business, but these effects are near meaningless when placed next to the potential for falling prices all over the globe, large-scale, rising unemployment, and an indefinite lack of substantive growth across the continents.</span>The impact on markets through changed expectations alone would be enough to push the world back into another recession, not to mention the material effects of such a policy regime.The central banks in these economies have no choice; currency war or not, they have to continue expansionary policy.They have to demonstrate a commitment to doing something.That's just part of how our modern economic world works.The example of Denmark clarifies this point.As mentioned, its recent expansionary policy has been primarily responsive to the easing of the European Central Bank (ECB), characteristic of a currency war.The reason it has taken these steps, though, has nothing to do with competitively boosting exports, it has to with the fear of becoming Switzerland.In January, the Swiss central bank, recognizing the profound up-bidding of its currency, decided that holding its peg to the euro would be too difficult, and it abandoned the peg in a move that shocked markets.The tremendous appreciation of the Swiss franc over the days that followed has destabilized the Swiss economy and created concerns about its central bank's credibility moving into the future.Denmark cannot afford to let this happen.It must maintain its peg at all costs.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The resulting easing may look like a response to the ECB, but really, it's an unavoidable defense of domestic economic stability and future growth prospects, nothing more.</span>Currency war alarmists often point to the long-term consequences of currency wars as being reason to fear them, even if they don't look that bad in the short term.They forget, however, that the economy needs to survive the short term in order for the long term to be accessible at all.This does point to an interesting issue in the currency war discussion, however - the meaning of the phrase.When wrongful currency manipulation was first defined by Cold War-era international financial treaties, no state had ever encountered the zero lower bound, and the entire category of extraordinary measures that form the great body of modern monetary policy had yet to enter the economic imagination.Today, recessions that push central banks to the zero lower bound, like the one that plagued Japan in the 1990s and the one that ravaged the U.S. and then the world following the financial crisis of 2008, have necessitated a new brand of aggressive expansionary policy that carries with it a significant depreciative effect.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While this brand of policy might fit the original definition of a currency war, it has become an established norm.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is why there is more confusion than consensus as to what ought to constitute a currency war.</span>Given the importance of these steps to restoring global growth, it would seem, at the very least, useful to exclude these measures from any standardized definition of the term.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That said, insofar as this is probably the closest that our modern global economy will ever get to a true currency war, if we believe the phrase can describe something real, this would seem to be an appropriate time to use it.</span>And it's true that this likely is the closest we're ever going to get to a global currency war.The reason why has to do with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and structural power dynamics of geopolitics today.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The WTO is the arbitration and enforcement mechanism through which states may file complaints against other states they believe are engaging in abusive currency manipulation.</span>Like most international institutions, however, the WTO was founded by developed states to support and perpetuate their interests.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This being the case, in an environment where most or all of the world's economic superpowers have recently engaged in policies that resemble competitive devaluation, it's simply unrealistic to believe that any of them would pursue the issue at the WTO.</span>If one such state did, other states certainly wouldn't look fondly on it.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The complainant would be seen as a hypocrite, and it could prompt a wave of subsequent accusations of which it could be a target.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even if the U.S., which has recently been tightening its monetary policy, in contrast to the rest of the world, leading to the appreciation of the dollar, were to try to accuse another state of competitive devaluation, that state could come back at America by citing the Federal Reserve's recent, six-year regime of quantitative easing, arguing that it not only also constituted competitive devaluation, but that it set a precedent and even created a necessity for that state to engage in its own depreciative measures.</span>In effect, the WTO of today is impotent by the mutual agreement of its members, but it's hard to tell whether this is more or less bad than the alternative.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Right now, we are seeing the first test of a new unspoken norm of looking toward currency-devaluing monetary policy with the greatest possible degree of leniency.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This suggests that, descriptively speaking, the term currency war is effectively meaningless when applied to our current situation.</span>But even if it weren't, that wouldn't be grounds for alarmism.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
