a move that could be very lucrative for the company and its investors long-term.</span>VoLTE is just now starting to gain traction here in the U.S., but the concept has been building for much of the last three years.Last year, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) became the first wireless service providers to offer voice services over an LTE network.AT&T (NYSE: T ) is expected to follow this year.This move paves the way for older legacy GSM and CDMA voice networks to be retired and for customers to gain the advantages that come with voice services over a far superior network.Verizon's 4G network is advertised to be 10x faster than 3G networks, and 3G networks are known as being far more powerful than CDMA networks.With this increase in power, VoLTE allows for fewer dropped calls, better call quality, faster connectivity, and HD video chatting among other services.It also allows wireless service providers to bill voice as data, thereby increasing data consumption long-term.Therefore, VoLTE is obviously an important market; the future of voice calling.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Back in 2013, Infonetics predicted that VoLTE would grow at a 145% compound annual rate from 2012 through 2017 until becoming a $16 billion market.</span>Clearly, wireless service companies will take a large chunk of this market due to the increase in data consumption, but equipment vendors will also gain due to higher CAPEX in this arena, along with the licensing fees that wireless companies pay to use VoLTE equipment like servers, APIs, etc.According to the Global Mobile Awards Ceremony, Alcatel-Lucent is leading the way with technology for VoLTE.The company's virtualized VoLTE platform has allowed for services like high definition voice and video, IP messaging, and content sharing that opens new windows of opportunity for both wireless service providers and consumers.Furthermore, at Mobile World Conference 2015, Alcatel-Lucent became the first company to unveil a single network that uses both WiFi and cellular networks as one.Notably, Alcatel-Lucent stated that its VoLTE technology allows for convergence across fixed, cellular, and WiFi networks.This means that Alcatel-Lucent is ready to provide VoLTE services to wireless service providers that don't have the best of 4G networks (ie Sprint, China Unicom, etc.) by combining WiFi and 4G into one network.In my opinion, this innovation puts Alcatel-Lucent into a world of its own in the fast-growing VoLTE market, and further strengthens its already valuable IP business.In other words, it's a great time to be an Alcatel-Lucent long.Source: Alcatel-Lucent Looks To Dominate This $16 Billion Market Disclosure: The author is long ALU.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
