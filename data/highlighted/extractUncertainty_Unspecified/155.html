is the fastest tech company to reach $5 billion sales.Steel business is not as good as iron and copper.Cramer started the show by talking about the basic principle of stock rotation and its impact on investors' portfolios.Once a chunk of money is allocated to a specific sector, the money has to stay in the sector no matter what, in order to achieve a diversified portfolio.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The cash just keeps shifting to different stocks.</span>Currently the stock rotation is taking place in Tech.Based on Wednesday's trading, Cramer found out that money is being rotated out of plain vanilla value tech stocks, into high growth tech stocks.As high value vanilla tech companies like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) failed to deliver any upside surprise in their earnings, investors got dissatisfied.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) also reported a disappointing quarter, and since money managers became unhappy with the sector, they moved to high growth tech stocks as they did not leave the sector to keep funds diversified.Higher growth stocks like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) were grabbed by investors as they shunned plain tech companies like Hewlett-Packard.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ) were some other stocks that were bought due to stock rotation."Now, I have to tell you, don't get too complacent about the longevity of this rotation," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He added that if IBM (NYSE: IBM ) gives investors something to cheer for in the upcoming analyst meet, the money could rotate back into old tech.</span>CEO interview: Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) Salesforce.com reported great earnings on Wednesday and has been trading higher in after-market hours.The company achieved higher than expected revenues, gave strong guidance for 2016 and was the fastest tech company to reach $5 billion.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer believes that it will be the fastest to reach $10 billion in some years.</span>He interviewed CEO Marc Benioff to find more about the prospects of the company.Benioff said that some of their largest deals have come from Europe despite the currency issues and they are going to grow even faster in Europe.Japan has been a high performer too.With Microsoft partnership, Salesforce is delivering great products to customers, he added.Benioff spoke about the customer experience of Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) after collaborating with Salesforce and also talked about the company's entry into high-end retail brands like Burberry ( OTCPK:BURBY ) and Louis Vuitton ( OTCPK:LVMUY ) and consumer goods company like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ).Companies that sell housing materials have been reporting strong quarters.Both Home Depot and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW ) reported numbers showing that housing materials are being purchased at a strong rate.With a smaller number of new homes being built, where are all the materials going?Cramer's answer to the question is 'Existing Homes'.Most of the housing materials purchased are being used in homes that were under-maintained and are coming to the market for leasing.Carol Tome, CFO of Home Depot confirmed this on the earnings call by mentioning that between 2006 and 2013, 3.6 million homes entered into the rental market, and those residences are badly in need of a remodel.Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL ) also said that home-builder gains came from fewer new homes that were mostly luxury homes.Cramer mentioned that if the housing materials were being allocated to new homes, then it would be bad for the housing boom which will be crushed by the Fed's rising rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"Instead, the strength in building materials is deliciously under the radar and destined to last a lot longer than anyone believes," said Cramer.</span>CEO interview: La Quinta Holdings (NYSE: LQ ) Cramer thinks La Quinta is a strong company and has more room to grow now that gasoline prices are down.Lodging is a strong business in the U.S. and La Quinta is taking advantage of that, which can be seen in the company's strong earnings.Cramer interviewed CEO Wayne Goldberg to find out more about the prospects of La Quinta."We are an amazing brand and we are poised to continue to do well," said Goldberg.He added that lower oil and gas prices are positive for the business and most of their hotels are 'Drive to'.However, other segments of the company like consumer and leisure are bigger than oil and gas.He spoke about how the franchises have been great partners of the company and there are many markets that are not saturated where the company has room to grow.Commenting on Blackstone (NYSE: BX ), he said that over time they will be selling La Quinta's stock but that will not have an impact on how the company grows.Southwest (NYSE: LUV ): "My favorite is Spirit (NASDAQ: SAVE ) and then Southwest and then American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) but I am not going to push them right now as there is an expectation of oil going to $40-41 and if it does not, then these numbers are not going to go up as they have been for the airlines."Schnitzer Steel (NASDAQ: SCHN ): "I am not a big fan of the steel companies other than Nucor (NYSE: NUE )," said Cramer.Although Schnitzer is fine, he is concerned that the steel business is not as good as the iron and copper businesses.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million
