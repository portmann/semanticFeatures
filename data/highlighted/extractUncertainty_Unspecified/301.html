Check-Cap LTD - Check-Cap (NASDAQ:CHEKU) | Seeking Alpha Check-Cap's technology could revolutionize a large segment of the medical diagnostics industry.</span>The diagnostic technology is well poised for quick adoption by doctors, patients, and insurers.Check-Cap LTD (CHEK) is an early clinical-stage medical diagnostic products company based in Israel.The company is currently developing a single product used in the diagnosis of colon and rectal (colorectal) cancer.Their product is capsule and imaging-system, which can be swallowed, and does not require lengthy fasts or cleansed.The capsule then allows X-rays to image the colon.This method is an alternative to the colonoscopy, a more invasive diagnostic technology.Check-Cap's upside potential is enormous.The company offers a key-solution to a major medical shortcoming for patient and doctors, it deeply under-prices its substitute making insurance coverage easily justifiable, and has a promising outlook for regulatory approval.Colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in the US.A leading driver in the mortality rate is the timing of detection.One of the reasons patients avoid screening and detection for colorectal cancer is the invasiveness and displeasure associated with screening.The current and most commonly used method of screening is the colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Check-Cap imaging system is very different.</span>It is an ingestible pill-shaped capsule that uses X-ray technology to image the digestive system.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The X-ray imaging and data could potentially even be converted to 3D renderings of the colon providing doctors a very easy and accurate alternative.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As a result, this method could easily create better adoption rates of screening amongst patients.</span>Being the more pleasant alternative should propel patient and doctor adoption of the technology.According to costhelper.com , the average cost of a colonoscopy before insurance coverage is just over $3,000, and a patient's responsibility is determined by type of insurance coverage.That simply means someone is paying $3,000 for the colonoscopy.The cost is in large part due to the time it takes to prep the patient, the nursing care, the lab work, and the doctor's time to complete.Now imagine the capsule - beyond purchasing the technology and the cost associated with reading the results does all that work without the requirement of hands-on time and prep work.If the technology is mass-produced it can easily under-price the colonoscopy by thousands of dollars.Even if the technology is not as accurate as the colonoscopy, insurance companies will not have a problem covering it due to the cost savings.Not to mention the increased potential to prevent even more costly late-stage Colorectal Cancer treatments.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If the technology is as accurate or more than the colonoscopy insurance companies will prefer this treatment, which could eventually phase out colonoscopies for the majority of diagnostic cases.</span>In any event, there should be no limitations to adoption given the fact that insurance coverage will be easy to obtain.Check-Cap has already completed a clinical proof-of-concept study that focused on the safety and feasibility of the imaging system.The study focused on 10-cases and produced very promising results allowing the company to move forward.The company has now moved on to 60-subject study which will more extensively access feasibility and set the ground work for clinical approval in both Europe and the United States.Additionally, the company has already been moving forward with pre-submission meeting with the US FDA.Given the current timing the company expects to launch their product commercially to Europe in 2016, and to the US in 2017.Based on the current offering per share price range of $6-$8, Check-Cap is looking to sell 2 million shares.This would result in just under 10 million shares outstanding, and at $7 average a market value of $70 million dollars.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is a very bargain price for a technology that could potentially revolutionize the colonoscopy industry and significantly improve colorectal cancer detection.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, investors should be aware of the risks investing in a company at the very early stages of clinical testing.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The method has not been proven to meet all of the regulatory guidelines and therefore may never make it to market.</span>For investors looking for a gamble or a great company to keep an eye on they should consider adding Check-Cap to their watch-list or portfolio.Source: Great Gamble On Medical Product Company IPO -
