(NASDAQ:HCSG) | Seeking Alpha I like Healthcare Services Group for its high client retention rate and its ability to cross-sell dining & nutrition services on top of its core housekeeping and laundry business.</span>Healthcare Services Group is a proxy for the growth in outsourced non-clinical services by healthcare organizations.Decent 2.2% forward dividend yield and debt-free balance sheet offer downside protection.However, Healthcare Services Group offers limited upside at current valuations, implying that investors should wait for a better entry price.I like to seek out market leaders with favorable growth prospects, and Healthcare Services Group (NASDAQ: HCSG ) fits the bill.It is the leading provider of housekeeping and laundry services to healthcare organizations in the U.S., and has a long growth runaway ahead of it, considering current market penetration rates.However, Healthcare Services Group is expensive at 28 times forward P/E and I will advise investors to consider the stock at more attractive valuations.Started in 1976, Healthcare Services Group is the largest provider of housekeeping and laundry services to the U.S. healthcare industry, serving more than 3,500 facilities in 48 states as of end-December 2014.It derived 46%, 19% and 35% of its 2014 revenue from housekeeping, laundry & linen and dining & nutrition services respectively.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It is noteworthy that while Healthcare Services Group provides its housekeeping and laundry services at all of its locations, its dining & nutrition services are only offered at approximately 900 of its current facilities.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Hermann Simon, a German researcher and author, first coined the term "hidden champion", in a German management journal in 1990, where he defined hidden champions as companies that are market leaders for a specific industry either globally or on any specific continent in terms of market share, with sales under $4 billion, operating out of the public limelight.</span>Healthcare Services Group will meet at least two out of three these criteria, given that it only has $1.3 billion of sales and it is not a familiar name for investors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Hidden champions like Healthcare Services Group are typically interesting investment candidates, as their dominant market share tends to suggest the presence of unique competitive advantages and attractive financial characteristics.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Firstly, Healthcare Services Group boasts a client retention rate of approximately 90% .</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While this might sound counter-intuitive, I find this statistic even more compelling considering the fact that Healthcare Services Group's service agreements with its clients are typically signed renewable one year on (relatively short) service terms.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For other companies which have high client retention rates by virtue of long-term contracts, issues such as client dissatisfaction could go unnoticed for an extended period of time.</span>In Healthcare Services Group's case, the fact, that it managed to have such a high client retention rate despite the short tenure of its service agreement, speaks volumes about its ability to meet its clients' needs.Secondly, Healthcare Services Group started offering outsourced dining & nutrition services in 1997 and continues to benefit from the cross-selling of such services to its large installed base of existing housekeeping & laundry clients.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In 2010, Healthcare Services provided dining & nutrition services at approximately 15% of its facilities that it operates in.</span>Last year, dining & nutrition services were offered at around 25% of Healthcare Services Group's facilities.This is the strongest validation of the success of Healthcare Services Group's cross-selling efforts.Looking ahead, the increased expansion of dining & nutrition services to its client base will continue to be a key growth driver for the Company.Based on management's estimates, dining & nutrition services account for double of the long term & post acute care facilities' expenditures on housekeeping & laundry services; but the third-party market penetration rates for dining & nutrition services is only a third of that for housekeeping & laundry services.This implies significant future growth derived from the increased cross-selling of dining & nutrition services.In addition, there is a virtuous cycle at play here.By providing a wider range of services to its healthcare clients, Healthcare Services Group increases customer switching costs, as most clients will prefer to deal with a fewer number of vendors for efficiency's sake.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As Healthcare Services Group retains more of its clients with its suite of services, it could accelerate cross-selling efforts to have as many of its clients take up all of its service offerings.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Healthcare Services Group has had a fantastic track record of growth since its incorporation almost four decades ago; 2014 represents the 38th year of consecutive revenue growth for Healthcare Services Group.</span>More impressively, it has consistently achieved low double-digit revenue growth for the past one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year periods.The market penetration rates for outsourced housekeeping and laundry services are only 24% and 18% at hospitals and long term & post acute care facilities respectively.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Similarly, third-party service providers only account for approximately 28% and 5% of total dining & nutrition services at hospitals and long term & post acute care facilities respectively.</span>The analysis above draws on information provided by Healthcare Services Group's management based on market data from the American Hospital Association, Department of Health and Human Services and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Since I have already established the fact that the penetration rates for third-party housekeeping & laundry services and dining & nutrition services have room to grow, the key is to understand why an increasing number of healthcare facilities will give up their in-house support service departments and engage third-party management firms like Healthcare Services Group instead.Healthcare costs have simply spiraled out of control in the past few years and healthcare organizations such as hospitals and long term & post acute care facilities are under pressure to contain costs.It is estimated that U.S. healthcare spending has increased from $2.6 trillion in 2010 to $3.8 trillion in 2013.More importantly, housekeeping & laundry and dining & nutrition are significant expense items for healthcare organizations, implying that the outsourcing of such services will alleviate cost pressures to a large extent.As per the management's compilation of market data from American Hospital Association, Department of Health and Human Services and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, housekeeping & laundry and dining & nutrition costs represent around 3% and 6% of hospitals' annual expenditures respectively.In the case of long term & post acute care facilities, the cost burden is even more significant, with total housekeeping & laundry and dining & nutrition accounting for 18% of their yearly expenditures.The importance of cost in the outsourcing decision is further supported by the results of Modern Healthcare's August 2013 Executive Opinions on Purchasing survey that hospital executives plan to "increase their outsourcing in non-clinical areas going forward into the year ahead," and 42.1% of respondents cited "cost reduction" as the key reason for outsourcing.As a result, the trend of hospitals and long term & post acute care facilities outsourcing their non-core services should continue to persist for the foreseeable future.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>More significantly, 47.4% of respondents also cited "capitalizing on vendor expertise" as another key outsourcing criterion, suggesting that Healthcare Services Group has a edge competing for new clients vis-ï¿½-vis sub-scale competitors with a shorter operating history.</span>Healthcare Services Group is a relatively defensive stock, due to its dividend track record and balance sheet strength.It has paid dividends for 47 consecutive quarters since it initiated its dividend program in 2003.The fourth quarter of 2014 also represents the 46th straight quarter running that Healthcare Services Group has raised its quarterly dividend.It currently only offers an attractive 2.2% forward dividend yield.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Healthcare Services Group also does not have any debt on its books, implying limited credit risks.</span>In addition, it is a cash flow generative business, having delivered positive free cash flow in every year for the past decade.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I arrive at a target price of $30 for Healthcare Services Group, assuming that a 25 times forward P/E is applied to my estimated 2016 EPS of $1.20.</span>Healthcare Services Group is currently trading at 28 times forward P/E and close to its all-time share price high of $34.I expect a forward P/E multiple compression from 28 times to 25 times in my valuation analysis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>My forecasted EPS of $1.20 in 2016 is based on assumptions of a 12% revenue growth for 2015 and 2016; and a net margin of 5%.</span>My target price offers limited upside from Healthcare Services Group's share price of $32.51 as of March 11, 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While Healthcare Services Group's financial track record has been impressive and it offers significant downside protection in the form of a debt-free balance sheet and a decent 2.2% forward dividend yield, it faces significant regulatory risks.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Its healthcare clients are heavily dependent on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A downward adjustment in reimbursement rates will adversely impact the financial health of Healthcare Services Group's clients and increase the risk of bad debts resulting from late or even non-payments.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, it is interesting that management has offered an alternative view of the "opportunities" that reimbursement pressures throw up , where Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dan McCartney commented at the recent earnings call: And even to go a little more granular as far as the two different segments, the demand for dining and nutrition services is really no different than that of housekeeping and laundry, and that there is more demand really pent-up demand in both segments and we are capable of managing.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And over the past 24 months, that demand has really only increased alongside the reimbursement pressures and the regulatory uncertainty that the providers feel.</span>So, the tighter, they are getting squeezed, real or perceived the more opportunity that opens up for us.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Source: Healthcare Services Group: Limited Upside For Hidden Champion With Long Growth Runway At Current Valuations Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</span>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
