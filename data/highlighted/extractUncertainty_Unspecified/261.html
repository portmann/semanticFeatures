(OTCMKTS:CVTPF) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 11, 2015  1:54 PM ET �|� About: Napec, Inc. (CVTPF) , Includes: PWR by: Brian Langis Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Learn more about PRO � NAPEC is undervalued on many different valuation metrics compared to its peers.</span>NAPEC's latest changes (board & management + strategic plan) is overshadowed by NAPEC's lackluster past.The CDPQ recently raise their participation in NPC to become the 2nd largest shareholder.That's a vote of confidence.The FTQ is the number one shareholder.NPC turned down multiple takeover offers in past as high as $1.95 per share.That was a terrible decision but it tells you the business is worth something.CVTech Group officially became NAPEC Inc. in September 2014.Throughout the article, NAPEC Inc. can also be referred to as NPC, CVTech Group, or the Corporation and its subsidiaries.NAPEC Inc. is primarily traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the sticker NPC.Note: Dollar amounts are in Canadian $ unless mentioned otherwise.USD-CAD 1.2617 Price of 1 USD in CAD as of March 10, 2015.The following opportunity is a beaten-down stock that has been disappointing shareholders for many years.NAPEC Inc. ( NPC , CVTPF) is a company with a market cap of ~$76 million that operates in energy sector.NPC provides maintenance and construction services for electricity transmission and distribution networks in Quebec, Ontario and the eastern U.S. Below is a chart of the stock performance of NAPEC Inc. since inception.This valuation research article explains why NAPEC trades at a significant discount to its intrinsic value because its past failures are overshadowing the current changes and progress.NPC prospects will be worthy once short-term problems disappear.NAPEC Inc. +6.19% since inception vs S&P TSX +62.79%.Apr 29, 2005 - March 5, 2015 That's certainly not an impressive chart so why is NPC's stock performance so depressing and why is this an opportunity?First how did we get here?NPC's stock performance has been a wreck because of two nasty proxy wars, two failed acquisitions within 6-months, mismanagement of the company as a whole, the mismanagement of multiple takeover offers, the lack of transparency, overhead overspending, the resignation of the Chairman and the CEO, and negative publicity.As a result of this mess NPC ended in a bad light with the financial community and shareholder confidence in the company has plummeted with its share price.Since the ship was sinking for a while, major changes were required.A new competent CEO, Pierre Gauthier, took the wheel in August 2014.Mr. Gauthier has recently presented its 2015-2017 strategic plans which calls for sales to double to $600 million and to restore EBITDA margins to its historical level of 7-8%.Basically Mr. Gauthier is doing the work that was supposed to be done five years ago.On the cost side, overhead cost has ballooned under the previous CEO and he's cutting unnecessary spending.He's also focused on developing synergies between operating units which are highlighted in the strategic plan.On the revenue side, LTM revenues are at an all-time high and NAPEC just recently awarded some of its biggest contracts in its history.Those massive contracts are not on the current financial statements and Q4-2014 results are expected on March 26, 2015.There also have been some management and board changes.In the last year there's been new key personal running the operating units since there's been a new chairman as of January 28, 2015.The new board and CEO is committed to fiscal discipline necessary to right-size NAPEC and put the company in a position to grow.On the macro side, North American transmission and distribution infrastructure has been under-invested and is aging.In the U.S. alone there's ~$20 billion spent on both the distribution and the transmission electricity grid each year.Quebec and Ontario are also growing their investment in the distribution and transmission lines.Even though NAPEC is only located in the North-East, it's due to benefit from the large electricity infrastructure investment.Regarding valuation, on an EV/EBITDA, price to book, and price to sales basis NAPEC trades at a significant discount compared to its peers.One can argue that it's warranted considering its lack of results in the past.But the market has overreacted and is too pessimistic.For example, NPC trades 0.92x book value vs your 1.81x book value for your comparable and the Corporation has modestly increased its book value over the years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I'm not suggesting NPC should trade at the same valuation than its peers but it doesn't deserve to be in the garbage bin either.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe the market's reaction is a little too extreme.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to my valuation which you will find in greater detail below, I believe the valuation range of the price per share of NAPEC is between $1.40 and $1.50 a share, this implies an upside of 32% to a 41.5% on the $1.05 closing price of March 3rd, 2015.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the short-term I believe those numbers are reasonable.</span>In the long-run, if NAPEC actually improves and achieves half its goal (450m in revenues), the upside is even higher.The catalysts that will fuel the stock higher are a combination of; higher sales, higher EBITDA margins, a takeover offer, acquisitions, take private offer, the lower Canadian dollar, growing investments in the electricity distribution and transmission grid.A little under the radar news is the Caisse de D�p�t et Placement du Qu�bec (CDPQ) has recently increased their position in NAPEC to become the 2nd largest shareholder after the Fonds de solidarit� FTQ.A CDPQ investment in an unloved company is definitely a vote of confidence.This means they did their due diligence and the CDPQ is an excellent long-term investor to have.NPC presents an interesting investing opportunity with minimal downside.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Everything negative about the NPC is all-ready baked in the stock price, so any positive surprise will be greatly welcomed by the market and might just be enough to shift the momentum.</span>NAPEC Inc. was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Drummondville, Quebec.NPC is a provider of construction and maintenance services to the public utility and heavy industrial markets mainly in Quebec, Ontario and the eastern United States.Through its subsidiaries, the NPC provides maintenance and construction services for electricity transmission and distribution networks, substations and electrical power houses, as well as the control of vegetation on rights�?of�?way for electrical lines.As of September 30th, 2014, NAPEC had a staff of 1,167 employees.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company operated under different names throughout its existence and was widely known as CVTech Group until recently.</span>On September 9th, 2014 CVTech Group Inc. has adopted the name NAPEC Inc.NAPEC stands for North American Power and Energy Corporation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That's because in 2012 the Corporation sold their division that designs, engineers, and manufactures Continuously Variable Transmissions (NYSE: CVT ) for $19.3 million ($17.3m cash + $2m preferred shares).</span>The CVT division only contributed to 11% of revenues at the time of the sale and was a drain on resources.This prompted the Corporation to change their name to something more representative of the sector they currently operate in.Below is the corporate chart as of November 7, 2014.Certain subsidiaries have been omitted because they do not represent 10% of the assets or revenues of NAPEC Inc.Thirau (formely Thiro) was founded in Victoriaville, Quebec, in 1952.Thiro was acquired in 2005 by CVTech.Thirau LLC is a general contracting firm specializing in the construction and maintenance of electrical power houses and substations as well as transmission and distribution lines primarily in the Province of Quebec.Thirau LLC carries the activity described above but in Eastern United-States.Its activities are divided into four main divisions: transmission, distribution, post installation and anchoring.This subsidiary is a leader in the field of transmission line construction and, in particular, the installation of power transmission lattice towers.It offers a turnkey service, from digging foundations through assembling the transmission poles to high-voltage conductor installation.It specializes in the vegetation control on rights�?of�?way for transmission and distribution lines.Basically they are the barber around electrical lines.CVTech acquired Riggs Distler & Company.Inc. for $43 million (US$37.4 million July 1, 2009 exchange rate) in 2009 Riggs Distler & Co. is over 100 years old (1909) and according to their history have participated in the construction of some of the most notable building projects in the United States such as The Empire State Building, The Federal Reserve Building and others.Riggs is a provider of maintenance and construction services to the utility and heavy industrial markets.In 2014, the activities of Thirau LLC in the US were regrouped with Riggs Distler.Riggs Distler Inc. is based in Ontario,Canada since 2012.Riggs Distler offers a full range of services in Ontario in the field of construction, maintenance and upgrade of electrical transmission, as well as emergency storm damage repair.It also offers planning, installation, and maintenance services for substations and transformers as well as solar panel installation.History of Developments and Proxy Fights Investor confidence in the company took a dive after a couple rocky years at NAPEC.What happened?Two back-to-back years of proxy war with a revolting shareholder and two failures to close two acquisitions took CVTech to new lows.In the following paragraphs, I will try my best to recollect the events how it happened.I relied on corporate filings and news clips to summon up the events.I will also try to provide both sides of the story.I'm not sure how much impact the following will have on your investing decision but I think it's important to bring it up since it explains in part how the company got to where it is today.A storm erupted when Guy Aubert, 2nd biggest shareholder and director at the time with 13.8% of the votes, lead a campaign to change the board of the company.His case was CVTech has over-promised and under-delivered.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>NPC.to close at $0.86 at the 2012 AGM on May 30th, 2012.</span>The institutional vote didn't side with Mr. Aubert.Glass Lewis & Co., a leading independent proxy advisory services firm, has issued a report recommending that the Corporation's shareholders vote in favor of the current board and recommended not to vote for the seven directors nominated by Guy Aubert.Institutional Shareholder Services Canada (NYSE: ISS ) also issued a report recommending keeping the board.In a press release Glass Lewis agreed with Mr. Aubert about the terrible performance at CVTech but shred Mr. Aubert's arguments apart by pretty much saying his position is paradoxical in nature, as his assertions seem to stand in odd contrast to his recent history with the Corporation."While we find some merit in certain of the Dissenting Shareholder quantitative arguments, we do not find CVTech's recent operational shortcomings serve as a clarion call for overwhelming board-level change.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We find even less impetus for such turmoil considering that the Dissenting Shareholder has, himself, been positioned for nearly seven years to directly influence, through his extensive board and executive service and significant shareholding, virtually every issue subject to his critique.</span>Moreover, up until late April 2012, the Dissenting Shareholder undertook actions that conveyed clear and direct support for the incumbent board members, including a circular which contemplated the reelection of all current board members at the 2012 Annual General and Special Meeting of shareholders, including himself.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Further still, in offering a response to the Dissenting Shareholder's sudden contest, the incumbent members continue to recommend shareholders support the election of the Dissenting Shareholder, thus affording him the continued opportunity to provide his perspective at the board level."</span>Source: Glass Lewis Co.'s Statements With only 28.11% of the votes, the proxy war didn't go in favor of Mr. Aubert.The key to toppling the board is to get Fonds de solidarit� FTQ's 24% of the votes in your favor, which Mr. Aubert didn't get.Controversy #2: AGM on June 4, 2013.The storm took a turn for the worst when Guy Aubert, now a former director after resigning, disclosed confidential information in a letter addressed to shareholders about the takeover offers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Mr. Aubert believed shareholders should have been consulted regarding the takeover offers.</span>Mr. Aubert also said shareholders deserve an explanation on why the offers were refused twice.As a result, a second push to change the entire board was proposed.In an interview to The Canadian Press in June 2013 before the AGM, Guy Aubert made the following comments: "It's still a good company, but it's the upper management that isn't good," he said, calling the board an "old boy's club.""We've lost the confidence of investors.The CEO needs to do road shows to sell the company to institutional investors and to potential investors.That isn't being done."To be brief, the story is CVTech twice refused a buyout offer from an undisclosed buyer.That buyer was later revealed to be Quanta Services (NYSE: PWR ).Quanta first made an offer for $1.65 a share December 2011, a 45% premium at the time, but the board turned it down.In January 2013, Quanta made a 2nd offer at $1.95 a share which represented a 70% premium but took it off the table after the board decided to have a bidding process.Quanta is an electrical contractor listed on the NYSE with a ~$6 billion market cap company.Quanta Services operates in Canada after buying Valard Construction and is looking to extend their presence in Canada.There was a third offer too, but I can't figure out if it was from Quanta or from another company.The sequence of events isn't exactly clear.CVTech defended itself by accusing Guy Aubert of disclosing confidential information about the takeover offers in the letter and said some of the information was erroneous and incomplete.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to the press release: "On December 19, 2011, the Corporation received a conditional and non-binding offer by the NYSE-listed company mentioned by Mr. Aubert (the "Company") in the Letter.</span>Following reception of this offer, the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") informed the Company of its interest and added that given its fiduciary duties, it would initiate a process to solicit competing offers to ensure the value of the Corporation would be maximized, notably for the benefit of all shareholders.Upon receiving this information, the Company indicated to the Board that it was withdrawing its offer since the Corporation wanted to extend solicitation offers to other parties.In 2012, the Board initiated a review of strategic alternatives.To this end, the Corporation appointed an independent committee (the "Committee") to review and consider such alternatives and also retained the services of technical advisors and legal counsel to assist in carrying out its mandate.In addition, the Committee, in the course of its mandate, proceeded with a valuation of the Corporation."Guy Aubert was defeated a 2nd time in his proxy war when once again the FTQ share didn't support his cause.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While the voting results looks like a small dunk victory for CVTech, the reality is different.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's not clear if it was during the first year of votes or the second year but the FTQ was apparently going to vote with Guy Aubert but changed their mind at the last minute and sided with CVTech's board.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The FTQ didn't issue any comments that could affect NPC.</span>Controversy #3: Following the Guy Aubert proxy wars and a lot of bad blood, CVTech knew they were on a short leash and had to prove to shareholders that they made the right choice by keeping them.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Instead CVTech failed to close two different transactions within 6-months.</span>The transactions were supposed to be strategic and accretive to earnings.CVTech claimed that the first transaction failed to close because of the negative publicity surrounding the proxy war and no explanation was given for the 2nd failed transaction.The shares dropped 9.17% on the news, falling ten cents to $0.99.On July 4th 2014, three weeks before the 2014 shareholder assembly and one week after the release of the management information circular, Andr� Laram�e left his CEO post and board seat after 18 years of service.CVTech issued a statement saying he was simply retiring but I have been told he was pushed out.It's hard to ignore the fact that the mess of the last few years and the lack of performance wouldn't weight on his decision.After two back to back proxy wars and nothing positive to show to a bunch of already very disappointed shareholders, it's a hard position to justify.NPC.to close $0.85, down 4.49% July 10th, 2014, Pierre Gauthier is announced as the new CEO.He was already a director and CEO of Alstom US and Canada.NPC.to close at $0.90.December 18th, 2014, NAPEC announces the resignation of its Chairman of the Board, Jacques Joly, for personal reasons.NPC.to close at $0.85 December 22nd, 2014, The CDPQ announced that it has acquired 2,334,188 common shares of NAPEC Inc. at a price of $0.86 per share.The CDPQ now owns 12.15% of NPC.January 28th, 2014: NAPEC announces the appointment of their new Chairman.NPC.to close at $0.91.I have a more detailed section on management and the board below.The aftermath didn't go unnoticed.Several important but small shareholders have sided with Mr. Aubert and some of them are former heads of companies that were sold to CVTech and fund managers.They have voiced their concerns, their frustrations and the board knows it's on a tight leash.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Mr. Aubert might not have won, but indirectly there have been some gains.</span>Since the last proxy war, some board members have resigned and have been replaced.There's also the new CEO, Pierre Gauthier, who has a lot of experience in the energy sector.He recently disclosed his strategic plan which I look at in detail below.There was a lot of mudslinging that ended up putting the company in a bad light with the financial community.This was an ugly war that went on for too long and as a result shareholders have suffered.It doesn't matter how good the investment idea is, if you don't have the right people in place, it will be hard to benefit from that idea.The old management has clearly under delivered and new people were brought in.The top people at NAPEC have been replaced (except the CFO).The new CEO is a veteran in the sector with his experience at Alstom.Rigg Distler & Company and Thirau LLC are also headed by new people.The biggest change was nominating Pierre L. Gauthier as the new CEO of NPC since August 11th 2014.Before joining NAPEC he was the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Alstom Power & Transport Canada Inc. (OTCPK: ALSMY ).He was with Alstom for 18 years.Alstom is one of the largest electricity and transport companies in the world.Mr. Gauthier is very familiar with the North-American energy sector and he's also familiar with NAPEC since he's been on the board since fall 2013.He also sits on numerous councils and he's well known in the Montreal business community.You can listen to some of his interesting speeches on Youtube or Bloomberg .There are no changes at the CFO position.Mario Trahan, has been the CFO since 2004 and has been with the company since 1997.He's an accountant by background.Stephen M. Zemaitatis Jr. also known as Steve, has served as the President of Riggs Distler & Co since February 2014.Bruno Testaert has been the VP and General manager of Thirau LLC and J.J.L. D�boisement since 2013.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Mr. Testaert has almost 20 years of experience in executive positions, managing large-scale projects with companies including Dessau Inc. and Vinci Energies.</span>Recently there has been some change on the board as well.Since the proxy wars of 2013 there have been three new board members, including a new chairman.In July 2014 Andr� Laram�e resigned from the CEO post and the Board twenty days before the AGM.The management information circular seeking his reelection has been out for a week.CVTech's press release simply said that he wanted to retire but I have been told that he was pushed out.If you read the entire article, it's obvious there's more to the story of a guy "transitioning into retirement".December 10th, 2014: Denis Tremblay was appointed as a director.He has previous experience in the energy sector, especially at Hydro-Quebec, where a lot of contracts are from.December 18th, 2014: Jacques Joly, Chairman of the Board, resigned for personal reasons.He has been with the company since 2005.He was of the last piece of the former group.January 28th, 2015: Luc Reny, CFA, was appointed as Chairman of the Board.He has been a director since June 2010.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He's also a VP at Power Corporation and on numerous different boards.</span>Pierre Gauthier has a massive job ahead of him.First he needs to regain investor confidence.He will need to use his talent to convince the financial community, institutional investors, journalists, and shareholders that after many lackluster years, that sustainable changes are in process that will yield positive results in the future.Pierre Gauthier has a positive reputation in the industry and plenty of experiences that will help him navigate the challenges.From what insiders told me so far, M. Gauthier is like a breath of fresh air.They have plenty of positive comments and he's focused on turning the ship around.On February 11th 2014, CVTech adopted a new corporate organizational structure that will regroup operations by geographic region.The first step was to merge Thirau LLC and all US operations under the unified banner of Riggs Distler.The new business model also entails the creation of shared administrative services, the introduction of new lines of business, and access to more diversified expertise.Management expects to save $2m a year just on that structure.On July 3rd 2014, new cosmetic changes were announced.The board adopted a new name, a new logo, a new website, and a new identity to get approve by the shareholders at the AGM set on July 23, 2014.The original AGM was set for June 18th 2014 but was pushed back to a later date.No reason was given.The name change was necessary following the disposal of their CVT transmission division two years earlier.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All that change is purely cosmetic, but sometimes a fresh coat of paint feels good and signals a new beginning.</span>But it still doesn't erase the dreary history of CVTech.On February 16th 2015, under the new CEO Pierre Gauthier, unveiled their strategic plan for fiscal 2015-2017.Below are some of the highlights: From a trailing 12-month revenue base of $290 million as of September 30th, 2014, the plan calls for revenue to double to $600 million by the end of 2017, while profitability should improve through the mix of revenues derived from higher margin segments and synergies from the implementation of the new business model.NAPEC projects to return to its historical EBITDA margin in the range of 7-8%.Revenue growth will be mainly achieved by further expanding NAPEC's presence in the northeastern United States and by increasing its market share in Ontario.The Corporation also intends to proceed with selective acquisitions that will provide additional expertise or equipment to support its expansion.As mentioned above, the new organizational structure should increase operating efficiency, reduce costs, stimulate cross-selling and achieve synergies.The structure was adopted in the U.S. in early 2014 and will be implemented in Canada in 2015 and 2016.All activities in Canada will be under the banner Thirau and Riggs Distler in the United-States.Eventually all Canadian operations will be known as Thirau Canada.Source: NAPEC FY2015-2017 Strategic Plan.Slide 14.During the strategic plan conference call, Mr. Gauthier signaled that they wanted to close the gap in their coverage in the U.S. Below is a map of their U.S. footprint.Source: NAPEC FY2015-2017 Strategic Plan.Slide 16.As you can see there's a hole between Illinois and the East Coast and management has the intention of filling it.The new strategic plan is modest and reasonable unlike the old one which over-promised and ended up under-delivering.Under the new plan NAPEC will have to add $100 million a year over three years to achieve their $600 million goal.They're definitely off to a strong start in 2015 with all the latest contract signing announcements.In the electricity market, the North American transmission and distribution infrastructure has suffered from under-investment and is aging, prompting the need for more maintenance, upgrade or replacement.Another major trend involves the gradual change in sources of electricity generation in North America.Coal has historically been the leading source of electricity generation in the United States, but it is increasingly being supplanted by natural gas due to its availability and low cost, while many old coal-fired generating facilities will have to close due to high retrofitting costs to comply with more stringent regulation.In Ontario, coal has been phased out and new capacity will mainly stem from renewable sources, including hydroelectricity.Ontario's Long-Term Energy Plan calls for renewables to represent 46% of generation capacity in 2025, up from about 30% in 2013.Source: NAPEC FY2015-2017 Strategic Plan.Slides 8 and 9.As you can see infrastructure investments are expected to be between $19-$20 billion in the U.S. alone.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Those are nice slides but unfortunately I don't know how much of this spending is directed in the North-East United-States and how much exposure NAPEC has to that spending.</span>Either way, the spending trend is favorable for NAPEC.I can make the same argument with Canada.The rising trend in transmission and distribution spending is good, but the chart is not clear on how much of this spending is in Quebec and Ontario, where NAPEC is exposed to.What's more precise is Hydro-Quebec, the energy powerhouse of Quebec, one of the major contributors of business to NAPEC, invests about $1.8 billion per year for the development and operability of the transmission grid and $1 billion per year in the distribution network.There's no lack of spending and hopefully the new management can get NAPEC in a position to take advantage of it.The FTQ and CDPQ are two big institutional investors with long-term approaches.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Guy Aubert now has less than 10% of the shares and it's possible that he has less than the 9.87% stated in the table.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"We believe the existing and future clients of NAPEC Inc. are beginning an important investment cycle that will be spread out over several years," "NAPEC Inc. will have the opportunity to participate in this investment cycle, and for a long-term investor like La Caisse, this is an interesting prospect."</span>said Martin Garand, Investment Director at the CDPQ.Above is a table of the insider buying over the last six months.The CEO Pierre Gauthier acquires 30,000$ worth of stock on January 29th, 2015 and Yves Filion, another director, bought 10,000 shares on February 24th, 2015.Dropping a whopping $40k isn't going to break the bank, but they are buying.I think that Yves Filion's purchase is more interesting since he has been a director since 2008 and I bet he has a pretty good idea of what's happening inside the company.Another purchase is by Pierre Joubert, VP HR back in September.There are many reasons on why you would sell a stock but only one for buying.*The above numbers include the CVT sales up to 2011.The CVT division was disposed in 2012.The chart above represents the last ten years of NAPEC's revenues.The good news is the trailing-twelve month revenues are at $290 million, an all-time high for NAPEC.The last revenue peak goes back to FY2010 with $260 million in revenues.Part of the decline in FY2013 revenues vs FY2012 was less storm related work in 2013 and lower business volume.Most of the big contracts that are announced are performed over a couple years and very often with a one-year extension.For the first nine-months of period of 2014, revenues reached $219M versus $169M for the same period a year earlier, representing an increase of 29.6%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The conversion impact had the effect of increasing the NAPEC's revenues denominated in US dollars by approximately $9.3M for the nine�?</span>month period ended.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>NPC doesn't hedge the currency fluctuation.</span>We can expect more contribution of a weaker Canadian dollar in the future since the CAD really started dipping once the oil started to crash, as display by the chart below.On the top of that the Bank of Canada recently cut interest rates in January but didn't lower than again at the last meeting on March 4, 2015.Q4-2014 results are expected to be released soon and with all the new contracts that NAPEC has announced in Q4, the trend is going in the right direction.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>NAPEC'S order backlog amounted approximately to $228M as at September 30, 2014 versus $162M as at September 30, 2013.</span>Except for 2009, it's important to note the numbers below have been adjusted to exclude the CVT division they have sold in 2012.If you look at FY2013 earnings have melted.Net income swung from $10m in profit in FY2012 to a $1.7m loss in FY2013, or EPS gain of $0.17 to a loss of $0.02 per share.The main reason is because NAPEC took on two bad contracts and massive overhead spending by the previous management.One contract is completed and the other one is being renegotiated.The biggest cost to the company is labour and then equipment.The supply is usually provided by the contract issuer.Regarding the numbers, except for 2009, it's important to note the numbers above have been adjusted to exclude the CVT division they have sold in 2012.EBITDA dipped from $25m in FY2012 to 7m for the FY2013.So did EBITDA margin crashing from 10% to 3% for the same time period.FY2012 EBITDA also includes a $2.2m gain in insurance claims, an obvious non-recurring item.Besides the bad contracts, EBITDA was negatively affected by the cost of start-up projects in new niche markets, establishing a new place of business (-$1.1m), professional fees with regard to acquisitions project (-$1.1m).These fees are non-recurring.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With the cost cutting in place, it's possible that NPC release one or two "kitchen sink" quarters before things normalized.</span>Now that the two bad contracts are being absorbed, Pierre Gauthier stated in his plan that he wants to bring back EBITDA margin to its historical level of 7-8%.Except for 2013, that objective was achieved.Cost cutting and synergies should bump up margins a bit and the better execution of contracts should also help.As Q3-2014, NAPEC's financial position showed cash balance of $1.8M, a long�?term debt/equity ratio of 0.38 and working capital of $28.2M. NPC also has $25 million in long-term debt plus $6.5 million owed in the current portion.As of December 31st, 2012, all financial ratios were met.As of December 31st, 2013, when EBITDA melted, these financial ratios were not met but NAPEC obtained waiver financial institutions concerned.But as of Q3-2014, under the new credit arrangements, NAPEC meets the financial ratios.On June 10th, 2014, NAPEC closed a new agreement with a banking syndicate for a total of $65.0M in bank financing ($40m credit facility, $25m LT-debt).As of Q3-2014, an amount of $23.2M has been used under the renewable credit facility.These new financing sources replaced existing agreements.Source: Q3-2014 Financial Statement Note 5 With a current ratio of 1.47x and a low LT-debt to equity ratio, NPC is in a position to cover their bills in the next twelve months.NPC paid $1.9 million on interest for the first 9-months of 2014, a manage amount and lower than the $3.2m in 2010 and $3m in 2011.The debt is not a concern now and shouldn't be if they get their EBITDA backup.The debt is something to keep an eye in the future because it limits their flexibility to make deals and if their results deteriorate the debt will bite them later on.NPC did pay a small dividend in FY2011 and FY2012 but it seemed to be a one-time affair.Regarding share buybacks, during FY2013, NPC repurchased 766,695 common shares at an average price of $1.17 per share.For FY2012 repurchased 120,145 common shares at an average price of $1.07 per share.The share buyback wasn't enough to have an actual influence on EPS, ROA, or ROE.In the near future, I don't except NPC to distribute dividends or to significantly buyback its shares.For NPC to be able to do so, they will have to generate more free cash flow.Any excess cash should go to improve the balance sheet.If you expect some kind of capital return plan in the future, don't invest in NPC.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Above is a table of comparable companies to NAPEC with different valuation metrics.</span>I have reviewed the financial and stock market information of NAPEC and seven publicly traded companies in the electricity contracting services industry.Although none of the selected companies is entirely comparable to NPC, I chose companies to be considered similar to certain operations and geographic markets.All the peers I have selected are U.S. companies but some of them have operations in Canada and NAPEC has operations in the U.S.The pre-dominant valuation metric used in the industry is enterprise value to EBITDA.The industry mean is 7.5X EV/EBITDA.At the moment FY2013 and the last twelve months of NAPEC are not representative of its historical norm and industry average.The new CEO stated that it was one of his primary objectives to bring back EBITDA margin to 7-8%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Saying something and doing it are two different things.</span>To achieve these numbers Pierre Gauthier is on a mission to cut cost and to achieve synergies by trying consolidating subsidiaries.As I mentioned above, part of the low EBITDA margin was cause by two bad contracts in 2013.One was absorbed and the other is being renegotiated.In my valuation, I used normalized EBITDA margin of 7.5%, slightly below the industry average and below the upper range target set in the new strategic plan.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Under the scenario above, with the assumption of a normalized EBITDA and a 20% margin of safety, NAPEC is worth $1.50 a share.</span>This implies a 43.1% upside to the closing price of February 26th, 2015.This is a hypothetical scenario.To achieve this kind of valuation NPC needs to come back to $22 million in EBITDA.I used a 20% margin of safety because I'm not the smartest guy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You can argue that it could have been much more considering the risk profile of the corporation.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even with a bigger margin of safety, it allows the investment to be made with minimal downside risk with reasonable upside.</span>The secondary approach I used is price to book value.This method implies much more upside.The price to book valuation is not perfect.NPC's competitors are bigger and more profitable and warrant a higher valuation.The consistent growth in book value is one of the best ways to gauge the growth of a company's prospects.NPC hasn't been as profitable as it should have been, but it still manages to modestly grow shareholder's equity over the years as displayed in the table below.Unless NPC was really unprofitable on the brink of disaster, or its assets are overstated, NPC shouldn't be trading below book value.There's an 8.6% gain on the table if the market values NPC at 1x book value.There's more upside if NPC improves their results.In my valuation above, including a 20% margin of safety, NPC has an upside of 61%.I used price to sales approach to verify my value conclusions.NAPEC trades at .26x sales.That's a really low multiple and the lowest amongst the comparable.The price to sale ratio is all over the place with the comps.The highest multiple is 0.79x and the lowest is 0.39x. I think companies like Matrix Services (NASDAQ: MTRX ) are negatively affected by the crash in oil prices, which NPC is isolated from.Under the price to sale approach, if I apply the comps average of 0.54x sales, I get a valuation of $1.77 a share after the 20% margin of safety.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I also looked at how much a company like NAPEC could sell for if taken over.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>An American company could take advantage of their strong dollar to make a strategic acquisition.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Apparently the company constantly receives offers but they don't respond to them or they refuse them because it's too low.</span>There are three of these offers that have been disclosed publicly.One of them was a $1.95 per share made by Quanta Services , a 70% premium over the previous closing price.I'm sure they regret refusing the offer considering the aftermath.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Apparently the offer was below CVTech's independent committee valuation.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I wonder if the committee still believes that offer was "too low" today.</span>The valuation was never released to the public.I don't expect the $1.95 offer to come back, the point is that there's a business there and it's worth enough for competitors to make offers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Now that NPC is trading around $1, it looks tentative to gobble it.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Interestingly, the current EV/EBITDA multiple of the takeover offers is almost identical to the current comps metrics.</span>Usually there's a premium attached when you take a company private or you have to pay for synergies.Like I explained earlier, there's a lot of value to unlock if NPC can get their EBITDA on track.MYR Construction, Quanta and Matrix Service Company have operations in Canada and have expressed interest in expanding their operations.Can NAPEC be an acquirer?In the short-term they can't.Their balance sheet does permit it and their stock price is too low.They need to deliver for a while.Acquisitions are part of their plan going forward and it's by acquisition that NPC got to where it is today.However I don't know how much financial flexibility NPC has.It doesn't have much financial margin until it gets its EBITDA back to normal and the low stock price limits NAPEC's ability to make acquisitions since they have used their shares as currency in the past.There has been talk of taking NAPEC private.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It would be a smart move considering its small size and the possible time it might take to fix it might exceed shareholders patience (if it already didn't).</span>Traditionally a 30% control premium is applied calculated on the 20 trading day average.I'm not sure who would want to take it private and it won't be a private equity firm since its already pretty lever up.I didn't do a DCF analysis since management doesn't provide guidance.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I could have assumed some numbers since we know their business plan for the next three years but I don't think my numbers would have been reliable because of too many assumptions.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A DCF approach is highly subjective and results are too volatile to small tweaks.</span>The table above summarized my valuation results.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>On the conservative and reasonable side I believe the valuation range of the price per share of NAPEC is between $1.40 and $1.50 a share, this implies an upside 32% to a 41.5% on the $1.05 closing price of March 3rd, 2015.</span>Because of its past and small size it's no secret NPC doesn't deserve the same valuation metrics of its peers but it doesn't deserve to be in the garbage bin either.After many years of disappointments, NPC is unloved, ignored and neglected.This leads to the stock price to be extremely depressed.NPC's past is overshadowing the recent changes at the company such as record high revenues, cost cutting, synergies, a new CEO, a new Chairman and a new strategic plan.This situation leads to a mispricing between price and value.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe the gap will close over time once the market realizes that NAPEC is not the same old troubled company.</span>Another factor is the lack of visibility.There's only one analyst covering it and I can't find any earnings estimates or investment research on the stock.Apart from the proxy wars, NPC doesn't get media coverage.Like most micro-cap, the lack of visibility definitely weight on the stock and keeps it under the radar.If I had a metaphor to visualize this opportunity it would be familiar to a sports team that have disappointed fans years and after years after promising the championship title.As a result a new management team was brought it with a mandate to fix the team, start winning and in the process regain the confidence of the fans.Today NPC is that team at the bottom of the standings.Of course there is no guarantee that the team will succeed and it will take time but you are paying really cheap for the team.If it still can't manage to put a win together the good news is that you didn't pay a lot for it.The recent investment by la Caisse de D�p�t et Placement du Qu�bec is definitely a vote of confidence.There's a little insider buying by some board members and management.Adopted a strategic plan that plans to double the revenues to $600 million by the end of FY2017 Favorable exchange rate.A strong US dollar in relation to a weak CAD is beneficial to NAPEC.The conversion has the effect of increasing revenues of USD denomination.NPC has turned down takeover offers in the past.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This suggests that the business is definitely worth more than it is today.</span>NAPEC is consolidating its operations in existing markets and expanding in new markets.Pursuing expansion in Ontario and with a place of business in Chicago, it will focus developing the Great Lakes region.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cross-selling should be easier with the new simpler organizational structure As an investment, NAPEC is one of the few Canadian companies that you offer direct exposure to the favorable North East North American electricity transmission and distribution networks sector.</span>It's a direct bet on major electricity infrastructure projects.NAPEC has a solid relationship with Hydro-Qu�bec.The former CEO lost the confidence of shareholders.The company needs to rebuild its confidence with the investor community.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With a new CEO, new Chairman, new name, maybe it's heading in the right direction.</span>NAPEC's balance sheet doesn't give them much flexibility.They need to de-lever.EBITDA margins have melted in 2013.Management wants to bring it back to its historical level.The two proxy fights, the public mudslinging and two failed acquisition attempts put the company in a bad light with the financial community.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Management's compensation package seems excessive considering the size of the company and its results.</span>There are some big shareholders that want to sell off their block and this is putting downward pressure on the stock.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Possible dilution of the shareholders if acquisitions are not accretive or if financials deteriorates.</span>Construction Valard, a subsidiary of Quanta established itself in Victoriaville in the summer of 2013 is a major competitor with a lot more cash than NAPEC.It's run by Andr� Gagn� the former general manager of Thirau.He was fired from Thirau in June 2013 and joined Valard in August 2013.Other employees left Thirau to join Valard.Victoriaville is also the city where NAPEC operates from.Victoriaville is an interesting spot because of the qualified labor.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Approximately ~80% of the employees are unionized.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Potential labor problems could lead to disruption.</span>At the moment all union agreements are in effect.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In Quebec, where contracts are granted to the lowest bidder using a call for tender process, it could lead to highly competitive bidding, lower prices, reduced margins and results of operations.</span>Revenues denominated in US$ accounted for 67% of the Corporation's total revenues for FY2013.A rise in the U.S. dollar would have a negative impact on the results.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These risks are partially offset by the following elements: the U.S. subsidiary's operating expenses are denominated in US$, and when deemed appropriate, foreign currency forward contracts are entered into by the Corporation.</span>NPC doesn't use financial derivatives.The lower Canadian dollar.A bulk of NPC's revenues are in USD.Buyout offer.They turned down $1.95 a share in the past.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The fact that CVTech rejected the offer can be seen as a positive, management possibly sees more value embedded in its share but I don't expect an offer that high to be back on the table.</span>The company has changed since.Acquisitions.Management has expressed they're interested in growing through acquisitions.A take private offer.There has been talk of taking it private.NPC is very small to be public.Storms restoration.NAPEC is set to benefit after a major hurricane.Emergency power restoration is good business.You are investing in a beaten down company, any good news or good surprise will fuel the stock upward.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Change in the market's perception which could lead to an expansion of market multiples As an investment, NAPEC is one of the few Canadian companies that you offer direct exposure to the favorable North East North American electricity transmission and distribution networks sector.</span>It's an investment cycle that will be spread out over several years.Now that that the investment cycle is in favor of companies like NAPEC, can it take advantage of this promising sector?Well it's a euphemism to say that the market has lost confidence in the past management of NPC and its stock has paid the price.There are no excuses; NPC's past letdown is responsible for where the stock is trading at today.However, NPC is a beaten-down stock set to bounce back.The current changes are being overshadowed by its past failures.NPC prospects will be worthy once short-term problems disappear.A new CEO, a new Chairman, new board members, new key personal at the operating units, stability and a reasonable strategic plan should result in a bounce back in the stock.There are several catalysts available: higher sales, higher EBITDA margins, a takeover offer, acquisitions, take private offer, the lower Canadian dollar, growing investments in the electricity distribution and transmission grid.An influx of new contracts shows highlights that NAPEC's reputation as a trusted provider of services.One of its subsidiaries, Thirau LLC, just signed its biggest contract ever in its 62 year history and Riggs Distler was awarded close to $130 million in contracts in the last two months.Barring a complete collapse of the global economy, how many downside catalysts are left for NPC?Most of the bad news is already embedded in the current stock price.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The biggest risk is not delivering on the strategic plan.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However that risk is minimized because NPC's current stock price reflects disappointments and a lack of confidence from the investing community.</span>The fact that the Caisse du D�p�t et Placement du Qu�bec increased their investment in December 2014 is a vote of confidence and should not be overlooked.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You can buy NPC today sufficiently below intrinsic value to allow for human error, bad luck, to allow an investment to be made with minimal downside risk.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If you are going to invest, I highly suggest you buy the Canadian title since trading is inexistent on the US sticker.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Based on my valuation, I believe the reasonable valuation range of the price per share of NAPEC is between $1.40 and $1.50 a share, this implies an upside 32% to a 41.5% on the $1.05 closing price of March 3rd, 2015.</span>I want to finish with this.This opportunity is not for everyone.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Yes this is an opportunity for attractive returns but this is a very risky proposition.</span>NAPEC is a micro-cap with a troubled past.People say "buy low, sell high", simple advice but extremely hard to execute.This is what buying "low" looks like; it gives you a sick, sinking feeling in your gut.It's emotionally uncomfortable.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>My words might not carry enough wisdom so here is a quote by Sir John Templeton: "to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest ultimate rewards."</span>June 3, 2013: Guy Aubert responds to recent CVTech
