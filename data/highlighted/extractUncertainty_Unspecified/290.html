Morgan Chase raised its projection for fourth-quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 2.1%.Barclaysraised its GDP growth estimate to 2.3% from 2.1%.Macroeconomic Advisers raised its estimate to 2.4% from 2.3%.Wednesday’s report, known as the QSS, doesn’t get much attention in the world of U.S. economic indicators .But it’s an important source of hard data on how much consumers are spending on services like haircuts, bookkeeping and appendectomies.The QSS can lead to big revisions for service-spending data between the Commerce Department’s second and third quarterly estimates for GDP.In the first quarter of 2014, health-care spending was estimated to have contributed 1.01 percentage points to growth– until the QSS came out and it swung to a 0.16 percentage-point subtraction.In the second and third quarters, on the other hand, the QSS led to upgrades for health-care spending.In its latest estimate for fourth-quarter GDP , the Commerce Department saw consumer spending on services contributing 1.82 percentage points to the 2.2% growth rate.Health-care services alone accounted for 0.53 percentage point of growth.Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.Send news items, comments and questions to the editors and reporters below or email  realtimeeconomics@wsj.com .You must enter the verification code below to send.</div></body></html>
