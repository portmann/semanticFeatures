and gentlemen.Thank you for standing by.Welcome to Athabasca Oil Corporation's 2014 Year-End Results Conference Call.[Operator Instructions].As a reminder, this conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded.I would now like to turn the conference call over to Matt Taylor, Vice President, Capital Markets and Communications.Please go ahead.Good morning everyone, and thanks operator.Welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference Call.I'd like to advise everyone to the forward-looking statements located at the end of today's news release.All information provided today is qualified by those advisories.Joined by me today is Tom Buchanan, Chairman and CEO; Rob Broen, President and COO; and Kim Anderson, CFO.I’ll hand the call over to Tom for some introductory remarks.Great.Thank you, Matt and good morning everybody.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Unless you’ve been hibernating over the last six months, you are probably aware that we’re in a current downturn in the sector.</span>Commodity prices are challenged, and the good news is Athabasca exited 2014 in a very strong financial position as companies need to protect their balance sheets in this market.Overall, Athabasca is in a strong position relative to most.We’re confident that our financial strength coupled with the cost and capital discipline will allow us to weather the storm, while achieving our asset base and ultimately -- while advancing our asset base I should say and ultimately help us emerge as a stronger company demonstrating tremendous long-term value for shareholders.We’ve two world-class assets that we’re currently developing, the Kaybob, Duvernay in the Light Oil division and Hangingstone in the Thermal Oil.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Last September, we established a set of guiding principles which we believe are the foundation for our future success in exploiting these assets over the long term.</span>And to withstand the cyclical nature of the commodity markets, such as the environment we’re in today.Firstly, we’ve positioned Athabasca to maintain a strong balance sheet, improving our cost structure and focusing capital toward our core assets, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt our capital program in the current economic environment.Cash flow growth is expected to be driven through the ramp-up of Hangingstone over the next 18 months, and maintaining a measured pace in the Duvernay to maximize the impact of high production rates in the first year.We’re targeting our Duvernay play to be self funding in the next three to four years.Through execution excellence, we’re applying strong technical rigor and discipline to improve our well cost and performance learnings in the Duvernay, constructing a strong foundation for future development in the play.We recognize the need to significantly increase our production and cash flow from our core assets over the next two years.Finally, we continue to focus on delivering on our commitments which we’ll see Athabasca transition the Duvernay from land value to resource value as we’re still on track to be steaming Hangingstone late this month.This will allow us to drive toward a 2015 exit target of 10,000 to 14,000 boe/d.In the fall, Athabasca established some key near-term priorities, which included refocusing our activities in our core areas, a thorough review of our cost structure, and commencing a Board renewal process.In January, we were pleased to announce the appointment of Carlos Fierro and Paul Haggis to the Board of Directors.Both individuals bring extensive financial and energy sector experience that will be of great value to Athabasca shareholders.A thorough review of the cost structure is underway with a goal to align the organization to the current operating environment, capital plans and growth profile going forward.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Moving on to highlights of 2014 and recent accomplishments, fourth-quarter production averaged approximately 6000 boe/d, and second half production averaged approximately 6200 boe/d with guidance of between 6000 and 6500 boe/d.</span>Light Oil capital expenditures totaled $200 million in 2014 and we made significant progress toward achieving our core goals of retaining Duvernay acreage into the intermediate term, and transitioning land to resource value supported by strong reserve growth.Thermal Oil capital expenditures totaled $415 million in 2014.Hangingstone Project 1 construction was substantially completed and the project remains on track for first steam at the end of this quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We currently have one of the strongest balance sheets among our peer group in the sector, and we currently are funding in plays in excess of $1.2 billion, including approximately $760 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 2nd.</span>Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone.Our press release this morning gave a bit of detail on our operating results, and our winter drilling program.I’ll review some of those operational results right now.First of all, in Light Oil, the Duvernay has been our primary focus over the last two years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In 2014, the company deployed $200 million of capital in the Light Oil division to average approximately 6100 boe/d.</span>We finished 2014 with our Q4 production just over 6000 boe/d and our second half production was just over 6200 boe/d.This was in line with our second half guidance of 6000 to 6500.The 2014 program resulted in us drilling five Duvernay horizontal wells, that included four horizontal and one vertical, and a completion of six horizontal Duvernay wells.Four of those completed wells were brought on stream during last year with the remaining two on stream in early 2015.In the fall, we commenced an 11-well winter drilling program with a specific goal of retaining our most prospective Duvernay lands and through ongoing appraisals ultimately transitioning this land to resource value.We’ve achieved the first goal.We’ve now retained 95% of our core 200,000 acres at Kaybob into intermediate term.And that gives us considerable flexibility to control the pace of activity going forward.We continue to gain more confidence in the condensate rich window supported by our well results with industry activity and reserve bookings.This drilling program for the winter, we expect to have wrapped up by the end of next week.In light of the decline in commodity prices as Tom has mentioned, we’ve slowed the pace of development and we’ll defer the completion and tie-in of four of the Duvernay wells and one of the originally planned drilling locations to the second half of this year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The actual timing of these expenditures will depend on more favorable service cost environment and favorable pricing outlook, which has the intent to maximize our returns in that present values.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Assuming, we complete these wells in the second half of this year, we still expect to meet the previously announced exit guidance of 7000 to 8000 boe/d in the Light Oil division.</span>GLJ is our independent reserve evaluator, and they have increased our Light Oil reserve bookings to 50 million barrels, BOE’s.That's up 52% year-over-year and it represents a reserve replacement ratio of 7.6 times.Extended production data and adjacent industry activity has certainly supported positive revisions and new discoveries.I am now going to provide a bit of detail on the drilling program and some of the recent results.First of all at Kaybob West, we drilled a location at 8-34-62-20W5, and now we’re offsetting our original 2-34 well which remains a top producer in the play, and has cumulative production in excess of 400,000 BOE over the last two years.The goal of this well is to evaluate well spacing, pressure depletion, and productivity.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Over the first almost 30 days that well has averaged a restricted rate of 635 boe/d, which is about 53% liquids.</span>I want to provide a little bit more color between those two wells.First of all, after cleanup, the initial liquid yields are very comparable.They are about 250 barrels per million.The 2-34 well was originally produced harder in the first 30 days than we’re currently producing in the 8-34.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>8-34 is still producing with approximately 2800 psi flowing pressure.</span>So it has lots of pressure and it's very strong.The shutting casing pressure while flowing at the end of 30 days in both wells is very comparable.The 2-34 rates which is the original well are showing minimal impact by the 8-34 well being on stream.And that well is still flowing at 275 boe/d after over two years of production.So we’re seeing some communication, but it’s clear we’re producing new reserves, and these wells are not competing with each other for those reserves.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Our type curve assumptions, just to remind you assume restricted rates for the first several months of production, and that's exactly what we’re flowing at.</span>So we’re pleased with the results so far, and our objective here is to maximize the resource recovery in the well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Athabasca has also, as you know a material exposure to the northern volatile oil window.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We remain encouraged by our preliminary results, which are supporting our internal expectations of reservoir characteristics and initial productivity.</span>At Simonette, we drilled a well at 16-36-63-25W5 and we completed it last fall, and we placed that on production very recently following a planned soak period.Liquids are currently being trucked out of location and gas is being processed through a third-party facility.Our goal here is to establish an initial production rate to establish resource potential.And that well, we expect we’ll shut in over breakup due to regional road bends.Rates will be provided following the extended flow time.However our initial results so far are in line with what we’ve seen from offsetting industry wells.In Kaybob East, we drilled a well at 2-7-63-25W5.That well was drilled on-strike in orientation and has a 1600 meter horizontal lateral.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We plan to complete this well sometime during the second half of 2015.</span>So just a few comments on well costs.Well costs in the Duvernay are continuing to improve, as more wells are drilled into the play.Industry operators are moving down the learning curve with a focus on drilling lower costs remaining a priority for Athabasca.The transition for early-stage resource appraisal to development in some parts of the play is underway.Over 250 Duvernay wells have been drilled by industry at Kaybob.And Athabasca has drilled 19 wells itself including 15 horizontals.With the favorable Alberta Crown tenure system, initial development pace has been more measured than what you would see in other North American shale plays.Having said that, operators have applied learnings from those other shale plays and accessed the industry data through public sources.That certainly lead to advancement and development approach and improved productivity.We’re certain to see the efficiencies in drill times.And industry is seeing completion efficiencies gained in multi-well pad development.In the winter program, Athabasca released a number of wells that were in the 35-days drilling Spud-to-Rig release range.And we now have several wells that we’ve drilled, this is drill cost only below $6 million.The goal is to drive down cost here where the Duvernay will be competitive with breakeven costs and allow profitability even during future commodity price downturns.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe industry and Athabasca will demonstrate similar cost learning curves in the Duvernay that has been made in other shale plays in North America and has made them so successful.</span>I am now going to say, I just want to say a few words on the Montney.At Placid, we drilled, completed and tested two Montney wells offsetting recent industry success.The objective of this program was to demonstrate, both the quality and the extent of the resource that will be considered for future funding.The first well which was 8-20-60-23 was flow tested for ten days.And I know there’s a bit of data in the public domain, so we get asked questions.That well had a final, after a ten-day flow period had a final restricted 24-hour flow rate of 1540 boe/d, and a liquid yield of 358 bbl/mmcf.That well was recently brought on production to a third-party facility that was in early March.And we drilled the second well at 9-26-60-24W5.And that well was also tested with an extended flow test in early March.Our preference obviously is to talk about extended production rates, and we’ll provide these when they become available.Now I am going to move on to Thermal Oil.Hangingstone Project 1 is nearing completion.And the asset has now been handed over to our operations team from the construction team.In 2015, we see three key milestones as production ramps up.First, the steaming of these wells will begin on schedule by the end of this month.Second, circulation will be completed for all producing wells and converted to SAGD production by the end of the year.And third, the Enbridge dilbit pipeline will be tied in by December.Production is projected to start ramp up four to six months after first steam.And we now have a December average expected rate between 3000 and 6000 barrels of bitumen per day and that's consistent with what we’ve been saying for quite a while.Hangingstone is projected to reach its design capacity of 12,000 boe/d by November 2016.So we really look forward to provide an update on our Q1 results with steam in the ground.Achieving our targeted ramp up at Hangingstone is an important milestone for Athabasca.It will demonstrate the quality of the Hangingstone resource base, but also the company’s ability to build and operate these larger-scale projects.So that concludes my operations update.I’ll now pass the call over to Kim Anderson, who will present a summary of our financials and the budget.Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone.I am pleased to be able to share some of our 2014 financial highlights, and will also provide an update on our capital budget and liquidity outlook for 2015.Athabasca’s Light Oil netbacks for the year-ended December 31, 2014 was $79 million and compared to $75 million in 2013.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This represents a netback of approximately $35 on a per BOE basis.</span>In 2013, slightly lower year-over-year production volumes were more than offset by our higher liquids weightings, as the Duvernay became a more material component of our production base, and also by stronger commodity prices earlier in the year.2014 funds flow from operations was $13 million and compared to a loss of $4 million in the prior year.In 2014, we continued to invest in our core Duvernay and Hangingstone assets.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Capital expenditures totaled approximately $635 million or $548 million excluding capitalized G&A and interest.</span>Capital was primarily directed towards the construction of Hangingstone Project 1 and to ongoing appraisal activity in the Duvernay.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Approximately $39 million of our 2014 capital budget predominately related to drilling activities in the Duvernay has been shifted into 2015.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Athabasca’s balance sheet was transformed in late August with the closing of the Dover transaction for net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion.</span>These proceeds included $600 million of cash, and $584 million of promissory notes which are fully backstopped by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by HSBC.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At year end, the company had approximately $580 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and funding in place in excess of $1.3 billion.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>On March 2nd of this year, as expected we received a cash payment of $303 million on the maturity of the first promissory note, increasing our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment position to approximately $760 million.</span>The remaining two promissory notes which total $284 million are scheduled for payment in August of 2015 and 2016.Including the remaining promissory note and our undrawn credit facility, our current available funding position is in excess of $1.2 million.The company continues to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants associated with our revolving credit facility and term loans, and we hold a very comfortable margin above all of the minimum requirements.Given our strong funding position, our material, high-quality asset base and current capital and production outlook, we expect to remain compliant with all of our financial covenants throughout the balance of 2015.Note that we’ve no financial covenants associated with our senior secured second lien note.Additional details regarding our debt facilities have been outlined in our year-end financial statements and also in the AIF, which has now both being filed on SEDAR.Athabasca’s Board of Directors has approved a full-year 2015 capital budget of $305 million, which includes the initial budget of $266 million that we announced in December, plus a $39 million of carryover capital that I mentioned previously.One of the core objectives of our 2015 capital program is to maintain balance sheet strength, and to retain the flexibility to further adjust our program as needed throughout the balance of the year.Of the $305 million, $203 million is allocated to our Light Oil division, $96 million to Thermal, and the remaining $6 million to corporate capital.The capital program is expected to drive a 2015 corporate year end correction exit target of between 10,000 and 14,000 boe/d, of which 7000 to 8000 is expected to come from the Light Oil division, and the remaining 3000 to 6000 boe/d from the Thermal Oil division.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Our budget and production target are based on commodity price assumptions of US$50/bbl for WTI, $2.80 for AECO gas, and a foreign exchange rate of US$0.78 per Canadian dollar.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Based on the capital spending and production outlook, Athabasca anticipates exiting 2015 with funding in place of approximately $800 million.</span>Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a top priority for us.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With our strong funding position and capital program flexibility, we believe we’re extremely well positioned to weather the current commodity price cycle, while at the same time advancing on our core objectives in both the Duvernay and at Hangingstone.</span>Thank you, Kim.We’re confident in Athabasca’s ability to leverage its asset base and grow shareholder value through strong execution and exceptional delivery.The company has begun the transition to being a producer that has focused on delivering strong production and cash flow growth, while at the same time preserving a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.We remain committed to delivering on our commitments through 2015, which will see Athabasca transition the Duvernay from land to resource value, begin steaming Hangingstone 1 in late March, and drive an exit target between 10,000 and 14,000 boe/d.I’d just like to apologize for the background noise that you heard during my introductory remarks.I think somebody on the call had left their line open, so we apologize for that.But we’re now ready to take questions.Thank you.Just a couple of questions for you, Tom and then I’ve a couple for Rob.Tom, in the past I know we’ve talked about G&A and the corporate structure.But you know in the fourth quarter, we saw G&A increase a little bit.That was cited, I think it was cited as a cause of corporate restructuring, you know obviously that is the consideration.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But maybe you can give us some color on exactly what means.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And if you are comfortable maybe help us understand when you would expect to start to see those G&A numbers come down and maybe by how much?</span>Yeah, thanks Mark.You know, our cost structure is something that's very important for us to get lined up with the business strategy and the plan going forward.And our review of our cost structure going back to last fall, when I stepped in, showed us that if we tore apart the businesses and you know this organization that we needed to work very hard on getting our cost structure lined up to be more competitive.In November, we restructured and downsized about 50 people, and so those costs were absorbed in the fourth quarter which you are referring to.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Our goal is, we need to get our corporate G&A down by probably 25% or more from where we’re today.</span>And so you know we’re looking at how we streamline the organization, and how we manage our cost, and you know we’ll be providing the market an update on that in the very near term, Mark in terms of the advances we’ve made on achieving some of those objectives.So I’d like to leave it at that, but I think that you’ll be very pleased to see some of the things that we’ve done on that regard.One more question about Hangingstone, in the press release, that was talking about cost being within 5% of the sanctioned budget.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Is that just a generic kind of statement or is that sort of alluding to you know maybe a $30 million to $40 million cost pressure?</span>Hi Mark, it’s Rob here.So Hangingstone, I mean we’ve talked about our sanctioned cost being $708 million for quite a while now.And that includes both the base facility, the actual Hangingstone 1 project, but it also includes the regional infrastructure that we built, including an assurance pass.And, so I mean that project is largely complete, we’re moving to steaming.We’re within 5% of that, so we’re not inferring the cost pressure, but we’re very pleased with the performance of within 5% of our oil sands project originally sanctioned for $708 million, that's pretty rate in today’s world.So we’re just finalizing where the costs are going to land.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We’ll probably have a more fulsome update at the end of Q1.</span>And I guess, we’ll just leave it at that.Okay, thanks Rob.A couple of more questions for you.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I wonder if you could, you made some comments about the reserve additions in the Light Oil division.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But I wondered if maybe you could maybe detail the source of some of those reserve additions, maybe a little bit more clearly between you know how many were, you know how many barrels were from you know actual Athabasca wells, their Athabasca offsets or industry offsets for that matter?</span>Yeah, sure.I mean, I don’t have all the details of that Mark, on my fingertips here right now.But certainly both were contributing factors.I mean as you know, we’ve land base that covers all the Thermal maturity windows across the basin and the Kaybob region.So there’s quite a bit of industry activity offsetting us.But honestly Mark, our reserves growth from our own activity was very strong.And so the wells that we drilled were precisely what we expected.They first held land and then they were proving resource value.And where industry is drilling directly offsets a lot of our acreage, so that also benefited us.But you know I’ll be happy to take it offline.We can have a discussion on reserves specifically, but we had strong growth from both.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am trying to get an understanding, a better understanding of the new 8-34 well, and maybe how that compares to the 2-34?</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then you made some comments about that and maybe [indiscernible] rate is not the best way to go.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can you maybe give us maybe some other comparables like what you would do, and you know how pressure is compared or maybe what you would expect in terms of EUR’s across both wells?</span>Sure, so I mean I gave quite a bit of detail when I described it.So our attempt there, when we drilled that well is we’ve an original well that has produced for over two years and produced a pretty large cumulative amount.And our goal was to go in and basically twin that location at a 400 meter spacing, and what the result is and we’re very confident in the rock quality that we would see.And the question was a little more on spacing.And what we saw there, and the original well by the way it’s in our IR pack, it has a EUR of just about a 1000 in BOE.And so, we drilled a second well.You know Mark, we’ve talked lots about, we’re managing our pressure as we produce these.We think it’s important that you don’t draw them down as hard as you can right off the bat to maximize your reserve life.And so we did that on the 8-34.In fact we held it back even more than we did on the original 2-34.And so we’re seeing a strong flowing pressure.I think there is some connection between the two wells.But honestly, it hasn't impacted our rates in a material way at 2-34, so we’re not seeing an immediate interference effect.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And with the reservoir here, we strongly believe we’re accessing the reserves.</span>So time will tell of course in the production rates, and you can see a lot of offset operators are certainly going at this spacing and actually testing spacing that's even tighter than this.And all with the objective of maximizing the resource recovery, and getting economic wells.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And so we’re very pleased with what we saw here and it just gives us further confidence in what we’re assuming for spacing.</span>Yeah, no.It’s pretty early to say.I mean volumetrically, I think the reserves are there.I think the production is what's going to prove it out, Mark.Well, that's -- it’s really, I mean we’re not working towards deferring those four completions that we talked about into some time in the second half.And we’re not going to give a finite date on that because we really want to see what the cost structure looks like.And you know what the price environment is like.There are a couple of wells.I mentioned the 16-36 well that we just recently brought on stream.We really would like to talk to you guys about IP30’s, IP60’s, IP90’s if we can.So you know when we’ve a good rate, we’ll talk about it.Unfortunately that one is going to get shut in over break up, just because of road bends and stuff.We drilled and completed a well at 15-15 in Saxon area and that was in our press release.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That well is completed, it’s on a soak period right now, and so we’ll bring that one on stream sometime after breakup.</span>And so that's another one that we’ll be talking about.So those are kind of what to look for, and then stay tuned for when we make a decision on completion of the rest of the wells.[Operator Instructions].This concludes the Analyst Q&A Session of today’s call.We’ll now take questions from members of the media.[Operator Instructions].You’ve a question from Dan Healing of Calgary Herald.Your line is open.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the G&A, I think you mentioned on the call that 50 positions were eliminated in November.</span>But Tom, you were saying that you want to reduce it by another 25%.How do you see doing that?And is that going to have an effect on employees in Calgary, and the [indiscernible]?Yeah, Dan, you know obviously when I looked at our cost structure, and we looked at our cost structures of the management team last year, in the context of the focused business plan that Athabasca needed to undertake and refocus our activities where we see the most growth, that's Hangingstone and the Duvernay project.We looked at our cost structure and said, we’re -- there’s a mismatch in terms of the resources that we’ve in not only people, but you know technical, software platforms, and office-based needs and the likes.And so we looked at that and said, we need to refocus our cost structure to be more competitive in the context of how we see ourselves building out this company going forward, and where we’re going to spend our capital.So that's been an ongoing process, and you know I would tell you that you know a part of that is the human side of it, and that's always a difficult thing to do.But there’s also other things that come into that analysis in terms of you know, we carry a lot of sub-leased space from some of the things that we -- where the company grew and we’ve had to transition the company.So we got to move that into the market and we carry -- we look at our other cost rate from what we spend on office supplies through telephones, through everything.We’re looking at everything in this organization to make sure we’re properly aligned.And any reductions that we do is not driven by the current economic environment.Our reductions are to become more competitive in terms of where our business plan is going forward.So no, we’re not responding to the current economic environment.It’s about being competitive, so Dan I’d like to leave it at that.And you know please stay tuned and we’ll inform you more in the terms of some of the progress we’ve made here in the near term.Thanks, operator and thanks everyone for joining our year-end conference call.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We look forward to providing an
