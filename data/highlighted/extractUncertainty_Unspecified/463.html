(NASDAQ:PCLN) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ETF Hub PCLN's offering of debt twice in the last two weeks suggests it is planning a big move.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some have suggested PCLN is raising debt to fund $3 billion acquisition, but with $8 billion in cash, there would be no need.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Instead, PCLN might be planning a strategic acquisition to grow its business.</span>Just two weeks after announcing a debt offering, Priceline Group (NASDAQ: PCLN ) is offering yet more Senior Notes (dollar instead of euro).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While the proceeds from this debt is unknown, it is quite unusual for a company of any size to enter two public offerings this quickly, especially one with $8 billion in cash & equivalents and that has over $2.75 billion of annual free cash flow.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Granted, interest rates are low, but the fact that Priceline is aggressively raising capital suggests it's up to something big, much larger than financing a $3 billion buyback program that can be paid using its cash-on-hand.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That's why I think Priceline is preparing to make a rather large acquisition, possibly Yelp (NYSE: YELP ).</span>Reviews have become a cornerstone of the consumer experience; as they tell consumers what to expect when dining, shopping or traveling.That's why Priceline has worked so hard to build its "guest reviews" over the last few years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, the importance of reviews is not the only reason why Priceline might have interest in a leading review site like Yelp.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For quite some time investors have speculated that Priceline is interested in entering new industries such as restaurant, event, and attraction bookings.</span>This theory was further supported when Priceline bought OpenTable last year.Therefore, Priceline already has the technology to book in industries outside of travel, thereby making the travel experience that much more enjoyable for its customers once fully implemented.What Priceline still lacks are thorough reviews for restaurants, events, attractions, etc., which is where Yelp comes into play.With Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) entering the travel space, and starting to gain momentum in North America, gaining a large collection of reviews across many industries has never been so important.Not only did Google gain this when it acquired Zagat several years back, but Google Maps and its social media assets have made it increasingly convenient for consumers to "check-in" at various places, and also write a review on just about anything in the world that has a physical address.Therefore, if Priceline were to acquire Yelp, it would not only strengthen its ex-travel bookings business, but also compete with the likes of Google and Facebook that seemingly have reviews on just about everything these days.That said, if Priceline were to consider an acquisition of Yelp, there has never been a better time to do so.The stock is trading at 18-month lows with a market capitalization of just $3.4 billion.While that represents a price/sales ratio of 9.0, investors must remember that Yelp is now a profitable business, and despite its stock loss it's still expected to grow revenue 53% this year and 35% in 2016.As a result, Yelp would give Priceline a fast-growing business, a new revenue channel and all of the noted perks at a price that hasn't been seen in quite some time.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All things considered, it is possible that my "buy Yelp" chant will never happen, but even if not, I do think that Priceline's activity suggests it is planning something big.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In my opinion, reviews make sense, as Priceline already has a leading market presence in international markets, but where it could perform better is in the U.S. Yelp could help the company do just that, and as an investor, I for one would be happy to see it become a reality.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Source: Priceline Might Be Planning A Big Acquisition, Possibly Yelp!</span>Disclosure: The author is long PCLN.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
