(NYSE:C) | Seeking Alpha After the CCAR results are revealed this week we may see Citi itself step in and buy quite a bit of its shares.</span>The company is looking to increase revenues through a digital marketing deal with Zillow and increasing foreign exchange trading fees.Dan Loeb recently initiated a stake in the company during the fourth quarter indicating that there is lots of value in the name right now.So in order for a stock to appreciate in value you have to have a lot of buyers bidding up the price of the stock, right?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With respect to Citi (NYSE: C ) it seems as if there are lots of buyers of the stock right now, but only at the small investor level.</span>The biggest investor of all isn't buying shares, yet.That biggest investor I'm referring to is Citi itself.But with the passing stress test results out of the way and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review due next week it will only be a matter of time before Citi begins to buy back their own shares.With the last article I wrote about the company , I stated, "I remain long the name in my Portfolio of Thirty but won't be buying any shares unless they drop to around $51."The stock remains above my purchase price target and has actually increased 2.24% since that time versus the 2.08% drop in the S&P 500.With that said, I'm going to take a look at the stock right now and see what has happened recently.Aside from Citi itself potentially stepping in to buy its own stock, Dan Loeb has recently added a stake in the company.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>During the fourth quarter of 2014 Loeb's Third Point added approximately 25 million shares.</span>Although, if the shares were added right at the beginning of the fourth quarter Third Point would be flat on the position currently.In fact, the entire fourth quarter Citi's stock remained strong and didn't really offer a great buying opportunity.It wasn't until the back end of January did a great entry point manifest itself in the stock.The bank has come to an agreement with Zillow (NASDAQ: Z ) to be able to have more presence on the web-based real estate company's website.This digital marketing presence should drive home buyers and sellers to psychologically want to use Citi for all their mortgage needs.I however question whether right now is the time for Citi to be doing this deal.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe housing prices are pretty high right now and with interest rate increases on the horizon we should see an inverse effect on home prices.</span>This just makes me fear the worst with respect to future defaults by future home owners again.In other income generating news, the company recently increased its foreign exchange trading fees as high as 25%.This news comes on the heels of the company losing some $150 million on the Swiss Franc move back in January.One has to imagine that the fee increase is in response to the loss.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The bank says that the increase is due to the increased volatility in the currency markets but Citi's prime brokerage clients can definitely afford to have the fees passed on to them.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>From a cost accounting perspective I like the move because the company essentially has to maintain their clients' accounts more frequently now due to the volatility.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Fundamentally I believe the stock is inexpensive on forward earnings estimates but it has a low earnings growth rate in the near-term.</span>From a financial perspective the company has quite a bit of debt compared to equity as all banks do but the financial efficiency ratios are adequate and the dividend is well supported by earnings.The company has been on a tear since late January but I'm not stepping in to buy any shares right now unless they drop below $51.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework.Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!Source: Citi's Biggest Investor Should Be Buying Shares Shortly Disclosure: The author is long C.
