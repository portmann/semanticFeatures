Cramer's Mad Money (3/3/15) | Seeking Alpha Mar.4, 2015  7:32 AM ET �|� Includes: BABA , BBY , DIN , GM , HPQ , KRFT , LL , OCN , PRGO , RAD , TRUE , VSTO , WFC by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Tuesday, March 3.With the decline in averages on Tuesday, Cramer thinks that the market has moved from being rosy to skeptical.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He discussed his six worries, that could be a disaster for the market.</span>The first was retail and restaurants which have been rallying recently due to lower oil prices.Cramer wonders what will happen if people stop going out to eat.He is seeing a little slowdown in restaurants recently.Car sales are another worry for Cramer.Besides General Motors (NYSE: GM ), there was nothing exciting.Since Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) has moved away from the sub-prime market, Cramer thinks there will not be enough financing available for buyers of new cars.Thirdly, it's housing which has been coming down slowly in February.Cramer is worried about the ripple effects housing and autos will have on the economy.Tablets and computers are another cause for worry.As Best-Buy (NYSE: BBY ) stated that tablets have suffered a material decline, and bad numbers from Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) last week, Cramer is worried about everything wrong with the PC world.Fifth worry is China.Macau casinos are down 49% Y/Y and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) is below its IPO price.Cramer is worried that China is no longer contributing to global growth.Last worry is oil.As most people want oil to stabilize, Cramer wants oil to go down.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"We have seen a host of equity deals that show me the oil and gas companies aren't nearly as troubled as many thought, but we do want to see gasoline at $2 a gallon nationwide, or we lose a key prop to the nascent recovery," said Cramer.</span>CEO interview - DineEquity (NYSE: DIN ) With restaurants stocks rallying higher, Cramer talked about DineEquity, which according to him has a good entry point for investors due to its recent pullback.The company reported an earnings beat recently, along with higher than expected same-store sales.It also has a 3.2% yield, and Cramer thinks investors should buy the stock.To find out more about the prospects of the company, he interviewed Chairman and CEO Julia Stewart.Stewart talked about the company's charity event on International Pancake Day and how they have been raising money.She mentioned about the company's capital allocation strategy, dividends, stock buybacks and potential acquisition."We have an opportunity I think to take the company to a whole new level.That's what you do with two great number one brands.If you think about it, we are in the business of long-term brand building," said Stewart.She mentioned that the company is looking for more growth internationally.Cramer was shocked to see Perrigo rally more than $3 without any news on the stock.The company had missed earnings recently.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer tried to figure out what could have driven the money in Perrigo suddenly.</span>It is Chinese vitamin supplements, said Cramer.He spoke about CEO Joe Papa, who said on the conference call that there are products coming from China into the U.S. that are not properly labelled.Cramer is concerned as the history of Chinese products is scary, especially after the Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL ) Chinese product fiasco.Cramer thinks that Perrigo will go much higher as all its products are made in America."After the downfall of Lumber Liquidators in the last couple of days, all I can say is good luck to anyone who's trying to obscure the origin of vitamins made in China," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer took a look at the technical charts of the CBOE Volatility Index - VIX, with the help of technician Mark Sebastian.</span>VIX is also known as the fear gauge because it measures the overall fear in the stock market.Sebastian mentioned that VIX rose on Tuesday, which is ahead of the Fed meeting.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He is worried that the market could be volatile for the next two weeks before the Fed meeting.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Looking at the last three years, most volatile periods have been before the Fed meeting, especially when there is a press conference.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sometimes VIX goes higher even when there is not a selloff in the market.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sebastian is worried that if the Fed raises rates, things might not go back to normal.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"When that happens, we could get the same freakout going into the meeting, but afterward things might not go back to normal," said Cramer.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While Sebastian is bullish on long-term prospects of the market, he cautions that there may be more volatile days like Tuesday again.</span>CEO interview - TrueCar (NASDAQ: TRUE ) Cramer talked about the 7% decline in TrueCar because of the negative article posted on Seeking Alpha.The company posted disappointing numbers recently with declines in revenue and visitors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To seek more clarification, he interviewed Chairman and CEO Scott Painter.</span>Painter said TrueCar works like a tech stock where Q/Q growth matters more than Y/Y just like a tech stock."TrueCar as a company grew 53% year over year, and our TrueCar branded channel had 125% growth.So I wouldn't say that we are declining in any way," said Painter.He mentioned that the company makes money when people buy a car, so he is not worried too much about monetization from viewership.Kraft Foods (NASDAQ: KRFT ): "The stock has a good yield, but I don't want to own the stock of a company whose products I don't want to eat."Vista Outdoor (NYSE: VSTO ): Cramer is not a fan.Ocwen Financial (NYSE: OCN ): "I don't like the business.I am a Wells Fargo fan."Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ): Cramer said the acquisition is going to be huge for the company.He wants investors to buy the stock.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.</span>Start your FREE 14-day trial now!We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
