Ozer-Armon, the company's Chief Executive Officer.Please go ahead.Thank you, Anan.Good morning to everyone and welcome to Lumenis' fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call.On today’s call, I will discuss the highlights of the quarter and summarize the performance in our three business segments and four geographic regions.Then, I'll turn the call over to Ophir, our CFO, who will walk us through a detailed review of our financial performance and discuss our 2015 guidance.I will then provide a prospective on our 2015 priorities and growth objectives.The fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2014.During the year, we put the business on the right track by focusing on growth, innovation, execution and bottom line.Not only did this generate strong results in 2014, but it has positioned us as well as we enter 2015 and beyond.In the fourth quarter, we grew 8.6% on a reported basis or 11.6% on a constant currency basis.This represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and represented our strongest quarter of growth rate in the year.For the full year of 2014, we grew 9.4% or 10.6% on a constant currency basis achieving revenues of $289.7 million above the high end of our guidance range of $285 million to $287 million.While we are primarily focusing on driving growth, we are also focused on profitability.Our disciplined execution allow us to generate 23.3% in adjusted EBITDA in Q4.Business segments review, we turn now to them.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Each of our three major business segments posted growth on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter with our two largest segments, aesthetic and surgical, growing 19% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year with our ophthalmic segment totaling nearly 5% growth in the period.</span>Growth has been significantly driven by contribution from products we have launched since the second quarter of 2013.The first quarter’s launch under this new management team, together these products represent more than 18% of the total company product revenue in the fourth quarter.The growth in contribution from new products represented the clearest indication of our expected product development process and it validates our ability to drive our top line growth by bringing new and innovative products to market in each of our three business segments.Our surgical business grew 9% on a constant currency basis in Q4 where it was driven mainly by the strong sales in our urology business, which benefited from the positive early response to our new holmium laser products, the Pulse 120H.The Pulse 120H is the most powerful and versatile holmium laser surgery solution in the urology market and we are progressing in our plan to get the system in the hands of the leading surgeons in the U.S. and Europe.The systems enable surgeons to perform Enucleation or Vaporization of the prostate, Stone Dusting and PCNL procedure all with one device.In BPH, we are targeting two main procedures; HoLEP and Vaporization.HoLEP is the best procedure to treat BPH condition with the lowest reoperation rate.Our Pulse 120H holmium laser is by far the best technology on the market as it provides significant improvement in the hemostasis while reducing the Enucleation time.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The adoption of the HoLEP is highly dependent on physician being educated on how to perform the procedure.</span>As such, we continue to invest in training programs mainly in the U.S. and in Europe to increase the adoption of our systems.We’ve hosted four training courses in Q4 and the total of 21 training courses globally in 2014 in which we’ve trained more than 650 physicians.Despite the fact that HoLEP is a superior procedure to treat BPH, the more commonly performed invasive procedure in the U.S. is the GreenLight laser with more than 60,000 estimated procedures performed annually.The Pulse 120H together with our new Xpeeda fiber is able to perform this Vaporization procedure with several key advantages versus the GreenLight.These were highlighted in the recent limited marketing and evaluation in the U.S. where five surgeons performed 32 cases and provided extensive feedback on the post performance.The results show that the Vaporization rate is as good or better than the GreenLight while the Pulse’s visibility and coagulation are notably superior.Based on these promising results, we are looking forward to promoting this procedure performed with our Xpeeda fiber in the U.S. to our distribution partnership with Boston Scientific.The versatile Pulse 120H is also used to perform stone management and PCNL.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Stone management is a very large treatment market representing approximately 300,000 minimally invasive procedures in the U.S. alone.</span>The Pulse 120H has superior technological capability including the 80-hertz repetition rate that enables a physician to perform Stone Dusting more efficiently.We’re now starting marketing clinical trial with our new SlimLine fiber to demonstrate the superiority of the combination of the platform and the fiber together.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the PCNL arena, which represents approximately 74,000 procedures in the U.S. alone, we’re planning to launch a reusable suction handpiece by the end of 2015.</span>This product will be launch in conjunction with the limited marketing and evaluation data detailing the product clinical benefits.This procedure will also help us to drive our consumable sales.We’re encouraged by the early markets response to the Pulse 120H and we look forward to increasing our penetration of Enucleation or Vaporization procedure as well as stone management and PCNL.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Our surgical business also continued to benefit from the ongoing penetration in the ENT microsurgery market with our differentiated CO2 platform and specifically the AcuPulse DUO, which launched in the second half of 2013.</span>The DUO is a CO2 system that enables clinicians to use either an articulated arm to [indiscernible] fibers for treating areas that are difficult to reach.Introducing the fiber best [ph] DUO system has broaden our reach beyond the traditional CO2 market of ENT and into the gynecological market where farther usage is more common.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In gynecology, our unique glass fiber allow us to treat a variety of conditions including endometriosis, which affects more than 170 million women across the globe.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe that this represents a significant market opportunity for us and have begun discussing the concept with KOLs at a recent AAGL conference in Vancouver that happened this quarter.</span>Turning to aesthetics.Our 19% growth in constant currency was driven by strong performance in both skin rejuvenation and hair removal.In skin rejuvenation, the M22 multi-application system continues to gain traction in the marketplace.The platform has showed significant growth driven by the continuous upgrade and additional applications that we put on the system.Last year, we introduced a 755-nanometer wavelength on the system and we just recently received FDA clearance in January for our solution to treat active acne providing a flexible wavelength solution, which we intend to launch in the second quarter of 2015.Physician knows that when they buy the M22 platform, there will be an ongoing price like [ph] innovation to upgrade the system and increase utilization of their machines by offering more treatment to their patients.An example is ResurFX model that was launched in late 2013 affecting 65-nanometer non-ablative skin resurfacing solution that delivers a true fractional treatment.ResurFX uses a fiber laser with patented CoolScan technology for superior quality and accuracy to improve patient outcome.In the fourth quarter, more than a quarter of the M22 were sold with this innovative solution, which meaningfully increased our ASP.Initially, when the ResurFX product was launched, the main marketing service was of skin resurfacing.As times go by, we see physician in EMEA exploiting the unique capability of this technology to treat acne scars as well as stretch marks with great results.In the coming weeks, we expect the first peer reviewed article on the treatment of stretch marks with our therapy to be published in the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy.Our hair removal product line, LightSheer, which is the gold standard in the industry, has continued to demonstrate strong growth in Q4.The LightSheer DESIRE, our recently launched portable platform was the major contributor to the growth of the hair removal category this quarter.Finally, our ophthalmic segment posted 5% growth in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter, an improvement compared to the first nine months of 2014.This business is challenged by our high product cost of manufacturing and we’re focused on creating the right infrastructure to support long-term profitable growth going forward.As of October 2014, we completed the consolidation of the manufacturing operation from two sites into one in Salt Lake City.Also, we’re starting to see positive results from the move of the R&D team from Salt Lake City to Israel where the rest of our global R&D team is located.We’re making good progress on the development of products with improved cost structure and feature.Turning to a review of our fourth quarter results by region.Revenue growth this quarter was driven by a continued strength in APAC and EMEA regions and we saw notable growth from the Americas in Q4.Revenues in Japan declined in the fourth quarter.Our largest region, APAC, which represents close to 35% of the total company sales reported 21% growth year-over-year in constant currency terms and surpassed the $100 million mark in sales for the full year of 2014.We continue to execute on our strategy for expanding our direct and indirect distribution in the region and our investment in additional speak on the street [ph] their primary driver of revenue growth this year.We saw strong performance in China due to the continued expansion of our sales and service team and we’ve also seen continued growth in other countries in which we deploy a direct selling model, particularly in countries like Australia, New Zealand and South Korea where we have transitioned to a direct model from a distributor’s model previously.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sales in EMEA region increased 26% in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter representing approximately 23% of the total company sales in the period.</span>We saw broad based growth in the region with contribution widely spread across most countries and business communities.The EMEA region is characterized by early adopters and our results in the fourth quarter and the year reflect the enthusiastic response we have seen for our innovative new aesthetics and surgical products.In the Americas, we reported 7% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the strongest performance for this region in 2014.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sales represented roughly 33% of the total company sales in the period.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe that our effort to transition the Americas business are beginning to bear fruit.</span>We have new leadership in the region, our sales force is refocused and together with the new product introduction, we’re seeing improved sales results.Finally, sales in Japan declined 19% in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We’re working through continued challenges in the region including an extremely difficult exchange rate environment where the yen has weakened by approximately 40% in the last two years.</span>This has resulted in intense competitive pricing pressure from local manufacturers and we have elected to be more selective in the deals that we pursue in this market.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In summary, our strong fourth quarter performance captured what we believe was a great year and an important year for the company.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We surpassed many of our operating milestones and financial goals, and we reported total revenue of nearly $290 million this year, representing growth of close to 11% year-over-year in constant currency terms.</span>Our two biggest business segments posted growth in 2014 and all of our four regions posted revenue growth on a constant currency basis this year.Importantly, we’ll deliver against our goal of launching one to two new products platform in each of our segments this year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Finally, we have reintroduced our company to the public equity market in several – without IPO, which allows us to raise nearly $69 million to fund our strategic growth initiatives.</span>Before turning the call to Ophir, I would like to highlight that I have made a mistake at the beginning and said EBITDA margins and not EBITDA growth as a percentage.I would like now to turn over the call to Ophir for a detailed review of our financial results in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2014 period as well as our fiscal year 2015 financial guidance.Ophir?Thank you, Tzipi.We have provided the detailed summary in our earnings release of our revenue results by segment and by geography for the fourth quarter and 12 months period ending December 31.This summary includes our revenue growth performance on both a reported basis and in constant currency terms.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As you know, foreign exchange rates were very volatile during the fourth quarter and the euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and other currencies continued to weaken against the dollar.</span>To best represent the underlying fundamentals in our segments and regions, my commentary today will also address our constant currency performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2014 period.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 increased 8.6% on a GAAP basis to $77.2 million and increased 11.6% on a constant currency basis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Approximately 30% of our revenue in the fourth quarter came from recurring revenue sources, services, consumable, disposable and rentals.</span>Gross profit margin declined 82 basis points to 52.8% and was up 30 basis points sequentially.Gross margin was impacted primarily by less favorable product mix that favors new product with lower gross margin earlier in their life cycle, geographic mix, foreign currency translation impact and competitive pricing dynamics.Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased $1.6 million or 5% to $34.1 million or 44.2% of revenue this year compared to 35.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.The additional increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by increased SG&A expenses offset partially by lower R&D expenses compared to last year.Fourth quarter 2014 GAAP operating income increased $1.1 million or 17.3% to $7.4 million.Fourth quarter 2014 GAAP operating margin was 9.6% compared to 8.9% last year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>GAAP operating expenses includes stock-based compensation expense of approximately $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.</span>Excluding these expenses, non-GAAP operating margin increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%.Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 million or 23.3% to $9.7 million representing 12.6% of total sales.GAAP net income was $6.8 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $4.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share last year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Note our GAAP net income results in the fourth quarter of 2014 included an income tax benefit of approximately $0.3 million mainly resulting from year-end true-up adjustments.</span>Non-GAAP net income increased by $1.6 million to $7.1 million reflecting 29.4% growth.Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2014 based on 36.1 million diluted shares outstanding.Turning to the summary of our financial results for the full year fiscal 2014.For the year, our results came in above the high end of our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income and EPS.Total revenue was $289.7 million, up 10.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.4 million or 24.7% to $32.4 million.Non-GAAP net income increased $5 million or 33.8% to $19.9 million or $0.57 per diluted share.Cash and cash equivalents were $105.6 million as of December 31, 2014 compared to $42.8 million as of December 31, 2013.The increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the net proceeds related to our IPO, share of options proceeds in addition to $15 million cash flow generated from ongoing business activities.Those were partially offset by cash payments to Bank Hapoalim of $15 million related to annual loan repayment and $6 million related to the completion of the IPO and achievement of a profitability milestone as well as to additional IPO-related payments of $1.2 million.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Our balance sheet is strong with net cash of $57 million or roughly $1.06 per share and we continue to generate cash from operations sufficient to fund our strategic growth objectives.</span>Turning to a discussion of our financial guidance for 2015, which we introduced in our earnings press release this morning.Revenue; for the full year 2015 period, we expect revenue in the range of $305 million to $310 million representing an increase of 5.3% to 7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Assuming current exchange rates, we estimate that foreign currency translation impact on our total reported sales results to be approximately $11 million.</span>Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our revenues are expected to increase 9.5% to 11.3% year-over-year.We expect our surgical business to grow in the mid-single digit on a reported basis and in the high-single digit in constant currency.We expect our aesthetic business to grow in the high-single digit on a reported basis and in the low-double digit in constant currency.We expect our ophthalmic business to grow in the low-single digit on a reported basis and in the mid-single digit in constant currency.In terms of regional growth, we expect mid-teens growth in APAC on reported and constant currency basis.We expect low single-digit growth in EMEA on a reported basis and low-double digit growth in constant currency.We expect mid-single digit growth in the Americas.Finally, we expect high-single digit decline in Japan on a reported basis and low-single digit growth in constant currency.We do expect total company revenue growth rate to be stronger in the second half of fiscal 2015 compared to the first half.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We expect gross margin to remain flat in fiscal 2015 as we expect pressure from foreign currency translation assuming exchange rates are similar to current levels throughout 2016.</span>Importantly, we expect to offset this headwind through a combination of lower production cost and scale efficiencies.We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $35 million to $37 million representing a growth of 7.9 to 14.21 year-over-year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Assuming current exchange rates, we estimate that foreign currency translation impact on our adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $5 million.</span>Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 28.6% to 36% year-over-year.Finally, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.66 per share representing growth of 9.1% to 16.1% year-over-year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Note that our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes tax rate of approximately 13% in stable currency environment and an average of approximately 36.6 million shares.</span>Thank you, Ophir.I would now like to discuss how we will drive our growth and our key operating priorities by business units and by regions.One of the things that is most compelling about Lumenis is the diversity of our business unit and geographic regions and the number of ways that we can generate sustainable growth across our global business.As we think about our growth, there are five overriding themes we are focused on; enhancing our core business by improving our product competitiveness in the respected markets; driving product adoption by building compelling clinical data and expanding physician training; expanding our technology into adjacent treatment markets; growing the recurring disposable area of our business and expanding our distribution footprint and focus on promoting the clinical value of our superior technologies and products.It is important to understand the lagging contribution from new products to our total company revenue growth, particularly in the surgical and aesthetic business units.For example, much of our product growth in 2015 has been driven by the ramp up in adoption of products that were introduced in 2014.Importantly, while the new products introduced in 2015 will contribute modestly to the revenue in the second half of 2015, we expect the significant contribution from these products to adhere in 2016.Let me summarize the drivers of growth in our business units and our regions, starting with business units.In the surgical business, growth will primarily be driven by increasing the adoption of the new products launched in 2013 and 2014, specifically the Pulse 120H and the recently launched fiber Xpeeda and SlimLine.Successful adoption and growth of the installed base of the Pulse 120H will allow us to increase fiber usage and drive recurring revenue growth.Following the success of the limited marketing and evaluation, we will be developing additional clinical data that will support the Pulse 120H and we will continue to focus on getting this compelling technology in the hands of leading surgeons in the U.S. and Europe and on hosting clinical education training seminars to expand the awareness and adoption of the HoLEP procedure.In parallel, we will continue to invest in the clinical data to support a PCNL procedure on the Pulse 120H platform and gynecological procedure including endometriosis on our CO2 platform.Both will build the foundation for increased consumable adoption in 2016.In the aesthetic business, we benefit from participating in an attractive skin rejuvenation and hair removal treatment market, which together represent over $900 million market opportunity that is growing in the high-single digits.We have upgraded our product offering in these markets to improve our competitive position.We expect to drive continued growth in the aesthetics this year through the continued adoption of our skin rejuvenation and hair removal product offering, the M22, ResurFX and the LightSheer family of products amongst others.As part of our ongoing effort to build foundation for future growth, we plan on launching new products this year that are expected to begin contributing to revenue towards the end of 2015.These include products that further penetrate existing treatment markets and products that will address new adjacent markets.In January at the IMCAS in Paris, we introduced the stand-alone ResurFX, which will allow physicians to perform industry-leading skin resurfacing without purchasing the full multi-application M22 platform.The commercial launch of this product will occur in the second half of 2015.While improving our competiveness in the traditional market of skin and hair, we’re looking to enter an adjacent market leveraging our existing CO2 technology.We are now in the process of developing an innovative handpiece for vaginal laser rejuvenation or VLR.We plan to introduce this year an offering on the AcuPulse platform to treat related conditions such as vaginal atrophy and tightening and stress urinary incontinence.This product addresses a market of over 30 million postmenopausal women in the U.S. alone.The product will enter clinical testing in the second half of 2015 with the goal of launching in EMEA by the end of the year.Finally, our ophthalmic business will grow in line with the market growth as we seek to build the foundation of this business in 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe there is a significant potential in the area of sub-threshold therapy for the various retinal conditions with growing prevalence.</span>We are currently in the process of developing such solution and we are looking to introduce it by the end of 2015.There is a growing expectance in the markets for using reduced dermal [ph] and selective laser treatment in many ophthalmic indications.Turning to a brief review of our growth strategy by geographic regions.In APAC, growth will be driven by investment in our distribution footprint this year, particularly as we continue to increase our coverage into second tier cities and hospitals in China and across APAC in general.More broadly, we’re looking – the ramp up of some newly commercialized products in China, which we received registration in late 2014 specifically the AcuPulse DUO, the ResurFX and the Array LaserLink.In EMEA, growth will be driven by continued penetration of the new aesthetic and surgical products that were launched in 2014 and new product introduction in the second half of 2015 that will contribute to growth given the more rapid adoption cycle in EMEA.In the Americas, growth will be driving by continued progress following the significant investments in the leadership organization and selling infrastructure in 2014, investing and building separate sales force to focus on ophthalmic segments, which will allow the medical team to benefit from greater focus on the surgical market and finally, Americas will benefit from continuous penetration of our recently commercialized product in 2014.In Japan, we expect to face the challenging competitive environment resulting from the exchange rate headwinds.As I noted earlier, since our ability to compete with local market pricing has been impacted dramatically by the exchange rates, we expect to be more selective in the deals that we will pursue.In conclusion, 2014 was an important year for the company.Our fourth quarter performance was a strong end to a great year overall.We expect to continue growing in 2015 as we leverage the investment in new product innovation and our distribution infrastructure, which we have made in 2014.The organization is focused on executing our strategic plan and we look forward to continued success going forward.Before opening to questions, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lumenis employees and management around the world for working diligently to achieve our success.I would also like to thank you, our investors, for your support and confidence in Lumenis.Thank you.Good afternoon to everybody.I wanted to start with the Americas.If I look at that, obviously a good quarter here, but you had a good quarter in Q1 of 2014 and saw two very weak quarters in the second and third.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So as you think about 2015, can you maybe give us some more specifics on what gives you confidence in the sustainability of growth in that region?</span>Yes.Hi, David.Thank you.So overall when we look at Americas, 2014 was a year whereby we’ve invested in building a lot of foundation to drive the growth going forward.We’ve made several changes.We started the year making leadership changes where we changed the Head of America.By the beginning of Q2, we have nominated a new manager for the surgical business, which is [indiscernible] with the company.And by the beginning of fiscal quarter Q1 2015, we have had another nomination of VP of Aesthetics who is actually the person who managed very successfully our Australian organization and he came back to the U.S.So I think the first thing that we feel is that we finally – we’ve completed the round of putting the right leadership in place.The second thing that we’ve implemented for 2015 is we have changed the – we have created more investment in the sales team in the medical arena.So basically what we’re doing is we are putting more fruit on the trees but we are doing it by actually – in the major metropolitan area, we are splitting the medical sales team into ophthalmic and surgical, which will allow the team to better focus both on the surgical and both on the ophthalmic.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Once we’ve introduced the Pulse 120, we see everyone’s attention going to that and we believe that we’ve got a lot of potential in all the products and this spilt we believe will contribute through the sales.</span>And the last thing really is the contribution from the new products.We feel that we have got the right sales products in place and it’s a ramp up in terms of the time.So, overall, when we look – we think that we’ve got – finally we have all the pieces together kind of in the right place to make America grow.I can share with you that we had Americas sales meeting the beginning of the year in January.I’ve met with the entire team.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Everyone is very much engaged, focused and motivated and I believe that finally it’s that what we need to make America a successful region.</span>Okay, that makes broader sense.Thank you.And then I have two more questions.On Japan, I think your guidance calls for low-single digit, FX neutral decline but I think on a constant currency basis, you were down much more significantly in the fourth quarter.And based on your commentary about local competition and your intention to be more selective, why do you think it will get so much better in 2015 in Japan than how you exited the year?Okay.So overall when we look at Japan, Japan is a region that accounted for 13% of the total sales in Q4.You’re absolutely right.We have suffered very much from the exchange rates and we’ve been very selective about taking the deals.The way I would characterize Japan going forward for 2015, I would split it into what I call the half one and half two.I think the first half is we are going to be continuing to be challenged, okay.So I think the first half, it’s going to be very rough and that the second half is going to be significantly better than the first half.And the reason is, is that in Japan you cannot raise prices in Japanese yen, it’s unacceptable.And the only way that if you want to compete is if you come with the modification and upgrade to products that allows you to better position them in the markets.And we estimate that we’re going to put the first half in making these changes and this is why we feel more confident about the second half.The other thing in relation to that is that that also translates in terms of the numbers for the year of the company resulting that in the first half, we will see slower growth versus second half where we will see better growth, high growth.Okay.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then my last one is, I know you don’t disclose specific details around your pipeline, but maybe you could give us some sense as you look at the product launches untapped for 2015 and 2016.</span>Are there more or less product launches over that time period than what we saw in 2014?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And how would you describe the magnitude of differentiation or importance of those product launches going forward versus what we saw in 2014?</span>Okay.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So overall, when we are thinking about new products, so the innovation for us is one of the key foundations for growth and this was the area where we believe that we can generate very nice growth.</span>The pipeline that we have at the moment in the R&D for products to be launched in 2015 and in 2016 is full.And we are looking to launch one to two product platform in each of the business units for 2016.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I have disclosed on this call and given some clarity on several products that we have not only visibility of the timing but on products that are not competing with existing things that we are doing and we don’t see a risk from the competitive point of view.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>From that, since we are going into the VLR and sub-threshold therapy, you can see that we are going to continue and maybe even expand our philosophy of not only improving the competitiveness of our offering but also expanding to what we call adjacent pockets.</span>This is something that we want to do overall, so all the time, and I think that as we progress more in 2015 and more in 2016, we would see new products coming also for new categories.Thank you.Good afternoon.Congratulations on another good quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Maybe for Ophir just a question on guidance real quickly is maybe you can provide what the FX impact is to the EPS line.</span>I’m just kind of going through some math here and I’m not quite getting there.I’m just wondering if there’s any offsets or how the 11 million flows through to the earnings line in 2015?And then a few follow ups for Tzipi.Yes.We said that it’s around $5 million tax on the EBITDA.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You can assume the tax rate that we provided, which is around 13% and you can – and that will be the effect on – the outcome on EPS.</span>That’s helpful.Thank you.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And maybe on some of the product lines to begin with aesthetics.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If we go into the LightSheer product line that seems to have gotten off to a good start and there’s two individual lines in there, the INFINITY and DESIRE.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can you maybe walk us through – you spoke about INFINITY getting a full commercial launch at some point this year.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Maybe a little bit how that’s different from the DESIRE platform and just how the initial market acceptance was for INFINITY in the early days?</span>Sure.So overall, the hair removal category has been growing very nicely for us.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I think the major difference that whereby I can categorize the DESIRE versus the INFINITY is that DESIRE is an 805 wavelength and it’s actually targeting the customer base where we’ve got huge, huge, huge endless clinical data to know what are the protocol, the efficacy, the pain management and everything.</span>So once we launch the new product, it was on the base of, oh, yes, I know it’s working.This is amazing.You just gave me something new and the adoption rate was very fast, okay.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The INFINITY is a different platform in two-dimension.</span>One, it’s significantly more expensive, so it’s a premium one, so the overall market is smaller.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But the other thing that is different is that for the first time we are introducing a 1060 wavelength diode for dark skin, hair removal.</span>And there it really takes more time to build the clinical base in order to actually sell this premium product and convince clinicians to pay significant premium.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So actually what we’re doing now is we have engaged with several kind of clinical, which I think we’re going to publish probably in the next two months or something like that one of their results.</span>So we are now building the clinical base and we need to have a little bit of critical mass of clinical.And once that happens, we will see also significant ramp up.But the market is still – the markets with INFINITY is smaller because it’s so much more expensive than the DESIRE.That’s helpful.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Maybe on surgical just to jump over or switch gears to surgical.</span>And I guess what we’re trying to do is crack the number of physicians that have done the HoLEP training and are expressing at least the desire to adopt the technology or those that have already done so.Can you give us a sense of what the transition is from HoLEP training to adoption at this point?Okay.So overall it’s early to tell.I can tell you that when we decided to adopt the HoLEP training course philosophy, it was following an analysis that we did was one course a year that was done in Cambridge in the UK.And this had several years kind of follow up and we found out that the majority of the people who participated in that course actually converted to a HoLEP user, okay.Now when we look at this year, we have trained more than 600 physicians, okay.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe that since it was more convenient – we didn’t need to travel all the way to Cambridge that the conversion rate would not be the majority but we expect a significant proportion to convert to HoLEP but the process of conversion is not kind of immediate.</span>So we’re like building the base.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Sometimes it take two years, sometimes it takes three years.</span>So what we’re doing now is we’re investing and building the base of physicians who are familiar with the procedure and thus feel more comfortable with the procedure.I can share with you that this year we are planning to have similar order of magnitude of physicians to be trained with this procedure as well.But I think that it’s also important to mention that now with the Pulse 120, we can also address the vaporization.So if doctors elect to keep on doing – not converting to HoLEP they can use this very same machine for vaporization.So that gives us a much more better selling and operating to physicians.That’s helpful.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And the last one from me would be on ophthalmology, one of the drivers there is the Array of scanning technology which I believe is available on all markets at this point.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can you maybe give us a sense of what the acceptance has been of that scanning technology and how potentially that drives the retina business going forward?</span>Thanks.Okay.So overall, the Array was well received in the market.In terms of the product features and benefits, it was just two very unique features which is the heads-up display and the micromanipulator which was well accepted in the markets.We don’t see it driving the growth so much.It’s a product that goes on top of the retina offering, which is either the Vision One or the Spectra.So it drives growth big but not much because we are very much positioned at this point in time with very high cost structure and as a result of that, very high pricing.So this is – the thing that we are now working on is to come up with an offering that would be more, say, favorable in terms of the cost structure, so new designs to the laser system and that would have also more benefit on the platform.And then we would start to see significant ramp up.Okay, great.Tzipi, I think in response to last question, it looks like your playbook’s evolving where you’re not so much focused solely on technology but rather adjacencies and not trying to redefine the world.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So could you just talk about both PCNL and vaporization in terms of the longevity of that runway for you?</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And also the contribution that those adjacencies could yield in terms of helping gross margin by getting into a more consumable mix of products?</span>Okay.So overall, when we look at those markets, I think that what’s fascinating for us about them are a few things.One is the size of the market.So for vaporization, there are like 50,000 cases, it’s all consumable.Every fiber is sold for around $1,000 and then [indiscernible], it’s all consumable fiber and handpiece goes together with it.In terms of – so we see a lot of potential out there to start and grow our business significantly.We don’t see that affecting the gross margin.So the gross margin that we see at the moment for the consumable is overall in line with the growth margin that we have on the systems.However, the leverage would come actually from leveraging the sales and marketing expenses.So just to give you a perspective, at the moment we are running at sales and marketing cost of around 30%.And if now we’re thinking about starting to add consumable portion, so once a hospital is starting to use a procedure, from that point onwards in terms of the sales and marketing cost that they’ll require us to maintain the usage of the procedure together with the platform in the hospital, that goes down, okay.And actually we get the leverage from the sales and marketing costs, the direct costs.So overall, it will allow us – it will take time because we need to convert every hospital and it takes time.But overall, we feel very good about the clinical outcome that we have from the products.All the physicians that are trying, they are really excited.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We use the word excited and we believe that it will put us in a much more healthier – not kind of this year or next year but going forward much healthier business model with more recurring revenue with physicians.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It would be difficult I believe the convergence from our solution because it’s not a commodity offering, it’s a very, very unique offering.</span>Perfect.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then it seems like skin rejuvenation is really doing well and I don’t think people may appreciate the – it’s kind of a source of recurring revenue to practitioners.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Could you just talk about that dynamic and your level of excitement about the new resurfacing module?</span>Yes.So overall, skin rejuvenation is a market that kind of – if I take a very long-term view of the market, it would be great, great potential.Only a few percentage of the women in the relative age – it was published for example in EMEA are getting treated.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What we are doing there actually is we are working on the platform and all the time adding features to the platform that enables us first to sell some consumable, which is some upgrades pending, which allows the physician to do more treatment.</span>On the ResurFX, I can tell you that so far clinically we get phenomenal results.From several discussions that I had, for example, with several German physicians there, basically they talked about the fact that in skin resurfacing, you need to do like four to five treatments and then once every quarter.They basically said that it’s the best product that they have ever had because they market that two to three treatments and after that, they don’t need to market anything to that patient because the patient are coming, knocking on the door and asking actually to make the next treatment earlier than what was scheduled because it’s really addicting in terms of the results that they are getting.So this is I think one phenomenal thing that we have started to see and it’s because of the accuracy and several fashions that we have in the technology that allows us to reach these amazing results with very, very little downtime.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And the second thing that we started to, found out about this amazing technology is that it is possible to do wonders with it.</span>So we can share with you kind of very bad acne scars, very bad scarring, stretch marks, anything that you touch the machine with, basically it brings new skin into place with very good quality.So overall, we are very enthusiastic about this machine.The more usage – although we don’t have a consumable portion in terms of every treatment, like we’re charging $20 for $200 but we’re giving a handpiece which is limited in terms of the number of shots.So it’s in our interest to increase the utilization of the machine and definitely we see the utilization going up the whole time.All right.So with that, I would like to thank you all for joining us to discuss our 2014 fourth quarter results.We’re excited about the opportunities in front of our consistent year 2015 and we look forward to updating you on the next call.Thank you very much.That does conclude
