begin I realize that many of you have questions regarding the status of the strategic alternatives process announced last quarter.The Company remains actively engaged with its advisors and is exploring a number of alternatives.The process is ongoing and we are unable to provide an update or discuss the details.In the meantime, we will continue to focus on the execution of our strategic priorities and drive the business forward for the benefit of all RealD stakeholders.So let's turn to a brief review of our 2015 results.Fiscal 2015 was an important year for RealD.Despite challenging box office comparisons were made progress stabilizing domestic 3D percentages through our platform optimization program.We look forward to expanding this program in select international markets.We delivered further reductions in OpEx and CapEx and generated strong free cash flow.As a result of our efforts we believe we are all well positioned to benefit from an exciting 3D film slate into enhanced value of our platform.Revenue for the year was $163.5 million and adjusted EBITDA was $52 million.We generated free cash flow of nearly $35 million which is up 158% from fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2016 is off to a good start and domestic markets films selected to participate in our platform optimization program continued to outperform nonparticipating films.Mad Max and Avengers: Age of Ultron delivered strong 3D box office and robust 3D percentages.Highlighting the continued appeal of premium large format, Age of Ultron within RealD PLF auditoriums had a record 3D growth in domestic markets generating approximately $9 million on opening weekend and $14 million to date.Most recently, San Andreas delivered an estimated 44% domestic 3D box office on its opening weekend with RealD accounting for $19.1 million of the total.Once again RealD 3D equipped PLF auditoriums performed well contributing $3.4 million or nearly 20% of RealD's total.Looking ahead to the upcoming film slate we remain encouraged by the improvement in the creative and technical quality of films playing on the RealD platform.Several blockbusters and temple films are slated for release this year and we along with the industry are excited for their debut.But what we are particularly encouraged by is the quality of films set to play across our platform and the expansion of the 3D format to films outside of the live action genre.Our key international growth markets also continue to benefit from strong 3D demand.China once again delivered robust growth.In fiscal 2015 license revenues increased 13% over the prior year to $18 million and seven of the region's top-ten films were shown in RealD 3D.More recently, Fast & Furious 7 which was released in China in April delivered over 93% 3D viewership and generated over $350 million in 3D box office.Just last month Avengers: Age of Ultron opened in China at 95% 3D viewership and delivered nearly $34 million in box office on its opening day making it Disney-Marvel's biggest ever opening day in China.Russia also continues to be a growth market for RealD.License revenues were up nearly 50% in fiscal year 2015 with eight of the top-ten films in Russia shown in RealD.We've also seen strength outside of China and Russia.In South America 3D percentages for Fast & Furious 7 exceeded 60%, well above expectations and strong 3D performance of San Andreas helped lift the film to the number one international release for the two consecutive weeks after its debut.Over 60% of its $188 million box office during the period came from 3D equipped auditoriums, with China, Germany, Russia and Brazil, all delivering strong 3D percentages.We also continue to expand our LUXE platform in select international markets.As a reminder, LUXE delivers moviegoers with an unmatched cinematic experience, exhibitors with program flexibility and the economics are compelling for both our partners and RealD.We now have 30 LUXE auditoriums under contract and 11 LUXE that are most currently installed in Eastern Europe.Just last month we opened our first LUXE auditorium in China.In summary, we're pleased with our performance in 2015 and our start to fiscal 2016.We believe our core cinema platform is poised to deliver strong RealD box office and improved operating leverage.That said, with review of strategic alternatives ongoing we will not be reiterating our operating expense guidance for fiscal 2016.We remain however, extremely committed to maintaining an optimized cost structure and any strategic expense outlays will be carefully balanced against financial returns.Thank you, Michael.Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $27.9 million.License revenues were $20.4 million or 73% of the total and products and other revenues were $7.5 million or 27% of the total.License revenues decreased 29% and domestic license revenues decreased 33% from the prior year quarter.Year-over-year comparability is difficult due to the strong box office performance in fiscal 2014 which included Lego the movie, The Hobbit 2, 300: Rise of an Empire and Frozen.Despite the year-over-year reduction in domestic 3D box office, 3D percentages in domestic markets improved slightly over the fourth fiscal quarter 2014 and have remained stable year-to-date through today.The international license revenues grew to 69% of total license revenue, which was relatively in line with the overall industry box office average and flat with 67% in the prior year quarter.Product and other revenues decreased 37% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to reduction in purchases from international exhibitors and the overall decrease in our box office over the prior year period.Domestic product revenues represented 71% of total product revenues and international product revenues represented 29% of total product revenues.Licensing gross profit was $6.9 million or 34% gross margin versus 60% gross margin reported in the prior year quarter.Pro forma licensing gross margin which excludes noncash depreciation and amortization expense was 74% a decrease from 90% in the prior year quarter.Year-over-year comparability of gross margin is impacted by several one-time and unusual items in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.Specifically, the year-over-year decline reflects 10 points of increased depreciation expense, 5.8 points of usual impairment expense, 3.5 points of increased manufacturing overhead related to outsourcing and 2.5 points of increased performance-based compensation.Looking at these items in greater detail, noncash depreciation expense included in the license cost to revenue was relatively flat year with the prior year at $8.1 million.As a percentage of licensing revenues however noncash depreciation expenses was 40% an increase from 30% in the prior quarter.As you all know, depreciation is a fixed cost.And in quarters of higher licensing revenue we would expect higher licensing margins and the converse is true as well which occurred in periods of lower licensing revenues.Also included in license cost to revenue were field support costs of $2.2 million which is inclusive of impairment expense of $1.8 million.This compares the field support costs in the prior year quarter of $1.3 million which is inclusive of impairment expense of $880,000.Product and other gross profit was $3.4 million or 45% gross margin compared to $2.7 million or 23% gross margin the prior year quarter.The improvement was primarily due to glasses and shipping cost reductions as well as an increase in the recycled eyewear mix the 72% of domestic shipping for the quarter from 56% in the year ago quarter.Research and development expenses of $4.8 million increased 14% from $4.2 million in the prior quarter, largely due to increased outside professional service fees to support ongoing projects, which was partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization.Selling and marketing expenses of $6.2 million decreased 9% from $6.8 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to reduced personnel cost as a result of our 2014 cost reduction plan.General and administrative expenses of $13.6 million increased 23% from $11.1 million in the prior year quarter.The increase was primarily driven by higher legal and other advisory fees related to our ongoing patent litigation as well as the Company’s review strategic alternatives.This increase was partially offset by lower personnel cost versus the prior year quarter.Total operating expenses of $24.6 million increased 11% from $22.1 million in the prior year quarter.Included in operating expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 were patent enforcement expenses of $1.3 million, restructuring cost of $500,000 and advisory fees related to the strategic process of $300,000.Thus excluding the strategic process, restructuring and patent enforcement expenses, pro forma operating expense were $22.5 million.Share based compensation expense including operating expenses was $3.1 million down from $4 million in the prior year quarter.GAAP operating loss was $14.3 million versus an operating loss of $2.2 million in the prior year quarter.Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $17.7 million or a loss of $0.36 per share versus the net loss attributable to common stockholders of $5 million or a loss of $0.10 per share in the prior year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million versus $14.2 million in the prior quarter.Turning briefly to our full year results, total revenues for fiscal 2015 were $163.5 million an 18% decline from $199.2 million in fiscal 2014.License revenues were $109.3 million or 67% of the total and product in other revenues were $54.2 million or 33% of the total.International license revenue represented 67% of total license revenue and Chinese license revenues was $18 million representing 17% of total license revenues.Fiscal 2015 operating expenses were $90.6 million a decrease of 7% from $97.4 million in the prior year.Included in fiscal 2015 operating expenses were patent enforcement expenses of $2.1 million, advisory fees related to the strategic process of $500,000 and restructuring cost of $500,000.Excluding the strategic process restructuring and patent enforcement expenses, pro forma operating expenses were $87.5 million, a decrease of 7% from $93.6 million in fiscal 2014.This was in line with our previously issued guidance.Also included in operating expenses for fiscal 2015 was $13.7 million of share based compensation and $5.5 million [ph] of depreciation and amortization expense.Our total operating expenses for fiscal 2015 we expect our investment and consumer visual technologies, which include both 2D and 3D products and applications was approximately $11.1 million on a fully allocated basis down from $20 million in the prior year quarter.Further of the $19.5 million in total companywide R&D expenses for the year, we estimate approximately $5.4 million was direct R&D spend on consumer visual technologies.This is down from the prior year in which companywide R&D expenses were $19.7 million and of that amount, we estimate approximately $7 million was direct R&D spend on consumer visual technologies.GAAP operating loss for fiscal 2015 was $9.8 million versus an operating loss of $2.2 million in fiscal 2014.Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $23.8 million or a loss of $0.48 per share for fiscal 2015 versus a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $11.4 million or a loss of $0.23 per share in fiscal 2014.Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $52 million versus $65.1 million in fiscal 2014.Now let’s turn to our cash flows and balance sheet.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, cash flow from operating activities was $11.8 million and total capital expenditures were $800,000 resulting in positive free cash flow of $11 million.For fiscal 2015, cash flow from operating activities was $51.8 million and total capital expenditures were $17.4 million resulting in positive free cash flow of $34.4 million, an increase of $21 million from fiscal 2014.As of March 31, 2015 cash and cash equivalents were $60.3 million.Total borrowings on our credit facility were $29.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from $31.7 million in the prior quarter.As a result, net cash was approximately $30.5 million at the end of the quarter.Now I will turn to our May box office metrics which was released earlier today.Please note that box office results do not include China.Estimated box office generated on RealD enabled screens for May 2015 is $307 million comprised of $188 million domestic and $190 [ph] million international.This compares to the $326 million estimated RealD box office on RealD enabled screens in May 2014 comprised of $167 million domestic and $159 million international worth nothing May marks the first monthly increase in domestic box office since August of 2015.Quarter-to-date through May and excluding China, estimated box office generated on RealD enabled screens is $441 million comprised of $213 million domestic and $228 million international.As Michael mentioned, with the ongoing review of strategic alternatives, we will not be reiterating our operating expense guidance for fiscal 2016.Great, thanks very much.Two quick questions on China, I guess one is, as China gets bigger I know in the past you guys had suggested that we use 4.5% as that license revenue as a percentage of RealD box to forecast licensing numbers, just seems it’s that number seems too low I guess in several quarters in a row well it has been ahead of 4.5%.So, what number you think we should be using going forward?And then secondly, could you just give us a sense for what the Hollywood content as a percentage of total content in China versus Chinese local language content, I'm just trying to get a sense for what the mix in 3D revenues has come out of that market?Sure James, this is Drew.At the end of the day with the fantastic growth we've had in China, really it’s more appropriate at this point to use 5%.I think when you don’t have China, if you take China out of the mix 4.5% would be the right percentage on China, but which China 5%.So when we’ve seen these types of royalty rates for fiscal ‘15 we saw 5.4% in fiscal ‘15 versus 5% in fiscal ‘14.Without China, it would have been 4.5% in fiscal ‘15 versus 4.4% in fiscal ‘14.So right now the right metric to use with our Chinese growth is 5%.So, it’s really taking the look like 4.5% would be without China and 5% proxies for China.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To local indigenous content , the fourth quarter was pretty <b>amazing</b> quarter for local content in China from Vegas to Macau too for instance , the 3D boxes are $ 121 million or 83 % , Dragon Blade $ 102 million in 3D box office at 92 % 3D percentages , Wolf Totem was $ 96 million in 3D box at 92 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Taking of Tiger Mountain was $61 million in 3D box office at 94% 3D percentages and Snow Girl And The Dark Crystal was about $58 million in 3D box with 96% 3D.So taking all those factors into account and our fourth quarter with China local indigenous content is approximately $1.8 million.So, on an annual run rate of $18 million from China local indigenous content is going to contribute somewhere between $5 million to $7 million on an annualized basis and that 18 is a trailing 12 months.So as we China license revenues grow we also see that number grow as well for local indigenous content.Hi, good afternoon.Couple of questions, one just following up on China, with the strength of 3D demand there, how is this helping kind of your pricing leverage with the theaters as more films come out?And then kind of talk about your system backlog in china right now and what do you think kind of the total addressable market is over the next few years for the market, for our viewer screens?Well, so our, our China installed base Eric has grown quite a bit.We’re up to about 2050 screens in China and that’s up from 1550 screens of March last year.We continued to see fantastic growth there.I think what we told you guys in several quarters ago is we have moved our model from a per film revenue model to a percentage of the ticket.So we’re seeing fantastic growth as a percentage of the tickets, so we get paid on the local indigenous content and as the U.S. produced content in China continues to grow we will continue to grow with that box office growth.So it’s not about leverage, its more about I would call it operating leverage than negotiating leverage that as we have these variable pricings, we’re able enjoy the growth that the entire industry in China is experiencing.Well, if you look at industry reports Eric in the next couple years.I think most folks in the industry would agree that China will far surpass the domestic box office of $11 billion a year, so the sky is the limit from where we are today to the future in China.We’re just like everyone else in the industry extremely excited about the growth prospectus in China.And Michael, and just to add to that, we’re also – we’re still relatively a small percentage of the Chinese market in 3D.So we think there is certainly growth opportunity in terms of our percentage of the market just as we’ve done in the other territories around the world.Thanks.And last question could you explain the reasoning behind pushing the proxy window back by two months from mid-April to mid-June?Hi good afternoon.So just a followup on Eric’s question, can you confirm that the proxy window opens up on Monday, the 15th of June?And could you give us a little more detail on what you think your market share in China is today and where do you think the 1000 screens takes you?So today we’re slightly under 15% Steve.It’s an estimate, we estimate somewhere between 12% and 15% and so we’re not providing any guidance at this point in time on revenues and market share.And I understand you pegged off of your guidance on OpEx are we to imply from that, that it’s not just because of some things you could pro forma out like external bankers fees and legal fees and things like that.But given that you’re in the strategic process, you may choose to spend more money on some of these initiatives than you would have otherwise?That’s one of many alternatives.Our advisors, the board, and management are looking at all our initiatives which ultimately affect our cost structure.And you had hinted that you might give us some update on some of these projects, would you care to share any types of metrics or update on what’s going on with these projects today?I would give you cellphone you can answer, can you just give us the domestic, international and worldwide take rates for the quarter?Sure, sure.What I’m actually going to do Steve is first start with the quarter ended March, then I’m going to go to the year-to-date and I’m actually going to provide you with two months ended May as well.So first let’s start with the quarter ended March 2015.The domestic 3D percentages increased to 36% from 34%.The international percentages decreased from 49% to 38%.So worldwide global, the totals went from 43% to 37%.Now on an annual basis for the year ended March, the domestic percentages went from 35% in fiscal 2014 to 34%, but note that 35% in the prior year includes Gravity.The international percentages went from 49% to 41%.So global total they went from 43% to 38%.Now let me give you for the two months ended May based on the box office that we reported today for the two months May.For domestic two months ended May, we held steady at 36%, 36% last year, 36% this year and international went from 45% to 44%.So global worldwide total two months to two months last year to this year held steady at 41% and of this Steve, we got to remember this all excludes China our reporting and as I talked about earlier and Michael talked about in his opening remarks, most of the 3D percentages in China are in the mid upper 90 percentage points.Okay.And would you care to comment on where we should expect glasses margin to normalize, because clearly we should not believe that 10% or 15% because you do not seem to be any way near there?That’s right, Steve.So we’ve had – we’ve been performing a lot better than anticipated.We previously, as you noted, guided a 10%.Now, we’re trending closer to 15% to 20%, some of the benefits in the last two quarters, we noted in my prepared remarks that recycled eyewear has been unusually high in the last two quarters, that’s because in lower periods of box, you have a higher inventory recycled eyewear.As we move into the summer season, we start to use brand new glasses that are not recycled yet.So the mix will decline and will get to a more steady state.Good evening.You have I think you mentioned you had about a 70:30 split of the revenues which were referred domestic or international versus domestic sort of matching the industry, your penetration in the U.S. is still I’m gathering about 80% or 85%.Did you say you couldn’t comment on what the penetration was internationally?No, we can.But again Jim it’s country by country specific.The international market share is right around 46%, so globally worldwide total is around 50%.Okay.And I gather reps continue to ratchet up because I believe that was a lot lower just a couple of years ago.Is that trend persisting and you’ll get well above that 70:30 general split as time progresses?I think our business will continue to mirror the general film business, 70:30 now is probably a good number.I see it going to 80:20 if not higher over the next three to five years and we would expect our business to mirror that increase.Okay.Because you are also – I guess your advantages internationally was little less than in some periods it had been, is there something you had point to look at that narrowing in that gap between the domestic take rates to that you just talked about in the international?Well, I think we’ve had success with our platform optimization program here in the U.S. and so we’re seeing stabilization in rates.Last couple of months we’ve seen very good performance in the domestic market.So our plan is to replicate a lot of what we’ve learned here domestically and see if we can move those 3D percentages up in those other markets that we’ve seen some declines in.Have you also then same as the premium large format model has taken further hold, has that accounted for some of that share shift also that it sort of increased your number of people in the United States using a 3D from RealD versus IMAX for example?While we do provide almost all of the premium large formats.Theatres around the world use RealD.the while label brands use RealD 3D technology, so I’m not exactly sure, I understand the question, are you saying?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm just <b>wondering</b> -LSB- indiscernible -RSB- increasing share , yes is the PLF increased share is what 's helping drive that improvement too ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yes, I think its pretty standard.The numbers we look at I’m sure you’re looking the same PLFs are over indexing the general market, so probably contributing somewhat, it’s certainly a trend that we see continuing, it’s one of the reasons why we’ve focused on our LUXE brand to, we think it’s an important part of – that’s and we’ve seen good results with it economically.All right and maybe lastly as you’ve level off your R&D spending, is there, should we assume no further movement on the home whole market or any of those other developments pending clarification with these strategic initiatives?Hi, good afternoon.Thanks for taking the question.I’m kind of curious your views on film, on film zone clearance and if they were to be abolished if you are looking from a box office perspective with you being a derivative of that, would you view it positively?I’m not sure we have a view on that.I’m not sure it would really affect our business one way or the other.Our market penetration around the world is very, very high.Okay.And then maybe one for Drew very quickly, Drew when I look at the royalty rates internationally excluding China, looks like they were a bit higher than what I would have thought, is this some of the U.S. dollar minimums kind of kick in?Sure, on the conversion rate, the conversion rate international ex-China was a little bit higher than it’s been for a while.Are you starting to see some of those minimums, does the minimum type of U.S. dollar kind of kicking in that pushes the royalty rate up a little bit?No, couple of things when we see an increase rate happen, but the largest driver is just ticket prices genre, that's actually moving as the most as ticket pricing related to the genre, that’s really the general explanation.There are no further questions at this time.I would like to thank everyone for their time and participation today.This concludes today’s conference call.You may now disconnect.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!RealD Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on June 11, 2015.</div></body></html>
