(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It turns out that a natural trickle-up experiment is going on right now owing to the price of oil being so low.The best thing about it is that it's non-political and without direct government spending or taxation adjustments.In trickle-down theory, lower tax rates provide an opportunity for additional incentive to work and invest.Because of certain leveraging multipliers, the effect from the wealthy would be expected to far outweigh the contributions from the less fortunate.For example, banks can lend money for business development at a multiple several times the amount of their deposits.The end result should be more economic activity and higher tax revenue.However, the propensity of the highest-earners to accumulate wealth seems to negate the positive effects.Worse yet, the amassed wealth is often tax-sheltered and expatriated into offshore accounts.A recent IMF report concludes that while the rich do get richer, there is no trickle-down effect from this situation: We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth, while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth — that is, when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down.Conventional trickle-up theory is essentially the opposite of trickle down.It theorizes that demand is stimulated through government spending that is made affordable by higher taxes.The result is an increase in spending by the less wealthy, who are the beneficiaries of the government's largess.In contrast to trickle-down economics, as noted above, the IMF found that "… increasing the income share of the poor and middle class actually increases growth …" Most people reading this are probably aware that low gasoline prices provide a greater benefit to low-income earners owing simply to the fact that household gas expenditures are a greater percentage of their income.In other words, it's a regressive benefit.Here is a graphic that displays this relationship, showing 9% of income being spent on gasoline for the lowest quartile versus 2% for the highest: How big of an effect does falling gas prices have?Economists have estimated that every penny decline in gasoline prices saves $1 Billion annually on energy costs.That's $100 Billion per dollar gas price reduction.Gas prices have declined about $1.00/gallon from their peak over the last year and $2.00/gallon from their 2014 peak.Over the latter timeframe, that's like a $200 Billion stimulus.How does this compare with a tax cut?The Bush tax cuts provided around $500/yr benefit to the bottom three-fifths of taxpayers.Every 62 cents in gas savings produces about $500 savings per household.So the two-year drop in oil prices yields approximately a $1500 savings per household per year relative to 2014.This is equivalent to 3 times the Bush tax cut benefit for the poor and middle class.How will this benefit be observed?There are two big related questions about the benefits.What will consumers do with their money?And, if they spend it, when will we see the effect?I've often seen articles state that most of the money obtained from tax breaks or gas-price reduction goes to savings and paying down debt, per consumer polls.But it turns out this isn't true, at least for credit- and debit-card holders.In a 2015 report , JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) analyzed the effects of gas-price reduction on spending habits of 57 million American card holders (I highly recommend anyone interested in this topic to read this report, there is much depth here).Chase found a marginal propensity to consume of 73-89%, meaning consumers mostly spend gas savings on other spending categories.That leaves around just 20% for savings and debt reduction.In particular, Chase found that individuals spent 18% of the savings at restaurants and a total of 23% on services, 33% on non-durable goods with 10% on groceries alone, and 6% on durable goods (e.g., electronics and appliances), and 2% on other categories (e.g., charitable donations).The categories with the largest increases in spending were 8% for department stores, 7% for entertainment, and 6% for electronics and appliances.Regarding timing, one study showed that the effects of lower gas prices are very gradual.This shows the effect of a 10% decrease in gasoline prices.Since 2014, we've had around a 50% increase, but this can be thought of as five consecutive 10% decreases over eight quarters, roughly one every 2 quarters.So we may have a snowballing effect that should have already started and will reach its peak around 2017.Note that it takes 3-4 quarters for the effect to extend into the broader consumer categories and 7-8 quarters to become reasonably significant.We should have seen some effect by mid- to late-2015 and certainly should see more as we progress through 2016.Assuming gasoline prices remain low for the next two years, we should see increasing consumer spending over the next two years as well relative to the case where gas prices remained high.This spending should mostly occur on restaurants and groceries, and to a lesser extent on general merchandise, electronics and appliances.The best place to look for this bump will be grocery stores, like Kroger (NYSE: KR ) and SuperValu (NYSE: SVU ), restaurants including fast-food chains such as McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ), Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR ), and Yum!Brands (NYSE: YUM ), casual dining restaurant chains such as Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI ) and DineEquity (NYSE: DIN ), which recently corrected, and pizza restaurants like Domino's (NYSE: DPZ ).The spending effect could in part be supporting recent sales improvements at McDonald's.Other categories could see lesser but still helpful effects.These include some general discount retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), movie theater chains such as Regal Entertainment (NYSE: RGC ) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), and electronics/appliance stores such as Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ).I particularly like the movie theater chains here, especially Regal Entertainment with its 4.5% yield for those interested in dividends, as they're bouncing well off their recent lows and have room for decent gains if their revenues get trickle-up support.Interestingly, department stores like Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ), Macy's (NYSE: M ), Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ), and J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ) are struggling even in light of the increase observed by Chase.Consequently, some of the lesser categories might not see sufficient impact to make a difference owing to too much consumer-spending dilution or because of significant unrelated headwinds in those industries.Perhaps the biggest sign that trickle-up is working will be if we have a much-improved holiday shopping season at the end of 2016.I'm optimistic that we'll be seeing meaningfully improved consumer spending by year's end.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Macro View , Economy, Services</div></body></html>
