(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The board may also consider watering down the timeframe for hitting the inflation target.The BOJ now says Japan will hit the target at or around fiscal 2015, though Kuroda has acknowledged that it may take somewhat longer than that.Central bankers have stressed that they will look through the effect of lower oil costs, which are largely blamed for inflation evaporating in February.But consumption has failed to rebound, underscoring doubts held by analysts that inflation will accelerate as quickly as the BOJ projects.Analysts polled by Reuters expect core consumer inflation to hit 0.3 percent this fiscal year and 1.3 percent the following year, barely half the pace projected by the BOJ."While additional easing is unlikely to take place this week, we think additional BOJ stimulus is a matter of time,"  HSBC economist Izumi Devalier said in a research note."We believe the central bank will announce enhanced easing measures by the end of the second quarter, most likely at the June 19 policy meeting."(Editing by Kim Coghill) Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
