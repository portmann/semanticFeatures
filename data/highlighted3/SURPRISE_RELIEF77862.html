(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The "final" privilege logs provided to Fairholme are not seen to contain confidential information and are the exact same types of information in earlier privilege logs.This sort of behavior appears to be last ditch effort type stuff on behalf of the government, and if the government loses, private shareholders win big.Fannie Mae (OTCQB: FNMA ) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB: FMCC ) are government sponsored housing businesses that are privately owned and are currently in conservatorship where for the time being all of the earnings are seen as United States Tax Revenue.There are three courts that have active cases in them, DC District, Court of Claims, and Iowa.The DC District court case is on appeal.The discussion below relates directly to the Court of Claims, where it would appear that the government thinks that they can make Fairholme lawyers look bad by engaging in Bush League tactics.Judge Sweeney, a few months ago had the following exchange with Mr. Schwind, a government lawyer: THE COURT: Well, then, if you don't know what it is, then you're just making it up as you go along.MR. SCHWIND: We're definitely not, Your Honor.And - THE COURT: Well, of course you are.You're saying you don't know what they've asked for, you don't know what's been produced.Oh, by the way, but it simply goes to merits, and it can't possibly help them with respect to their jurisdictional defenses or their jurisdictional allegations.In the plaintiff's most recent filing , as a shareholder I get to celebrate that the government has finally provided to them final privilege logs!The battle has gotten intense lately and the judge just ruled in favor of the government's recent motion.What is interesting to me is that the Government seems to be trying so hard to make Fairholme lawyers look bad.The government also appears to have alleged that the Plaintiffs have, by stating publicly what is already public information that "the Government has asserted privilege with respect to thousands of documents" constitutes "a breach of the Court's protective order".Judge Sweeney has made great quotes on this type of behavior in the past that just goes to show you that the government's defense continues to be meritless.THE COURT: And so far, I haven't gotten - I haven't received a good answer from the Government.Counsel is very able.But counsel has expressed concern of what could happen if certain documents are released, which I do not want to see happen, but counsel didn't answer to my satisfaction the discrepancy between sort of using the deliberative process as sword and shield.On one hand, FHFA is a government entity, you know, for purposes of booting the Plaintiffs out of court and not part of the Government, but for purposes of forwarding discovery, all of a sudden deliberative process is appropriate because they are part of the Government.So, it's a schizophrenic approach and I'm just waiting to hear a reasonable explanation.The new Saxton v. FHFA complaint in Iowa has an interesting snippet: A senior executive at one of the Companies even discussed the reversal of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance with Treasury on eve of the Net Worth Sweep.I'm not a legal expert, but Mario Ugoletti went on the record saying the complete opposite: At the time of the negotiation of the Third Amendment, the Conservator and the Enterprises had not yet begun to discuss whether or when the Enterprises would be able to recognize any value to their deferred tax assets.Thus, neither the Conservator nor Treasury envisioned at the time of the Third Amendment that Fannie Mae's valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets would be reversed in early 2013, resulting in a sudden and substantial increase in Fannie Mae's net worth, which was paid to Treasury in mid-2013 by virtue of the net worth dividend.Relevant Items of Interest Coming This Year We will see AIG play out in the next two months.Discovery is supposed to be done by the end of this month.Maybe you read about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because you're interested in seeing how things play out because you're not sure if it makes sense to own a business that currently is in a perpetual agreement with the tax collector US Treasury that prevents you from benefiting from ownership.The deal is this, in the event the third amendment is reversed, Fannie and Freddie are worth upwards of $20 if the government goes from owning 100% of the profits to over 80%.Further, there is recapitalization risk.This is why some people own the preferreds even though Bill Ackman says that the commons are the best trade in capital markets.In the event that the warrants are not completely exercised, the stocks are worth much more.In the event that it is determined that the law has not been violated, the private shares are possibly worthless, but I still don't know how that works because I don't understand how that helps anyone.The way I see it, there are billions of dollars at stake here and there isn't an alternative.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Source: Fannie And Freddie Legal Woes Are Big Shows Disclosure: The author is long FNMA.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
