(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If you recall, during the early years of conservatorship the GSEs wrote down the value of their assets in order to trigger the issuance of more senior preferred stock to the United States Treasury at the behest of FHFA.In order to do this, the forcasted losses had to be greater than the actual losses experienced at the GSEs.The implication is that when your actual losses are short of your forecasted losses, eventually you get to a point where you can't write off more assets to generate accounting losses.This email reflects that FHFA is well aware that the capital backstops for the GSEs are solid: The following is more of the same sort of memo, where FHFA is getting high fives but isn't thrilled about reasonable financial projections: Why Was It So Important To Treasury That Treasury To Take Everything?Government discovery shows that this was done so that they could "take parts of the GSEs' business (and human capital/systems)": But, in order to accomplish this Single National Securitization Utility, they had to take the positive net worth of the GSEs: David J. Voacolo has filed a simple lawsuit in Delaware.The complaint itself is pretty straight forward, but here's where it gets interesting: His valuation of $35 per share on the commons is an interesting perspective.Would love to know how he gets there.Considering that he bought shares after the conservatorship began, it would seem that his valuation includes the government warrants being dilutive, some pretty high normalized profitability metrics and a generous multiple of earnings.Recent discovery makes a pretty compelling case that the government saw the deferred tax assets turning the corner.After all, it was the issuance of senior preferred to the government that was the driving force behind the writedowns in the first place.Seeing the assets turn the corner caused the government to effect a net worth sweep out of fear that the dividends would exceed the 10% they were owed and they saw an opportunity for a better deal even though in their legal defense Treasury claims it wasn't a better deal.The government filings reveal that according to the government GSE money should go to the government.I happen to disagree with the government and that's why I own the shares that the government doesn't own.I expect at least one of the many lawsuits against the government to prevail with the discovery they have on hand, not to mention additional information that may be produced shortly from the over ten thousand documents being contested in Judge Sweeney's Court of Claims.I own 4,050 shares of FMCCH, 9,340 shares of FMCCP, 4,442 shares of FMCCT, 5,000 shares of FMCKP, 27,086 shares of FNMFN, 5 shares of FNMFO, 25,092 shares of FNMA, and 500 shares of FMCKO.Disclosure: I am/we are long FMCCH, FNMA, FMCCP, FMCCT, FMCKP, FNMFN, FNMFO, FMCKO.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Financial , Savings & Loans</div></body></html>
