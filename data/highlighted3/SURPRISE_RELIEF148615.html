(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This shouldn't be a surprise since during times of crisis, liquidity tends to dry up and prices seem to fall.Fortunately, capital structures are put in place so that during times of crisis there is a systematic approach to determining who gets paid first.Generally speaking the order is based on who assumes the most risk when issuing money to the company.According to agreements made during conservatorship, US Treasury takes the money above and beyond payments made on agency mortgage pass-through securities.Once US Treasury is paid back money would accrue to the junior preferred securities of Fannie and Freddie and then to the common securities.In a recent filing in the United States Court of Federal Claims the United States opposes the motions to remove the "Protected Information" designation from certain discovery materials.In this motion, the government references Watergate , which is interesting because GSE shareholder rights activists have been pointing to Watergate for months now drawing correlations in the name of Fanniegate .The government's legal filing references Watergate suggesting that the public's right to inspect judicial records is "not absolute": In addition to referencing Watergate, the government confirms that Fairholme's primary objective is compensation and not access to vital Goverment information: It's worth noting that since the conservatorship began in 2008, the government has been the only recipient of tens of billions of dollars of Fannie and Freddie funds.This doesn't even reflect that in these calculations of disbursements were interest accruals meaning that the governments return on a cash flow basis appears to be understated.The Perry Capital case is the one that was dismissed last year by the Honorable Judge Lamberth in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.An amicus brief by the Independent Community Bankers of America refers to this memorandum opinion as the fleet of yachts ruling: Since then the plaintiffs, excluding Ackman, have motioned for an appeal.Judge Sweeney in the Court of Claims has sent documents over on behalf of the plaintiffs and the government has filed to prevent the Perry Capital from having access to them: Perry capital has requested access to the filings suggesting that access to the documents is not a matter of national security and it is unfair if Perry Capital is not able to see documents that are filed on their behalf: At the current level of G-fees Fannie and Freddie make $20B/annum and have roughly 1.81B shares outstanding.The government has 79.9% warrant coverage and on an official basis is owed $187.5B.If the third amendment is reversed and the 10% is kept there is no telling whether or not that money offsets the senior preferreds and is credited as principle payment or is credited to the firms balance sheets.$18.75B/year is certainly an attractive perpetuity proposition and the government has been forecasting the inclusion of Fannie and Freddie profits in their budget.The Federal Finance Housing Agency is in charge of the conservatorship and will be instrumental in determining the capital structure of the firms assuming they exit conservatorship.The possibility that the government keeps its balance of the senior preferreds instead of crediting the overrepayment in the situation have caused me to switch from commons to preferreds.According to Bill Ackman and Richard X. Bove the commons by 2019 are worth over $20 in the event that the warrants are exercised and the firms are allowed to pay off the government's senior preferred over time.In the scenario that the entire PSPA is voided the commons are worth over $100.In the event that the government wins all the legal battles and there is no political will to pay out any money to shareholders, the securities that have been delisted from the NYSE and now trade over the counter are worthless.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Disclosure: I am/we are long FNMA, FNMAS.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
