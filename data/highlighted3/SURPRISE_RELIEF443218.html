NVE Corporation (NASDAQ:NVEC) | Seeking Alpha NVE Corporation reported full-year results for fiscal 2016 on May 4th.Revenue declined year-over-year due to a decrease in product sales.The year, however, offered plenty of R&D opportunities, both customer-sponsored and company-sponsored.R&D, historically, has led to product sales in time.Though not a giant itself, NVE is positioned to mingle with giants in multiple industries - IoT, security, biomedical and food production.NVE Corporation (NASDAQ: NVEC ) is not a giant corporation by most measures.But, that does not mean it should be cast aside.On the subject of spurring change, its potential is Herculean.Considering an investment in NVE Corporation is a reasonable exercise.Growth opportunities abound in promising industries.The company implemented a generous dividend in its fiscal 2015 third quarter (ending December 2014).It authorized a share repurchase program in its fiscal 2016 third quarter (ending December 2015).Like any stock, there are potential threats to an investment in NVE Corporation.Product sales have decreased.In the second half of fiscal 2016, product sales were expected to be lower than the first half.R&D expense is increasing.The fiscal 2016 first half total was expected to grow by 20% to 25% in the second half.Its payout ratio is over 100% - typically, a glaring warning.Operating cash is not covering dividend payments plus share repurchases.But, to be fair, NVE purposely set out to return tens of millions to shareholders.The spintronics manufacturer reported full-year results on May 4, 2016 for fiscal year 2016 ending March 31, 2016.Revenue is derived from two sources: product sales and contracted R&D.The company did warn the second half of fiscal 2016 would see challenges regarding product sales.And, it did - product sales in the latter half were 28% less than the first half.For the full year, revenue decreased 9.5% from $30.6 million to $27.7 million.At fiscal year-end 2015, NVE had a firm backlog for contract R&D of $2.2 million.Yet, for the full year of fiscal 2016, NVE saw a 50% increase in R&D revenue totaling $3.3 million.R&D revenue in fiscal 2017 can be based, minimally, on the company's firm backlog valued at $2.12 million.Like fiscal 2016, NVE suspects there will be revenue beyond its backlog.The total for fiscal 2017 is expected to approach $3 million.It could be argued focusing on R&D revenue is trivial as it represents just 12% of total revenue.Further, the gross margins on R&D revenue (approximately 17%) hardly compare to the gross margins on product sales (approximately 84%).But, NVE claims there is a direct correlation between R&D and future product sales."So they do result in product sales and that's part of the reason why we believe these contracts are helpful.They help fund R&D.They help advance things like our MRAM technology.And, they can result in product sales.So they're more than just a revenue source for us.They build intellectual properly and potential business in the future."NVE also funds its own R&D.The $3.3 million received from customers represents just part of the company's R&D activity for the full year.For fiscal 2016, customer-sponsored and company-sponsored R&D totaled $5.45 million.This compares to $3.59 million for fiscal 2015.There are several industries with the potential to benefit from NVE R&D activity including industrial, medical and scientific.NVE is not alone in its quest.Competitors are also heavily researching the possibilities for spintronics applications.Such competition does serve to validate the potential.In fiscal 2016, NVE's R&D activity necessitated additional headcount and resulted in three patent awards and new products.In the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call, Curt Reynders, NVE's CFO validated R&D efforts would pay off."We expect to continue to see product sales increase sequentially at least for the next couple of quarters."Management highlighted several applications offering major prospects: IoT (Internet of Things), security and food safety.Its latest transceiver, developed at customer request, was described as "a simple but elegant product".It is targeted for integration with the Internet of Things.NVE is targeting the protection of valuable sensitive electronics through anti-tamper memories.Military and aerospace organizations, specifically, prioritize their responsibilities to protect systems, software, intellectual properties and the like.The company validated some of the 2016 R&D spend was for developing anti-tamper memories.NVE also spent significant effort on anti-pathogen detection for the USDA.The laboratory work is completed.NVE is satisfied with the results.Once reports are reviewed and data analyzed, NVE expects to be able to proceed with a second phase.The company is already having commercialization discussions with food producers.In its earnings call, Dan Baker, CEO, shared the NVE R&D team had demonstrated "the ability to detect truly infinitesimal level of pathogens".How microscopic?The goal was akin to detecting "the equivalence of a needle in the mall of America".<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Considering Chipotle 's ( NYSE : CMG ) trials since last summer , it was natural to <b>wonder</b> if that level of detection could have benefited either it or the CDC .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Curiosity won.A call was placed to NVE's Investor Relations.It was indeed a pleasure to be routed directly to Mr. Baker.During the chat, it became clear.To state anti-pathogen detection is likely to improve food safety is an understatement.NVE is designing the products for the largest food producers.There are numerous points of potential contamination from harvest to distribution.NVE believes its detection solutions will ultimately be deployed at each mission-critical point.But, at this juncture, the anti-pathogen detection would not likely be a fit for Chipotle's.It is currently geared toward much, much larger applications.The cost would probably be prohibitive at this phase for Chipotle's.This same technology is applicable to medical testing for pathogens.NVE does expect to be able to deliver bio-sensor and anti-pathogen solutions for a wide variety of needs and multi-sized applications.In the near-term, its target market is focused on the industry's giants.Taking advantage of Mr. Baker's generosity of time, we asked if the company was concerned about competing with giants.It's no secret NVE is considerably smaller in scale.It had just 47 employees at fiscal year-end.Mr. Baker shared key differentiators for NVE Corporation: the flexibility and speed it is able to employ during development and testing, and its decision to partner on processes it isn't scaled to accomplish such as distribution.Mr. Baker also highlighted the advantages of NVE's corporate location in Minnesota rather than Silicon Valley.NVE has close ties with the Engineering school at the University of Minnesota, often named one of the nation's top 25.Its engineers are drawn to the opportunity to work with revolutionary technology.They also appreciate the Twin Cities' affordability and quality of life.Honestly, it's a bit of a struggle to convey with words the confidence and pride Mr. Baker evoked when discussing the company he leads.Change isn't always the result of being the largest or most powerful.From a motivational perspective, it's often noted change stems from passion.And, in that regard, NVE is not lacking.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Semiconductor - Specialized, Earnings</div></body></html>
