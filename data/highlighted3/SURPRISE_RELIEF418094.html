Summers; Voxeu.org The idea of secular stagnation was first presented by economist Alvin Hansen in 1938, after he observed the second great recessionary pulse of the Great Depression.As fate would have it, World War II started immediately thereafter, and the huge burst of economic activity associated with that event pushed Hansen's theory into what some might call the dustbin of history.Larry Summers resurrected the theory in a November 2013 speech to the IMF.He proposed the idea of secular stagnation as an explanation for the extremely weak and protracted US recovery from the Great Recession; however, he also suggested that the double-dip recessions in Europe (2012) and Japan (1998) were caused by the same phenomenon (see Chart 3 below).Whatever the merits of the Secular Stagnation Hypothesis, this latter idea about double-dip recessions is dubious at best, as in both of Summers's examples, policy error was clearly in play.A series of symposia have followed the publication of the Secular Stagnation Theory, the result of which has been a very healthy debate within the fields of macroeconomics and monetary policy (Coen Teulings & Richard Baldwin (Eds.), Secular Stagnation: Facts, Causes and Cures, 2014, CEPR Press ; Lawrence H. Summers, 30 Oct. 2014, "Reflections on the new 'Secular Stagnation Hypothesis," Mario Draghi (Convener), ECB Forum on Central Banking Conference, Inflation and Unemployment in Europe, Sintra, Portugal, 21-23 May, 2015).There have also been many articles in various media outlets (e.g., Peter Coy, "Opening Remarks" Column, "The Curse of the Big Bad Rut," Bloomberg Business Week, May 16, 2016, p. 12-14), including a whole series of articles at Seeking Alpha by contributors such as Ben Bernanke, Lance Brofman, Brad DeLong, Leo Kolivakis, John Mason, and Matthew Salter.There are a number of interesting points that have been made in the debate so far, both as to the accuracy of the theory, and what alternatives there may be to the theory.Even if one accepts the theory, there is some debate also about the mechanisms through which it would operate.With respect to the accuracy of the theory, several famous economists have stated their opposition to the economic stagnation theory as proposed by Larry Summers.Economist and author Richard Koo thinks the very slow and weak recovery since 2008 is just a hangover from the Great (Balance Sheet) Recession; balance sheet recessions (cf. Japan since 1990) often require extremely long recovery periods involving prolonged deleveraging by the private sector (see Chart 4 below), so the current situation is not really unusual.Therefore Koo sees no need for a new Secular Stagnation theory to explain what we are seeing (for deep background on balance sheet recessions, see R.C. Koo, 2009; The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics: Lessons from Japan's Great Recession, John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Pte. Ltd., Singapore, 339p).Similarly, renowned economist Lacy Hunt has written often about the slow recovery, but he has always blamed this weakness on our massive amounts of debt.(See his quarterly commentary at here and here .)Hunt has argued that the debt overhang, and in particular the explosively expanding amount of unproductive debt worldwide, is causing a sort of "economic sclerosis."This kind of debt (see Chart 5 below) pulls forward future spending, creating a hole behind it, and since it is unproductive, must be paid from other assets, putting a strain on the entire financial system.Famous hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has suggested alternatively ( see Surbhi Jain, 2016, "Ray Dalio on the Next Downturn: What You Need to Know,") that the cause of the apparent global economic stagnation is the end of the "credit super-cycle" that has run for many decades.His take then is that we are seeing the natural slowing that comes near the ending to a very long (usually 50 years or more) economic leveraging cycle, and that this slowdown can't be avoided once the system reaches its capacity (see Chart 6 below).His argument is that we are at the top of the cycle, where not much happens as credit-driven growth stalls out, and we are now waiting for the inevitable crash and depression that ends it.He does not think that this cycle will end this year or next, but he implies that we may be in trouble after that.Famous economist and author Barry Eichengreen has argued that the notion of Secular Stagnation is a kind of economic Rorschach Test, i.e., it means different things to different people.He does not agree that innovation is dying out (as some would claim), or that the best big ideas in technology (that could boost productivity and GDP) are behind us.As he says, this would fly in the face of 200 years of economic history.He also disagrees with the idea that there is a global savings glut; instead, he maintains that while US savings have fallen, global savings have been stable at 23-25% of global GDP for 20 years.However, when we look at recent data (see Chart 7 below), it does appear that there has been a steep increase in the global savings rate since 2003.Eichengreen proposes that this increase should be considered minor and temporary, and that it will revert to the mean as China switches to a consumption-based economy.However, the part of Summers's theory that Eichengreen actually likes is the idea that US total factor productivity growth has stagnated due to massive underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and training since 2008.This is easy to see in the data (see Chart 8 below).Eichengreen concludes that any secular stagnation the US experiences will be self-inflicted, since it reflects the failure to repair the damage done by the Great Recession, or to support aggregate demand growth.This lays the problem directly at the feet of Congress and the President.Other economists like Robert Gordon see the situation as resulting from negative demographic trends, which have a direct impact on GDP over time (see Chart 9).This speaks to one of Hansen's original hypotheses, i.e., that secular stagnation may be related to declining population.The data of the last few decades suggest that this has already been a problem for countries like Japan, Italy, France, and even Germany to some degree.Looking ahead, this will likely be a major issue in the decades to come.Gordon would add in some other factors as well, including the end of the great economic gains from education, and the rising inequality of income in advanced economies (see Chart 10 below), which tends to exacerbate the excess savings problem because the rich save far more of their income than do the middle class or the poor.Seeking Alpha Contributor Shareholders Unite wrote in December of 2013 that the implication of the Summers Secular Stagnation Hypothesis is that the government should run permanent deficits in order to provide a permanent level of stimulus to the economy.As Shareholders Unite has noted, when you analyze this on a sectoral basis, then according to the national income accounting identity, if the private sector is saving too much, this can only be offset or balanced by the public sector (government) running deficits, or the foreign sector running surpluses (i.e., we export more than we import).We are already doing the former, and have little chance of doing the latter.However, recent data do not suggest an exorbitant US savings rate (see Chart 11 below); therefore, the problem really originates (as mentioned before) in the global savings rate, which may arguably be rising higher than is optimal for growth (see Chart 7 above).The Summers prescription for the US economy may then appear to be, in some ways, a solution looking for a problem.Nevertheless, the problem of stagnant growth remains, not just in the US, but in many advanced economies.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Whatever its cause , and one can certainly see from all of the arguments above that there is room for debate , we are constrained by what we know for certain : 1 ) A drop in the GDP growth trend ( `` hysteresis '' ) and a decline in the rate of GDP growth ( `` super-hysteresis '' ) have definitely occurred in a number of major economies ; 2 ) real interest rates have fallen for decades and may continue to fall ; 3 ) US business spending also appears to be <i>lower</i> than the savings rate ( see Chart 12 below ) , creating an imbalance that is helping drive interest rates even <i>lower</i> ; 4 ) declining total US government spending after 2008 ( see Chart 13 below ) , rather than increased spending as would be expected in the wake of a huge recession ; 5 ) following the enormous balance sheet recession that ended in 2009 , private sector deleveraging and excessive savings rates are definitely ongoing in a number of countries , damaging growth ; 6 ) there is ongoing and prospective damage to economic growth in many countries as a result of negative demographic trends ; 7 ) massive amounts of unproductive debt have accumulated in many different economies , with the US , China , and Japan all displaying <b>astonishing</b> levels of complacency in the face of daunting levels of speculative finance , with very little probability that most of it can be repaid ; and 8 ) spending on productive assets like infrastructure , education , training , and R & D has fallen drastically in some countries , especially the US .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, there are political considerations that will have to be addressed, whatever our final take on the Secular Stagnation Theory and its proposed remedies.Either way, in spite of the uncertainties, and despite political sensitivity on aspects of this question, it is reasonable to suggest that something new should be tried before the curtain is pulled aside (at some point) to reveal a Federal Reserve that is out of ammo or without effective options.Given the rapid decline in our infrastructure especially (see Chart 14 below), the solution appears to be increased spending, either by governments or by Public-Private Partnerships, primarily on infrastructure, but also perhaps basic R & D, training, and education.Our infrastructure spending has declined for years (see Chart 15 below), and our estimated shortfall on needed future infrastructure spending has been estimated at over $1.3 trillion over the next few years (see Chart 16 below); surely that is where we should start.The problem is not the spending itself, since most of it will be productive for economic growth; rather, the problem is all of the money being spent foolishly on unproductive assets and activities.This dilemma can be resolved once we have the will to see it through; I would suggest that the election of 2016 will provide us the opportunity to address this problem, and that we will be as close to a resolution then as we are going to get.Both leading presidential candidates appear to be in favor of infrastructure spending.How they pay for it is a political question.World famous hockey great Wayne Gretzky famously said: "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been."When the election is over, there will be a consensus for major action and a President who wants to take credit for getting something big done.Whatever the merits of the Larry Summers Theory of Secular Stagnation, we know that spending on infrastructure, perhaps in massive quantities, will be on the way.The "puck" is going to be in the infrastructure construction industry soon.Although it may seem early, it is time to start considering investments on infrastructure related companies.I believe that before the campaign is over, there will be at least speculative interest in this idea.I like certain ETF names like I-Shares Global Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: IGF ), SPDR S& P Global Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: GII ), Guggenheim S & P High Income Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: GHII ), and the Proshares DJ Brookfield Global Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: TOLZ ).Unfortunately, there don't seem to be many publicly traded US-focused funds.The US holdings of the above ETFs are listed as 38%, 39%, 39%, and 50% of assets, respectively.Mutual funds focused on infrastructure include the Deutsche Global Infrastructure Fund (MUTF: TOLIX ), which holds 51% US assets, and Nuveen Global Infrastructure Fund (MUTF: FGIYX ), which holds 35% of its assets in US stocks.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: This article is intended to provide information to interested parties.As I have no knowledge of individual investor circumstances, goals, and/or portfolio concentration or diversification, readers are expected to complete their own due diligence before purchasing any stocks or other securities mentioned or recommended.Tagged: Macro View , Economy, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
