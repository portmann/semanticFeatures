Executive Officer, for a discussion of the Company’s results.Thank you, Cathy.Good afternoon.To state the financial loss we experience in the second fiscal quarter, the company remains excited and confident that the foundation we are building will have a rewarding impact for our shareholders, our customers and our company.The financial loss in our second quarter was somewhat larger than originally expected, due to the workforce reduction related costs and customer delays resulting in lower orders and net sales.The implementation of the previously announced workforce reduction in the second quarter resulted in approximately $420,000 of additional cost of which approximately 60% was recorded in operating expenses.The workforce reduction was a continuation of our strategic initiatives to drive companywide efficiencies throughout our operations and improvement in our overall business model.We expect the payback of the workforce reduction related costs through future savings to occur during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.In our previous call, we noted that there were significant orders in our beginning backlog for the second quarter that would not ship until the second half of the fiscal year and that net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were thus expected to increase only moderately as compared to the net sales recorded the first quarter of fiscal 2015.Net sales for the second quarter, however, were actually lower than expected as a result of multiple customer short-term delays of upgrade and equipment shipments preventing the recognition of revenues in the quarter.In the second quarter, we continued to manage all operating expenses closely, including our research and development spending.Our overall operating expenses have continued to decline significantly in all functional areas compared to the prior fiscal year, even after absorbing the cost associated with the workforce reduction.As we previously communicated, an important part of our overall strategic plan is to increase our presence and penetration Europe.We are aggressively responding to the voice of our European customers with new developments, which are specifically tailored to effectively address the unique needs of existing and potential customers in this region.We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to provide real value to processors in this region through our new tailored and flexible developments and solutions, our technology Center of Excellence and customer demonstration centers in Europe, our manufacturing capabilities in Europe for both, vibratory and optical sorting solutions in our enhanced localized customer service and support.In the second quarter, we achieved near record level of European orders in Euros, with several important strategic wins with multiple customers most will significantly in the potato market segment.However, exchange-rate fluctuations negatively affected the U.S. dollars equivalent of our overall European orders in the second quarter by over $1 million, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.We remain positive regarding the existing near-term funnel of opportunities in this region.Subsequent to quarter end, we received a significant order from a new vegetable processor in Europe, which included multiple chute-fed and bank and belt-fed sorters as well as associated vibratory equipment.The addition of our new senior director of EMEA sales is also quickly having a positive impact as we focused on building customer partnerships in this region.We are also beginning to see increased activity in the overall global potato market, more significantly in Europe.Year-to-date orders in the potato segment have increased in all regions compared to the prior year and we expect the potato market to continue to strengthen in the near-term.Orders in North America in the second quarter were lower than expected, with several significant opportunities being delayed to later in fiscal 2015 and potentially into fiscal 2016.In due of significant customer order and related shipment delays, and a net loss in the first half of the fiscal year, the company no longer expects to be profitable in fiscal 2015.Subject to any further negative effects of exchange-rate fluctuations and customer order delays, we continue to believe that it remains reasonable for Key to achieve year-over-year double-digit bookings growth in fiscal 2015.As we previously communicated, in fiscal 2014, we initiated field trials of our new innovative developments.These field placements are continuing to take place with several strategic customers in our core markets both, in North America and in Europe.We are receiving very collaborative interaction and positive and enthusiastic responses from our strategic customers regarding our new developments.We believe, our new solutions will enable us to be successful in existing and new insertion points in our core and adjacent markets in all geographic regions.Our new development field trials include, both our optical sorting and material handling solutions and are focused on three areas of innovation for superior sorting and yield optimization.Advanced product handling designs, next-generation detection technology and smarts sorters and plant information analytics are focused on advanced product handling designs, includes the ability to handle a broad range of products that vary as to shape, size and texture, the ability to support quick product line changes and to ensure minimal sanitation and maintenance requirements.The next-generation detection technology will exhibit enhanced laser scanner and camera technologies, optimized sensor viewing and illumination techniques and proprietary software and algorithms.Further, the use of smarts sorters and plant information analytics will provide sophisticated, intelligent sorting capabilities that minimize operator intervention, customer-specific smart system opportunities and uniquely specifications, and information analytics, data collection, connectivity and integration with plant automation for optimized operations.Our new developments will also deploy the principles of the design-enabled mass configuration or DEMC as well as demand flow technology in our manufacturing operations.With increased configurability modularity, flexibility, cost efficiency, manufacturability and serviceability, we believe, we can have significant positive impact on our overall operating costs, profitability and our customer solution and support strategies.We continue to expect market commercialization of many of our new developments late in fiscal 2015.We remain confident and excited about the foundation we are continuing to build, in our ability to effectively leverage the investments we have made in 2013 through 2015 to propel anticipated profitable growth and increased shareholder value in the future.Thank you, Jack.First I will discuss the second quarter results for fiscal 2015.Second quarter net sales were $21.6 million compared with $31.6 million reported in the same quarter a year ago.Sales of automated inspection systems in the second quarter totaled $7.9 million compared with $17.9 million in the same period a year ago, a 56% decrease.Second quarter net sales of process systems were $7.2 million compared with $7.3 million in 2014, a 2% decrease.Parts and service net sales were $6.5 million versus $6.4 million in the same period a year ago, a 1% increase.During the second quarter, we announced certain cost reduction initiatives.As a result, we incurred approximately $420,000 in costs of which $160,000 and $260,000 were expenses cost of goods sold and operating expenses, respectively, during the quarter.Gross profit for the second quarter was $5.7 million compared with $10.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.As a percent of sales, margins of 26.4% decreased from the 32.5% reported for the same quarter a year ago.Gross margins for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, were down compared with corresponding prior period, due primarily to less favorable product mix and less efficient plant utilization due to lower sales and production volumes.In addition, gross margins were also negatively impacted by the costs associated with the cost reduction initiatives.We continue to actively manage our overall cost structure.As a result, our total operating expenses have decreased significantly as compared to the prior year.Operating expenses of $8.6 million for the second quarter were 39.8% of net sales compared with $11.2 million or 35.5% of net sales for the same quarter last year.Operating expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, were favorably affected compared with the same period in the prior year by cost reduction initiatives taken in both, the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the current quarter, lower R&D expenses and lower commissions on lower sales.These reductions were partially offset by the increased expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives.The net loss for the second quarter was $1.9 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share compared with the net loss of $697,000 or $0.11 per share in the same period last year.I will now discuss our second quarter 2015 orders and backlog.For the second quarter ended March 31st, we recorded new orders of $25.1 million.Last year's second quarter new orders totaled $25.5 million.Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $32.2 million.This compares with $30.8 million at the end of the second quarter last year.The backlog mix at the end of the second quarter was 42% automated inspection systems, 52% process systems and 6% parts and service.For the six months ended March 31, 2015 net sales were $41.7 million as compared to $54.3 million for the same period in the prior year.The net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was $0.60 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of $0.53 per diluted share in the first six months of 2014.Cash at the end of the quarter was $8.3 million compared with $9.7 million at September 30, 2014, and we owe significant customer order and related shipment delays and the net loss in the first half of the year, we believe, we will not be profitable for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.Looking forward, we expect the results in the second half of 2015 to be significantly improved from the losses in the first half of the year.Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 are expected to increase significantly as compared to the net sales records in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Gross margins are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 are anticipated to be fairly consistent as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Thank you, Jeff.As we begin our third-quarter, we are energized by the many positive changes we are making throughout our organization and we are very excited about bringing our new innovative developments and solutions to the market in the near future.We believe all the strategic initiatives will have a rewarding impact for our shareholders, our customers and our company.I am extremely proud of the efforts and commitment of all of our employees and I appreciate the support of our investors.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Hi.Thanks.Good afternoon.Just with respect to Q3 up significantly, I think is what you said from Q2.Would you still be down year-over-year?No.I think, first of all, I guess, Jim, as we said we expect revenues to increase significantly and we expect our results to improve significantly from the losses in the first half.With regards to Q3, obviously, it will still be dependent upon the timing of shipments and potential customer delays, but subject to no further delays, it would not be unreasonable for Key to make money in the third quarter.For shipments to be somewhat unit in that range of the prior year or reasonably.Okay.Jack, just with respect to the geographies, it almost seems like at the moment you are seeing more activity with some of the newer initiatives out of Europe versus North America, where it just sounds like customers are just delaying.Is that a fair way to characterize it?Yes.I think right now, it would be fair to say that in North America we are actually seeing some softness even though potatoes did increase year-over-year in orders.We are still seeing some softness really across all of our core markets.In potatoes, in 2013, as you remember in North America, there was a significant investment by the major players in North America and they are still in the process of absorbing that investment and also a lot of the multinationals have shifted a lot of their investments to other geographies in North American in the processed fruit and vegetables.We are kind of going through a period, where investments are being made in some of the other manufacturing processes such as packaging or sterilization and we would expect to see more of a shift back towards our type of equipment in 2016.In nuts and dried fruit, in North America, there has been slight contraction in nuts and dry fruit, due to a large number of capacity increases in '14 and there are some concerns in North America.For example, the California drought and the strengthening of the dollar as North American producers are challenged to export, so I would say what we are seeing is some opportunities in Europe.North America would be somewhat soft right now, but we see potatoes continuing to strengthen and we see processed food and vegetable strengthening, but more as we get closer to 2016.In Europe, are you seeing any competitive actions from your European competitor to perhaps take advantage of the move in the currency?Absolutely, as the competition continues to be to the fierce.Just a reminder that the real impact in Europe is for those products that we produce in the United States and ship in Europe, so all of our vibratory equipment that we sell in Europe is produced in Europe and all of our chute-fed solutions as well as some of the belt-sorter solutions that we saw in Europe are produced in Europe, but there are certain legacy products today on the optical sorting that we only manufacture in the United States and that is where the toughest price competition comes in, especially with that the currency challenges.You referenced a new vegetable processor in Europe and order that you received subsequent to the quarter.Is this a new customer for you or?It is a very significant win for us and again included a combination of our chute-fed solutions, belt solutions as well as our vibratory equipment, so very important insertion point for us.Is it meaningful from a revenue standpoint or is it just something that is very significant in terms of penetrating this customer?Okay.Just final question, I mean, it sounds like if you are not assuming necessarily any major changes in North America to get to the kind of bookings levels that you would need to get to in the second half or just to achieve low double-digit revenue growth.It sounds like it is going to have to come from Europe.Is that a fair way to look at it?No.When I talked about the orders that been pushed out of the quarter, those were more significantly in North America, so we still are seeing a very important and significant order opportunities for the remainder of the year in North America in all of our four segments.Okay.Jeff, just one minor question just on the restructuring, the charge that you took in OpEx.Where did it hit?Was it split and was it mostly in which line item?Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Rick D'Auteuil of Columbia.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Yes.Just to follow and clarify, I think I heard, Jim, on one of his last questions say how to get to double-digit revenue growth.You guys are not saying revenue growth.You are saying order growth, right?Okay.I just wanted to clarify that, just so we do not have a model out there that is out of sorts.Then just on the new vegetable customer, is this one facility that it is going into or is it multiple facilities, is it a new facility, is it replacing somebody else's equipment?Give me a sense of that.Okay.The opportunity in the future, if the equipment performs well, is not to replace what is on the floor now.It would be if they have other future expansion opportunities?Okay.Just on the quasi guidance you guys gave, so significantly up on revenue.When Jim asked, could you get to last year's number, which was $28 million, it did not seem like it sounded like in that ballpark.That implies 30% revenue growth, and one of the reasons given for the poor gross margin this quarter or a couple of the reasons, were the restructuring charge, the headcount reduction charge and also the inefficiencies from underutilization.With 30% revenue growth and with no drag from the $160,000 that was hitting cost of goods sold this quarter and the benefit from that $160,000 that you are expecting to get in the next quarter, I am having a hard time figuring out how we can keep gross margins only slightly better from these depressed levels.Help me understand that.I think, first of all, the revenues, but it goes along with your statement, the revenues in the second quarter of '14 were about 31.6.Okay.You are right.I guess, I was looking at Jim's estimate for this quarter, so it is more like 50% or 45% increase and we are not going to get any operating leverage from that?We certainly would expect some improvement in the margins as the utilization improves, because we have higher volumes throughout our facilities, but it will all depend upon also that the mix of products that we end up shipping.Year-to-date our AIS shipment have ship only been 34% of total revenues and there will be some significant orders in the third quarter that will be vibratory and that will have an impact of taking it down, so it will really be dependent upon the mix of the products that we ship out.Yes, I know, but you said slight.I would think, if nothing else happened, even if you did not get any operating leverage just the $160,000 going away, plus whatever the savings you get from that $160,000, call it, $80,000.That is $240,000 of gross margin improvement from something that is in the bag already, right?Again, it is hard for me to fathom how at that revenue level that we do not have, a significant gross margin improvement.I understand the mix component that you are referring to, but you did not have a super rich mix in Q2, right?You said 30-something percent?Yes.I mean, is there other issues on the manufacturing side that are not coming out here that we need to know about?No.I think on the manufacturing the real issue, as you know we have improved really on some of the other cost of goods sold there, such as warranties continue to improve, so there really are no other issues.We should improve quite significantly with the utilization with the higher volumes in the third quarter, so there will be some improvement.Like I said, there are some large orders that are more vibratory orientated that have an impact as well, but we definitely will expect some improvement in the... Okay.The automated stuff might be as low as, I do not know half - 15% of the mix or something like that?No.I mean, in the first half of the year was 34.Automated inspections systems were about 34% of the mix and typically it is more in that 45 range.Depending on the timing of some of these large shipments, we will have an impact of how much that mix is and some of these orders we are still working with customers and that is why we are being a little bit careful here, because there are some large vibratory orders that could significantly impact the margins.Separate subject, the delays that you are seeing in the orders, are these primarily customers that we are doing field testing that are not, I mean, I guess, if they delay it further, it means they missed the season, right?That means next year or what does that mean?I think that is a really good question.Right now, we do not believe that there have been significant decisions that are impacted.The orders that we have talked about that were delayed in the second quarter we really have nothing to do with new solutions coming out.It was really more a timing of decisions within these organizations.In fact, we actually think there are situations where it is working to our benefit, because there are insertion points in applications where we are not the incumbent and we do not playing right now and in some of those situation, customers are waiting to get a chance to see the new solutions.We really do not believe that there is a significant negative impact on delays.There might be some, but we do not think it significant and we do see upside associated as well, where some decision are being delay, so they do get an opportunity where in the past we would not have had the opportunity to play.Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Rich Beaven of Signia Capital.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Thank you.Yes.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I am <b>wondering</b> do you feel as though you are experiencing any market share loss in any areas .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That is my first question.Yes.It is a good question.I think, as we said our market share in Europe tends to be very, very small, and we have put a significant amount of focus in that region and we have worked really hard on developing those relationships and partnerships, we had a really strong quarter and we have got a nice funnel of opportunities going into the third quarter and we continue to penetrate with uncertain insertion points that were not incumbent in previously, but it would be to premature to say we have increased our market share in Europe.In North America, we are experiencing somewhat of the softness as I talked about in each of the core markets, but we really do not believe that there is a significant change one way or another with regards to our market share at this point.Okay.Discussing this customer push out, can you help me understand why that is happening?What are the dynamics behind that?I am just trying to understand why the push out continues here.Yes.I think it is really a combination that goes across to all segments.It is a combination of some of them having to, because of the magnitude, getting through their systems in the timeframe to get approved.In some cases, it is part of a large expansion and they are reviewing all the other cost associated with the project that came in higher than what were expected for example in one case, so they are taken and hard to look at how they get that back in alignment with their budget not our related equipment, so in each one there is a little bit of a different explanation, but in each of them there certainly is the intent indications we have had they continue to proceed... Okay.You mentioned the last big order cycle.I think, in the potato market was 2013 - When you see that magnitude of orders hit, typically, from the cycle perspective, how long can they go before ultimately they have to come back to market and we will see some reordering?I mean, can they go three years?Can they go four years?I mean, is this just pending here?How typical is this cycle?Yes.Now, each of the large players are multi-national processors, so a lot of them now have shifted their investments outside of the North America to other regions, but it would not be unusual now with the significance of investments that were made in North America for them to dig down.They will still continue to make replacement orders and some expansion depending upon the facilities and maybe they may do an acquisition, but when they do a major investment in capital like we had in '13, it can be several years as you just suggested before major investments are made again.In this region, like I said, each of them will continue to make major investments, but right now after the investment they made in North America, the investments are many instances have shifted to other geographic regions.Okay.My final question is I think you put out a long-term goal of $160 million to $170 million in revenues and $18 million to $19 million of EBITDA by, I believe, 2017.Are you still comfortable with that?Yes.Obviously, that is heavily dependent on our new solutions and capabilities and ability to penetrate new insertion points in the core and adjacencies and there would not be anything at this time that would have us make a statement that would be different than what we have said previously.Thank you.Our next question is from a follow-up from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Thanks.Sorry for misspeaking on the point I was trying to make about the bookings.Again just going back to the second half, it looks like you need to do orders of $65 million, $66 million to get to double-digit bookings growth for the year?Jack, is there any way you could help us understand, I mean, are we talking about half a dozen customers where there is the potential for some very sizable orders?I am just trying to get a sense as to what this pipeline looks like.It sounds like it is a pipeline that you see as pretty active and a chance where you are going to be able to convert some of these into the bookings and potentially have a pretty strong bookings quarter.Can you help maybe frame that for us?Sure.I think that in the push outside of the of the second quarter, there were between five and ten customers that there were significant orders dollar magnitude that got pushed out and there are also in that range of significant orders that we are hoping to realize in addition to these, in the latter part of the fiscal year as well, so the timing of those is important to hit that number, but there are a number of significant opportunities here that we are working currently.Okay.Potentially, you do not necessarily have to have a blowout bookings quarter in the current quarter, so you can certainly see some of these that are converted in fiscal Q4 and still get to where you hope to be?Yes.It would not require a blowout quarter-to-quarter for that to happened.The issue though becomes that some of these now that are pushed out of the second quarter and some of them that will delay maybe later in the third quarter to the fourth quarter now make it impossible to ship in the fiscal year, which is why we said we could no longer be profitable for the year.Thank you.[Operator Instructions] I am showing no further questions in queue.I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jack Ehren for any closing
