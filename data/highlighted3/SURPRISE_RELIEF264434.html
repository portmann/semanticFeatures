Incorporated’s Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, CFO, Mr. Dan Fujii.Sir, you may begin.Thank you, Latif.Good afternoon.I’m pleased to welcome you to our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call.With me on the call today is Mike Kaminski, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.By now, you’ve had the opportunity to review the press release and perhaps the 10-K which we issued today, a copy of which you can find on the Company’s website at landauer.com.In addition, you will find posted our quarterly results slide deck that highlights key activities and accomplishments related to the quarter.With the filing of the press release today, our objective is to provide additional clarity with some brief opening remarks and then to move to the question-and-answer portion of the call to address any specific questions you have.Before turning the call over to Mike, I need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor provisions contained in our press release, which also governs this conference call, and that certain statements made today are not historical and may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Please refer to the complete Safe Harbor statements contained within the press release as well as the information contained in the Company’s annual 10-K report and other reports filed with the SEC by the Company.Thank you, Dan.Good morning, everyone.In 2015, we met our adjusted financial guidance targets while making significant progress in our business.The fourth quarter financial results were in line with our expectations.For the year, we realized revenue of $151 million, a decrease of $3.7 million versus prior year.The primary items impacting the revenue decrease are a $5.3 million negative FX impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and $4 million from three large non-recurring product sales in fiscal 2014 to the U.S. Military and two international customers that were not repeated in fiscal 2015.Without the negative effect of FX and the non-recurring transactions, revenue grew $5.6 million or 3.8% with growth across all of our core product lines, and in both domestic and international markets.As a reminder, FX impact on our income statement is translational, since the cost and the revenue are generated in local currency.The overall gross margin rate remained essentially flat year-over-year due to the gross margin percentages, improvements in both the symmetry services and informatics products, offset by higher mix in imaging physics service sales which have a lower gross margin rate.Variable costs in the symmetry services were positively impacted by our efforts to institute lien processes.These improvements were seen in lower product costs, improved quality and less customer errors.Operating expenses were down about a $1 million for the year despite incurring unusually high professional fees.Throughout 2015, we developed and refined our strategy around leveraging our broad customer base and our core products to accelerate our growth.We’ve outlined on previous calls that we believe our core products are the symmetry services, imaging physics and informatics, all components of a broader solution associated with the management of radiation for the workers, patients and equipments.As we refined our business strategy and roadmap, it was apparent that our Radon business and the associated product line was not quarter or future success and diluted our focus.Thus in September, we sold the Radon business to a Swedish firm.The Radon business generated $4.7 million in revenue in 2015 which had decreased approximately 20% from 2014.The proceeds from the Radon business will be used to retire debt.Other key accomplishments in 2015 include: The accounting team did an outstanding job in coordinating Company efforts around mitigating the accounting material weaknesses.Dan will talk in detail about the topic as part of his prepared remarks.Our R&D team made significant progress in the development of the verified solid-state dosimetry, which will revolutionize occupational monitoring.We expanded our informatics product with three new introductions including releasing clinical dose optimization services or CDOS, an innovative new product which assists in new patient dose management.Our sales team secured over 500 new imaging physics customers, almost 20% -- up 20%, representing larger regional and national healthcare systems.Our international operations continued to grow the recurring revenue service business in a majority of the markets.We launched our OSL product line in Brazil and expanded our product in nuclear medicine in Australia.Over the past few years, we’ve grown our international business by a compound annual growth rate of 6.5% in constant currencies, driven primarily by the growth in market share.Now turning to 2016, we believe we’re poised to continue growth in our core product platform.The U.S. dosimetry annuity products are expected to continue to grow at a modest pace.This growth is driven by the expansion into professional office segment and continued share growth internationally.We are also forecasting strong revenue growth from our informatics product line, especially in the area of patient dose management.This market need is fueled by increased regulations and changes in hospital accreditation requirements which are generating more data, resulting in the need to aggregate, summarize and highlight actionably steps from big data.In imaging physics, we expect to continue strong double-digit growth along with improvement in operating margins.We are spending our lean process efforts, which to-date have been focused in dosimetry services, into medical physic.On the negative side in 2016, we are forecasting continuing strengthening of the dollar which will result in further negative FX impact as well as increased interest rates impacting our cost of debt.And while we expect recurring revenue to increase, we’re being conservative in forecasting lower equipment sales to the federal government in the year.Operating expenses are expected to be relatively flat, although we’re accelerating R&D and marketing spending which supports our growth initiatives.This will be offset by significantly reducing corporate spending.The key strategic initiatives in 2016 are the development of the verified digital dosimetry platform, the expansion of our informatics products offering, continued growth in the professional offices and driving operational excellence.The top initiative continues to be the commercialization of the verified digital dosimetry platform which is transformational to our business.In 2016, we are planning on rolling out the verified platform in a series of field tests, so we can sure the product performance is up to our standards.These field tests are expected to begin in the second half of calendar 2016.The reason for this conservative approach is that we’re cognizant that Landauer has an exceptional reputation in radiation dose monitoring and we want to assure all aspects of this important platform meet the customer and our expectation before ramping volumes.These tests will evolve from component level field tests to final product testing over several quarters.We’re not planning for any meaningful revenue to be realized until 2017.We continue to view 2016 and 2017 as investment years to assure that we are well-positioned to capitalize on this platform.In 2016, we’ll be investing heavily in the testing of our product and in 2017, we’re planning on investing in the infrastructure needed to ramp the commercial operations.Additionally, we’ll continue to drive operational excellence by instituting a lean culture throughout our Company, resulting in an improved product emergence as well as a simpler business model.We’re also mindful of the need to bring new talent in to help us drive to our full potential.In 2015, we began to transition positions from corporate roles into key R&D, marketing, sales and operating roles.These skills are consistent with the strategic plan and are needed to transform Landauer over the planned period.In summary, in 2016, we expect to deliver solid financial results while implementing our longer term strategic infinitives which will transform our business model.We’re very optimistic about the long-term growth potential.We remain focused on the strategic initiatives, key process improvements and continuing to bring in the skills needed to make this strategy a reality.Thank you, Mike.Revenues for fiscal 2015 were $151.3 million, a 2.4% decrease compared to fiscal 2014.Revenues in the Radiation Measurement segment decreased by $7.6 million year-over-year; unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced revenues by $5.3 million.Revenues at international locations decreased from $37.2 million in 2014 to $30.5 million in 2015.In addition, fiscal 2014 included three large product sales with a total value of $4 million that did not repeat in 2015, including two international product sales and a military sale.Medical physics revenue increased 9.9% versus the prior year, driven by new customer contracts for imaging services.Imaging services revenue increased by $2.2 million or 28%, driven by strong demand for our solutions for the Joint Commission’s new diagnostic imaging requirements.Lastly, our Medical Products revenue grew 6.5% as compared to the prior year, driven by stronger volumes.Operating income for fiscal 2015 was $23.7 million compared with an operating loss of $40 million in the prior year period.As a reminder, results for the fiscal 2014 were impacted by $62.2 million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and $3.8 million in reorganization expenses.Adjusted operating income decreased $700,000 compared to fiscal 2014.However, adjusted operating income margins remained consistent at 16.7% in fiscal 2015 versus 16.8% in fiscal 2014.Professional fees reduced fiscal 2015 operating income by approximately $2 million year-over-year.These expenses were primarily associated with the remediation of the accounting control issues disclosed in the Form 10-K.Turning to the fourth quarter, revenues were $40.2 million, a 4.3% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.Revenues in the Radiation Measurement segment decreased by $3.3 million, unfavorable foreign currency rates decreased revenues by $1.6 million.In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a one-time custom equipment sale of $1.7 million and a large sale to the military of approximately $1.3 million.Fourth quarter revenues in our Medical Physics division grew nearly 15% compared to the same period in 2014, driven by 31% growth in imaging services.In addition, our commissioning service revenue increased significantly during the fourth quarter.However, the commissioning revenue is episodic in nature and subject to fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.Fourth quarter operating income was $6.8 million compared with $7.4 million in the prior year period.The decrease in operating income was driven by lower Radiation Measurement product sales and the negative impact of foreign currency.As Mike mentioned earlier, we divested our non-core Radon business at the end of the fourth quarter and received net cash proceeds of $7 million.We will use these proceeds to pay down debt in the first quarter of 2016.The Radon division contributed approximately $4.7 million of revenue and $800,000 of net income during fiscal 2015.The effective tax rate was 52.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015, increasing the full year effective tax rate to 29.4%.The increase in the tax rate was driven by taxes associated with the Radon divestiture as well as foreign tax expenses.Turning to cash flow metrics, cash provided by operations for the year was $28.3 million, a decrease of $8.4 million over the same period in 2014.The decrease was due primarily to $2.3 million of severance payments.In addition, working capital in fiscal 2014 was positively impacted by the timing of customer collections and vendor payments.We implemented a new IT system in fiscal 2012 which negatively impacted working capital in fiscal 2013 and positively impacted working capital in fiscal 2014, upon stabilization of this system.Our fiscal 2015 investing cash flows included $7 million of net cash proceeds for the sale of our Radon division that I discussed previously.Turning now to guidance, our press release today announced fiscal 2016 guidance.We anticipate aggregate revenues for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $150 million to $157 million.Fiscal 2016 guidance reflects an expected year-over-year reduction in sales due to unfavorable foreign currency rates of $2.9 million.Our fiscal 2016 guidance also excludes revenues from our divested Radon business.Fiscal 2015 revenues excluding approximately $4.7 million of revenues from our Radon business were $146.6 million.The Company anticipates adjusted net income for fiscal 2016 in the range of $15 million to $18 million.Fiscal 2015 adjusted net income was $16.2 million excluding approximately $800,000 from our Radon business.As Mike discussed earlier, we expect operating expenses to be approximately flat in 2016.While we expect professional fees to decrease in 2016, we plan to invest heavily in sales and marketing as well as research and development.The low end of our guidance is below fiscal 2015 results due to: One, higher interest rate assumptions, we are expecting two rate increases in fiscal 2016; two, continued pressure from foreign currency rates, we expect a stronger dollar to impact net income by approximately $400,000 in 2016; and three, we are forecasting a decrease in military sales from $5.8 million to $2.8 million.We have made significant progress on our plans to remediate the internal control weaknesses.We started 2015 with five material weaknesses in controls and made significant progress in remediating all of them.By the end of 2015, we fully remediated two of our material weaknesses and implemented new controls in the other three.Although the process controls have been implemented in the last three, we will need to demonstrate effectiveness over our testing period in 2016, before they will be considerably mitigated.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.Your line is open.Just a question very quickly, regarding the informatics part of the business, you started to kind of call that out just verbally, but can you just give us sense of maybe size and kind of growth expectation there; can you just size that?And I presume that is -- that falls within the Med Physics portion of the business, correct?It falls in Radiation Measurement and Med Physics, and they’re kind of combined together.For example, Radiation Measurement produces reports that people are buying that summarize the data for occupational dose and then Med Physics is doing the same for patient dose, so they’re coming together in the summary data report set that we’re calling informatics.And if you think of the size, it’s grown from roughly $2 million to $2.5 million up to closer to our expectations, our significant growth this year -- in the range of 50% or more.And the interesting part of informatics, it carries a very strong margin; you can imagine the variable cost on this is pretty minor.And then also just a question on the Rad Measurement business, if I do the math wrong and I might be doing such but the domestic business, if you adjust out the military in both the fourth quarter of last year and the fourth quarter of this year, it looks like it was up maybe 15%.Don’t spend a lot of time on the math, I can follow-up.But I’m just curious; it seemed like a pretty strong growth rate, domestic radiation?The business is up.I’d have to do the -- pull out the military.Obviously military swings a lot of Q4 revenue for sure and the year-over-year.We can do that and do a follow-up with you to get that.Yes, no problem.And you did conservatively say that your military expectations, the DOD expectations would be $2.8 million than for ‘16?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's hard obviously , it 's a lumpy business and we 're just being conservative on what we expect to get out of ` 16 and obviously , hopefully we 'll be positively <b>surprised</b> there .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mitra Ramgopal of Sidoti.Your line is open.First, Mike, I know you talked about 2016-2017 being an investment year regards to sales and marketing, and R&D.If you can just give me a sense in terms of as you look at sales and marketing investments, specifically what areas are you looking to really beef up as it relates to bringing in more talent?So, yes, in obviously Verifii, we’re bringing in the digital skill set we need for the R&D and even for the marketing part of that product line.So, if you think that -- that’s the largest part of the investment is, about half of it is Verifii related and then the other half Mitra is we have people coming in for informatics, professional offices and imaging physics growth.So, it’s all -- all the investments are around our strategic initiatives that are really in our core product line.And again, you’re expecting Verifii to really start contributing in fiscal ‘17, pretty much we should see a full year really of disinvesting and getting that off the ground so to speak?And then now with the new regulations in place that should be helping the Medical Physics business.If you could just remind us in terms of -- what are the regulations in terms of the timeframe for these offices to be compliant and after a few months now, what are you seeing?And now you said you’re certainly signing up new customers but in terms of the expectations for year one versus year two, if you can maybe help us in terms of the growth there?So, the TJC regulations began to be implemented in July of last year, right, and the CT went in.The timeframe for when a hospital has to be compliant is based on their renewal or their accreditation cycle which is every three years.So, depending on when they’re going to come up for the next cycle would be the timeframe that they’re looking at, the new regulations and how they impact their processes.Now, we’ve seen a constant stream and interest around driving compliance in their hospitals.Obviously we anticipate strong growth rate to continue in ‘16; we’ll have to look past ‘17.But the thorough part of the regulations we believe would be implemented in ‘16; they may drift into ‘17 based on timing but we think it’d be the summer of ‘16 just based on what we know now, which would add more requirements to hospitals.So, all of that, what’s happening is, that’s driving a lot of data that the hospitals need to collect in order to be compliant; it also drives new imaging processes that they need to comply with, all of which fuels the fire for the third party to come in and provide more and broader services.And so CDOS emerged data that’s a clinical dose information, and obviously some of the expanded contracts we have on just equipment management has emerged out of it.So, we anticipate a strong ‘16.We think the ‘17 will be a mirror of that but it’s early to call that but we anticipate, still feel it for awhile.And I know you’ve already divested the Radon business.As you look in terms of the other businesses you have right now, is there anything else you sort of feel like you probably better off if you were to divest it?We continue -- Dan, and I continue to look at that question.Obviously we think the core businesses that we’re disproportionately investing in the core businesses and we think there is a lot of synergy, and that would be dosimetry service, informatics and imaging physics.We think that an investment there paid off disproportionally.So, we’re shifting investments there.The non-core we continue to look at and so what is that mean for the non-core, right?Yes, and we’ll continue to evaluate the future cash if we can grow it versus if to monetize it.So, I think it’s a continuous process; it’s an update that more wants and we’ll continue to have updates on that as we go quarter-to-quarter.And then finally, I know Dan, if you look back at this last quarter, I think there was just over 1 million of sort of good position [ph] re-og or non-recurring costs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was just <b>wondering</b> if there were any other one-time items that might have been in there that we should be adjusting for .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I think that summary is good summary of the unusual or non-recurring expenses.So, yes, everything else will be pretty well discussed in the MD&A and the 10-K.[Operator Instructions] And as there appear to be no further questions in queue, at this time I’d like to turn the call back over Mr. Fujii for any closing remarks.Thank you gentlemen, and thank you everyone for your participation.That does conclude your program.You may disconnect your lines at this time.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Have a <b>wonderful</b> day .
