the financial results, I would like to explain and make a few comments regarding the Kumamoto earthquake of 2016.I just went to the site on Sunday last week and just seeing is believing.I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to those who were affected by the earthquake.And DoCoMo will make utmost efforts for the restoration of services.We would like to do our maximum, our utmost, whatever we can.In terms of service areas, actually, as of yesterday, 27 April, all the areas within Kumamoto or around Kumamoto have been resumed to normal operations.There were some off-limit zones, restricted areas, but we requested them to give us - grant us access and we provided the car-mounted base station units to provide coverage in those areas.I won’t go into the details today but we have summarized the activities that we have undertaken in response to the Kumamoto earthquake in a separate presentation.So, please refer to them later.Now, I would like to begin my presentation regarding the financial results for the year ended March 2016 and the prospects for fiscal ‘16.Now, we have to begin with the financial highlights on Page 2.This is the highlight of the results.Operating revenues increased by 3.3% year-on-year and reached ¥4.5271 trillion.Operating income increased by 22.5% and reached ¥783 billion so recorded an increase in both revenues and income.Along with the recovery of telecommunications business, the profit from Smart-Life related business also increased.And due to cost efficiency improvement we have achieved a recovery in operating income.Operational numbers are also favorable as you can see net additions increased 1.34 year-on-year to 4.37 million.New billing plan subscriptions amounted to 29.7 million 1.57 times increase compared to March a year ago.And the DoCoMo Hikari subscriptions amounted to approximately 1.6 million as of the end of March.Slide number 3, these are the net selected financial data.In addition to what I just explained, I would like to explain the following.Net income increased by ¥138.3 billion to ¥548.4 billion, a significant increase over the previous year.As I said at the end of the third quarter, due to the termination of NOC TV service, we recorded deferred tax assets and that’s the reason why we have saved some enterprise or corporate tax payment.Capital expenditures decreased by ¥66.5 billion to ¥595.2 billion.Although we have made efforts for the reinforcement of network in a very efficient manner, we were able to save the total capital expenditures to below ¥600 billion for fiscal 2015 and free cash flow increased by ¥3.2 billion to ¥598.7 billion.Segment results on page 4, telecommunications business that you see at the top.We have achieved an increase in both revenues and income.Revenues increased by ¥35.2 billion and income increased by ¥48.8 billion.The cost efficiency efforts kicked in here too.In the middle, the Smart-Life business, operating revenues increased by ¥60.8 billion year-on-year and operating income increased by ¥48.8 billion.Other businesses, as you see at the bottom, operating revenues increased by ¥45.8 billion and operating income increased by ¥22.3 billion.The two boxes combined, is what we call the Smart-Life related businesses.In terms of Smart-Life related business, we achieved an increase in both revenues and income and we have made our progress greater than expected and the income from Smart-Life related businesses.So, when you divide between Telecommunications business vis-à-vis the Smart-Life related businesses, each of them contributed 50% each to operating income over the previous year.Slide number 5, this analyzes the year-on-year changes behind the operating income.And as you can see at the bottom, operating revenues increased by ¥143.7 billion.On the other hand, operating expenses decreased by ¥300 million.Due to cost efficiency improvement, we achieved an improvement in expenses.And as a result, operating income increased by ¥144 billion over the prior year.Mobile communication service revenues improved, optical fiber business revenues increased even after the market supporting impact, telecommunication services revenues increased over the prior year.And other operating revenues increased due to the contribution from the Smart-Life business.And on the expenses side, the expenses relating to Smart-Life business increased but due to our efforts for cost efficiency improvement, the expenses overall was almost flat or even in a negative territory compared to the previous fiscal year.And therefore we were able to achieve an increase of ¥144 billion in operating income which reached ¥793 billion for fiscal 2015.Operational performance on slide number 6, net additions increased by 1.34 million to 4.37 million, net number portability out-fold improved by 70% to only 100,000.And churn rate was maintained at a very low level of 0.62%.So, all these indicators showed improvement on a continual basis.And with respect to the churn rate, the dCard and DoCoMo Hikari subscribers’ churn rate in particular have been quite low.Actually, those customers’ churn rate is only about half of the average churn rate.So we believe that dCards or dOptical fibers business is generating synergies with our mobile phone business.Slide number 7, these are the sales data.Total handsets sold, was 26.06 million units of which smart new sales accounted for 11.61 million units up 29% year-on-year.Smartphone sales, was 15.44 million due to the demand for a second mobile phone.Tablet sales increased by 27% year-on-year and with 2.18 million units.New billing plan on page 8.So, the April 12, the total number of subscriptions increased to more than 30 million.And we are seeing continuous increase in the uptake of the new billing plan and the data usage has been rising.And therefore we have made progress in up-selling customers to larger data buckets.And those subscribing with larger data buckets over 90% of the total which is significantly different from two years ago when we introduced the new billing plan.And those subscribing impact with larger data buckets account for over 90% of the total which is significantly different from two years ago when we introduced the new billing plan.And the 1 gigabyte top-up rate has also been increasing.So, leveraging the new billing plan, we have been able to up-sell customers.And at one point in the future, we were quite dubious, we were quite doubtful, we thought that this might have been a failure.But now the new billing plan is setting us the foundation for our recovery and turnaround of business.Slide number 9, these are the new billing plan additions that we have implemented starting March.And there are some new plans to be implemented starting June of this year.On March 1, we have introduced a share pack 5, as a new plan for low usage customers and also we have expanded applicability of the Kake-hodai Light Plan starting March 1.And from June 1, we will be introducing two new courses to provide choice between customers one with a cancellation fee and another without a cancellation fee.And also, for long-term users, we have decided to expand the discounts offered under the DoCoMo discount-discount.And also we have also decided to provide customers with reward points for contract renewal starting June 1.As I said, the new billing plan now has more than 30 million subscribers.And this is enjoying great reviews by customers.But actually this is because we are providing long-term users with greater privileges.That’s the reason why we believe the new billing plan is receiving great reviews.Now in 2014 and 2015, what is the size of the discount, the negative impact of the new billing plan?Actually, the Zutto DoCoMo Discount had a size of ¥100 billion of negative, because this is the amount that we throw back to customers in terms of the profits.So, on these new three packages that we plan to introduce this fiscal year will have a full-year impact negative impact of about ¥70 billion.So these are the efforts that we’re undertaking in order to grow our profits on the part of customers.So of course this is going to be a discount but we are on the other hand going to undertake cost efficiency improvement measures and also try to up-sell customers in order to absorb the negative impact from these additional discounts that we offer this year.So, we tried to show that in the end of the year.Basically, the whole idea is to improve customer satisfaction by improving the services offered to customers and also we would like to achieve sustained growth as a company at the same time.We believe we have to fulfill these two things at the same time.And we would like to make utmost efforts to reach this goal.Slide number 10, DoCoMo Hikari Optical Fiber business.As of the end of March, the cumulative number subscription applications amounted to 1.84 million.As you can see on the right hand side, there are boxes in which you see numbers like 30%, 50%, 60%.30% of the subscribers have already migrated to the larger data buckets.And more than 50% of these DoCoMo Hikari subscription application users have our new subscribers to our mobile phone service.And over 60% of them have opted to join the share pact.The share pact of the Kake-hodai and [indiscernible] service in order to share the data buckets amongst the customers.So the customer recommendations provided by the staff of the shops are now well appreciated by customers.Slide number 11, ARPU and MOU recovery continues.The aggregate ARPU for the fourth quarter inclusive of the impact of the monthly support reached ¥4,260, an increase in the usage by the customers and also increase in the DoCoMo Hikari subscribers such that to the continued recovery trend.As for voice ARPU, it is ¥1.230 compared against the previous quarter it seems to be a 10-year decline.However, there is a de-settlement of the excess charge that was applicable for the fourth quarter.The impact thereof was ¥10.So, therefore it has essentially remained flat.Voice ARPU has remained flat.Packet ARPU ¥2,140 increased the demand for the second handset and increase in traffic has allowed upward trend to continue.DoCoMo Hikari ARPU was ¥90.And it was growing in line with the increased CND subscription.Slide number 12, Smart-Life business and other businesses operating income.Fiscal 2015 was 2.4 fold increased against the previous year reached ¥78.7 billion.Now, we made an upward revision after the first six months to ¥70 billion, however we have exceeded that upward reverse plan by ¥8.7 billion.The flag services are showing increase, Smart-Life business and other businesses, so three businesses, so five businesses altogether.So from the top, the contribution to profit, are as follows percentage wise.Content services 30%, finance payment services contributing 10%, group company’s 20%, enterprise solutions 10%, support services for customer peace of mind contributed 30%.So that is the breakdown.So, content and support services are the major drivers in the increase in profit.Now for your reference, the transaction volume in the Smart-Life related business are these are not of course straight contribution to profit but the transaction volume actually extended up to ¥3 trillion for fiscal year 2015.We want to further increase the transaction volume for Smart-Life business going forward.D-market subscription it reached 15.54 million.That represents 1.3 fold increases on a year-on-year basis, and the increase in D-market subscriptions, continue.On the right hand side you’ll find some of the major services, six major services and the number of subs for the major services are indicated.Slide number 14, the D-market usage per subscriber it reached ¥1,370 that represents 20% increase on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter.So, therefore steady increase continues.Slide number 15, from December we began to leverage the dCard and the dPoint program.As for dCard subscription at the end of March reached 16.43 million.We hope that we’ll be able to realize the ¥20 million target as soon as possible.And also for the net assets in the fourth quarter reached 220,000 we went to further accelerate that.Now dPoint, dPoint club numbers reached 58 million.So, it has expanded and dPoint card registrants reached 3.66 million.These are active registrants.And going forward we hope that the active registrants can further expand.Slide number 16, in group companies.These are something group companies that are contributing to the increase in profitability.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Three companies that I want to introduce in particular starting with Oak Lawn Marketing , Cerafit and <b>Wonder</b> Core , they have sales of ¥ 3 million , I actually purchased these products so I 'm contributing to the sales .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And in the center we have the ABC Cooking Studio.Membership and number of shops are steadily increasing.It is now active, the number of shops increased to 130.And we are expanding outside Japan, so we are solidifying our base outside Japan as well.As a third example, as DoCoMo Healthcare, this is joint venture with Omron Healthcare.Karada-no-Kimochi, karada-no-Tokei, these subscriptions are also expanding and also on top of that we add our [indiscernible] healthcare pack which was rolled out from April 19 this year.This is also enjoying very popularity.We believe that these services will indeed contribute towards increased profitability.Slide number 17, this shows the plus D initiative we are partnering with very large number of partners in collaboration.So DoCoMo is behind the scenes and using DoCoMo’s assets, so we are inviting various partners to be active.And we have shown a great deal in fiscal 2015, we have had 49 partnerships signed.And as of April 21 this number increased up to 53 partners.And also quite recently IoT to the left you’ll find Kobe City.That logo, the logo of the Kobe City is indicated as of April 18, together with the mayor of Kobe City and myself, we had a joint press conference.And with some Bluetooth, we’re offering monitoring services for kids as well as for senior citizens.And also mobile data and also using that data together with City of Kobe, they want to further improve their operational efficiency through these services.And this is the backdrop of this partnership.Now, even prior to the signing of this initiative, with the City of Kobe, we were involved in some initiatives and trials beforehand.And based on the results of that trial, we believe it’s a step forward with our relationship.Slide number 18, this relates to network.Of course LTE network, the LTE base stations reach 138,000, this actually exceeded the planned 130,000.The premium 4G base stations reached 22,800.This again exceeds the plan of 18,000.This line may be difficult for you to see but that is this current situation.Now, the numbers of cities covered, as you can see, 176 cities across Japan.And also we’re offering such as 44 cities 200 megabit per second.And also we want to further offer further services.We’re adding carrier aggregation using 3.5 gigahertz band.And this will allow us to provide 270 megabit per second speed.And at the same time, we want to increase bandwidth by providing three carrier aggregation, and leveraging that we’ll be able to offer Japan’s first fastest speed 275 megabit per second.We will start that service as well.As for CapEx, we’ll realize capital, we’ll realize improved deficiency but at the same time we’ll also offer large number of base stations exceeding our plan.And we want to provide breadth, speed and comfort of our LTE network and these are all improving at a very steady pace.Slide number 19, cost divisions improvement.For fiscal 2015, we realized ¥240 billion in cost reduction and on a cumulative basis - cost efficiency has reached ¥260 billion.Of course the company as a whole is working.And as a result of work with our partners we’re able to realize ¥20 billion higher cost reduction against the annual target of ¥220 billion.And we’ll seek leaned management and for fiscal 2016 we’ll further make efforts to improve cost efficiency.Slide number 20, this is the result snapshot of fiscal year 2015.This I believe is self-explanatory.But you’re seeing growth in profit of this more affiliated business and also we’re realizing, recovering in mobile communication business based on new billing plan.And as a result the cost efficiency has improved.And with these three pillars, we’ve been able to realize increase in both operating revenue and operating income for fiscal year 2015.Now, if I may add, for the Smart-Life business segment, the contribution from that segment and also contribution from the recovery in the mobile telecommunication business were actually equal, 50% each.So that is a breakdown of the contribution of the profit of these sectors which means that Smart-Life related business has really grown in terms of its profitability, that is illustrated.Now, turning to page 22, this relates to fiscal 2016 forecast.As for operating revenue, ¥4.62 trillion, an increase of ¥92.9 billion in operating income, expecting ¥110 billion, increase of ¥127 billion, so, increase in both operating revenue and operating income.Now, operating income target of ¥110 billion, this also includes the impact of the change in the depreciation method, roughly ¥50 billion.As regards to the change in the depreciation method, we’ll explain in greater detail in the next page.As for CapEx, second from the bottom, we will solidify and enhance network but at the same time pursue further improved efficiency.And on a year-on-year basis, we anticipate ¥10.2 billion increase and CapEx is expected to be ¥585 billion.So this is going to dip below ¥600 billion.As for free cash flow, on the bottom column, we anticipate roughly the same as the previous year, ¥600 billion.Improvement of the impact of the installment claims and also improved efficiency capital expenditure will contribute.Now, this is like preaching to be Buddha.But we’re going to change from declining balance method in our depreciation.This will kick-in from fiscal year 2016 as you’re probably already aware, with the change in the depreciation method.In the initial phase that is 2016, depreciation cost will shrink.So therefore there is going to be temporary increase in profitability as a result of the change and the depreciation method.But the over a certain span of time, the impact from the change of depreciation method and the amount thereof will be roughly the same.However, in the early years, there is going to be a positive impact from the change in depreciation method.So CapEx, for fiscal year 2016 and CapEx for fiscal year 2017 will also have an impact.But we anticipate that there is going to be certain impact at this stage.Slide number 24.So, as for operating income for fiscal year 2016, I mentioned it is ¥110 billion.This includes ¥50 billion impact from the change in depreciation.So the positive impact from the change will be ¥50 billion.The target number for us should be ¥860 billion in terms of operating income.That is the operating income which we should be pursuing in against this backdrop.Slide number 25, so these are the key targets for fiscal year 2016.On the left hand side, this excludes the impact of the change of depreciation method that is ¥160 billion, ¥120 billion for Smart-Life business and other business, cost division improvement ¥440 billion impact, CapEx ¥585 billion.And on the right hand side, we have indicated to you the medium term targets for fiscal 2016.So, we’ve been able to clear these targets and we want to achieve these targets one year ahead of plan.Slide number 26, relating to shareholder returns.Dividend, this is one of the more critical challenges for the management.We have always aspired to continue to provide stable dividend to date.With improvement in recovery and also with expanding free cash flow and considering the projection for the future, we have decided to increase our dividend by ¥10 per share up to ¥80 for fiscal year 2016.Now, on the bottom, you will find reference to share repurchase.We announced the share repurchase program in third quarter.And we have been authorized to carry up to ¥500 billion in share repurchase.With the tender offer, we’ve been able to already realize ¥200 billion next year we purchase.So as for the remainder ¥20 billion, that will be the upper limit.And starting from May 2, we’ll begin to buy the share repurchases, shares rather from the marketplace.Going forward we’ll make efforts to further enhance shareholder return and also divert to improve capital efficiency.So, ladies and gentlemen, that is the final page.Over the last couple of years, we have made efforts to restore competitiveness with introduction of iPhone, new billing plan and also DoCoMo Hikari program, we’ve made these challenges.And with these reform and change, we’ve been able to improve and restore our competitiveness.Also, more recent, we made further efforts in terms of improving cost efficiency and also in terms of reviewing our profitable business.And as a result, we became much leaner company.And thereby identify a path toward future growth.For fiscal year 2016, we want to focus on plus D.In other words, pursuing and solidifying and enhancing open collaborations with the partners, we will also expand to profit growth in the Smart-Life related business.And we want to transition from recovery of profit to something beyond that, a year where we can make a significant vibrant leap forward.So, fiscal 2016 is where DoCoMo will make significant progress and vibrant progress.And we hope to solicit your understanding and your support.Thank you for your attention.Please let us know your name and affiliation before you begin your question.The gentlemen in the first row please.My name is Masuno from Nomura Securities.I’ve got three questions.First, relating to the change of depreciation, I would just like to organize the impact here?So, the change of depreciation it says etcetera here and that is supposed to have an impact of ¥50 billion.So, when I look at the projection of depreciation, it is expected to come down by ¥170 billion.I think that relates to the system change, method change.But then, what is the GAAP?The GAAP is like ¥130 billion, so does that relate to an increase in expenses and is that the reason why you have only GAAP of ¥50 billion?And the telecommunication facilities, is expected to increase by ¥70 billion.And so the depreciation amount is going to come down by ¥170 billion.But the impact that you assess here, can you explain to me what’s the impact that you’re talking about?I would like to give a rough explanation.And anybody else can follow me up if there is any additional comment.Again, I don’t want to preach on the Buddha but the depreciation for fiscal ‘16 is estimated to have ¥200 billion impact from the change of depreciation method.This is non-cash impact but we would like to have, we’re trying to alleviate the impact on the subsequent years as much as possible.So, ¥150 billion of that savings will be appropriated for measures to alleviate the impact, because we have used this declining method, declining method.And therefore there is a residual value in the final years.We’ll try to write them off as part of this process.And also, we are going to have some accelerated depreciation and that’s the reason why we anticipate a ¥150 billion.And also further out of this ¥150 billion, in order to alleviate the impact on the subsequent years, we have to smartly support program and we have looked into May’s ways to alleviate the impact of monthly support.So, on a net-net basis, that’s the reason why we have come up with this ¥50 billion.We would like to use this ¥50 billion for profit increase.But of course we all like to consider as we run going forward.So, ¥585 billion is the projection for this fiscal year for CapEx.And the depreciation will change will also have an impact on CapEx.And not really relating to the change of depreciation.But ¥160 billion or ¥150 billion is the current estimation.And also we have also reduced the CapEx over the years.And that will have an impact on fiscal ‘16 numbers.Did I explain it all?And if that’s the case, in terms of accounting depreciation amount itself, the decrease of depreciation only has a ¥165 billion impact in itself right?So how should I put this?The planned capital expenditure is ¥178 billion coming down and ¥165 billion out of that relates to depreciation method change.So, including accelerated depreciation.So, originally you had anticipated ¥200 billion decrease in depreciation and there could be some ups and downs.But ¥165 billion is the decrease that the authentic decrease.So, other than the accelerated depreciation of your facilities, there are some discount budgets.And that is going to increase significantly right, the fund, financing those discounts?Well, the main thing is the depreciation change and that is going to have a ¥200 billion impact first of all.And then how to use the saving and depreciation when we consider this I think because this ¥200 billion is non-cash operating income boost.So we would like to use this for non-cash related purpose that’s the basic philosophy.So, as I said the residual value, ¥80 billion and that is going to be, we are going to write that off in two years’ time.So in the first year ¥160 billion, the remaining of that is going to be the actual amount of impact.But as it was mentioned ¥180 billion that you mentioned relates to depreciation change and also because of the decrease in baseline beginning of that year amount.And other than that there are some write-off of the laws on disposal of the loss on property and private equipment.And those are going to be accelerated in terms of write off because that’s the plan, that’s also included in the plan.And also other than that monthly support, we relate to decreased amount of monthly support in the future.And this is going to have a cash-out impact.So to some extent we will be using the savings for that purpose.So, altogether how do the ¥200 billion impact?¥150 billion of that will be appropriated for those purposes and remaining ¥50 billion here is now calculated in the boost of operating income.Now, again, sorry to be persistent here, but it’s very good, it’s very healthy to utilize these savings for subsequent year impact.But according to your explanation, the incremental portion has ¥40 billion in the residual value.So, cash expenses is likely to increase significantly according to my understanding.But in the plan, apparently it’s a decrease.So I think there is a lot of cash, non-cash expenditures.It’s very good that my, it’s a very healthy thing.But I’m just trying to confirm my understanding is correct?So, there are non-cash but there are significant amount of cash outs right, is that correct?All right.The second question is about the point that you mentioned that the low usage customers and the discounts offered to the long term subscribers.Mr. Kato mentioned that altogether there is going to be ¥70 billion impact from the new menus that you introduced this time around.So, is that a full-year impact?Yes, some of that is going to start from June.So, it’s not full-year impact.But when you calculate on a full-year basis, we believe these will have a ¥70 billion impact onto discount impact.Yes, share pack 5 also included.So, all these three elements, altogether combined ¥70 billion impact.So that’s the full year projection.Now, and also the MIC has requested to eliminate excessive cash subsidies on the handsets.How do you recognize that?We haven’t really balanced that out.So the price discount is going to come first.But then after that we’ll try to, I’m not sure if we can balance out that completely.So the price reduction is going to come first.I think that should come first.And we’ll try to absorb that to cost efficiency improvement efforts.And at the same time, as a baseline, we would also like to work to up-sell customers so that we can recover overall on a net-net basis.And then, as for the handset sales practice, we just started the new practice.So we would like to carefully monitor what is happening in the environment and make decisions as appropriate.So, if there is anything we have to respond to the market so, we have to be well prepared.And the guidelines from the MIC is just, it only came out one month ago, less than one month ago.So, there was some misunderstanding on our part.So, you had given instructions from the ministry.But we will try to accommodate a request as much as possible and implement appropriate measures.Again, the Zutto DoCoMo Discount, when you introduced this, initially you mentioned that the impact is likely to be insignificant to the press.And according to my investigation, I think the size is quite significant, ¥70 billion?The Zutto DoCoMo discount impact when you look into that, actually after the introduction of the new billing plan, we have applied all the discounts from the initial ones.So because we have long-term, so many long-term users on our network, so when you add this up, we believe there is a significant negative impact from the Zutto DoCoMo Discount.So as it turns out for the fiscal year, fiscal ‘15, it had ¥100 billion impact on our profits.So we made a downward revision in fiscal ‘14 and that was already anticipated.And on top of that there was some negative impact from the new introduction of the new billing plan, first because in the initial month of the new billing plan introduction, 10 times greater number of customers have signed up for the new billing plan.And many of them signed up for the cheapest data package.And that had a negative impact on a full-year basis.So, that’s the reason why we had decided to make downward revision on our guidelines as at the end of the first half.But over the years, we have been able to up-sell customers to larger data buckets.And we have been successful in regaining the whole family.And that’s the reason why we were able to achieve a recovery.So, after listening to your story, I understand my misunderstanding.In order to avoid any confusion, let me reconfirm.The ¥70 billion impact, is because you have reinforced the discounts of the Zutto DoCoMo Discount.It’s not only the reinforced portion?No, this accounts for only the reinforced portion, the ¥70 billion.So, Kake-hodai Light expanded the applicability that accounts for us quite a sizeable bulk of this ¥70 billion.I cannot comment on the precise breakdown.And also, the two selectable courses will also have a good impact because cancellation fee cannot be charged.All right, so, I understand now.So, the ¥70 billion impact also is inclusive of the point program impact?And the policy of rewarding customers, because of the impact of the depreciation method, so I’m not really sure what will be the right policy for shareholder returns?So, I do have a benchmark at 50% payout ratio.What is your plan for shareholder returns?Well, our basic policy is to continue stable dividend payment.And as a consequence of that, our payout ratio has come up and I think we are one of the highest intent of the payout ratio.It’s not that we are going to maintain the payout ratio.We are going to continue stable dividend payments.And the payout ratio is only a result of that but we are aware of that to some extent but that’s the basic policy.Thank you very much for that.We’ll take the next question.We’d like to go to the gentlemen in the third row, please.Thank you, from Merrill Lynch, Kinoshita is my name.Two questions.My first question, this goes back to the earlier question by Mr. Masuno.In the initial year, I understand the situation I understand that before the next fiscal year, when we consider next fiscal year and onwards, I know that you’ve been very restrictive, you’ve restrained yourself.But then, CapEx budget, however, so CapEx is larger than your depreciation.It depends on the facility, but in a natural manner, depreciation actually could actually continue even at increase, even under the straight line method.That is a possibility.But for the next fiscal year, what is the level of depreciation you would envision?And also, this fiscal year, ¥150 billion would be utilized for this purpose, out of that ¥40 billion will be to your disposal of the residential value.But what about the rest, will this be eliminated, will this be gone in the second year?So, can you share with us your thoughts about the cost for this fiscal year and also the envisioned depreciation for the next fiscal year?Thank you very much.Thank you.The impact of the review of the depreciation method this time around for fiscal year 2016 this will be the first year.And I believe that the impact will probably span over maybe three-year period.We can anticipate benefit, in fact for a three-year period.So, ¥20 billion for this fiscal year, next fiscal year it will be somewhat less than that I would imagine.I cannot give you concrete numbers.But it will be in the realm of ¥100 billion thereabouts, it would be in the realm of ¥100.Now, how to utilize that?We have not yet decided anything on this particular matter.So, how will we leverage this and how will this be channeled to profitability?We have not yet structured that at this moment.When the timing comes, when the proper timing comes we will share with you that information.But the impact of the depreciation is not going to exceed ¥100 billion.That is our anticipation.So, I understand the impact.But based on this fiscal year, the depreciation, will it increase next fiscal year, or will it come down?You mean the impact will be in the positive territory.However the level of positive impact will be smaller as we go down the subsequent year.So, it’s again preaching to Buddha, but on a year-on-year basis, yes.The impact will be smaller, so I just wanted to confirm that.For this fiscal year, your planned depreciation is ¥484 billion, that is the depreciation right?No, for this fiscal year, the one-off cost for this fiscal year, aside from the disposal that’s usual value.Will it be gone next fiscal year is that what you have in mind in other words, this fiscal year, depreciation ¥20 billion right, but the impact is ¥50 billion right?For the next fiscal year, the impact of the depreciation will be smaller.So the one-off cost will be smaller than that that’s my question for the next fiscal year?As far as that’s concerned we have not yet fully structured that yet.And so, at appropriate time we will share that information with you.Thank you very much.My second question and a more simple question, Smart-Life related business for the next fiscal year.Operating income is expected to go down right?Is that due to the disposal MMBI is that one-off cost for MMBI disposal?For the fourth quarter, Smart-Life related business operating income actually went down.Is that due to the disposal MMBI, is that one-off cost, is that the case?For the fourth quarter, there wasn’t too much profit.That is because of the write-down of MMBI because we’re going to withdraw from the services.So breakdown, we immediately had breakdown of that.And aside from that, in the subsidiary firms, Smart-Life business related, Smart-Life subsidiary firms, there were several write-downs among some of the subsidiaries, so that impact was there.So that being the case we have not seen too much increase in operating income for the fourth quarter.Yes.It seems as though it’s come down.But on this page, on the bottom on this point, ¥74.2 billion that’s the Smart-Life related business.I used a different slide, that’s ¥78.8 billion.I did not explain that but MMBI if you exclude both then that’s what it looks like.Now for fiscal 2015, the period that was over, some unrelated business group operating company subsidiary firms write-downs had been reflected.So if you exclude that then roughly it would come to ¥90 billion.That is the current capacity of DoCoMo in terms of Smart-Life related business.Next fiscal year, we want to increase that up to ¥120 billion in terms of operating income that is our plan for the next fiscal year.Thank you.Now, we’d like to take the next question, fourth row from the very far corner of the room.My name is Takahashi from Mizuho Securities.Regarding the Smart-Life related area, Mr. Kato mentioned that the transaction amount has come to, has risen to ¥3 trillion.But if you compare with the previous fiscal year, what is the incremental portion?The previous year transaction volume was ¥2.7 trillion and this has come up to ¥3 trillion, so more than 10% increase.Okay, good.Now, regarding that you said that ¥80 billion slightly less than ¥80 billion was GLP from Smart-Life business.So, I think the profit margin is about 3% right, but this is a transaction volume.So, when the transaction amount increases going forward, when you consider to do a profit margin, how would that be, how will that fare?So, please when you look at the profit margin, vis-à-vis the transaction amount, this may look like it’s coming down because we are now focusing on first, on increasing the transaction amount first that is handled on the Smart-Life business.And after that I think the profit margin will follow and begin to increase, that’s the basic policy.Now I understand, thank you.The next question is about related to the previous question.Regarding this year’s plan, this year’s EBITDA is expected to come down because the cash cost is going to come up by ¥150 billion that’s the assumption that I believe, so cash cost is going to increase by ¥150 billion right.It seems to be that way, is that correct.So what kind of cost are you anticipating to increase, for what reason, can you explain on that point?All right then, EBITDA when you look at the EBITDA for, if you compare fiscal ‘16 versus fiscal ‘15, there is a decrease of ¥56 billion approximately in fiscal ‘16.This relates to the use of ¥150 billion savings we are going to appropriate this Direct Wari discount in order to save the spending on multi-support discount program and because we have decided to reduce the gross margin of the handsets.And also the cash payments relating to MMBI withdrawal exit, we have to do the remaining business disposals.So we have to pay cash payments for the cancellation charges altogether.So ¥50 billion altogether are set aside for that.So if you recalculate, bring this back into the calculation, then I think EBITDA will remain flat almost in our coming projection.So, because you are planning ¥100 billion or so increase in revenues, so I thought that the expenses should be much higher than that?Right.But out of that ¥200 billion of depreciation change and ¥150 billion additional savings, how to appropriate that, if you look at the cash spending ¥50 billion to ¥60 billion is the cash expenses.So it’s not a significant increase in my point of view.Thank you.Morgan Stanley, Tsusaka is my name.Thank you very much.Now, this time around you had a target of ¥160 billion as operating income target.So, you are aiming to well exceed the plan you are achieving the target one year ahead of time, you’re exceeding the plan as well, so that’s commendable.Now, the number targeted at 4, please go the 2017, what you mentioned that you will achieve you actually over-exceeded that.So, the directionality is not yet very clear.So the subsequent directionality is not yet clear after achieving these targets well ahead of your plan.Now you mentioned the changes in depreciation where you talked about cash items, you talked about temporary, non-temporary items, so the situation very unclear.So, at the end of the day, operating income that DoCoMo will aim at going forward, what is it going to be?Is that you, I suppose you’ll take initiatives that you will not dip below this target?So what is it that what you were aiming for fiscal year 2017, have then been revised at this juncture, that’s my question?And also, what are you aiming for at this operating income target, what are you aiming at in terms of your operating income target at this juncture?The reason why we did not revise because of the change of the system, and again there is something so we must consider as we go forward.So, therefore at this juncture we simply decided that we will definitely achieve the target of ¥160 billion one year ahead of time, definitely.Now, some things we have to consider as we go forward.But inclusive of that and at appropriate timing, we hope to give you clear indications.Now, as far as the numbers are concerned, it’s been consistent on a downward trend.It’s the first time under my presidency that I’m able to announce both operating revenue and operating income at the same time.Now, having said that when we consider mobile telecommunication business we have not yet reached the 2013 level.And also of course we’re seeing greater than expected increase in Smart-Life related business.We’ve been able to solidify our base.So, we will continue to observe the situation and give this matter some thought as we go forward.Naturally, we want to maintain increase operating revenue and operating income.However, there will be some things that are unclear in terms of the competitive environment.So, we would like to have some time to give this matter some greater thought.My second question.¥70 billion price discount or price reduction, in terms of ARPU that should translate to ¥100 in terms of ARPU.Now, so, a dip of ARPU but ¥100, to offset that requires tremendous effort I would imagine.And also, the new billing plan subscriptions reached 30 million so therefore ARPU upside based on the new billing plan is going to shrink going forward I would imagine.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So , you have <b>wonderful</b> ARPU at this moment and you see very positive trend as far as ARPU is concerned .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But how do you see the possibility of further expansion of ARPU down the road.To the extent, can ARPU expand and also at what level will the increase in ARPU saturate?Well, the outlook for ARPU over the medium term, we have carried various simulations to date.Now, share pack 5, so Zutto DoCoMo wari, the long-term discount.The impact, or rather these programs will expand down the road.And therefore there is considerably more greater impact on the ARPU as we go forward.So therefore, can we maintain this level of growth over the next couple of years?That might be somewhat challenging.So therefore the pace of growth will be somewhat more moderate as we go down the road.However, we want to increase up-sell, we want to sell greater tablets and also DoCoMo Hikari, there are various methodologies and marketing programs that we’re carrying in order to increase our profitability and sales.Naturally we want to expand.However the pace of growth will have to saturate at some point.So, what is the - at what point will we see saturation?That is not something we’re able to grasp.However, we’d anticipate that the pace of growth will probably have to slow down some time.If I could add, from my side, up until now ARPU growth was cut down by the monthly support.So, the driver was the monthly support.However the impact will be much smaller as we go forward.And also we’re considering rectifying the monthly support impact.So therefore I believe we will see an upside to ARPU because it will be deliberately downside.And also as for the new billing plan is concerned, yes, it is true that there is going to be some leveling off.However, among the current customer base, I think we are seeing up-selling, with faster speed, customers will reach their content.So, therefore they will increase to a larger data bucket plan.So therefore, it’s a matter of timing, it’s very difficult to say at what point.However, there is going to be some upside as well.So, we’re going to increase to the extent possible of course it will be challenging.Thank you, my last question.Depreciation, were you going to model through with the depreciation and the outlook is still very unclear.Now, the investors will focus on EBITDA, investors are focused on EBITDA against this backdrop.So this is half a request, half a comment from my side.The indicator for the management team, you see operating income.However the investors will focus on EBITDA as the management indicator.So please be mindful of that and take measures to increase your EBITDA.Any thoughts?I do take your point that is the point - that is the trend we see.Of course monitor the situation.And we will of course monitor the overall competitive environment as we go forward with our management.So that being the case, we are now getting into a total new and different territory.So multi-support, reduction impact will go down, that parameter is there.So, going back to your first question, why not reverse the medium term outlook, it is because of these uncertainties that is the reason.Okay, thank you.Since we are running out of time we would like to take maybe one or two more questions.So these people who are raising their hands right now will be last several questions.Now, the right hand side.My name is Oshidari from JPMorgan.With regarding to Mr. Tsusaka’s question, after fiscal ‘17, the picture that you’re going to aspire to, you said you need some more time to think about it.But, when it comes to cost efficiency improvement and also Smart-Life related business, I think the pictures are relatively clear.But so, what about the plans for Smart-Life businesses excluding the M&A, in the current portfolio, how much upside in terms of profits can you expect in the existing Smart-Life portfolio?And for cost efficiency, you reduced by ¥120 billion in the second year ¥240 billion, and for this fiscal year, expecting ¥80 billion.So, how much further cost reduction can you achieve because you’ve talked about capital expenditures, efficiency improvement.Overall how much can you continue?Of course this is an ongoing effort and I think you can continue that but not really at this size, I don’t think you can continue cost reduction at this scale.So, what are your thoughts on that?Right.The one year achieving the targets one year ahead of the plan because we were able to bring cost reduction at one year ahead of the plan.So, in fiscal ‘16 as well, ¥80 billion cost reduction target has been raised.And we’ll try to overachieve this, achieve a higher number than this stated target as we have said on many occasions.Mr. Yoshizawa is the leader of cost reduction project of the entire company.And so he will continue to spearhead that.The Smart-Life related operating income is estimated to be ¥120 billion.But as it turned out, we have already achieved ¥90 in the year end.So, another ¥30 billion requires some more efforts.But the near term target is ¥120 million after exceeding the ¥100 billion mark.Now M&A, if there is a good opportunity, we would like to proactively and ambitiously look into those opportunities.We have been approached by many partners but since we learned a very hard lesson from the past of investment activities, so we have learned something out of it.So, we cannot easily accept these approaches.We are trying to be more rigorous here, so we allow cautiously looking into these opportunities.Now in a nutshell, when it comes to Smart-Life related businesses, ¥120 billion is the guidance for this year in operating income.So, you are expecting that you’ll be able to achieve that level in the current portfolio, is that what you’re saying?And then the transaction volume out of that, how much is the transaction volume that you’re anticipating out of this portfolio?Actually this is something that we haven’t disclosed.But now that we have already exceeded ¥3 trillion, so over the medium term we first look into the profit level.But in order for us to continue growth, we have to expand the top-line.And the top-line will be different by the transaction volume.So, we would like to focus that.So, in addition to telecommunications segments and when you compare with the Smart-Life related segment, I think in terms of transaction volume, we believe the Smart-Life related transaction exceeded the revenues from telecommunications business at some point in the future.That’s what we have in our mind.So that is the medium term picture or vision that we have in our mind at this point of time.But even before that I think we have to expand the number partners who will join forces with that.That’s our first priority.And in that regard we have to secure some level of operating income.And in order for us to achieve that we have to increase the revenues and therefore the transaction volume.If I could give you some more details to that analysis, one of the big drivers in the Smart-Life related business to our profits, we said that 30% came from content and finance and payment, 10%.We explained those factors behind the income growth.But basically in terms of content, this is B2C D-market contents.Those are the contents that we sell directly to customers at our DoCoMo shops.And as you may well know, we have 50 million to 60 million subscribers.So, therefore, this content business will at some point saturate in terms of growth.So far we have been able to achieve a linear growth but at some point of this will saturate.Now, then for organic growth beyond that we have to look into plus D, the B2B2C model and that is about financing businesses and the platform businesses.So, marketing commercial transaction flows, how to expand is going to be the issue.And this will not be confined by the customer base of 50 million or 60 million.So, on top of our customer base, leverage that as a foundation, our partners will be able to expand their revenues and also, we would also like to use our payment platform and do the business of our partners using our payment platforms.So, this is also a blue ocean if you will for our - on our part.So, how to make revenues out of it is going to be a key for us to achieve organic growth, I cannot comment on the numbers in detail but that’s the qualitative assessment that we have.So, there should be some elements that will have saturation at some point.But when it comes to B2B2C model there is no ceiling there.So, we will try to combine both to achieve growth in the future.Well, thank you.Then at some point in the future, are you planning to revise your medium-term plan in terms of?Yes, that’s what we plan to do.But we are learning as we are running our business.And there is something that we have to scrutinize.And overall as a group, we will like to align the phases in the entire entity group.So thus we would like to come up with the right timing to make that announcement.With this we would like to finish this results presentation.Thank you very much once again for taking your precious time.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important
