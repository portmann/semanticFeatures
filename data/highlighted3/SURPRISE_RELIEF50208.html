conference call.[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Terry Gallagher, CFO of ANADIGICS.Please go ahead, sir.Thank you, operator.Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to ANADIGICS’ first quarter 2015 conference call.With me on the call today is Ron Michels, our chairman and CEO.For today's call, I will first take you through our adjusted financial results, and then Ron will comment on the broader business backdrop.I will then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015, and finally, Ron will open the call for Q&A.Before I begin, I would like to remind you that in light of the SEC's fair disclosure rules, we are limited in responding to inquiries in a non-public forum.Therefore, we encourage you to ask all questions of material nature on this call.Some of the information we present today maybe forward-looking in nature.I must remind you that the forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from our projections, based on various risk factors, including those described in the press release issued earlier today and our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.All numbers during the call will be presented on a non-GAAP basis.Non-GAAP financial measures exclude equity compensation charges, marketable auction rate securities movements, restructuring charges, and other specifically identified non-routine items referenced in our release.The non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the understanding of our core operating performance, and a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results was presented in our press release.Now, I am pleased to announce that first quarter 2015 results were in line with or better than the guidance we provided two months ago.In line with our expectations, total Q1 revenue declined sequentially by $2.4 million or 11.7% to $18.4 million.In Q1, we saw a sequential decline in mobile revenue of $4.7 million or 42% that was partially offset by strong sequential growth of $2.3 million or 23% in infrastructure, principally by wifi and small cell.Notably, infrastructure as a percentage of total revenue climbed from 47% in Q4 to 65% in Q1, outpacing our prior estimates.For Q1, we had five greater than 10% customers, Huawei, Altec, Samsung, Cisco, and Long Trump.Our gross profit margin for the first quarter increased sequentially by 455 basis points to 23.2%, exceeding our forecasted sequential increase of 400 basis points.This improvement was driven by our infrastructure revenue growth and more favorable product mix, which offset the sequential decline in total revenue, slightly lower fab utilization, and some inventory reductions which improved cash efficiency for the quarter.Operating expenses in the first quarter totaled $8.1 million, representing a sequential decrease of 4.4% and demonstrated continued benefits of our more efficient infrastructure business model.This improvement was observed in both research and development and selling and administrative expenses.As a point of reference, the $8.1 million total operating expenses in Q1 represents a one third reduction from levels in the first quarter of 2014.The net loss for the quarter was $3.8 million or $0.04 per share.This represents our fourth consecutive sequential improvement and was a penny better than the consensus forecast.Our EBITDA loss was $1.6 million, representing a sequential improvement of $500,000 or roughly 25% and demonstrates the continued benefits of our strategic restructuring and focus on infrastructure markets.Moving to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with total cash and equivalents of $17 million, which included $4 million drawn on our $10 million line of credit.Our resulting net cash of $13 million represents a sequential decrease of $1.4 million, which aligns with Q1’s sequentially lower EBITDA loss.At the close of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $5.5 million or 28 days.Inventories declined by $2.4 million to $11.5 million or approximately 84 days.The decrease in inventory was largely offset by correspondingly lower payables and accruals and a seasonal increase in prepaids for insurance payments.Depreciation expense in the quarter was $2.25 million and capacity utilization approximated 32%.Capital investment was again basically zero for the quarter.With that, I’ll turn the call over to our chairman and CEO, Ron Michels.Following Ron’s comments, I’ll discuss our guidance for Q2.Thank you, Terry.I’m pleased with our Q1 2015 financial results, which demonstrate the continued progress we’re making as a result of our strategic restructuring, which we announced mid last year.With the company’s focus on infrastructure, we’re managing two vectors: the expected decline in mobile as we exit certain elements of that space, most notably cellular mobile, and two, the anticipated long term growth of our infrastructure business, which includes CATV, small cell, wifi infrastructure, IoT, and new expansion technologies in the optical arena.With significantly higher revenue and profitability per wafer in infrastructure, we believe that the rate of decline in mobile wafers can outpace the expected increase in infrastructure wafer demand while the company’s financials improve over the long term.To achieve this, though, we must continue to align our manufacturing capacity, overall investments, and cost structure to our infrastructure business model.As our mobile wafer demand declines, we estimate that we can further reduce ongoing expenses by an annualized $4 million to $5 million.Terry will expand on that shortly.I’d like now to share some additional color to the Q2 guidance we provided in our press release.In Q2 mobile, we’re anticipating a sequential revenue decline of approximately 20% to 25%, which is expected as part of our ongoing transition to infrastructure.In Q2 infrastructure, we are anticipating a sequential revenue decline of approximately 7% to 9%, driven by the following two items: first, some softness in forecasted demand from a key wifi infrastructure customer.As a result, the customer is digesting some excess inventory, which has created a small headwind on new sales for us in Q2.The second is a slower rate of small cell deployment than previously anticipated, due in part to certain carriers delaying the award of hardware contracts to OEMs.We believe the anticipated Q2 infrastructure decline represents a temporary pause in our long term growth infrastructure revenues.Although we are not in a position to provide detailed guidance beyond Q2, we believe that infrastructure revenue growth will return in Q3 based on our current view of the following.We expect that wifi infrastructure channel inventories at our key customer will come into balance and we anticipate small cell network deployments to resume at a pace that aligns with our customer’s latest forecasts.As a result, we expect the Q2 headwind, offset by our planned improvements in manufacturing efficiency, to slightly delay our EBITDA breakeven goal by approximately three to six months.We believe that we remain on track to achieve a revenue split of at least 75-25 in favor of infrastructure by year-end.To eliminate the fundamentals that we expect to drive our infrastructure performance in the second half of 2015, I’d like to provide an update on our key target areas.First, in CATV, product development for DOCSIS 3.0 infrastructure upgrades remains a critical focus.In spite of recent changes in strategic activity at MSO level, capex spending for CATV infrastructure is continuing at a pace that can sustain our planned growth trajectory.In fact, our DOCSIS 3.1 products are being chosen for use in 3.0 networks, which we believe will help us hedge against potential delays in DOCSIS 3.1 deployments.In summary, we anticipate a healthy CATV revenue growth for 2015 over 2014 and that should position us for continued growth into 2016.In spite of some slowness in the small cell market, we still expect to double our revenue in 2015 over 2014.We believe that our product portfolio remains unmatched, and our design win penetration is stronger than ever.According to Infonetics, while some service providers are revisiting the timing for small cell rollout, the compound annual growth rate of small cell equipment is expected to be 20% through 2019.Small cell is a critical market for ANADIGICS and we believe that we are well-positioned to be successful in it.We are confident that our unique products and technology are helping carriers to solve the challenge of delivering robust service and high data rates over the cellular network in densely populated areas.In wifi infrastructure, we recently announced design wins in the high performance TRENDnet AC3200 triband wireless router.With six ANADIGICS amplifiers in each router, the dollar content per box is attractive.Coupled with the continued expansion of 802.11ac, wifi infrastructure represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us.In addition, we’ve also announced design wins in the DGI Phantom series of drones.We believe that our wifi products offer compelling advantages for customers not only in conventional wifi connectivity equipment, but in many adjacent applications that use wifi technologies as well.In M2M and IoT apps, we noted in our last call that we anticipate double digit revenue growth in the first half of 2015 at our largest customer in that sector.This remains on track, and we continue to target specific applications that are a good fit for our high-performance gallium arsenide based products.Now, let’s turn our attention to our six-inch VCSEL wafer manufacturing technology.The breadth and depth of applications that VCSELs can enhance and enable are exciting.Our role in this space is simple.We offer a six-inch process that has the necessary economic advantages over alternative three and four inch wafers that make the use of VCSEL’s technology ubiquitous.We believe that we are positioning VCSELs to be a significant contributor to our long term financial growth.We believe that even as we optimize our near term manufacturing capability with the demands of our new business model, we remain well-positioned to service an increasing wafer demand for VCSELs over the long term.Through our transition to an infrastructure company, we have continued to manage our resources carefully, and ended Q1 with net cash of $13 million.Our infrastructure product portfolio and design win penetration is strong.Based on existing market indicators and our business outlook, we believe our net cash and our existing line of credit give us adequate capital resources to support our business and carry us through EBITDA breakeven.I’ll turn the call back to Terry so that he can provide details on our guidance for Q2 and following that, I’ll provide my closing remarks and then we’ll open the call for questions.Terry?Thanks, Ron.For the second quarter, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline of 10% to 15%, driven principally by a decrease in mobile of approximately 20% to 25%, in accordance with our shift to infrastructure.Infrastructure revenues are expected to decline sequentially by 7% to 9%, for the reasons Ron outlined earlier, following our higher than expected growth in the first quarter of 2015.In line with the continued migration to our infrastructure business model, we are implementing the next phase of cost improvement measures designed to match our supply capability with demand.We are proceeding with a staff reduction, primarily in manufacturing, and implementing other cost improvement measures that in aggregate represent a $4 million to $5 million improvement in our annual cost structure.We are committed to improving the overall operating efficiency of our business while we maintain solid R&D investment levels to support our long term growth [unintelligible].We expect gross margin to decline sequentially in the second quarter by approximately 100 to 300 basis points.As the anticipated infrastructure revenue growth returns in the second half of 2015, we expect gross margin expansion to resume.Based on our planned expense improvements and new leaner infrastructure business model, we expect a sequential reduction in our operating expenses of 5% to 7%.We expect cash usage to largely align with the anticipated EBITDA loss, adjusted for a small restructuring payout.In addition, we have maintained a close working relationship with our banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank.We are already in discussions to revise certain covenants of our existing debt agreement, principally EBITDA metrics, to ensure they are well aligned to our financial outlook.We expect to formalize these revisions within the quarter and maintain access to the capital that the facility provides.As we look a bit further down the road, we believe our new operating model will deliver EBITDA breakeven results at a quarterly revenue level below $19 million, with utilization approximating only 25% to 30%.Thanks, Terry.I’m pleased with the results that we delivered for Q1.While our guidance for Q2 indicates a pause in our infrastructure revenue growth, we believe for all the reasons discussed today that the outlook for the second half of 2015 remains positive.As we gain a clearer picture of our mobile wafer demand, we believe that we will be able to further optimize our manufacturing capacity and cost structure, which should reduce the impact Q2’s pause has on our broader EBITDA breakeven goals.We believe that our infrastructure product development, customer engagements, technology development, and design win pipeline are solid and our target markets.As they develop, we are focused on executing to our new infrastructure business model and delivering value to our customers with competitive products and unique technology.I just want to ask a gross margin question here first off.You guys have been saying, really since the strategic restructuring was announced last June, that mix shift to infrastructure would drive a much richer gross margin mix, and that mix was probably more important to margins than the overall level of revenue.I think that seemed to be playing out through the first quarter, but your second quarter guidance sort of implies a 100 to 300 basis point drop in gross margins despite a continued mix shift to infrastructure.So just trying to get a sense of, are there some fixed cost overhang, absorption issues, that are impacting that margin in the second quarter, or is the decline in gross margin due to other factors?Yeah, very insightful.We have been growing gross margin as the mix shift swapped over to infrastructure, but with the lower revenues, with the decline in revenues, there’s a little bit of a pinch on the fixed costs.We’re rightsizing manufacturing to the demand levels, but certain of those fixed costs do get trapped inside cost of goods.So I would generally view it and what we’re seeing we believe to be a pause on those revenues and that as they return to increasing, we’ll get that gross margin back and show the increases.And then just a follow up on the cost reduction initiatives.You mentioned that you’d be implementing staff reduction in the wafer fab.So of the $4 million to $5 million of annualized cost savings you expect to receive, can you give us some sense of what’s the split between COGS and opex?Some of it, as you were just highlighting, cost of sales needs to come down as the revenue comes down.So some of that you may or may not be able to see, but it’ll be better than 50%, would be in the manufacturing operation.And then it’s just other support roles to the factory that can be more efficient.Maybe another way, then, to ask it, it looks like your opex guide for the second quarter is down about $500,000 or call it a couple of million dollars annualized.Would you expect that there would be further opex reductions as you head into the third quarter?Or is the guidance you’re giving for Q2 capturing most of the benefit, at least at the opex line, from the newest round of cost efficiencies?Very good point.I see where you’re coming at it, and yes, the Q2 levels reflect those efficiencies, and they’d be a decent metric to run your models out for future.And then just a couple of quick ones for Ron.Ron, you talked about the long term VCSEL opportunity.Can you give us any updated thoughts on when you think you might start to see the production of VCSELs showing up on the revenue line?And then a second question, you talked about it sounds like a pretty good opportunity or demand that you’re seeing in the cable infrastructure business.That’s not one of the areas that you’re seeing a slowdown in Q2, so can you give us some sense, what kind of growth do you anticipate for the cable infrastructure market in 2015 versus 2014?Today, as we look at it, we see that the CATV probably will grow about 30% over last year.So that’s quite nice.One of the reasons why, as I had mentioned in the prepared remarks, that cable looks as good as it does is that we have a whole slew of these products we developed for DOCSIS 3.1, and they’re of course compatible with 3.0 equipment.And as new equipment is being installed in systems that are not ready to go to 3.1, they can spec equipment differently if they have parts like ours that are spec compliant to 3.1.So it’s kind of a spec somewhere between 3.0 and 3.1, and that’s winning business for us.On the VCSELs, I can’t really be specific.I’d be guessing as to when it’s going to start.I can tell you that every week we have visitors here that are looking over what we’re doing.We’re getting very excited about the amount of engagements that we have.Some are small and some are larger.The engagements which will be significant, because you mentioned significant revenue, will be in 2016.However, could we be running something this year around Q4?Yes, it’s possible.We’ll see whether we’re at a preproduction level of a production level towards the end of the year.But again, we’re getting very excited, and we’re getting some very serious signs that this thing is real and some of the applications that we’ve talked about in previous calls for mobile applications are definitely things that are going to be adopted in 2016 and 2017 and the quantities will be quite significant for them.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ron , <b>wondering</b> if you could comment on the overall wifi infrastructure market and kind of your outlook and what you 're seeing there outside the inventory digestion at that particular customer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So basically, we have 802.11ac products.Now, we started wifi infrastructure actually only when we announced last June the switch to infrastructure.Prior to that, ANADIGICS products for wifi were primarily mobile.So we’re a very new entrant into this area.And as you know, you have to design products, get on reference designs, and then wait for them to actually make their way into production, so it can be a six-month cycle.We started with 5 GHz parts, and these are 5 GHz parts designed for the typical infrastructure market, routers, set top boxes, that kind of thing.But there’s a whole other market of 2 GHz parts, which we now are starting to roll very competitive products out for that as well, which kind of doubles our share that we could get in wifi infrastructure.So we think by the end of this year, we’ll be announcing wins both on 5 GHz and 2 GHz.We’re already on some 5 GHz reference designs with some major reference design partners, and we’re working to do the same thing on 2 GHz.So future’s good for that.And as far as the growth rate, it’s 2x to 2.5x what we had last year.So it’s growing at a nice rate.We want to continue that growth.As I said, we’re new to the 2 GHz.We just rolled out parts three or four weeks ago that we think are the lowest power consumption parts in the industry.We’re very excited about them.And the 5 GHz parts were only rolled out just a few months ago.So we’re new to it, but already we’re seeing some nice growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And then Terry , <b>wondering</b> if you can help me think about the gross margin snapback that will come in Q3 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Should we be thinking about a level similar to Q1, or just slowly building upon Q2 level?Good question, Jason, and we only give guidance on the one quarter.But I think of your two choices, I think I’d be seeing it improve upon a Q1 level.And then the last one for me.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Wondering</b> what the breakdown between cellular and wifi within mobile in Q1 was .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Okay, so that was wifi split between cellular and mobile.Or, I’m sorry, Jason, I got the question wrong.It’s wifi and you’re looking for it between mobile and infrastructure?Okay.So, maybe it’s kind of a 55-45 thereabouts.A little heavy on cellular, but cellular had a lot to get back from a seasonal Q4.Ron, you called out wifi and small cell as points of strength in the quarter.Can you talk about how CATV performed in Q1?Was it sort of in line with your expectations?And with CATV, I think now you’re looking for about 30% growth for the year.Last quarter I think you were talking about a 30% to 50% growth range.So now you’re sort of toward the low end of that range.Can you maybe give us a little bit of color about what’s tempering your expectations there?I’m trying to be conservative.And the number could be bigger, but I think that overall, the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 is disappointing.There’s lots of things going on.The overall spending that the MSOs are doing is not a bad number, but the rollout specifically for DOCSIS 3.1 is not as big as anybody expected.So that will probably mute the growth a little bit.Our reaction to that is getting these products designed into 3.0 systems that are getting installed.So I’m saying let’s give us a little more headroom and say 30% as opposed to 30% to 50%, but that would be the reason.Okay, and with the VCSEL opportunity, so you guys are looking for significant revenue in 2016.Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you mean by that?Is that like 5% of sales?What do you mean by significant?I think what we were trying to indicate is you’re not gonna see much here in 2015, as opposed to calling it out as significant revenue driver, let’s say 2016.But the level of engagement that we’ve got out there, in conversations that are going right now, does point to the technology being embraced.It’s being valued, but where this necessarily goes, we’re feeding the technology, we think it’s very promising, but to speculate on a number, isn’t all the best at this time.Ron, I just want to get into a little bit more detail about the expected second half recovery.I guess help me understand to what extent is this a view that the inventory correction at the large customer will be over?To what extent is this a view of kind of share gains?To what extent is this a view that the overall market’s just going to pick up?And then I guess as you guys transform the business to focus more in on infrastructure, how should I think about sort of the lumpiness of the business?Are we going to go through sort of quarters of very strong demand, and then things get quiet?Or do you think you’ll have some linearity and smoothness as infrastructure begins to grow again?We think it will be smooth.What we’re dealing with now is the rollout for small cell is largely dependent on, in North America, it’s the Verizons awarding contracts.In China, it’s China Mobile.And in China, there appears to be a delay in handing out these awards.So as an example, there’s 10 small cell suppliers that ANADIGICS is designed into, or I should say we were designed into nine out of ten suppliers in China alone, who are all waiting to see who gets the award from CMCC.Now, our expectation a couple of months ago was that these awards would have been given by now.All of these customers have built product with our products in previous quarters.And things just kind of stopped, because now everybody’s waiting for this next step.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So this was a <b>surprise</b> , and this has created some lumpiness .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But when I take a look at the amount of customers that are waiting for their awards, it’s over 20.And some of them are going after the same markets, but some portion of these 20 customers are going to be winning and we’re in all of them.So there’s just a lot of small cell business that is kind of on hold right now that we think is going to pick up before the year’s out.So I’d say it’s not a matter of gaining share.I think we’ve got a tremendous share there.It just hasn’t started yet, on the small cell side.On wifi, we have one major customer who basically ran into inventory issues.And a large portion of what we sell to them basically is in the channels now from last quarter.So when we look at their forecast, it looks like that kind of cleans itself up in Q3.At least that’s our view today.So that one takes care of itself.And they’ve been a good customer, and they’ve been consistent, and they haven’t been lumpy for the last two or three quarters.So this is another, I think, one-time event.So those are the two things that are overriding small cell kind of sitting still for a month or two, we hope, and this largest customer that we have in wifi.Now, we’re winning other infrastructure wifi customers.So going forward, even if there is a bump in the road with one customer, it will be less of an issue for us.But at the moment, we do have, unfortunately, one very large, percentagewise, customer for wifi infrastructure.And then I guess from your perspective, Terry, given all the hard work you guys have done on the cost side, how should I think about sort of quarterly revenue breakeven run rate?And can you talk a little bit about what you expect cash balance to be at the end of the June quarter, and how I should think about minimal cash you guys need to run the business?I’ll take the cash portion first.I think by the time you guys are done with your numbers, you’re going to be coming out somewhere with a $2 million burn or something like that in the P&L.And I don’t see cash moving by a whole heck of a lot more than that.The restructuring payout is not particularly large.And the other half of your question, John, was breakeven revenues, I believe?So as I indicted in the prepared remarks, we now see it being somewhere less than $19 million.And that’s probably looking at infrastructure being circa 70% to 75% of the mix.The utilization would stay low, leaving us with room to accommodate VCSEL development and VCSEL production.That’s all the pieces that we’re kind of juggling.And I’ve got to hand it to the team here.They keep kind of turning up new efficiencies and finding ways to work smarter.So the expense reductions that they’ve been able to drive are helping the model as well.So in terms of EBITDA breakeven, $19 million or something a bit less than that, that’s a reasoned view of things.Beyond Q2, do you anticipate the recovery of revenues driven by all three segments of the infrastructure market, wifi, small cell infrastructure, and also cable?Or is there any one particular market that you’re optimistic about?Ron’s looking up something right now, Krishna, but I think small cell, even though we’re talking to a pause, it’s a pause in the substantial growth trajectory that we believe that business line is capable of.I would say, to answer the question, we think CATV will move along.It’s done well for us, and we think it will continue.The two places that are soft, which we’re hoping from our view today will improve in the short term, is basically both small cell and wifi.And I think equally we’re probably looking at both of them recovering to the same extent.So I wouldn’t say one is more important than the other.And then at what level will your mobile revenues operate in the second half of the year?Do you expect continued rapid decline, or can you talk about the pace of that business?Okay, so that’s the mobile reductions.We had a very steep decline from Q4, a seasonal high, down to Q1.We anticipate some continued falloff, and then in terms of where we end the year, it’s kind of 75% infrastructure and 25% mobile.I just wanted to follow up on John’s question about the EBITDA breakeven.If I run my numbers, it looks like it implies a breakeven gross margin that’s somewhere around 30%.Does that seem to fit with your numbers?Thank you very much, everybody, for joining the call.We’ll talk to you again soon.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for
