(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook has been battered in the media for mismanagement of Apple.Unfortunately, Tim Cook is dealing with the fallout from a lack of investment in the years prior to his CEO appointment.Under Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has returned R&D spending to historical norms.BlackBerry serves as a model for how management can burn shareholders in the name of excessive, misguided spending.Apple should avoid that fate.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and how it chooses to use its capital remains a point of serious contention among investors.I've highlighted how I'm supportive of Apple's buyback plan (and even want it ramped back up to 2014 levels), but many investors want to see more money poured into research and development and capital expenditures."Apple needs to invest in the business" is the line.That desire isn't completely naïve.To some extent, we are all worried about what the future brings for Apple.And even the most ardent of Apple bulls acknowledge that smartphone revenue is showing some signs of topping, and the "next big thing" for the company seems far off in the future.When the future is hazy like it is now, knee-jerk reactions inevitably happen.What I intend to do here is to give a gentle reminder to investors what led Apple to where it is today, how it has historically allocated its resources, and why throwing more money at the problem may not necessarily fix Apple's woes.Ah, 2007.I was in college, Beyonce was at the top of the Billboard Top 100 (maybe that has not changed), and then Senator Barack Obama was poised to take his place in the White House.The man didn't have a single gray hair back then: Of course, something else more relevant to the discussion of Apple occurred in 2007.We were blessed with a product that would change, or indirectly influence, the way many of us live our lives forever: the iPhone.Apple, from this point forward, would precede to grow its revenue at a 32.91% annual pace through its fiscal 2015, propelled by the success of this one consumer electronic device and its eventual reiterations.Total research and development outlay in fiscal 2006 leading into that product launch?Just $712M.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In an <b>amazing</b> use of capital , what was likely just several hundred million in total research and development outlay turned out the first example of a device that would eventually generate hundreds of billions in profit .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>You can't beat that return on investment, and historically, this is how Apple has always operated.The company has always been characterized by, when compared to peers, very low spending allocated toward research and development.Traditionally, research and development costs have run below 4% of revenue, even stretched back further than what I have pulled above.Compare this to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) R&D/Revenue spending at 12.8% in its fiscal 2015, or even notoriously stingy IBM (NYSE: IBM ) at 6.4% of 2015 revenue.That being said, the slump we saw heading into the 2010-2012 period likely contributed greatly to the lack of new product availability that we see today.Taking a project from initial concept to eventual commercial development takes years, and I have the feeling we are now in the period where we would have seen the fruits of investment from that period.2010-2012 was a period of massive growth for Apple, where revenue more than doubled from $65B to $156B.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even Steve Jobs and his team were likely taken <b>aback</b> by the quick success of new product launches and were a little slow in adjusting to a vastly changed business environment .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Focus was likely elsewhere, likely on structuring Apple to handle its new superpower status in the business world.Jobs' illness may have even played a part.Its unfortunate, but nothing can be done about that now.As far as the change in spending patterns that began in 2012, this also roughly coincides with the timing of Tim Cook taking over as CEO.For as much criticism as Tim Cook has gotten in the public media for mismanagement of Apple in recent months, he has presided over a massive ramp in Apple's development efforts.Nominally during Tim Cook's tenure, this increase in research and development spending is large - from $2.4B in 2012 to $8B annually in 2015.Even beyond research and development, capital expenditures (investments in long-lived assets like property and equipment) are up from $7.4B in 2011 to $11.4B in 2015.However, like most things in business, payoff takes time, and investors need to have patience in seeing results from the ramp in spending.Apple Spending More Now Won't Solve Its Problem So why not spend even more today?It's important for investors to remember that you cannot force innovation.Spending for the sake of spending gets you nowhere.Just as throwing money at problems in your personal life rarely works, it also rarely works in the business world as well.Companies need to hire the right people who will make the right decisions, all by properly weighing and considering all available options that come out of research.To get products to market quickly, weak projects need to be culled early, so focus can be directed where it could be most beneficial.The more rapid the change in development spending policy, the more it is likely that company direction and motivation gets muddled.For an example of a company that has struggled with research and development spending, we can take BlackBerry's (NASDAQ: BBRY ) malaise as a guidepost.The recent peak in BlackBerry's revenue came in fiscal 2012, which saw R&D/revenue touch 8.3%.This was above peer norms, and all seemed well.Despite being a much smaller company at the time, Blackberry was pouring almost as much money into developing innovation as its larger competitor Apple.However, revenue began its slump as Blackberry products fell out of favor, and Blackberry proceeded to dump money into trying to figure out how to slow its revenue decline.R&D/revenue has now been driven toward 20% annually as the company continues to try to figure out how to remain solvent.$5.2B was spent on research and development in that fiscal 2012-2016 timeline, and this spending drove a large portion of the earnings per share losses that have plagued BlackBerry shareholders for years.Has all this spending done any good for the company?At this juncture, no.Revenues are expected to fall - once again - 16.5% annually to $1.8B in the company's fiscal 2017.Shareholder value has been destroyed, and the company would have been better off liquidating the assets it had five years ago rather than chasing a viable solution to saving its business that does not seem to exist.For those of us who are worried about future innovation, Tim Cook has pushed Apple's research and development spending well above levels that were present when he took over the business.For those of us who are worried about management throwing money at a perceived problem and degrading shareholder value, he also has just moved Apple's spending back to historical norms.I personally find Apple's spending in this category to be just right at face value, although I have no clue on how efficient the returns on that spending will be in the future.Given the discount on Apple shares in the market currently, Apple doesn't need home runs.Singles and doubles over the next decade to maintain current free cash flows would point to the shares being deeply undervalued.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As investors , sometimes we just need to sit back and let management do its job and have the patience to wait for what product release <b>surprises</b> might lie around the corner .
