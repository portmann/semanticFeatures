(NYSE:JOY) | Seeking Alpha Joy Global equity has rallied on hopes that the mining industry is improving.Hard commodity prices were oversold in my opinion, but miners won't increase capital expenditures on this minor rally.The risk/reward simply isn't there until signs of increased mining capex are present; investors shouldn't be too quick to pull the trigger.Joy Global (NYSE: JOY ) equity has risen nearly 40% in the past five trading days.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Long-term shareholders might be <b>relieved</b> to see some positive price action , but the move does little to erode the massive destruction of shareholder value over the past year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even after the move, shares are down 60% in the past year and over 80% in the past five years - a far cry from the 5s% return of the S&P 500.This sustained move to the downside has not been without merit; Sales have declined double digits for the past three fiscal years and are still expected to decline further in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.The company's backlog has eroded to just a fraction of it once was, and there are signs of distress present.Sell-side analysts are likely frustrated; the company has missed expectations in eleven of the past twelve quarters, despite continuous downward revisions.There are faint signs of hope, however.Fiscal 2016 guidance was largely in-line with Wall Street expectations, giving investors hope that, maybe this time, things will be different.Coupled with this, a recent turnaround in a broad basket of hard commodity prices has investors hoping for a turnaround for Joy Global as its customers get some breathing room.For those unaware, Joy Global is a leading manufacturer of mining equipment and a provider of aftermarket parts and services directed towards the that industry.Products range from mining shoves to rotary blasthole drills to draglines.As the downturn began, sales have shifted more and more towards the company's services businesses rather than equipment sales; services now constitute 74% of net sales in fiscal 2015, compared to just 55% in 2013.Diversification here has been incredibly important to Joy Global's ability to function through this downturn.Gross margin of 36% in fiscal 2013 fell to 26.4% in fiscal 2015, but would have been much worse if the company had been forced to rely solely on equipment sales.From an end market perspective, Joy Global derived 58% of ttm fiscal 2015 revenues from the coal industry.Broken down further, 40% of revenue is derived from thermal coal, which is coal used to generate electricity.This has been a primary driver of concern among many investors, as the United States and the rest of the developed world shifts away from coal as a power generation source.The EIA expects flat coal consumption in the United States for several years after a 12% drop in 2015 driven by major coal-fired powerplant retirements , a prediction that is also primarily predicated on a snap-back rally in natural gas.If you think the futures market and the EIA is a little too overzealous on natural gas futures pricing (as I am) you likely would expect gradual declines over the next several years rather than flat consumption.With that said, Joy Global management points overseas as a method of offsetting growth on what, even in optimistic scenarios, is not going to be a strong domestic thermal coal market.China and India, with sprawling populaces, are still deeply interested in coal-fired generation in order to increase electric infrastructure and provide a steady, dependable power supply source to citizens.The situation is similar across the developing world, from African nations to smaller Asian countries.Even in the current environment, the company generated $284M in free cash flow in fiscal 2015; far off from doomsday or bankruptcy.Cash flow is expected to contract further in fiscal 2016 as net income falls to near zero; I expect free cash flow of just $100M in 2016.Nonetheless, the company is in a substantially stronger financial position than the vast majority of its customers, making it a safer way to play for a mining turnaround.Further, management structured their balance sheet intelligently prior to the global commodity downturn.While the company has total borrowings of $1.1B, the maturities on this debt are quite long, giving ample time for a market turnaround.The $500M of senior notes aren't due until 2021 and a smaller series of senior notes ($150M) won't need to be paid off until 2036.The nearest debt expiration is the $375M term loan due July 2019, which could easily be refinanced or paid off with 1.5 years of 2015 free cash flow.Sizable liquidity ($700M) remains on the revolver, should the company see an accretive acquisition opportunity.After the recent run, shares trade at 10x my estimate of fiscal 2016 EBITDA ($275M) and 8.8x my fiscal 2017 EBITDA ($330M), which already builds in some earnings improvement that the Street is not expecting.3 year average EV/EBITDA of 8.5x, which implies shares are, at best, fairly valued at current prices.While there has been some improvement in Joy Global's future, it's still far too early to buy into this rally in my opinion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The snapback in shares has been sudden , but it is too early to tell if this is just a minor <b>relief</b> rally from a sector that has been beaten down relentlessly or if the fundamentals of the market have truly changed .
