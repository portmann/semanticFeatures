class='textDiv'>OmniVision Technologies' (OVTI) CEO Shaw Hong on Q1 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Ladies and gentlemen, thank you and for standing by.And welcome to the OmniVision Technologies conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.Later, we will open up the call for your questions.Instructions for queuing up will be provided at that time.As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the conference call over to Anson Chan, CFO of the company.Please proceed.Thank you very much.Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings conference call.On today’s call will be Shaw Hong, our CEO; Ray Cisneros, Senior VP of Worldwide Sales and Sales Operations; and myself.During this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our business, including statements relating to revenues, earnings targets and our product plans.This is based on information as of today, August 27, 2015, and actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements.These and other forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.For a discussion of these risk factors, you should review the forward-looking disclosures in the earning release we issued today, as well as the risk factors and other disclosures in OmniVision’s SEC filings and reports, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and recent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.During today’s call, we will also discuss certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the latter of which exclude stock-based compensation expenses and related tax effects.Reconciliation between the two measures is available in our earnings release posted on our website.Thank you, Anson.Welcome to all of you joining us on the call and webcast.Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release describing our results for fiscal Q1 2016.We reported fiscal Q1 revenues of $330 million, an increase of 15.4% sequentially, but a decrease of almost 18.9% year-over-year.During the quarter, we shipped 215 million sensors.On non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 23% and net income was $28.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share.Our cash and short-term investments increased again when compared to last quarter at approximately $594 million.We are pleased that these results were consistent with our expectations, despite the fact that demand from our end markets especially China had been fairly volatile.Before I discuss our business and long-term strategy, I would like to first comment on the status of the acquisition by the consortium that consist our Hua Capital Management, CITIC Capital, and GoldStone Investment.At the end of April, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to be acquired by this consortium.Under the terms of the agreement, the consortium will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company in cash at $29.75 per here, or a total of approximately $1.9 billion.Our Board of Directors unanimously concluded that this arrangement is the best way to maximize value of our stockholders, providing them with immediate cash value for their investment.Subsequently, we filed a proxy statement with the SEC in June and held a special stockholders meeting on July 23, relating to the proposed transaction.Our stockholders have voted favorably on the transaction and we are proceeding with our plan to meet the closing conditions in the definitive agreement.Last week, we have also entered into an agreement with TSMC to sell them our equity interest in VisEra and XinTec.The object of this divestiture is to obtain clearance approval and applicable law in Taiwan for this proposed transaction.Currently, we expect the transaction will close in the third or fourth quarter of this fiscal year.However, the transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals, including antitrust review in the People’s Republic of China, review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., clearance or approval under applicable Taiwan law, and other customary closing conditions.As of today, we have not obtained all the necessary approvals, nor have we met all the closing conditions.As such, there’s no assurance that the proposed acquisition by the consortium will close.With that said, I will now comment on our business and strategy.We are celebrating our 20th anniversary this year.During this past 20 years, we have seen the coming to dominance of CMOS as a technological basis for image sensors and the exploding of the imaging market.But in this ever-changing market, we have maintained the three fundamental pillars of our strategy.First, growing our technological capabilities and developing innovative applications.Second, identifying and capitalizing our market opportunities.And third, optimizing and diversifying our supply chain.With these long-term business strategies, we aim to achieve profitable revenue growth and continue to be the premier business partners for our customers.First, our technological capabilities.Through years of measured and a disciplined approach to growing our R&D capabilities, we have built a solid foundation to help us lead the way in bringing more innovations to the image sensing industry.On the one hand, we are introducing the latest advancement in fabrications and design capabilities into our product to further shrink the pixel size.For example, we recently introduced our first 1 micron pixel sensor last quarter, and it was very well received by the market.Concurrently, we’re also identifying more advanced features typically found only in digital still cameras and integrate them into our offerings.For example, we introduced face detection autofocus to a 13-megapixel product, allowing even mainstream smartphones to have a capability that rival that of dedicated point-and-shoot DSCs.For adjacent technologies, such as ASIC, ISPs and LCOS, we are also making great progress in bringing out new products based on these technologies.We will continue to strengthen our product line up in this area and introduce to our customers an even broader menu of imaging solutions.Last year, I also talked about forming more technology partnerships as a way to speed up the introduction of innovative solutions to our target markets.In fiscal 2016, we are continuing that push.Most recently, we came up with industry veterans to introduce precision camera solutions for the medical market.We will continue to seek out suitable technology partners and explore new innovations.Next, our market opportunities, as always we want to continue to expand our business in all of our target markets.The number of mass market applications using image sensors continues to grow at a tremendous pace, creating new opportunities for OmniVision every day.For the global smartphone market mobile phone continues to be a solid market for OmniVision.As I have mentioned before the Asian market, particularly China, has been quite volatile.And it is still difficult for us to determine the seasonality pattern of our business, especially with our business mix shifting towards this part of the world over the last few quarters.Nonetheless, we believe that the long-term outlook for this end-market, particularly for mid-tier to entry level smartphones remains very positive.Other imaging markets such as India are also increasing their demand for mobile phones.We will continue to invest in China and other emerging markets to realize their longer-term potential despite near term volatilities.For the entertainment and notebook markets, in the first fiscal quarter of 2016, business in these target markets remains slow.However, there will soon be an entire new class of entertainment products coming to the market, mostly based on 3-D imaging and other wearable concepts.The notebook market will also see new opportunities as the operating system goes through another major upgrade this year.These developments can have potential upside for us and we are prepared.For the automotive market, our automotive business continues to grow at a very fast pace.It actually surpassed entertainment and notebook last quarter in terms of revenue contribution.We are reaping benefits from our design-win pipeline that we built up a few years back and are shipping at very healthy volumes to various applications designed for driver assistance.We are now extending our design-win pipeline with machine-vision based applications, such as land departures and road-sign recognition.We will begin to ship against these design wins in the near future.Overall, we expect automotive to continue to be accretive to our revenues and gross profit.For the emerging market, I briefly discuss our security camera business last quarter.It is riding the wave of new application introductions for smart homes and Internet of Things.We saw significant growth in this space in the first quarter for fiscal 2016.Earlier, I’ve also touched upon our partnership for medical cameras.We have every intention to grow our medical business.With our partnerships, we are in a great position to further drive the adoption of seamless image sensors in this market.Lastly, our supply chain, yet again, we delivered a solid quarter with sequential improvement in gross margin.This is our 11th quarter with a sequential margin improvement.Our ability to leverage the different capabilities of our supply chain partners and work together to drive production efficiencies played a big role in our continuing margin improvement.From the capacity perspective, our diversified supply chain has the capability to meet today’s market demand.However, we are of a belief in the long-term growth trend of our business, we’re also working with our supply chain partners to make sure we can meet future requirements.Having said that, we’re closely monitoring the near-term volatility, particularly in China, and we may adjust our plan accordingly.With that, I will now turn the call over to Ray, who will update you on our sales and the marketing activities.Thank you, Shaw.We are pleased to report that our fiscal first quarter revenues were well within our guidance.In our first fiscal quarter, we shipped 215 million units, as compared to 180 million units in our prior quarter, reflecting strength in our mobile market and strong growth in our automotive and security markets.The average selling price in our first quarter was $1.53, as compared to $1.59 in our prior quarter.The decrease in ASP was attributed to the combination of the product mix shift towards lower ASP products for the same resolution, and the market price erosion in our largest regional market of China.Unit sales of 8-megapixel and above represented approximately 19% of total shipments in the fiscal first quarter equivalent to the prior quarter.Unit sales of 3 to 5-megapixel category represented approximately 40% of total shipments, as compared to 38% in the prior quarter for the same category.Unit sales of 2-megapixel and below represented approximately 41% of total shipments, as compared to 43% in the prior quarter.In terms of target markets, our mobile phone sales represented approximately 65% of revenues in the first fiscal quarter, as compared to 69% in the prior quarter.Our automotive segment represented 10% of sales, as compared to 9% in our prior quarter.Quarter-on-quarter, the automotive market showed a robust 25% growth.In our emerging market category sales, predominantly composed of the security market, represented 12% of sales, a solid increase from our prior quarter 9%.Quarter-on-quarter, the security market grew by 49%, a significant step up.Our entertainment segment represented 9% of sales, as compared to 8% in our prior quarter.Quarter-on-quarter, the entertainment segment saw solid step up predominately due to the extension of a customer product SKUs into tablet segment and some incremental upside seasonality in our gaming segment.Our sales of sensors into the notebook and webcam segment were approximately 4% of sales, as compared to 5% in our prior quarter.In the mobile market, China, which is our largest regional market saw robust growth quarter-on-quarter.Competitive smartphone OEM landscape drove a brisk summer seasonality period.The majority of our shipments to the China market were 5-megapixel, 8-megapixel, 13-megapixel, and 2-megapixel for the mainstream smartphone segment.Our PureCel products continue to ramp in the China region, offering our customers a migration path to high resolutions, while maintaining equal form factor footprints.For example, our dominant 1/4-inch 5-megapixel product line partially transitioned to our new PureCel 1/4-inch 8-megapixel.Similarly, our third-inch 8-megapixel market partially transitioned to our new PureCel third-inch 13-megapixel products.In the 5-megapixel category, our new PureCel fifth-inch 5-megapixel offers a cost-effective midrange resolution sensor in a small form factor.We have also engaged with key China Tier 1 OEM brand names to accept our next in line 1 micron pixel technology offered in 16-megapixel product.This is a key milestone in our technology roadmap plan to migrate our key customers to our latest technology platforms.The 1 micron pixel is another step in our interest to extend the gap between our position and the rest of the competitors.So far early feedback of this product from our customer base is very encouraging.We made progress in the mobile market in other regions as well.In North America, we scored a significant customer with an android-based product line, using our slightly bigger pixel in a 16-megapixel sensor.In Korea, we continue to pull in more socket design wins for our current Tier 1 Korean smartphone OEM customer.In Japan, we scored new design wins with Tier 1 brand name Japan handset makers.Overall, our mobile market business is in the direction of achieving a balanced attack on customers, regions, and technologies.In our entertainment segment, we saw a slight increase in revenues and shipments due to an extension of one of our customers tablet products skews, utilizing some of our legacy sensors.We also saw a slight increase in shipments to some of our Tier 1 customers in desktop gaming products lining up their products for the holiday season.One fast emerging category is the virtual reality or augmented reality headsets being designed by a vast variety of brand-name OEMs or high potential startups.This category has a broad scope of applications from entertainment, gaming, education, industrial, enterprise, or simply web surfing.We have begun shipping early mass production volumes to a Tier 1 brand-name customer, utilizing our highly specialized global shutter sensors.We are also engaged in several other virtual reality and augmented reality, headset potential applications and designs.The automotive market continues to grow at a steady pace with design wins and shipment ramp ups occurring across the board for Tier 1 OEMs in Europe, North America, Japan, and China.We continue to solidify our number one position in surround view camera systems in the marketplace.A highly acclaimed European brand name has started a surround view camera system production ramp using our latest best-in-class, high dynamic range 1-megapixel sensor, the OV10640.This is the world’s first BSI-based automotive sensor delivered to the marketplace and will set the benchmark in the SVC category.The previous 1-megapixel SLC high dynamic range sensor, the OV10635 continues to increase in volume shipments against design win secured after two years ago.This points out the key aspect of the automotive business of long-term product life cycles and dependable revenue and profit streams.Our high sensitivity VGA analog-based sensors also continue to ramp up in larger quantities, as design win secured previously start to ship in many regions.One special category quickly accelerating in usage is e-mirror applications.Early examples on the road exists today, showing the replacements of traditional rear – side view mirrors replaced with an electronic display produced by a camera solution.The benefits are significant, such as wider field of view, blind spot coverage, enhanced dynamic range and even better fuel efficiency due to removal of a traditional bulky side view mirror.OmniVision’s unique high dynamic range technology incorporate into our automotive sensors, in particular, our OV10635 and OV10640 gives us a significant advantage.We have secured multiple design wins in this category and brand name automotive models will roll out in the near future.My final discussion on automotive is the category we call Machine Vision.This is CMOS image sensors used in complex camera systems devoted to interpreting the image data captured, not for display image, but to use the information captured to assist in driving the automobile.These are cameras typically pointed forward to assist, or alert the driver and the ultimate goal is use these systems to develop to the autonomous driven vehicle.In fact, similar to the NHTSA-approved legislature, the imposed backup image solutions required in all vehicles by 2018.Similar legislature is being considered to require automobiles to carry forward front-facing machine vision systems.At OmniVisions due to our unique automotive sensor technologies, we believe we are gaining market leadership in this category.We have secured multiple design wins with either Tier 1 system integrators, or ecosystem partners.The OV10642 the sister product to the OV10640 is gaining significant traction in the application.Our emerging market category is predominately driven by the security market.Quarter-on-quarter, there was a significant growth.We anticipate continual strong growth.Fueling this growth is a rapid migration to IP camera platforms and the ease of use for domestic or small business setups.Additionally, security installations represent the next source of cloud-based service and data mining revenues for high-profile Internet service providers.Our shipments in the security market range from 5-megapixel down to VGA with the sweet spot in the 1080p, 720p, and our specialized 4-megapixel sensor that offers high dynamic range and superfast frame rate speeds.Now, I will comment on some products and technologies recently announced by OmniVision.In the past fiscal quarter, we announced the release of our latest PureCel based product with the enhanced autofocus technology known as phase detection autofocus, or PDAF.This will give DSLR autofocus functionality to one of our most popular mainstream sensors and a compact 1/3-inch 13-megapixel resolution.We recently announced our next generation 720p sensor for the notebook market, the OV9734.This product is our smallest 720p sensor utilizing our PureCel 1.4 micron technology platform to offer high performance in a small 1/9-inch form factor.The product is targeted to the notebook market or slim smartphone ID designs.A final announcement to discuss is our latest medical product release called the OV6946.This sensor is based on a reliable OmniBSI+ technology in one of the smallest form factors of 1/18-inch.This allows incredibly small endoscope products to be designed and for added value in the medical industry for many minimal intrusive procedures.We are to engage in multiple Tier 1 medical OEM customers who are highly motivated to utilize this product.As the automotive market incubated several years, the medical field is similar.We believe the medical industry will generate high barriers to entry type business with attractive return on investments.In summary, we continue to produce a broad range of products to cover valuable mature markets, as well as highly anticipated emerging markets.Thank you, Ray.I will now turn the call over to Anson, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance and provide guidance for our second quarter of fiscal 2016.Thank you, Shaw.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are reporting revenues of $329.9 million, an increase of 15.4% on a sequential basis, but a decrease of 18.9% on year-over-year basis.Direct sales to OEMs and VARs accounted for 69.7% of our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.It decreased from 76.5% in the prior quarter.The remainder of our revenues came from sales through our distributor channels.Their proportional increase in distributor sales when compared to the prior quarter was driven by an increase in the use of distribution channels in our China market.Our fiscal 2016 first quarter gross margin was 22.6% compared with the 22.4% that we reported in our prior quarter.Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million included in cost of revenues, our non-GAAP gross margin was 23% compared with a 22.7% in the prior quarter.Gross margin continued to improve, but the margin improvement was mostly attributable to the net margin effect from the sales of previously written off inventory and allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, which became less unfavorable when compared with our prior quarter.We did experience a small mix improvement in the first quarter, but the associated benefits were more than offset by price erosions which decreased our ASPs.In the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded approximately $2 million of revenues on a sale of previously written down inventory, an $8.8 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories with the net $6.8 million or 2.2 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin.In compassion in the prior quarter, we recorded proximally $1.6 million of revenues for the sale of previously written down inventory and $10.8 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, with a net $9.2 million or 3.3 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin.Overall, our business in China continues to be volatile.Demand for our end-use customers’ products is uncertain and our visibility is reduced as we are further upstream in the supply chains.Combined with the price erosions that we saw in our first quarter and some recent unfavorable exchange rate movements, we are maintaining a conservative stance regarding our own expectations and gross margin trajectory for the rest of fiscal 2016.R&D expense in our fiscal 2016 first quarter totaled $36.1 million, a 7.9% increase from the $33.5 million in the prior quarter.The increase is primarily the result of our annual companywide salary increase which took effect on July 1, and the increase in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal first quarter of 2016.We currently expect our R&D expenses in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease slightly when compared to our first fiscal quarter.R&D expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 included approximately $4.8 million of stock-based compensation expense.Excluding stock-based compensation expense fiscal 2016 first quarter R&D expense was $31.3 million as compared to $29.5 million in the prior quarter.SG&A expenses in our fiscal 2016 first quarter totaled $21.1 million, a 10.2% decrease from the $23.6 million in the prior quarter.The decrease is mostly the result of a $4 million one-time charge last quarter, representing success based transaction costs for the signing of the merger agreement with the consortium at the end of April.As an offset, however, our commission payments to channel partners increased in the first quarter, when our distributor sales increased.We expect our SG&A expenses in our second quarter fiscal 2016 to decrease slightly when compared to our first fiscal quarter in 2016.Our fiscal 2016 first quarter SG&A expenses included approximately $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expense.Excluding stock-based compensation expense SG&A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $17.4 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior quarter.The amount of amortization for our acquired patent portfolio remained at $2.3 million per quarter.Our GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled approximately $15 million as compared to $4.6 million in the prior quarter.Our GAAP pretax income in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $16.2 million as compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.As a reminder, included in our fourth quarter pretax income was a one-time gain of approximately $0.6 million related to XinTec completing a stock listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in March 2015.XinTec is one of our equity investees in Taiwan.Our GAAP tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was $2 million, this compares with a GAAP tax expense of $0.8 million in the prior quarter.Included in GAAP tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was the reversal of certain previously recorded tax reserves when the statute of limitations for the related tax matters expired.This reversal resulted in a one-time non-cash tax benefit of approximately $3.1 million.Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP income tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was $2.5 million.This compares to a non-GAAP tax expense for the prior quarter of $1.3 million.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our GAAP income tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage range.And our non-GAAP income tax rate to be in a high single-digit percentage range.In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our GAAP net income was $18.2 million or $0.31 on a per diluted share basis.This compares to $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the prior quarter.Excluding stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects, our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $28.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share.This compares to a non-GAAP net income of $13.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior quarter.Let me now turn to the balance sheet.We ended the first quarter fiscal 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $593.8 million, a $69.6 million increase when compared to our $524.2 million balance at the end of our prior quarter.The increase on cash position is primarily related to cash provided by operations.As of July 31, 2015, our inventory decreased to $320.6 million from the $344 million balance at the end of our last quarter.Our fiscal 2016 first quarter inventory balance represented an annual inventory turn of 3.2 times or 116 days sales from the 2.6 times or 138 days sales in the prior quarter.We are continuing our efforts to reduce our inventory, but given the volatility in our markets, we may likely experience an increase in inventory balance next quarter.Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2016 first quarter net of allowances were $147.5 million, a decrease from the $151.1 million at the end of our prior quarter.Our days sales outstanding in the first quarter decreased to 41 days from 47 days in our prior quarter.The higher days sales outstanding in prior quarter was attributable to the shipping pattern then, which was heavily skewed towards the latter half of the quarter.Regarding our class-action lawsuit, in June 2015 the court granted final approval of the settlement and entered a final judgment and order dismissing the action.Consequently, this quarter we reversed the $12.5 million of recoverable insurance proceeds and a corresponding $12.5 million of litigation settlement accrual with no additional cash settlement payment from us and no income statement effect.Lastly, a couple comments on our equity investees.As mentioned previously XinTec completed its stock listing in the Taiwan Stock Exchange during our fourth quarter.We were required to record the carrying value at its market closing price then, resulting in a tax effected unrealized gain of approximately $37.7 million in the fourth quarter.As of July 31, 2015, due to a significant decrease in XinTec’s stock price the total amount of unrealized gain decreased to approximately $14.8 million.As to our investment in WLCSP, it too experienced a decrease in stock price, albeit less severe than XinTec.Using the market closing price on July 31, 2015, our WLCSP stake is worth approximately $228.3 million.This compares to our recorded book value of $37.8 million at the end of our first fiscal quarter.With that I will turn to outlook.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which ends on October 31, 2015, we currently expect our fiscal 2016 second quarter revenues will be in the range of $300 million to $330 million.Our GAAP EPS are expected range from $0.12 to $0.27 per diluted share.Excluding the estimated expense and related tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, we expect our non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.40 per diluted share.Thank you, Anson.From our strategy and execution perspective, we are pleased by the progress we made this quarter.We are as focused as ever in building the business and we believe our growth story remains intact.Operator, we are now ready to take questions.Hi, this is Josh Buckwalter [ph] in for Rajvi.Thanks.Congratulations on the solid results.I was hoping to drill down a little more into the China handset market.I know you mentioned it’s very volatile, but could you maybe talk about the linearity both within the quarter and, I guess, so far in the second quarter?Thank you.If you don’t mind, could you repeat your question?The line we have is little broken up.I just want to make sure I captured the question accurately.Okay.Sorry about that.So my question was around China handset linearity.I know you mentioned it was volatile, but it would be helpful to get some color both within the current quarter and what you are seeing so far in the second quarter.I wouldn’t – I don’t know what adjective to use, linearity or not.I can tell you right now that the total market is still there and it is still quite dynamic.It’s very competitive, and the total volume is still enormous.What we also see is China continuing to not just service their own domestic demand which is enormous, but also the continual growth of their service to serving emerging markets such as India.And that’s also being driven through the manufacturing structures in China.The reference to the volatility is just the fact related probably to the financial markets.We are just being a little conservative with the certain recent events that occurred there.I guess, our position is, with those complex events occurring we want to take a conservative position in how it might affect businesses such as the consumer devices that we back into quite heavily into China.Of course, the good news is China is also picking up on some other markets that we look at as favorable such as the automotive market and the security markets.That is going to help as well.But nevertheless, the mobile handset market is the largest portion right now, still being driven out of China and just all the dynamic events occurring in that market is something we don’t have a full long-term picture for sure not – it’s difficult to predict.We still believe it’s a long-term good situation to continue investing in, but month to month is sort of what we are concerned about.Okay.Thank you.That’s very helpful.And then, I was hoping within the gross margin, you guys have done an incredible job with 11 straight quarters of increasing that sequentially.But it looks like the guidance suggests that might break next quarter, is that accurate?And can you maybe talk about what are the puts and takes within the gross margin?Thank you.Similar to what Ray mentioned earlier, in the near-term there are some volatility, particularly in the China market.And we all know about some of these unfavorable exchange rate movements.Even though we trade strictly in U.S. dollars that may translate into some concerns from our OEMs, particularly for those that need to sell their end products in their respective markets in local currencies.Because of these recent events, we have decided to take a more conservative approach in terms of assessing the near-term guidance.Your next question comes from the line of MelissA - I’m sorry, your next question comes from the line of Mr. Tom Sepenzis of Northland.Please proceed.Hey, thank you for taking my questions.I think – did you say that the ASP for the quarter was $1.03?53, okay, thank you.And, can you just talk a little bit about what you’re doing?You mentioned LCOS a couple times and I just was curious as to where you are in the development of the product.And potentially anybody that you are working with and in what capacity you might be – would that be for an AR-type headset or are we talking about signage or what are you guys doing in LCOS right now?LCOS represents a very complementary type of business and technology that we could leverage off of our experience in building CMOS image sensors, because it’s all about displaying an image.And it’s all about an array that displays in an RGB pattern, as well as in terms of its packaging manufacturing flow.That whole business is highly attractive for us to leverage and it backs into potentially common customers, where when we have an opportunity to sell sensors we can sell an LCOS as well.The way it currently stands today, it’s a very, very, very small business.In the acquisition that occurred several years ago.It came with some running business but very minor, very small, and in niche markets and steady markets of LCOS-type traditional applications.Going forward, you’re right, there’s a million, million different applications that are very attractive and exciting potential for LCOS technologies.Suffice it to say, we are talking to a variety of customers, albeit, most of these projects are, I would say, very emerging as many of new technologies are in development and in early introductions to market places in niche markets.So that’s all I want to say about our customers and our technologies and our engagements, it’s across the board, heavily engaged with many different customers, and we are searching for the big opportunities.Great.Thank you.And then, in terms of the acquisition, I know you can’t talk much about that specifically.But could you just let us know, are there any – at this point, it sounds like it is mainly regulatory approval from the governments.Are there any penalties for either party backing out of the current offer price?If you [ph] look at the agreement itself, yes, there are some penalties involved.Nonetheless, there we are still moving along.There are various regulatory approvals that we still need to obtain.And the closing conditions as listed in the agreement, we are still trying to step through that.Like for instance, we just sent an agreement with TSMC to sell them our equity interests in some Taiwan entities.These are just examples that we’re trying to get through.We are not expecting any significant change in terms of when we expect the transaction to close, still talking about the fourth fiscal quarter, but there’s no assurance about the close at this point.Great.Thank you.That’s really helpful.And then, last question and I’ll get back in queue.In terms of what’s going on in China, it sounds like there is pretty intense competition on the ASP side and just a general lack of visibility, so you are being quite a bit more cautious here in the near-term.Do you expect to see unit growth continue year-over-year this year and next, or does that flatten out just in terms of a longer-term view with the ASPs eroding so fast, do you still see the units actually growing?I’d like to just make general – very general comments, because there is quite a number of independent third-party reports, any one of us can pick up and read in reference in regard to markets and volumes and prices and resolutions.But the way we see it, China is a enormous engine of manufacturing, obviously, as I mentioned several times for its own domestic sales.But as we are beginning to learn and becoming very evident, it’s the manufacturing platform for emerging regions like India.We expect Africa and we expect Eastern Europe to be part of that process.So, you look at that situation, the market should continue to grow, although specifically to year-over-year what type of specific numbers that growth will be.I’ll leave it to better experts than myself for predicting the future.We are extremely happy in our position, which engage into this region because of its size and because of its – our ability to grow with it when it needs new technology, new products, and our ability to engage in our sales channels backs into many of our strengths.So, I mean, it’s not something that’s going to go away anytime soon.It’s going to continue to grow and certainly we’re – we want to participate in it for the long term.[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James.Please proceed.Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Harsh Kumar of Stephens.Please proceed.Yes, guys.This is Richard in for Harsh.Thanks for taking my question.I just wanted to kind of circle up on the China smartphone market.We’ve heard from some other suppliers that there may be some inventory kind of in the channel that needs to be worked down.Are you seeing any signs of this, or do you think it’s purely just you guys being conservative with the volatility in the markets?I can’t specifically say there is inventory right now that we are directly getting feedback.That’s not something I have directly heard through my channels.But we are feeling that there is perhaps in the – I would say the outlook beyond the current quarter, there could be some slowing down of the market.Now what’s causing the slowing down of the market, it could be as – maybe as you are alluding to, perhaps an inventory correction, it could be related to the financial situations in the China market, or it could be related to just market saturation.As we all know, there has been plenty of events.You could easily read in the news about certain OEM handset makers going through difficulties managing this particular period of intense competitive landscape.So all those combined is something that we are going to all have to filter through and bring back your own interpretation to manage your own business.And that’s something we have to wrestle with every day and that – those are my general comments to a very broad question that you have.No, that’s very helpful.And I know that it was pretty broad.And then as you start to look to the India market and some of the other emerging markets in the mobile space, are you seeing those guys transition straight to 4G phones, or are they going to 3G, kind of where are we in terms of that transition?Right.There is a very strong push to go into 4G as quickly as possible.However, the infrastructure, the price points, the configuration of all the handsets that need to be built to provide a 4G phone inside a 4G infrastructure and be able to sell the right volume to the consumer bases all has to be worked out.That’s going to be worked out with the next several quarters.Right now there is still quite a bit of 3G volume, but you are correct.Everybody wants a march to the 4G.It’s going to take a few quarters.That represents opportunity for all of us.Third time is a charm, I guess.This is Melissa for Hans Mosesmann.Thanks for taking my call.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was just <b>wondering</b> if you could give us a little bit <i>more</i> color on your automotive business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What the mix looks like as far as ASP or margin profile relative to the smartphone business?And then again, looking further out into – as you move into Machine Vision, how does that ASP and margin profile change?Thanks.Yes.We – I mean, we won’t be so specific in regards to margin as we don’t break that out for any particular of our segments or business markets.But I will help you out in just letting you know that the automotive market continues to provide double-digit growth quarter-on-quarter.I don’t – I’m not exactly sure how many continuous quarters now we’ve shown double-digit growth, but it’s on a very healthy, healthy pace.The resolution mix is migrating up, because as we incubated the automotive business for many, many years with simple VGA analog-type high-sensitivity sensors, we are quickly moving into the 1-megapixel for advanced backup cameras and then now a surround view system cameras.Machine Vision cameras are right now in a very, very strong design and engagement with forward-looking 1-megapixel type resolutions now.This all is migrating quickly.Product life cycles are beginning to accelerate now as all OEMs recognize the value of imaging and with the ultimate goal of having a full autonomous vehicle.So the resolution curve – we see the trend up – going up in resolution, which is very good news, because we do maintain higher profit margin type products in this business.And 1-megapixel is quickly moving into 2-megapixel and then even above the 2-megapixel range.We’ve got engagements with key OEM customers as well as Tier 1 integrated partners.So the whole story of the automotive industry in our business in it is extremely positive.There are no further questions in the queue at the moment.There are no further questions in the queue.Please proceed with closing remarks.Mr. Anson Chan?Thank you for joining us on this call and webcast.We anticipate holding our second quarter conference call on December 1, 2015.Thank you and good day.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your participation in today’s presentation.You may now disconnect and everyone have a good day.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.OmniVision Technologies, Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on August 27, 2015.</div></body></html>
