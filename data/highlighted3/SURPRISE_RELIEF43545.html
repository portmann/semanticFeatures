morning, ladies and gentlemen.Welcome to The Jean Coutu Group's 2015 Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year Financial Results Conference Call.Please be advised that this call is being recorded.Good morning, everyone.The Q4 earnings release was put on the wire earlier this morning and was also posted on The Jean Coutu Group's corporate website.The quarterly press release is accompanied by additional financial information and we’ll refer to the quarterly results slide presentation and MD&A during this call.The press release and MD&A are also available on SEDAR.Here with me today are Francois Coutu, President and CEO and Mr. Belzile VP, Finance and Corporate Affairs.Mr. Coutu will discuss Company's results and key operating highlights and Mr. Belzile will then cover through financial details.This will be followed by a question-and-answer period for analysts only.I would ask you to limit yourselves to only one question at a time, so as to allow us time to address as many different analyst questions as possible.Media are invited to contact me for comments or interview purposes.We would like to remind listeners that the Company's forward-looking statement disclaimer applies to all our communications.Good morning everyone.Welcome to our spring [Indiscernible] conference.Total sales have achieved solid growth, in a market which still remains very competitive.Let’s look at the details of these results.During the fourth quarter network sales increased by 4% to $1.1 billion, while The Jean Coutu Group’s consolidated sales were up by 4.1% at $641 million.As shown on the first table network pharmacy sales increased by 4.4%, whist distribution center pharmacy sales were up by 3.7%.The introduction of new generic drugs reduced retail, pharmacy sales growth by 1% in the last quarter and price reductions of the generic drugs reduced by another 0.6%.Without these deflation factors network pharmacy sales growth would have been 6% in the last quarter.Furthermore, the generics penetration rate increased by 1.3% year-over-year to reach 68.5% in the last quarter thus impacting pharmacy sale, this increase can be explained not only by new generic drugs coming to market, but also by the ageing of the population covered by public health insurance, which back favors the dispensing of generic drugs.Network front-end sales showed an increase of 3.5%, while distribution center front-end sales grew by 5.2%.Turning to the next slide, we see that operating income before depreciation and amortization decreased by 3.9% this quarter to $84.1 million.Despite a solid operational performance, this decrease is due to the negotiation of a retroactive credit for previous quarters of $4.9 million for publicity costs recorded as a reduction of the general and operating expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 last year.Furthermore, a charge of $600,000 for a stock appreciation rights and deferred share units was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 compared with $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.This expense is mainly attributable to the fluctuation of the Corporation’s common share market price.Net profit amounted to $55.2 million or $0.30 per share during the quarter ended February 28, 2015 compared with $57.7 million or $0.30 per share last year.The following slide shows the quarterly same-store sales growth for the PJC network on a same-store basis network pharmacy sales increased by 4% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 over the comparable quarter, while prescription’s count grew by 3.2% year-over-year.Once again keep in mind that combined with a 68.5% generics penetration rate introduction of new generic drugs and price decreases reduced pharmacies retail sales growth.On the other hand it’s been a while since we saw pharmacy sales grow at a faster pace than scripts counts for a two consecutive quarters, which is good news.Also on a same-store basis, front-end sales increased by 2.7% year-over-year showing a positive strength for the last three quarters and overall network sales increased by 3.4% during the past quarter on the same basis.During the fourth quarter, we launched a contest which proved to be very popular with our clients and two super weekends were held in January where many door crasher prices were announced, increased in sales were significant during these two events.We also had various promotions, which were supported by important advertising campaign on television, radio and our weekly flyer and through social media.We are very pleased to report that The Jean Coutu Group was ranked as The Second Most Admired Company in Quebec and first as a retailer in a survey conducted by a Leger Marketing recently.This preferred position in the marked is once again well ahead of our competitors in the retail sector and a consulted population is almost unanimous on its positive opinion of our company.On the real estate front, we relocated one store in Longueuil [Indiscernible], on slide 8, you can see a photo of the new drug store.Three significant store expansion or renovation projects were completed during the quarter.There are another 25 projects underway.During the fourth quarter, we proposed various health related initiatives to our customers.Jean Coutu drugstores distributed free of charge over 13,500 quit to win challenge, kits to their patients.We also promoted - and these kits were distributed through our patients.We also promoted our exclusive website functionality that allows customers to print free of change, a prescription summary for their income tax return directly from their Online Health Record.Another example of health related advertising shown on slide 10 was done for services related to the health of those who travel.I guess that’s a good quarter, but again let’s go to the financial review and Andre will speak about it.Thank you, François and good morning everyone again.The table shown on slide 12, reconciled operating income before depreciation and amortization to net profit.Income taxes amounted to $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $21.4 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2014.Earnings are subject to a 26.9% tax rate in our 2015 fiscal year and there was no significant item affecting the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.Depreciation and amortization charges amounted to $8 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $8.4 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2014.Fourth quarter fiscal 2015 OIBA decreased to $84.1 million compared to $87.5 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2014 for the reasons explained by François earlier in this presentation.Note also that other items explaining the SG&A increase are expenses of $2 million approximately for publicity and rental expense that were translated in a equivalent increase in other revenues charge back to franchises.The balance of the $10.6 million increase in these expenses is related to higher labor for annual inflation and higher volume handled in our warehouses on top of additional support two new stores in the network.You also have a summary of our statement of financial position on the following slide, there was no bank debt used at quarter end and we had $121.9 million of cash on hands.We reminded you that we cancelled a portion of $250 million of the $500 million revolving credit facilities during the quarter in order to reduce standby fees by $425,000 annually.We have sufficient liquidity with availability of $250 million under this credit, with an optional recording of another $500 million.The company generates strong unpredictable cash flows and is in an excellent financial position.The book value of total equity amounted to little more than $1 billion compared to $932.1 million at the end of the previous fiscal year.The construction of our new distribution center and head office in Varennes is still on schedule and within budget.On slide 14, you can see the cash flow related to operating activities amounted to $79.7 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.Cash flow used in investing activities were $34.7 million during the last quarter, including $31.3 million used for the construction and acquisition of store or DC related capital assets and $0.4 million invested in intangible assets.Total selling square footage was 3,185,000 square feet at the end of the last quarter compared to 3,96,000 square feet at the end of the same quarter in the previous fiscal year.In fiscal year 2016, the Corporation plans to allocate approximately $130.4 million to capital expenditures and banner developments costs including $103.4 million to almost complete the new distribution center and head office in Varennes.We planned to open 12 stores including 3 relocations, complete 24 store renovation and expansion projects, resulting in an expected total selling square footage of the network of 3,283,000 square feet at the end of fiscal year 2016 or 3.1% surplus growth.The corporation did not purchase any shares under its normal course issuer bid during the last quarter.As usual the last slide shows the contribution from our generics drug manufacturing subsidiary in our consolidated results.That concludes our presentation on the fourth quarter Fiscal 2015 results.I would now ask the operator to open the question further.Thank you.Thanks and good morning, gentlemen.I’m just wondering on Bill 28 obvious you have had enough, some more time for discussion both with your franchisees and with the government.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And wondering what your thoughts are at this point in time of the probable impact on the franchisees and whether you have any plans at this time to just possibly offer them a little bit <b>relief</b> on the royalties in order to help them through this period ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Bill 28 was recently passed that gives all the powers to the ministry, Minister of Health to negotiate the fees for our pharmacist.We will see if he will negotiate in good faith or not.At this time, we cannot say anything, we know speculation, we don’t negotiate.Okay.And have you had any discussions with the franchisees if we assume that impact is going to be about $100,000 or $177,000 per franchisee, have you had discussions with them around perhaps any break in the royalty payments?Okay, got it.Thank you, Francois.I was just looking at the balance sheet, cash flow and capital allocation, obviously, very you have a nice amount of cash on the balance sheet, you continue to generate very strong free cash flow, could you just walk us through a little bit of thinking behind the 10% dividend increase and whether at this point in time you actually do intent to repurchase the share of 2016 and F’16?You know in the context of the additional reforms in the market that we can talk much about we thought it was prudent to have a lower increase [Indiscernible] of the dividend than we had for the last few years, depending on what’s going to happen in the 40 [ph] both future regarding that, but as you know we have you are right, other than business, we do pharmacy and specifically with the government, we do have a business with the private payers and on the front-end that generate good cash flows and for which we will put find good ways to reinvest that cash flow either to additional dividend growth or the share buyback are the main, if you – we can find good opportunities of acquisition as we always said in the past, we would rather reinvest in business and grow our pharmacy business, but as you know we have currency a large investment in Varennes [ph] that has [Indiscernible] for most part of it, we are still on schedule on budget, but that investment will be completed sometime in the early in the first quarter or second quarter of 2016 that the calendar quarter I was referring to or fiscal quarter.And also just recently, we had to pay almost $50 million in income taxes if you remain - I’ll remind you that last year we had a good saving in terms of income taxes from the deduction for drug deduction that was given to company by [Indiscernible] and our installment this year were based on that last year income tax expense, so we had now to pay for the balance of $15 million.So the cash balance will be - the balance will be a little lower at the end of the next quarter, so that’s about what we intend to do, we’ll review the situation on quarterly basis and see what’s the best use for that excess cash flow.Andre, just one question for you.On the year-over-year increase in SG&A, I know there were some unusual item stock-based comp and the advertising credit you got last year, but the SG&A dollars were still up you provided some explanation, there is one item I didn’t quite understand, you were talking about a $2 million adjustment, the explanation was little complex, I’m just wondering if you could go through that again?Yeah, actually, it was not an adjustment, it’s just that we lease some real estate that we sublease to our franchisees, so you’ll see when we grew this square footage of that real estate portion an increase in our rental expense, but you have actually an equivalent increase in the rental income in other [Indiscernible].So the SG&A grow but on a net basis doesn’t make any difference or actually we even make a little margin on those rents.So those were increased in the quarter by above $500,000 and same thing in the publicity cost which increased by above 1.5, these specific publicity cost were charge back to the franchisees, so you see an increase in the expenses, but call an increase the revenue stuff, that’s what I meant.Okay, and the other thing you mentioned to on the SG&A part of your presentation was additional support to franchisees, it’s not the level of support is going up or just that your store count has gone up?It’s both actually because when we open new stores, as you know for the first few years and the – it will take some time for them to reach the breakeven point and some time we will provide supporting the form of credit in our royalties, but also direct support otherwise which goes in the Gen A [ph] and that expense as we grow the network obviously it grows also.For the two quarters in a row now, you’ve finally seen some price appreciation in your average script.Can you give us some idea of what your outlook is for the rest of calendar 2015?Actually for the prescription pricing or the prescription drugs has same pricing, obviously, we don’t provide forecast as you know, but on top of that depending on what exactly are going to be the measures that are implemented by the government it may be that they reduce prices again, we don’t know, on top of the four additional molecules that were added by the Pan-Canadian coalition to the list of the 18% drugs, they may find otherwise to reduce prices, we don’t know, we’re actually, we have no visibility whatsoever on what exactly we will do so, so it’s difficult to predict at this point.Okay.And you’ve mentioned up front that the competitive environment rates quite intense, have you seen any benefit of the target stores finally closing down or other dynamics is causing the price promotion intensity will remain quite...?Well, actually, yes, first of all, we were probably more aggressive in the last quarter and previous quarters and we felt that realize that the competition is out there, we need to be extremely present and within, but at the same time I agree, that the closing of the target store of this somehow help for the stores that were immediately located nearby.Obviously, it’s the ones that are sold at other stores for example health and beauty is obviously a department for us that receives more competition than ever and somewhat also from the OTC level where you can find OTC now at Casco and then Walmart and all this, but we rely on convenience and good value anyway, so even though it’s a challenge we take up the challenge and we’re not afraid of it.And in the quarter when you say that you are more aggressive, I guess depending your position or is that because of the target liquidation or because the others had stepped up their pressures?No, I think we want to stand our ground, I think we want to make sure to tell our population that the destination for the things like health and beauty and OTC it is a chunk or two and we want to make sure that in a world while everybody now tries to get a piece of our business, well, we want to tell them that it’s still the best value to go to Jean Coutu, it looks like it works.And then just finally the product revenues, the revenue growth slowed quite a bit this quarter.Are we getting closer to than more normalized runrate going forward given the that seems like your penetration, your royalty is getting closer to maturing?Well, there is different way to looking at it, obviously with the aging in the population, there is some initiatives by government, which will definitely propose the usage of more generic drugs as well as in the private sector.So I think it will grow definitely, but also there is a pressure of decreasing in prices as governments are more and more involved and the coalition and reducing the prices.So we will see how this will match up.Yeah, hi thanks, just following up on that last question.Are there any big drugs coming off pattern in the next couple of years?They have in the past the big drugs, there will be, that once in the next few years will be the smaller ones, yeah.Okay, great, thanks.And can you just give us some color on the smaller store format initiative, of the new net stores that you are looking to open in fiscal ’16, how many of those will be the new smaller store from that?That’s a good question.I’ll have to look at it.There hasn’t been a lot of them forecast, because of the opportunities were not there.I remind you that most of them that we wanted to open were based also on acquisition on competitive stores, regional stores pharmacies were going to be for sale, because in smaller community it’s difficult to answer Greenfield [ph] and there hasn’t been many of them, but we’re ready whenever the opportunity will come up we’ll be ready to grasp those opportunities.Thank you very much and good morning.Just question on I’ll start with on the CapEx.I guess it came in a little lower than we had anticipated for the quarter and the year.Is this Andre related to some of the pressures on the cash front that you spoke about or is just there a delay in spending going into the next Fiscal Year?Yeah, it’s actually not cash related, we have access to sufficient capital, as you know it’s more question of opportunities of acquisition that probably has been rise as quickly as we would have thought, as you said we ended with 3,185,000 square feet at the end of the fiscal year.We targeted last year as a budget for this year to get to 3.2 million roughly that was 4% growth and we ended up with 2.9%, it’s mostly based on less opportunities than we thought.So this year, we’ll see what’s the impact of the additional reforms in the province, it may create more opportunities we’ll see, but we have let’s say conservative target this year, 3,283,000 square feet that’s only 3.1% square foot growth, so we think its achievable for this year.Okay, great and into - so that 107 million that’s what your reference, I believe in your release for CapEx for this year, I mean how much are you expecting in that number for there to be acquisitions?We actually, the CapEx we are - most of it in the numbers that actually, the number was $130.4 million from that there is $103.4 million for the new distribution centre.So it’s not a large number that’s roughly $27 million for the balance.Keep in mind that some of the new store we opened are developed with promoters, so we don’t necessarily open the real estate, so that’s why the number may be - may look as that low, but we planned to open 12 stores including 3 relocations, so the 9 other stores are probably above half acquired, half agreed [ph] to close.Okay, that’s helpful, thanks a lot and just on the script unit count, the growth rate there as evidence in your presentation, the number keeps coming down from the 5% down into the low 3% range, what’s the outlook as you look into 2016, should we expect this trend to be continued?I won’t say that, I think now there is probably no additional prescription drugs have been coming in the market to help for certain diseases or certain therapeutic situation.We will monitor that as you see, obviously, whether that the employers or the government, they tried to really push down the consumption of medication, they’re telling the doctors to make sure that they don’t prescribe too much and so on, it’s proper use of proper money discounts and we will follow that closely and also keep in mind that in the last two years we were used to have over 10% growth in the drug that were dispensed in the form of [Indiscernible] discussed on Custom blisters that are weekly supply base to the same-store those are growing these days more and between 8% to 7%, so that account for portion of the decrease you see there.Okay, that’s great and just two more from me.Just the consideration of the Canada the Pan-Canadian group that you referenced and they’ve impact on drug prices, could you tell us how many molecules now where they’ve mandated the reduction in price, in what percentage of drugs does that represent now, generic drugs?If I recall, I think that we were at 10 drugs and there is a plan for four additional, there was four additional this month in April, I can tell you that I don’t number that as a percentage in terms of volume what they represent but it’s a large portion, I mean those drugs are large volume drugs [Indiscernible] first, but the more we had drugs to that list the less impact we have.Right, okay.And the final question just on the product margin came in 45% in the quarter, what should we expect as moving forward, will that depend a lot on Bill 28 or do you expect a leveling off that do you make discussions with suppliers et cetera?Again as I answer to the first quarter, difficult to predict at this point, mostly we don’t provide forecast as you know, but on top of that the we don’t know, are the professional ounces, they going to remain at 15% which is a cost for product, are they be, will they increase or decrease we don’t know, are they going to touch also the prices on the formulary, we don’t know, so it’s really difficult to answer that question, sorry about that.Yes, I have some questions about the new distribution center in Varennes, did you know when it will be started fully up and operational and are you expecting some benefit in cost per keys and I guess the third part of that is when will the depreciation on the facility begin to show up in fiscal 2017?Yeah, the first part of the question, I will say that we’ll - the head office will move at the end of this year, the distribution facilities will begin gradually in early 2016 and by May at this time next year we should just about to have to move everything from here to Varennes.And so from there we should see the benefits from being more efficient, but obviously there is going to be a transitioning in get into full speed at the DC in Varennes and in terms of depreciation as the assets are available for operations, we have to start depreciating these assets.So there is going to be some of it probably in this fiscal year, at the end of this fiscal year, but most of the increase will shown in our results next fiscal year.Well, actually, we don’t want to commit ourselves before we’ve actually been moved out of the premises here, but we have lot of interest from different parties to whether to buy the premises, buy the existing land and buildings or rental, so we’ll see actually, we look forward to eventually as these premises are certainly good for a lot of players in a sense that the size and the location and so on, so we are not worried about that at all.And just finally on the payment for pharmacy services, is there - are there ongoing discussions or is that progressing or where we on that?There are ongoing negotiations, and it’s part of the overall negotiations with the [Indiscernible] on Bill 28 and Bill 41 [ph].Good morning.In the press release you have mentioned that you are planning to make more investments to targets that training improve store service levels and also improve the operating efficiency of the network.I was wondering if you can please maybe elaborate on that perhaps, where do you think are the biggest lie ahead for the company?We are going to change our technology, not only here at the Head Office, but also in our stores.[Indiscernible] so definitely we will, it was state-of-the-art actually, it will give us a lot of information and so on and this obviously we will need in the field to have lot of training done on at store level.And that’s part of the thing that we mentioned.There is our DC in which we invest a lot in automation equipment to be more efficient.We have a new also warehouse management system that is being developed to be more efficient.All the actual processes in the warehouse are going to be improved, but on top of that that’s what we are seeing, we are in the process of developing a new point of sale system for our stores in the field.And those stores are going to be switch to system gradually over the next 24 months and that will provide us with a lot of information to improve sales and grow again in these stores.Okay, perfect.Last question just with respect to CapEx, Andre can you share with us, I guess that the $190 million that is being budgeted for the new DC and HQ how much was spent in Fiscal 2015?In 2015, I would have to get back to you but we’d say that it is probably around $175 million because we expect $103 in the current fiscal year and there will be a balance of [indiscernible] million, we’ll invest in the next fiscal year, so it’s $175 million to $180 million.Okay.[Inaudible] pretty much entirely what you spent in ’15 was related to DC, because I think you CapEx in ’15 was roughly about 75.Thanks.On product margin, I say at least you are close to saw that normalized level now, but do you still expect some further erosion there as a result of the extraordinary gains in the prior year?Yeah, this year excluding the impact of additional reforms, as we mentioned in the past, we are obviously, we’re expecting a slight reduction again this year, since there will be - there was four additional molecules that were about to 18% in April, just in April.So obviously, that didn’t show in the margin at the end of February, so yes, we were expecting further reduction in margins.Yes, I was just wondering in terms of the general merchandise and over the counter drugs and the front-end of the store if there is you see substantial opportunity to increase fertility in any particularly categories or to improve the kind of private label penetration?Yes, definitely, we have developed, I wonder, if it’s over 200 new products and the personnel are PJC brand and our great support from our franchisees, pharmacist owners and managers and now that’s the great part is that we have an offer - a complete offer which even will try to [Indiscernible] over the next months, but very - if we compare to last year, we have a much larger offer than before in the private label and well there is no question about this economy for our customers and also more profitability for pharmacist owners, so that’s something we will definitely worked on in the next years to come.Hi, yeah, thank you.Just a follow-up on the DC, obviously, you’re at full capacity more or less with the existing one, will the new DC is it simply for growth and efficiency or do you have other opportunities that you see for that DC other lines of business that potentially could be serviced out of that DC and if not.I mean, what’s the runway, how long does the DC last you for projected growth?I mean, it’s all of the above in a sense that we want to have more efficiency from that DC capacity, it will be very high in a sense that manually the existing premises will serve us for another 20 years.We also have additional space to expand if these are arrived, so we are moving for good and definitely this is very exciting and I think our service level will probably improve, our capacity for growth will also be expecting to - we will definitely look for opportunities to use even more of this facility, but it’s something we look forward to obviously.And the transition into the new facility, which I guess really starts nearly back end of the year.I mean, how disruptive do you see that being if at all, is there a way to measure into 2016, 2017 or?Well, we have hired lot of people here to make sure that this transition is done at this way.It’s not like working on the existing premises here.We are, it is sometimes very difficult.We are actually building something completely out of somewhere else with new technology.So we will make sure not only the building, but also the technology is ready to accept our incoming business and that’s something that we want to make sure this is done properly and minimize actually any pitfalls along the way.And you know what, we are not pressured really to move into new premises in a certain date, we’ll move in accordingly to work what we just said.We’ll move when we are ready and make sure that the transition is as smooth as possible.Thank you.There are no further questions registered at this time.I would like to turn it back over to Ms. Bisson.Thank you everyone for your
