(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, the lost tax revenue could undercut moves to lower Japan's debt burden, which is the worst among advanced economies.Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities, said that given the costs small businesses would face from having to deal with different tax rates, the negatives from introducing such a system "outweigh the positives over the long term".Also, he said, "revenue from the sales tax tends to be very stable, but when you introduce exemptions this makes revenue more volatile."Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will soon start meeting to decide the details of the scheme, which is likely to be similar to multiple value-added tax rates found in many European countries.Many households have been struggling with a rise in imported food prices due to a weak yen, so lower tax rates on food could support consumer spending and sentiment.Increasing the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent could boost tax revenue by around 5 trillion yen  ($41.86 billion), but the government could lose up to 1 trillion yen if it exempts some food from the higher tax rate, UBS's Aoki said.The government will be tempted to subsidise some of the administrative costs of the scheme for small companies, which would burden public finances further, Aoki said.Ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating last month by one notch to A+, which is four rungs below the top rating, because it doubted that the economy will grow fast enough to boost tax revenue.Japan's public debt is around twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, but successive governments have made only limited progress in curbing spending and new borrowing.($1 = 119.46 yen)   (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Richard Borsuk) What’s Next: Tomorrow’s Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
