(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Last week the International Monetary Fund urged Riyadh to alter domestic energy prices, curb public sector wages, and introduce value-added tax and land tax in coming years.Many economists think such policies are probably inevitable in the long run.But Saudi officials did not respond publicly to the IMF's advice, so it is not clear when or even if the government will summon the political will to act.The rigid, top-down structure of the government can make economic policy changes difficult, said a Saudi banker."Everyone is having to wait for direction."(Additional reporting by David French in Dubai; Writing by Andrew Torchia ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford) Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
