if Mexico fails to come through - a border wall, all while balancing the budget," New York Magazine exclaimed earlier this month, when critiquing Donald Trump's ad hoc fiscal policy "platform."Before we're too hard on Trump for his seemingly contradictory policy pronouncements, let's be clear about something: politicians almost never fulfill the promises they make on the campaign trail.You'd be hard pressed to find someone who holds elected office that managed to implement the platform they campaigned on in full.Take Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for instance.One minute he and his "erratic Marxist" Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis were going to throw off the chains of austerity and "make Greece great again."Seven months later, Varoufakis was back to being a blogger while Tsipras was forced to accept a third bailout from Greece's EU oppressors after the ECB put the screws to the country's banking sector.Or take President Obama, who once said "yes we can" but who, as Jon Stewart famously quipped, was eventually forced to tacitly admit that "well, I thought we could, but it turns out the other guys are assholes."The point is this: if you know it's going to be impossible to deliver on your promises anyway, why not just tell the people everything they want to hear and then hedge your bets by talking about how good of a negotiator you are?That way, when you have to abandon some of the campaign trail rhetoric out of sheer political expediency, you can just point to the compromises you made as evidence of what a good deal maker you are.That seems to be the Trump strategy and make no mistake, it's worked so far.But it's rather bewildering for anyone trying to understand his proposals as something that emanates from a Republican frontrunner.Jennifer Rubin - who writes "from a conservative perspective" for the Washington Post's "Right Turn" column - is completely exasperated.Here's what she had to say two weeks ago: Normally in a presidential election you'd have a fiscal conservative who'd put out spending reforms and a pro-growth tax plan with some overly optimistic assumptions.But this time the GOP has Trump, who is nearly as bad as Sanders.If we take Trump seriously and include his protectionist policies and round-up-and-deport-millions plan, the economy is in all likelihood going to take a beating, further depressing revenue.It is laughable that conservative fiscal hawks - the same people who want a balanced budget - are now lining up behind Trump.It's even worse that conservative economists are contributing to drafting plans that are so reckless.Rubin is referencing a study by The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget who suggests the following about Trump's proposals: [Trump's] initiatives together would add anywhere from $10.7 trillion to $15.45 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years.Debt held by the public would increase from nearly $14 trillion today to $36 trillion by 2026 (compared to about $24 trillion under current law).This means debt would grow from 74 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the end of last year (and headed to 86 percent by 2026) to 129 percent by 2026.Under our high cost estimate, debt could reach as high as 141 percent by 2026, or reach as low as 111 percent assuming his plans also lead to significant economic growth.That's "nearly as bad as Bernie Sanders," Rubin laments, incredulous.This is reminiscent of the sentiments expressed by Citi, whom I cited early Friday.Here's what the bank said about the outlook for the US deficit and budget going into November's election: Unfortunately, with just six months to go before the election, we see limited evidence from the leading Presidential hopefuls that their policies may avert or even ameliorate the United States' looming Federal budget deficit and debt crisis.But you never have the full story until you've heard from the "smartest" guys in the room: Goldman.After all, if anyone knows about how things are likely to play out inside the Beltway, it's the bank that's contributed nearly a million dollars to Clinton over the course of her political career and which has paid the former Secretary of State more than $675,000 for speaking engagements: As it turns out, Goldman generally agrees with the notion that fiscal policy will likely be expansionary no matter who wins the White House.In the meantime, policy uncertainty is "elevated" for a number of reasons."In light of the unusual election campaign currently underway, uncertainty seems likely to rise even more than it typically does in a presidential election year," Goldman begins, in a note out last week.Citi and Goldman aren't the only ones to cite the "unusual" nature of the current election on the way to noting increased uncertainty.Earlier this week, outspoken billionaire Mark Cuban had the following to say about the likely reaction of stocks (NYSEARCA: SPY ) to a Trump victory: I can say with 100% certainty that there is a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction.That uncertainty potentially as the president of the United States, that's the last thing Wall Street wants to hear.Goldman goes on to say - and I'll be more colloquial here than they are - that Trump's policy prescriptions are basically all over the place and so, when taken together, they accidentally turn out to be centrist.Here's the actual language from the note: Mr. Trump proposes a set of policies from across the political spectrum, which could be considered centrist when averaged together.Mr. Trump's views on international trade, for example, appear to sit to the left of Sec.Clinton, while his tax proposal is more in line with other Republican plans, and his views on immigration are to the right of most if not all of the other candidates for the Republican nomination.Regarding health care and entitlement reform, his proposals average out to a roughly centrist position but also include some items supported by the left and others from the right.By contrast, Sec.Clinton's proposals are more politically uniform and in many cases reasonably close to the positions of the current administration.Goldman goes on to make an interesting point.Trump may have a hard time backing off of his campaign promises because, whether he knows it or not, his proposals are more amenable to unilateral executive action: Some of Mr. Trump's most high-profile stances-on foreign trade, immigration, and relations with foreign allies, for example-happen to be areas of policy where the executive branch has greater authority to make decisions without Congressional approval.On trade, for example, the President has significant influence over decisions involving protective duties in response to complaints brought by domestic industries, and could in theory withdraw from existing trade agreements without Congressional approval.Likewise, the executive branch has fairly broad discretion regarding immigration.The upshot is that the areas where Mr. Trump's proposals have attracted the most attention also happen to be the areas where the executive branch has the greatest latitude.Well, yes, that's "the upshot" unless of course you never intended to implement such radical policies in the first place and you only championed them because you were telling voters what they wanted to hear.If that's the case then the fact that you can't blame Congress is a bad thing.In any event, let's turn to fiscal policy, because that's what matters for the economy and therefore, to investors.Goldman lists three reasons to expect fiscal policy expansion no matter who is elected: "Neither candidate has emphasized significant fiscal restraint" "Looking past the campaign rhetoric, there are some common priorities.Both candidates have advocated a significant boost in infrastructure investment, for example" "Congress has already shown that, over the last year, it has become increasingly willing to resolve political disagreements by adding to the deficit."Goldman's takeaway: "...over the longer-term, the policy risks are not all to the downside, and at least as far as fiscal policy is concerned, the risks lean to the upside over the coming year in our view."That seems to be a nice way of saying this: when it comes to fiscal policy, there are no truly conservative candidates left.The astute market observer will note that when monetary policy reaches its limits (which it has), fiscal stimulus is all that's left.That is, if you believe that expansionary fiscal policy is what's needed to revive growth now that central banks have reached the end of the road, then this is bullish.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the analysis highlighted above , one is certainly left to <b>wonder</b> whether so-called `` helicopter money '' is now a foregone conclusion -
