2015 Earnings Conference Call.All participants will be in listen-only mode.[Operator Instructions].After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.[Operator Instructions].Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Dwight Robson, Chief Public Strategy and Marketing Officer.Please go ahead, sir.Thank you, Denise.Good afternoon and welcome to Civitas Solutions Inc. fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call.I am joined by Bruce Nardella, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Denis Holler, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, if you do not already have a copy, our press release with financial statements can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at civitas-solutions.com.Please be advised that today’s discussion includes forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates and other information that might be considered forward-looking.Throughout today’s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which could affect these forward-looking statements.The forward-looking statements are also subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements we make today.We are not obligating ourselves to release any updates to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and would encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for a discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow because we believe such measures are appropriate ways to discuss our financial results.However, please remember these are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to other GAAP measures such as net income or income from operations.I refer you to our press release issued today detailing our fourth quarter results for comparable GAAP measures.Thank you Dwight and thank everyone for joining us on today’s call to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and full year results.We delivered a solid fourth quarter performance to complete a very successful fiscal year for the company, both financially and operationally.During fiscal year 2015, we achieved significant growth through disciplined investments in organic opportunities and the completion of 10 acquisitions.Moving forward, we are continuing to pursue our long-term growth strategy by seeking to capture attractive opportunities from new started initiatives, additional acquisitions, expansion of our Post-Acute Specialty Rehab Services or SRS in new and existing markets and by leveraging our entry into the large and growing market for Adult Day Health Services.As we continue to grow most importantly we continue to fulfill our missions by providing high quality cost effective services to more adults and children in need of support.Dennis will provide more detail on our financial performance later on in this call but first I want to take a few minutes to discuss some of the fourth quarter and full year highlights.Our fourth quarter results reflect growth through selective acquisitions as well as strong organic growth.Net revenue for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2015, was $351.2 million, an increase of 7.3% from the year earlier period.Approximately 33% of net revenue growth was organic with acquisitions making up the balance.Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.9% to $37.9 million.Looking at our full year results, we’re pleased with the progress and growth we’ve achieved in fiscal 2015.During the 12-months ended September 30, 2015, net revenues increased 8.8%, including strong growth in both of our two largest service lines, I/DD and SRS.Approximately 47% of net revenue growth was organic with acquisitions making up the balance.This is the first year since fiscal 2011 for which M&A activity generated a majority of growth, which underscores our ability to execute both levels of growth.In the long-term however we aspire to achieve a balanced growth profile propelled by both organic and M&A opportunities.For fiscal 2015 adjusted EBITDA increased to 19.9% to $154.5 million and was fueled by our record level of new start investment in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.These two classes of new starts are now approaching maturation and as a result moving forward we will lien on more recent new starts including a big class we have planned for fiscal 2016 to drive organic growth.During our IPO process we noted that we believed we can achieve significant expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin over a multi-year period, but in fiscal 2015 we actually accomplished this expansion much quicker than originally anticipated.As a result we would expect that additional margin expansion in the future would be more modest in result from our successfully leveraging G&A expenses in growing higher margin services.As expected or ARY service line contracted in fiscal 2015 largely due to the reverse momentum in the five states where we are in the process of divesting our ARY operation and transitioning the young people served to other providers.For fiscal 2015 ARY operations in these five states contributed $48.2 million in net revenue and $2.3 million in EBITDA.In the eight states where we plan to continue to provide ARY services, we achieved solid growth during the year with net revenues up 5.7% over fiscal 2014.We expect the ARY closures in all five states to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016.As I said last summer when we announced the difficult decision to close these operation following the completion of the strategic review of the entire ARY service line, we believe that our action plans including these transitions and the establishment of the new center of excellence for children and family services composed of child welfare experts will enhance our position as a national leader in serving youth at risk and their families and strengthen the financial performance and predictability of the service line.During fiscal 2015 we completed 10 acquisitions with total annual revenues of approximately $38.5 million.The 10 companies were acquired for a total consideration of $44.8 million including $6.1 million of contingent consideration.For those companies acquired in fiscal 2015 add to our Post-Acute Specialty Rehab Services or SRS segment and six are part of our human service segment in providing mix of residential and supported living services to individuals with the intellectual and developmental disabilities.As we reported in our 10-K subsequent to the end of fiscal 2015 on November 30, 2015 we acquired an Indiana human service business for total consideration of $3.4 million.This company provides residential services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disability and has annual revenues of approximately $7.1 million.Moving forward, our overall M&A pipeline remains robust including Adult Day Health companies.Since entering this adjacent service last year via the acquisition of a platform company in Massachusetts we have remained very enthusiastic about the potential of this new service line as the market as a whole has a strong organic growth rate and like the other markets in which we operate is very fragmented.These services are also consistent with our mission of serving individuals in the least restricted community settings possible and providing a strong value proposition for our payers, the individuals we serve and their families.And now I would like to provide some context regarding our fiscal year 2016 guidance.For fiscal year 2016 we expect net revenue between $1.4 billion and $1.44 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $161 million and $165 million.It is very important to note that this guidance takes into account a potential increase of $2.5 million in new start investments compared to fiscal 2015.It also accounts for a loss of $48.2 million and $2.3 million of net revenue and EBITDA respectively generated in fiscal 2015 from ARY services in the five states been divested and it also accounts for an estimated $500,000 of potential operating losses expected to be incurred as these operations are wound down in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.This guidance excludes any related one-time charges which will be treated as an add-back to adjusted EBITDA.These one-time closure costs are currently not expected to exceed $3.6 million, a significant reduction from our estimated worst case scenario of $6.7 million at the time we announced our decision last June to divest ARY operation.We are particularly excited at our 2016 guidance that our 2016 guidance includes an acceleration of our investments in new starts compared to the last couple of years.There are a lots of good opportunities in our business and we expect that leveraging those opportunities will result in a heightened level of investment in new starts in 2016.Since fiscal years ‘12 and ‘13 when we invested a record high amounts in new starts, investment levels have moderated over the last couple of years.We expect these investments to increase by approximately 2.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015.Ultimately though predicting the timing of these opportunities can be challenging.So the actual increase in new starts investment level in fiscal 2016 maybe a little lower than 2.5 million.However given the potential magnitude of opportunity it is possible that our investment level could be higher.And therefore approach the record levels of investment in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.We have been very pleased with our historical returns on new start investments which have been a significant driver of organic growth.New starts typically take 18 to 24 months to turn profitable and their associated investments will impact margins in the short-term.However, an uptick in new start development bodes well for long-term organic growth.I would also note that we expect higher growth in the back half of fiscal 2016.There are three primary reasons for this.First, we expect more growth in the back half of the year from new starts and organic growth activity.Second, while we feel very good about our M&A pipeline, the timing of deals can be uneven.In fiscal 2015, we started the year fast with almost 65% of the revenue acquired in the year coming to us in transactions closed in approximately the first 100 days.Fiscal 2016 has started slower but we expect M&A activity to pick up later in the fiscal year.And finally, we will experience a greater headwind in the first half of the year as a result of the in-process divestiture of ARY operations in five states.Most notably, fully 2.1 million of the 2.3 million in EBITDA that these operations generated in fiscal 2015 came during the first half of the year and as I noted earlier we expect to incur an estimated $500,000 in onetime charges early in fiscal 2016 as these programs are transitioned to other providers.The two strategic decisions we’ve made to capture increase demand through substantial increase in new start investments and to divest the significant portion of our ARY service line will obviously depress our projected growth in fiscal 2016 but we are confident that they will also support our longer term growth and help us become an even stronger company in the future.Excluding the impact of the increased new start investments and the divested ARY operations our 2016 guidance implies a year-over-year net revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.8% and at 8.7% respectively.Now just the few more comments, first the operating environment remains very stable.Overall state revenues remain positives and are running ahead of projections in most of our key markets including our largest state Minnesota where higher tax collections have helped create a budget surplus approaching $2 billion.Assuming state revenues across the nation remains strong we expect pricing adjustments while modest will be positive in fiscal 2016.Though we expect less of the tailwind form pricing than we experienced during the last two fiscal years.As was the case during our last call in August, West Virginia remains our biggest concern.Against the back drop of weak revenue collections driven by lower energy prices the state is implementing significant changes to its I/DD waiver program with some of the biggest impact coming from changes to staffing ratios.Families, providers and advocates have all been out spoken in raising concerns about some of these changes.A legal aid group has filed a class action law suit on behalf of individuals with disabilities, and there is also a three part appeals process in place for individual serve to have serious concerns about the impact of these changes.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However at this time we were assuming that our team in West Virginia will have to manage through these changes without any significant <b>relief</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If data assumption proves to be true we will see a significant financial impact to our West Virginia operations all of which is factored into our guidance for 2016.Given the protected nature of the populations we serve our revenues have been generally insulated from significant raise in service cuts and this has been especially true for our I/DD services.In the handful of circumstances during our 35 year history when we have had to face significant financial impact from Raider [ph] policy changes as we currently are in West Virginia I have been reminded of the advantageous of having a highly diversified base of payers as we do across our 35 state platform.We discussed during our last two conference calls that due to tightening labor markets in some of our state we plan to expand our variable pay program for direct care and program staff assuming we are on track to achieve more than $154 million in adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2015.As the end of the fiscal year approach we remained committed to making a bigger investment in our workforce, but we altered our approach under our standard variable pay program next week we will pay a yearend average bonus of nearly $500 to almost 13,000 direct care and program staff.Our staff does great work in support of others and this variable pay is well deserved.However given the significantly lower than expected utilization of our high deductible health insurance plan and more importantly how expense of it is for our staff to access healthcare at yearend we contributed an additional $2.1 million to employee health savings accounts or HSA's and did not expand our variable pay program.In total, we contributed just over $6 million to employee HSA's during the fiscal year.For fiscal 2016 we are using these dollars to hold flat or reduce the insurance premiums that employees pay each period including those for employees with dependence, who could see a premium reduction of as much as 20% to 30%.Our variable pay program and efforts to reduce healthcare cost for employees are two planks of a larger workforce strategy geared to ensuring we can continue to attract and retain a qualified committed staff we need to continue to provide high quality services and achieve our growth agenda.The labor market is certainly tighter in some states but we believe we can manage our direct labor cost as a percentage of revenue to a level in line with our experience in fiscal 2015.At this point I would like to turn the call over to Denis Holler our Chief Financial Officer to discuss our financial results in more detail.Denis.Thanks Bruce.This quarter many of the factors that drove our growth over the previous three quarters continued.Our I/DD and SRS businesses continued their growth trajectory both organically and through acquisitions.Although the ARY business continued to lag in total, the remaining ARY states grew their revenues year-over-year.New starts continue to drive the growth in revenue and margin expansion.In spite of the fact that our healthcare planning usage has increased to anticipated levels and was still a margin contributor for the year and this is unlikely to continue in 2016.In addition, we did experience some margin expansion from our other self-insured programs Working capital and account receivable collections remain positive, although days -- sales outstanding which were essentially unchanged did not positively impact free cash flows as they did in the prior year when we saw significant improvements.Finally, free cash flows accelerated during the year as a result of our -- the improvements to our capital structure.Moving to the results for the quarter, net revenues grew by 23.9 million or 7.3% over the fourth quarter of last year.The increase included 7.9 million from organic growth and 16 million from acquisitions.Our human services segment which represents 80.6% of revenue increased 6% over the prior quarter.Our SRS segment which represents 19.4% of revenue increased 12.9% over the prior quarter.If you consider the continuing at risk youth states trends remain positive in volume and average rates for all of our service lines.This fueled organic growth for all of our businesses.This quarter I/DD gross revenues grew by 6.9% with more than half of that organic or 3.8%.SRS gross revenues grew at a rate of 11.7% with 4.3% of that organic.ARY revenues for the continuing states grew by 4.3%.Organic growth was almost entirely due to the maturation of new starts.New starts initiated from fiscal 2012 through this quarter contributed 7.7 million of the growth in revenue.New start losses increased from 1.8 million in the prior quarter to 2.1 million in the current quarter.We expect this increase to continue into 2016.Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.9% over the prior quarter in addition our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 60 basis points to 10.8%.During the quarter we did see margin expansion of 120 basis points related to our workers’ compensation and professional liability programs both as a result of favorable claims experienced.For the first time in fiscal 2015 health expense consumed margins by 70 basis points, but this reversal was due to positive adjustments to our health reserves in the fourth quarter of last year.Unlike prior quarters direct labor leveraged by 30 basis points in the quarter.Occupancy cost continuing the trend from the first three quarters of the year consumed 70 basis points of margin.This is primarily due to lower occupancy in our I/DD service lines.Finally, we continue to see a positive impact from reduced sales allowances which contributed 60 basis points of that margin expansion.Net income for the quarter was 4.3 million compared to a net loss of 5.9 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year.The increase in net income was mainly due to lower interest expense resulting from the redemption of 212 million of senior notes and the elimination of management fees paid to our private equity sponsor as a result of the IPO.The increase was partially offset by 1.7 million of compensation expense for retirement benefits for our executive chairman and 1 million of professional services fees associated with our secondary offering and a $700,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense.Free cash flow continued its positive trend this quarter coming in at 27.3 million compared to just 6.3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year.Pro forma for IPO cost [ph] for the fourth quarter of the 2014 free cash flow would have been 14.3 million.This represents a virtual doubling of free cash flow and is skewed to the lower interest expense related to our new capital structure some improved working capital and higher profitability from operations.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $12.5 million or 3.6% of net revenue, which is in line with our expectation and up slightly given we typically see an uptick in the fourth quarter.Full year capital expenditures were 3.1% of net revenue.Moving to the results for this year, net revenues grew from $1.256 billion in fiscal 2014 to $1.367 billion in fiscal 2015 and increase of $111 million or 8.8%.The increase included $52.5 million from organic growth and $58.6 million from acquisitions.Our Human Services segment, which represents 80.7% of revenue, increased 7.5% over the prior year.Our SRS segment which represented 19.3% of revenue increased, 14.7% over the prior year.Consistent with the quarter organic growth was driven by the maturation of new starts, new starts initiated from fiscal 2012 through 2015 contributed $31 million to the growth in revenue which is more than half or 59% of our organic growth.In fiscal 2015 new start losses moderated slightly coming in at $5.7 million compared to $6.1 million during the prior year.This trend reversed in the fourth quarter where new start losses increased compare to the prior quarter.This trend we expect to continue through the first half of our 2016.If you consider the continuing at risk [ph] new states trends remain positive in volume and adverse rates for all of our service line and fueled organic growth within all of our businesses.This year I/DD gross revenues grew by 7.7% with more than half of that organic or 4.6%.SRS revenue grew at a rate of 14% with more than half of that organic or 8.3%.ARY revenues for the continuing states grew by 5.7%.During the year we generated adjusted EBITDA of $154.5 million this represented an increase of $25.7 million or 19.9% over the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 11.3% in fiscal 2015.Improving by a 100 basis points over fiscal 2014.Once again adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was impacted favorably by the maturation of new start and acquisitions during the year our margin was also positively impacted by reductions in expense where the self-insured portion of our health and insurance plans which all together contributed 80 basis points to our margin expansion.About half of the improvement is the result of the redesign of the health plan and is not expected to continue.We also saw leveraging of general and administrative expenses including labor which contributed 30 basis points as well as lower adjustments to revenue which were $4.7 million less than the prior year a positive impact of 40 basis points.These improvements were offset by occupancy cost and direct labor which consume 30 and 40 basis points respectively off of the year.Net income for the year was $3.1 million compared to a net loss of $22.8 million during the prior year.This increase in net income was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the refinancing of our debt facility in January of 2014 and the redemption of $250 million of our senior notes in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015.Also contributing to the increase in net income was the elimination of management fees paid to our private equity sponsor as a result of the IPO.The increase was partially offset by a 10.4 million impairment charge related to the ARY divestitures and a $4.3 million increase in stock based compensation related to our new management equity plans.Free cash flow for the year was $47.7 million compared to $48.6 million in the prior year.The 2015 free cash flow was significantly impacted by the refinancing in the IPO.Adjusting for these items free cash flow would have been $64.2 million.The increase over the prior year is mostly due to the reduction of interest from the capital structure changes.There was a slight improvement in day sales outstanding on our accounts receivable to $41.4 days at September 30, 2015 as compared to 42.5 days in the prior year.Capital expenditures for the year were $42.8 million or 3.1% of revenue, compared to $35.3 million or 2.8% of revenue last year.Although we came in at the lower end of our guidance range we expect our spending to increase a percent of revenue as we invest in our growth initiatives and in our SRS businesses which are more capital intensive.During 2015 we completed 10 acquisitions in our SRS and I/DD service line compared to 11 acquisitions in 2014 total consideration including anticipated earn outs was 44.8 million compared to 56.1 million in fiscal 2014.And finally our net leverage came in at 32.62 times our annual adjusted EBITDA of 154.5 million, this was down from last year which ended at 4.4 times leverage off of adjusted EBITDA of 128.8 million.In addition to the fiscal year 2016 guidance that Bruce provided we are providing the following model guidelines or modeling guidelines for fiscal 2016.Stock-based compensation of 17.4 million and the annual tax rate for 2015 at 50%.The modeling guideline for our annual stock compensation expense reflects 10.5 million of additional expense in the first quarter of fiscal ‘16 and this is related towards under our former equity compensation plan that vested in October It’s important to note the vesting of these awards impacted the allocation of shares of Civitas that were distributed from the NMH Investment LLC to our private equity sponsor and management and did not impact the number of shares outstanding.Because this expense is not deductible for tax purposes it will drive an increase in our effective tax rate in 2016 to 50%.Next modeling guidelines.Depreciation and amortization expense 71 million.Average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year 37.5 million.Stock based and capital expenditures will be in the range 3.3% to 3.5% of net revenue.And with that I will turn it back to Bruce.Well before I do Bruce, I am just being told that the net leverage number that I stated for this year, I misspoke on that, it’s 3.62 times our annual adjusted EBITDA of 154.5 million and that is a big improvement over the last year which is 4.4 times Very good sir we will now begin the question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions].The first question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays.Please go ahead.Couple of questions here.First just on the I/DD side in terms of RFPs are you seeing any new entrance, health plans or others that are interested some of these I/DD programs now?At this point in time Josh we have not seen any significant new entries.There might be one or two out there but they haven’t really crossed our radar screen in a material way.On the labor cost, I am just looking at the human services sort of potent numbers in the 10-K.It looks like your ratio -- your labor-to-cost ratio as a percentage of revenues was down for the full year but up in 4Q and I guess I am just wondering, I know you mentioned that now in your comments this quarter and last quarter, maybe help us understand what the labor pressures are and is this a trend that’s accelerating going forward?As we’ve mentioned both in our public reporting and on past calls, there are certainly labor pressures in some of our markets.However it’s very uneven across our 35 state platform.It usually manifests itself with increased premiums paid for increased utilization of overtime that is driven by staff vacancies that occur because it’s harder to attract and just as importantly frankly it’s hard to hold on to quality staff as they have other opportunities out there.However we have been generally very effective and I believe we can continue to be so by paying a lot of attention to planks that I just mentioned in our remarks that this is the second year in a row in another week we are going to distribute a total $6.6 million in variable pay to our staff that have been around for at least a year.And we did that same $6.6 million distribution last year.So I think the variable pay is good way for us to manage because that rewards people that are stuck with us where we have good performance it does not have a tail on it and it also allows us to manage those selective states where we feel like we do have to make wage increases and we will continue to do that where we deem it necessary.So between the variable pay program, selective wage increases where we feel it is necessary along with enhancements to our HSA contributions and now looking forward into the 2016 with a good portion of our employees that select health insurance that they will receive a reduction in their premiums, we think we can manage about in the zone where we have been in fiscal year 2015.So it's a long and complicated answer because it's a complicated issue and it plays itself out differently in the -- obviously in the 35 states that we operate.Okay.That's helpful.And then just last question on the guidance, if I just sort of take a step back and look at the EBITDA, you guys are guiding that something of the midpoint around 5.5% EBITDA growth.I know it's closer to 8.5 or maybe even certainly higher when you excludes some of the acceleration in new starts in the ARY stuff, but how do you actually think about long-term EBITDA, is this consistent with what you guys are thinking?Yes I think in general yes I mean I'm hopeful that we can continue to leverage our G&A and continue to accelerate our growth in our higher margin SRS and ADH businesses.So I would be hopeful that we could continue with EBITDA growth that is slightly accelerated over our revenue growth I mean that's our plan we were obviously very successful in doing that in 2015 and hopeful that can continue, but as you know anytime your growing your higher margin businesses that accelerated rates compared to your much larger human service business overtime we looked for that to take effects, however it's not going to happen nearly as rapidly as it did during fiscal year 2014.Couple of questions.So just to make sure I understand so on the other variable pay program, payout you’re doing next week and as well the HSA contribution are those things that you accrued in the fourth quarter or have you been accruing something all year for that or is that going to be booked in the new year?Okay.And so anything you do this year is not going to hit -- that's not part of the 2016 guidance?Okay.When we think about the new starts obviously you've got the I/DD business, you've got the SRS business and you've got Adult Day Care are they going to skew to one business line versus the other and can you sort of remind us how long it takes to get to breakeven on those and how long it takes to get to maturity during -- in the different business lines?Yes.There -- actually this is frankly a little better distribution of new starts in terms of program type than we had in 2012 our record breaking year.It's dominated -- it's not dominated the majority is still in I/DD and we think that's a good thing and of those -- and in consistent with the trend of the last couple of years there are a lot more day programs.Now day program do take a little longer to achieve profitability probably towards the outer end of our 18 to 24 months range, whereas residential programs can break even and 12 to 18 months, day programs using take a little longer.But there are also here are two Adult Day Health new starts in here, it remains to be seem since this is such a new service line to us how long they will take to break to profitability.At this point we don’t think it will be materially different than our other programs.We continue with a good healthy dose of SRS new starts and these are exclusively in our NeuroRestorative business where we continue to do a lot of residential support at living new starts through the country.And believe it or not in selective markets as has been our plan, there is some investment in ARY and it's for periodic services which has been a trend that we have seen play itself out over the last four or five years.So it's a broad distribution all-in, we’re at that 18 to 24 months break even as I said day programs and probably Adult Day Health as well as I/DD day programs will take a little longer than the residential programs.Residential I/DD as I said will probably be in the 12 to 18 months range.Residential NeuroRestorative or SRS will be a little longer to profitability simply because we’re dealing with a much smaller population to draw from.But we don’t see -- right now we would not see this mix producing results that differ materially from past results of new starts.Sure okay and then you highlight West Virginia a couple of times and I was encouraged to hear that I guess it sounds like you have taken the more conservative view in the guidance so far and so there is a brake in interaction, hopefully it sounds like it’s upside.Can you just sort of give us a sense of the order of magnitude of what we are talking about there in terms of the dollar -- the millions of dollars, sounds like between where we’re at today where it could be if they do what you are hoping they will do?Well it’s a substantial state for us, it’s about 70 million in annualized revenue and although this is not a rate cut A.J., it would have the impact of like a high single digit rate cut to us.So it’s about $7 million to $8 million hit to revenues coming in.So that’s about the size of it.Now if its plays -- best case scenario is that they change course and they say, we’re going to -- we’re not going to implement these changes but these changes have been in place for a while, the legal process takes quite some time to come into play and I am not very optimistic that there is going to be substantial change.So as a matter of fact there could be word from the court about the pending lawsuit as early as tomorrow.So we have taken the conservative route and we’ve made sure that our leadership there is planning accordingly.I really would be much too speculative on my part to try and predict what might happen on a go forward basis.I just wanted to quickly ask you a follow up on labor.Just curious, in areas where there is selective wage increases, are you seeing any pricing increases in those states as well and is that helping to offset some of the higher costs for you or is this really just about remaining competitive in those markets in terms of the vacancies and being able to fill those spots.Yes in the State of Ohio -- Paula, that’s a good question, in the State of Ohio there is a rate increase that’s scheduled to go into effect January 1, I believe.That rate increase requires a certain percentage, that percentage escapes me right now, that is required to be passed through to our employee.And over the last two years Paula in the number states where there have been minimum wage increases that we have complied with, a number of states have followed up with ties to increases in our reimbursement to account to that, Minnesota is another very good example of that.As a matter of fact, if you are in Minnesota we got 1% which was a second part of rate increase a couple of years ago and we are going to pass on portion of that to our employee in Minnesota as well.So yes it doesn’t happen all the time but it happens probably more often than not.Okay, that’s great, not to beat a dead horse, but have are also seen some better retention given the variable pay program and HSA increases that you’ve made in terms of the employee retention there?While I am encouraged by the fact that we are paying out this bonus to people, this 30,000 people, those are folks that have been with us at least a year and that’s the requirement for this program.I think it’s too early to tell frankly if there has been any impact on the retention though.Okay great now thank you.and I want to go next maybe to the SRS business and I am wondering if you can update us on plan for CareMeridian and growth there and where is occupancy now and what opportunities are left there, are there any thoughts about building out new capacity and then in terms of NeuroRestorative are there any potential to add states in ‘16 as part of the new starts that you mentioned or are those new starts really concentrated to markets where you already have business?Well I will take the CareMeridian first, there are longer term plans to increase capacity, frankly it’s a little too far out there for me to speak to right now, but there is availability of capacity in our -- for example, our Colorado program and we have -- that there has been a recent change in legislation in California that's going to allow us to expand the licensing capacity.A number of our programs have nine or 12 people we can expand our licensing to 15 so were going to be executing on some renovations there to expand capacity there along with some selective new program development that again is it's little too early for me to speak to.So that's the picture CareMeridian.With NeuroRestorative as far as new states I would say there is not a new state for this year, but it is expansion in the states that we are in expanding the footprint within those states.For example the state of Texas is one that we have very high hopes for their and it's been growing nicely and we’re expanding our operations there.So it's more it would be more accurate to say we’re staying in the same states for now and that we’re looking to expand our markets within those states.Okay, great.Thank you.And then maybe lastly from me.I'm just curious on the I/DD side of the business.Can you update us on what might be happening with waiting list and previously you've mentioned Florida and Pennsylvania anything of note out there other than West Virginia that could be a catalyst in 2016 and are there any other states that you are in where waiting lists are maybe approaching critical levels where states would really need to act up on this from a budgeting standpoint?Well.In PA there was a significant initiative on waiting list, but they have yet to execute on the budgets which is highly unusual, so we remain hopeful there.Ohio is another state where we are looking for some significant opportunity as well and they are looking to downsize some of the larger ICF type facilities so those are two states that come to mind we are always watching in the state of Mississippi for example there could be initiatives there that could break, we've been in Mississippi for two years now but it's largely with non-residential Day program, but we think there could be some opportunities down the road there for our residential services as well.Hi.This is Steve Baxter on for Kevin.Can you remind us what if anything is factored into guidance in terms of deals that you haven’t yet announced?Yes.We don’t guide Steve specifically to M&A or we don’t segregate the acquired growth from our organic growth, so as I said earlier the timing on acquisitions is difficult to predict we have no reason to believe that this year would be off of last year even though we are starting slower, but we don’t segregate any guidance between acquired revenue and organic revenue.Okay.So it's something but not necessarily a huge deviation from prior years is kind of what you’re saying.Okay.And I guess how is then kind of a like six to nine months in terms of deals and some of your comments suggest that it might remain so for the first half of 2016.So I guess what gives you confidence or visibility into the fact that you think that the deal pipeline is going to start to kind of come through for you more in the back of 2016?Just to look at our pipeline and the kind of conversations were having with people.We been doing this for a while now, it's a well-honed practice within the company, we've done over 50 acquisitions in the last seven or eight years.So I haven’t -- in another words I haven’t seen anything that's waiving huge flags in front of me.It's just difficult timing to predict.Okay, thanks.And then just going back to West Virginia for a minute, you said the potential revenue impact is maybe seven to eight million but I think you had also said that a lot of that was going to be driven by decrease in staff ratios there, so if we were to think about what the impact of say EBITDA would be, it wouldn’t be 78 million [ph], it would be your margin on 78 million is that kind of the right way to frame that?This is Brain in for Richard Close.First question on in terms of your guidance provided for 2016 when you think about your visibility into revenue for the year do you any sense of how much of that revenue guidance is already accounted for, and secondly what are the key drivers that make up the delta between the high and lower end of the range.I think some of it might be timing of M&A like you previously discussed, but any additional color would be helpful.Thanks.Yes.I'll take your last first.The -- I'm sorry, now I just lost the chain of through in those two questions, could you repeat the questions?Yes, sure.The first one was visibility into revenue for 2016, how much of that is accounted for?And secondly, what are the key issues or drivers that make up the delta between low and high end of the range?Yes, primarily M&A, how many deals that we’re going to be able to get in, and the timing of those deals.So if we are going to be back end loaded second, third and fourth quarter that might tend to put you at the mid or lower point of the range.But it’s really very, very hard to tell.It’s largely M&A, the size of the deals, the pricing involved, how long it takes us to get them in the door.The new starts of the class year ‘12 and ‘13 that Dennis and I have spoken about, as I said they are largely mature so there is not going to be huge growth from them in 2016 because they have matured already.So a lot of this variability is going to be tied to M&A and the amount of organic growth we can just get from delivering high quality services.The issue about revenue visibility, as I said before, if we do a good job upon intake in dealing with people with intellectual and developmental disability.It’s our goal frankly to keep them happy and satisfied and to serve them for the rest of their lives.So -- and we have been very successful in doing that over the years.So a good deal of that revenue is recurring revenue, very sticky, I don’t have the percentage for that.But the people we are waking up today, we are hopeful we are going to be waking them up a year from now and a year after that and so forth.So that is less so the case obviously with at risk youth.There is generally a turnover in that service line, something short of a year, but if we know we are going to have them six to nine months, that’s usually typical for the at risk youth service line.Okay, thank you and my second question how do you think about the sustainable long-term organic growth rates for the SRS and human services segment?And then secondly, you had mentioned Adult Day Health market is growing at a strong organic rate, what is that growth rate?Well I said we had -- we have a first organic new start opportunities in Adult Day Health, so it’s too early.Those new starts are frankly too young, Brian, for us to actually see the revenue growth from them, so it remains to be seen what those are.The market itself in Adult Day Health is growing across the country about 7% annually and frankly we would look to try and replicate that organically.So it’s a little too early to tell there.SRS continues to have good opportunities for organic growth.I think that’s driven by the increased recognition of brain injury requiring specialized support and the fact that the state and federal governments are recognizing that fact and developing more specialized waiver -- Medicaid waiver programs to fund the expansion of that service.So we feel very good about the opportunities there.And as far as I/DD as you have seen from our history we will continue to execute on those, they ebb and flow overtime they never completely disappear.We are always working on a number of programs starts year-after-year, but it looks like 2016 could be shaping up to a year that reminded us somewhat of 2012, that there seems to be a couple of these larger opportunities like I mentioned Ohio, but we are very diversified in this year’s new start class across all four of our service lines.Great thank you and then my last question is on some of the long-term growth strategies.You mentioned new start initiatives, expansion of SRS and also the Adult Day Health business.In the past you have discussed other markets such as mental health and youth autism as potential new service markets to enter.So do you have any color you can provide or an update on how you are thinking about these opportunities or where they may sit on your timeline of growth initiatives?It’s speculative Brian to talk about.The next service line -- sufficed to say we are doing a lot of homework particularly in youth autism market, but it’s too early to say.Could you mind just resetting your commentary on acquisition spend, as it relates to your guidance?How much EBITDA is factored in the low and high end of your guidance on acquisition spending?Thanks.Again we don’t segregate that.The amount of growth coming from acquisition vis-à-vis organic growth opportunity.We’ve had history now over the last couple of years.We’ve adjusted our goals on how much money we deploy.We look to deploy about 25 million dollars, we look at that frankly it's kind of a floor as you know.We certainly exceeded that in 2014 and 2015.I would hope we don’t exceed that in 2016, so that remains to be seen though.But we don’t specify how much of that range is dedicated to the acquired revenue versus organic.What was the -- as you wrapped up the year, what do you think your multiple was on your acquisition spend in fiscal ’15?Okay.My next question is just speaking of labor costs.I wouldn't expect you to have this number exactly, but just approximately if you looked across all your states.What percent of your labor spend is in states without a minimum wages law, number one and maybe it would be -- maybe touching that minimum wage rate or within a few dollars of that minimum wage rate, where it would be affected if we got say $10 to $12 federal rate?I don’t think I might be wrong and we will have to follow up, I don’t think this year we are seeing any new minimum wage laws that are going in effect in the states in which we operate.That is -- in the last couple of years that has been the case, there have been a number of states and we certainly comply.As I said earlier in a number of those states we got reimbursement increases to deal with that.Normally, our employee workforce is above the minimum wage we might have 1% or 2% at that minimum wage in any of our given state.So a lot of times when these wage increases were implemented there was not immediate impact to us directly, in some cases there were, but it affects -- has a compression effects, as you move up the line and gain more experience in direct care work.What I meant was -- I mean states like say North Carolina that don’t have a minimum wage, if there is a federal minimum wage passed, let say $10 to $12.Where right now the federal was in $7 or something.Do you expect -- it's fair to say a federal minimum wage of $12, would that have a material effect on your labor cost?Well.It certainly would in some of our I/DD states again in most instances we’re above the state minimum wage, but if you were to get a $12 minimum wage it would affect us and it would affect the entire community base human service delivery systems very dramatically and I would suspect that if the federal government is going to do that there is going to be some substantial consideration on the reimbursement and those things as well.Right, okay.And then finally in your guidance, let's just stick to the point and it’s a little confusing with all the insurance accounting, but approximately what kind of growth in healthcare spending are you estimating at the midpoint of your guidance?And ladies and gentlemen.This will conclude our question-and-answer session.I would like to hand the conference back over to Bruce Nardella for his closing remarks.Okay.Thank you, Denise.In summary, we produce a year of strong growth both from organic and acquisition opportunities and we’re very pleased with the performance of our business both financially and operationally, as we enter fiscal 2016.During fiscal 2015, we took actions to strengthen and stabilize our ARY service line and we paid down debt and strengthen our financial position, which has resulted in enhanced free cash flow that can be deployed for investments in organic growth and M&A.Our industry dynamics are attractive, we are executing on our proven business model and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.I'm very grateful to our outstanding workforce and thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to our mission and to the individuals whom we are proud to support.And I'd like to thank all of our stockholders, I look forward to keeping you updated on the Civitas story, as we move forward.Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen.The conference has now concluded.Thank you for attending today's presentation.You may now
