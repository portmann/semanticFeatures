financial results remain below our long-term expectations, we are pleased to return Key to profitability for the third quarter and to have achieved a positive and healthier quarterly EBITDA.Our gross margin percentage in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 also increased compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014 due to favorable facility utilization in 2015, cost savings from prior workforce reduction initiatives and the absence of the workforce reduction related charges that were incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.In addition, we continued to manage our overall cost structure which has resulted in a significant decline in operating expenses in all functional areas in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.The cost savings realized from the previous workforce reductions implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the second quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as lower R&D project expenses were the main contributors to the lower operating expense levels in fiscal 2015.As communicated previously, the European market is a high priority strategic focus for our company.In the third quarter, our European orders in Euros achieved a quarterly record for this region with several strategic wins across our core market segments.In the third quarter, we received a significant first time order from a vegetable processor in Europe, which included multiple chute fed and belt sorters as well as associated vibratory equipment.European orders in Euros for the last six months also reached the highest order level recorded in our company history for any six-months period in this region.These record orders in Euros have been achieved despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the prior fiscal year, which has negatively affected the U.S. dollar equivalent of overall European orders.Again, Europe is a high-priority for our company and we are pleased with our continued progress in building customer relationships in this region.There continue to be significant opportunities in our potential order funnel for this region and we are currently aggressively pursuing them.North American orders remained sluggish in the third quarter, primarily due to a slowdown in capital investment and continued project delays in our core market segments.The drought in California, along with export challenges for North American processors relating to the strong dollar versus the Euro has resulted in a number of processors delaying project into the future, more significantly in the nuts and dried fruit market.Also in North America, year-to-date the processed fruit and vegetable market is down compared to the prior fiscal year and processed potato orders have increased only slightly year-over-year.There are signs, however, that the activity in these two markets will increase in North America in the coming quarters, with several important opportunities in our potential order funnel.Despite these challenges in North America, our chute fed solutions have continued to gain customer acceptance globally in the nuts and dry fruit and processed fruit and vegetable segment, most significantly for the Taurus, our most recently released chute fed product.In the third quarter we received multiple orders that included a combination of our chute fed and process system solutions.There are, however, multiple significant global projects for which we were expecting to receive orders in the fourth quarter, primarily in the potato segment, which have now been delayed into fiscal 2016 and beyond.As a result, we no longer expect to achieve year-over-year double-digit bookings growth in fiscal 2015.As previously communicated, we are currently engaged in extensive field testing of our new developments in our core segments in both Europe and North America.We are encouraged by the response of our strategic partners to the value of our new solutions and we are confident in our ability to effectively leverage these developments in penetrating new and existing insertion points in our core and high potential adjacent markets.We continue to expect to bring our new developments to the market in late fiscal 2015.We remain confident in our long-term strategic direction and in our ability to effectively leverage the investments we have made over the past few years to drive anticipated profitable growth and increased shareholder value in the future.Thank you, Jack.First I will discuss the third quarter results for fiscal 2015.Third quarter net sales were $30.8 million compared with $31.3 million reported in the same quarter a year ago.Sales of automated inspection systems in third quarter totaled $13.1 million compared with $15.1 million in the same period a year ago, a 13% decrease.Third quarter net sales of process systems were $10.1 million compared with $9.1 million in 2014, an 11% increase.Parts and service net sales were $7.6 million versus $7.1 million in the same period a year ago, an 8% increase.Gross profit for the third quarter was $9.2 million compared with $8.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.As a percent of sales, margins of 30% increased from the 26% reported for the same quarter a year ago.Gross margins for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were higher compared to the corresponding prior period, due primarily to more efficient plant utilization, cost savings associated with the cost reduction activities in the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of the current year and the absence of the expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives from the prior year.During the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced certain cost reduction initiatives.As a result, we incurred approximately $1.25 million in costs in the third quarter of the prior year of which $775,000 and $475,000 were expense of cost of goods sold and operating expenses, respectively, during the quarter.We have actively managed our overall cost structure and, as a result, our total operating expenses have decreased significantly as compared to the prior year.Operating expenses of $8.6 million for the third quarter were 28% of net sales compared with $11.1 million or 35.5% of net sales for the same quarter last year.Operating expenses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 were favorably affected compared to the same period in the prior year by cost reduction initiatives taken in both the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the second quarter of fiscal 2015, lower R&D expenses and the absence of the expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives from the prior year.Net earnings for the third quarter were $295,000 or $0.05 per fully diluted share compared with a net loss of $2 million or $0.32 per share in the same period last year.I will now discuss our third quarter 2015 orders and backlog.For the third quarter ended June 30, we recorded new orders of $28.5 million.Last year's third quarter new orders totaled $26.9 million.Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $29.9 million.This compares with $26.6 million at the end of the third quarter last year.The backlog mix at the end of the third quarter was 37% automated inspection systems, 56% process systems and 7% parts and service.For the nine months ended June 30, 2015, net sales were $72.5 million as compared to $85.6 million for the same period in the prior year.The net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was $0.55 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of $0.85 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2014.Cash at the end of the quarter was $9 million compared with $9.7 million at September 30, 2014.The company also announced today that we have entered into a new financing arrangement.This new arrangement allows for a revolving credit facility of $15 million and a term loan of $5.3 million.This new credit facility allows for greater flexibility and stability moving forward and is expected to meet our needs into the future.Looking forward, we continue to expect the results in the second half of 2015 to be significantly improved from the losses in the first half of the year.Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are expected to decrease slightly as compared to the net sales recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.Gross margins are expected to be slightly lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are anticipated to be slightly higher as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.Thank you, Jeff.As we begin our fourth quarter, we are energized by the many positive changes we are making throughout our organization and we are very excited about bringing our new innovative developments and solutions to the market in the near future.We believe that execution of our strategic initiatives will have a rewarding impact for our shareholders, our customers and our company.I continue to be extremely proud of the great efforts, perseverance and commitment of all our employees and I again appreciate the support of our investors.Hi.Good afternoon.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you can comment about the bookings activity you did see in North America .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Can you say whether it was up, down?And if it was down, how much, just in light of the projects that you saw slip?For the quarter, year-over-year bookings are up slightly for the year, though they are down from where they were year-to-date a year ago.Got it.And Jack, is there a way to separate some of these large projects that you saw, is there any way, any sense you can give us as to how long they are going to be delayed?Are these orders that potentially could slip and you could see it again in the second half of fiscal 2016?Well, last quarter we talked about several large orders in North America that were pushed out.A few of those were recognized and realized as orders in the in the third quarter.Some of that we are still expecting in the fourth quarter and some of them might be beyond that.In addition to those though, there are some global large potential orders that we are really counting on for this fiscal year and one or two of those, again, were very significant and they could be pushed out a year.Then again, if it's related to the internal business needs and strategies of our customers and those priorities, the strategic priorities that they have change and can change very quickly and significantly depending upon their business structure and their needs and the capacities that they have versus the demand and maybe potential M&A activities that they do that change their priorities.So there been a couple very significant deals that will be pushed out now into 2016 and beyond, as I said.No, that's good color.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you can now maybe just shift gears little bit and talk about some of these <i>newer</i> areas and what level of confidence you might have that you could see some of these things here working on both in Europe , it sounds like mainly , but it sounds also like in North America .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What your level of confidence is that you are going to see some of that converted into bookings in the next one to two quarters?Well, we have a high confidence level that that we will start to see some new orders with regards to our new solutions in the next quarter or two.We would expect to start shipping new solutions near the end of the first quarter into the second quarter of next year.Is there anyway that you can give us some sense as to the magnitude of these types of orders?We don't know a whole lot about some of the areas that you are working in terms of what the dollar amount could be on some of these potential orders?Well, when I talk significant orders, we are usually talking in the seven-figure range and some of those can be larger than a little seven-figures.Yes.The new solutions, again, are with our core markets in Europe and North America.And so again, it's a large number of strategic customers that we are currently working with.Just to follow up to that last question from Jim.I can't think of any good reason why you wouldn't say what the number is?How many people are doing field tests?How many customers are doing field tests of these new products, both in Europe and here?Well, we have customers that we are doing field testing with in all of our core segments in potatoes, processed fruit and vegetable and nuts.And again, there are multiple customers in Europe and in North America that are currently working with us on those markets.I mean, just give me -- is it between 10 and 20 or is it less than 10 or more than 20?Just give -- Okay.And how many are -- so the potato guys are all in there.So that's probably four or five, right?And the rest would be in the other verticals, the other end-markets?Yes, we would be in potatoes, in processed fruit and veg and nuts and dried fruit in Europe and North America.Okay.Just on the fourth quarter guidance, I guess I am scratching my head a little bit.So you are looking forward slightly down sequential revenues, gross margin.Is the mix on gross margin -- is that a mix issue?Or are you starting to let expenses creep up again?No, it's primarily a mix.Right now, our mix is more heavily -- or backlog going into the quarter is more heavily orientated towards the process systems.So it's really a mix related issue.Well, it would insignificant, not a large increase, as Jeff said, but there are costs that will be associated with launching new solutions and those types of things.All right.I mean I am just curious, not that it's a big deal, but the debt was down a little bit.Was there -- what was that about?I think that's a mortgage on the facility there, right?Okay.And the new bank agreement, is there any motive behind that?Or is that just sort of re-up what you had in place before?Well, we kept the company with a good cash balance and this arrangement really gives us more flexibility and stability, especially as we start looking at working capital requirements as we start to grow the business.So it really provides a better situation for us for what our long-term needs are as well short-term.Yes.I guess I am are all in support of working capital help if you needed beyond the cash you have, but I am certainly not an advocate of going out and making more acquisitions.So just as one large shareholder view on that topic.So it's not for that purpose?It's not for strategic purposes?The primary purpose, again, was to provide us with the cash from an overall business perspective to grow it effectively.Thank you.[Operator Instructions].I am showing no further questions at this time.I would like to call back over to Jack Ehren for closing remarks.Well, thank you very much again for joining the call and again we sincerely appreciate the support from our investors and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.Thanks for your participation.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Have a <b>wonderful</b> day .
