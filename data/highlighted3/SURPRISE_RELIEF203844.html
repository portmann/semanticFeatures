class='textDiv'>How Long Will The Deflation-Driven Stock Market Correction Last?| Seeking Alpha The 1,000 point intraday drop in the Dow on August 23rd and ensuing market volatility has left investors wondering whether to buy the dip or pare U.S. equity exposure.The Financial Relativity Index developed to systematically gauge whether key fundamental forces are currently strong enough to sustain stock market levels now warns investors to reduce U.S. equity exposure.The index shows significant headwinds have formed in the credit markets which are likely to create a prolonged stock market downturn which has many similarities to both 1937 and 1947.U.S. monetary and fiscal policies are both now in the relative position of exerting negative pressure on stock valuations.A disrupting international financial force tipping the U.S. stock market bias from positive to negative is a worldwide deflationary force driven mainly by economic problems in China.Anyone who follows my blog and has read my book, Theory of Financial Relativity , knows that my research looks at the U.S. financial markets systematically.By looking back through time to gain an understanding of how key market metrics performed during boom and bust cycles, I have developed a heuristic model which investors can use to gauge whether key fundamental forces are strong enough to sustain current stock market index price levels.The model is simple.It contains 7 market variables that are tracked through time.As specific market thresholds are breached, the risk of a major market correction in the Dow (NYSEARCA: DIA ) or S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) increase.The model uses quantitative metrics (and one qualitative).To illustrate the stability in the relative value of the stock market at any particular time, the index (shown in the graph below) is illustrated using green, yellow and red markers.Green is considered the neutral or low probability zone for the metric to create a condition conducive to a major market correction.Likewise, a yellow marker denotes a cautionary condition, and red denotes a relative measure that has a high probability of causing downward market pressure.Through time, as the measurements change, the directional change in each variable is also assessed, and if a variable is approaching, but not yet reached a warning condition, then it is outlined in red.At the beginning of 2015, my commentary on the state of the U.S. equity market based on the Financial Relativity Index was the following: "The financial metrics as 2015 begins are increasingly cautious, as exhibited by the number of yellow and red markers.The model over the past two years has become progressively more "colorful.", another way of saying the trend is not your friend at the present time.Based on the research I have done in each categorical area, I expect more of the metrics to reach a red level before the stock market is likely to undergo a sustained severe downturn.The increased areas of caution in many of the metrics, however, set 2015 up in my opinion to be a very volatile year for equity values, with a likelihood of a major intra-year drop at some point."- Seeking Alpha Article, January 10, 2015 The metrics referred to in the statement are shown in the table below, and augmented by the status of the metrics as of the end of July 2015.The July month-end metrics, which were updated on the Financial Relativity.com website after the July close, included a warning statement for the first time.The warning was "Deflation-Driven Correction Risk Extreme".The movement in the metrics since year-end 2014 led to the need to post the warning.In particular, the index metrics that have worsened since the end of 2014 are: GDP/Lending Risk - The continued increase risk in U.S. credit markets as loan balances grow to all-time highs relative to the size of U.S. GDP.BAA1/30-Year Treasury Spread - A major widening of spreads between the Treasury market and investment grade bonds to historical warning levels.Fiscal Spending Rate - Stagnant U.S. fiscal spending yearly growth continues below historical levels and slowed to -0.1% in Q2 2015.Oil Price Levels - Rapid commodity price deflation as exhibited in the oil market creates a warning sign on what should be a positive for U.S. consumers.Fed Policy - The tightening of monetary policy relative to the world because other countries are devaluing their currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.All these metrics became progressively stronger headwinds, as the stock market pushed to higher and higher all-time highs during the first half of 2015.The fact that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the bellwether in the current tech-driven bull market, suddenly lost its appeal in the market and recently entered correction territory was a good anecdotal signal that the overall market was entering a correction phase.The stock market relative to GDP has been expensive for over a year, and is now in progress of rolling over.The recent market pullback has left the metric in caution territory, but since the momentum in stock price growth is now negative, risk is still high for further declines.In previous blog posts, I have pointed out the extent to which debt has fueled much of the stock market price expansion to all-time highs in 2015, primarily through margin buying and stock buybacks.Seven years of the zero interest rate Fed monetary policy is the main driver, creating the illusion of value which, in my professional opinion, is simply not sustainable.But it is the reality our elected and unelected leaders have created, so it is imperative that prudent investors understand the investment risk as the policy changes, as it currently is slowly doing.Lending levels relative to GDP in many sectors of the U.S. economy, including consumer borrowing, student loans, business loans and stock margin debt, show leverage in the U.S. financial market is currently flashing red, even without a mortgage lending crisis.The liquidity that found its way into the U.S. housing market in 2004-2008, that disappeared in the foreclosures and de-leveraging after the crisis, has been recreated by Fed QE in 2010-2014.The difference is that it has flowed through different lending channels to consumers and businesses this economic cycle.In fact, if you look at the decline in total single family mortgages outstanding (-$960B) since the peak of the stock market before the 2008 crisis, it has been more than replaced by increases in student loans (+571B), stock margin debt (+$175B), consumer credit (+$842B) and business loans (+$525B).And, these stats do not state the impact that shadow banking markets are having on the world financial markets that may be bleeding into the U.S. financial markets.(See " About that $9 trillion global non-bank credit exposure", FT Alphaville, Feb 2015 ) What we do know is that the U.S. economy and in particular the U.S. consumer was over-leveraged when mortgage debt was about $1T higher in 2007 than it is today in 2015.Although we have a lower dollar volume of 30-year single family mortgages on bank books, there is over $2.1T more in shorter term credit outstanding mostly to U.S. consumers and small businesses.Statistically speaking, the U.S. nominal GDP is 22% larger than it was in 2008, and fundamentally does not appear to be in better shape to digest the expanded debt load today given stagnant growth in personal income.(See Real Disposable Income per capita, FRED ) Since 2009, real income per capita has grown by only 4.1%.Total personal income over the same period has grown in line with GDP.The BAA1/30-year spread blowing out to well over 2% is the primary indicator that I use in the Financial Relativity Index to signal when credit risk is disproportionately high in the U.S. economy and likely to create stock market unrest.The mismatch between U.S. Treasury borrowing rates and the direction of investment grade corporate debt is, in my analytical opinion, currently a harbinger of bad times ahead for major stock indexes like the Dow, S&P and NASDAQ (NASDAQ: QQQ ), just as it was at the market peaks in the year 2000 and 2007.Why are the non-government credit markets becoming stressed and taking center stage as an equity market warning signal, and how is it related to the global commodity selloff?The current credit market stress all comes down to the flow of funds into dollar-based financing of debt.Because commodities, like oil, are priced in dollars, when there is a dramatically lower price for oil, there is a corresponding decline in financing available that flows into the U.S. fixed income markets (a.k.a. petrodollars).Something in the financial system has to give in a financial world where transactions for basic commodities priced in dollars are being traded at less than $0.50 on the dollar relative to what the price was a year ago.The decline in the supply of financing available will shake out weak businesses and consumers (if their jobs are related to an affected industry) that are heavily dependent upon higher commodity prices to service the debt.Fed policy no longer accommodative for stocks, even though rates are still 0% Market Fed watchers currently are focused on when the Fed will increase interest rates from 0% to 0.25%.The rate change was first forecast to take place as early as June, and then extended to September, and now with equity market unrest it is anyone's guess when the Fed will change policy.But in my opinion, the story is not the fed funds rate currently.Many informed investors agree that interest rates should be higher given the market instability that has been induced by over-leveraged positions both in the U.S. and internationally.What is happening in the credit markets, even without a Fed rate increase, is that the market is increasing interest rates because credit risk is has become too high.The Fed, stuck in the fairy tale land of 0% interest rates, is being circumvented by real market forces.The issue is that the Fed can no longer afford to print money at the velocity it did from 2010 through late 2014, lest it risk complete loss of confidence in the U.S. currency.The change in Fed policy to no more QE, even without a change in interest rates, has now created a negative force on the stock market simply because the illusion of value created by active Fed bond buying is no longer in the market.Additionally, relative to the rest of the world - Europe, Japan and now China - the U.S. monetary policy is tight because these countries are devaluing their currency relative to the U.S. dollar.U.S. equity valuations which over shot reality due to the "monetary illusion" created by Fed policy must now gravitate to more realistic market-driven levels determined by reasonable risk-adjusted interest rates.The experimental Fed QE policy is now causing a major discrepancy between yields on Treasuries and investment grade debt.It is the investment grade rate that investors should be using to determine the riskiness of a stock investment, not a capital controlled government Treasury rate.QE has distorted the fair market high yield and investment grade interest rate for several years.Currently, this distortion is in the process of being priced out of the market because the Fed is on the sidelines.A driving factor behind the Fed policy over the past seven years has been to lower the borrowing rate for the U.S. government's $18.2T debt (see Monthly Reports U.S. Public Debt ).The U.S. debt has doubled since the beginning of the last stock market crisis in the summer of 2007.Contrary to political posturing by many 2016 presidential candidates and beliefs of many investors, the stock market loves growth in fiscal spending, with a caveat.In particular, stocks don't like high fiscal spending growth created through taxes experienced in the 1960s and 1970s.Historically, "tax and spend" policies are inflationary, and my review of historical data satisfies my mathematical mind that the correlation is statistically significant.Politicians shifted from the typical "tax and spend" policy actions of the 1960s and 70s to a "borrow and spend" philosophy in the 1980s.By saddling the government with a deflationary debt balance, financed mostly by China, Japan and petrodollars, government money printing induced "consumer price" inflation has been kept in check over the past 35 years.On the contrary, asset prices of stocks have continually experienced bubble price spikes, only to be deflated at some point in time.The primary reason that this process has worked to tame consumer price inflation is that an ever growing portion of U.S. debt financing has come from lower wage emerging markets that peg their currency to the U.S. at an advantageous rate for trade, and then borrow in dollars and store reserves in dollar-based Treasuries.(See U.S. Debt Ownership Graph ) Relative to history, the U.S. fiscal spending growth rate of -0.1% year over year Q2 2015 is anemic.The typical growth rate average is over 7% per year since WWII, with the odd exception of the Clinton years in the 1990s and now the Obama administration.Odd?The anomaly is certainly a factor in the similarities in the recent stock market gains and the late 1990 bubble.The growth rate in fiscal spending since 2011 has been restricted, owed largely to the size of the U.S. debt relative to GDP which ballooned in 2009 and U.S. congress push-back to control government spending in 2011.The U.S. political environment currently does not seem likely to produce a fiscal stimulus "surprise" which would give the stock market a boost through the 2016 election cycle, and possibly well beyond depending on the mandate on which the next U.S. President is elected.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> than likely the next fiscal policy change will be corporate tax <b>relief</b> , which if true will create <i>more</i> uncertainty for stock valuations .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Currently, the fiscal policy environment for stocks is in warning territory, as it relates to stock market valuation, and is likely to continue to progress to a Financial Relativity Index red status in 2016 due to its deflationary drag on the U.S. economy.International disruption, particularly China, is driving U.S. stock markets to roll over In the research I did in the book, Theory of Financial Relativity, the metrics which were correlating precursors to major stock market downturns in the past that related to fiscal policy, monetary policy and credit creation by Wall Street were examined and categorized.These three major forces, as measured by various metrics, if they reached extreme conditions in isolation, were usually necessary but not sufficient to cause a major stock market correction.The defining factor which tended to accompany the other warning signals was a major international event in the financial realm.In almost every case, the energy market sent the signal, usually a spike higher in energy prices caused by supply disruptions (Iraq War 2008), an embargo (Arab Oil embargo, 1974) or markets out-racing global supply (2000).In 2015, the oil market signal is diametrically opposite from one that typically accompanies a major U.S. recession led stock market correction.In the present case, oil prices are deflating dramatically, and are accompanied by a new disrupting force here-to-fore not considered a driver to cause U.S. markets experience a major decline.Currently, the international force accompanying the oil market decline is very visible, with China leading the way by recently devaluing the yuan against the U.S. dollar (See Of China's "dirty peg" and spreading EM pain, FT Alpaville, August 2015 ).The resulting market downward price reaction very closely correlates to the 1998 stock market late summer decline which accompanied the Asian currency crisis in which many emerging market countries moved to devalue their currency.During that time period, China was a stabilizing force as they continued to stimulate growth domestically to build capacity in support of their export led economy; today, however, China's export-driven economy is substantially overbuilt, and when combined with major U.S. debt obligations hampering fiscal and monetary policy responses from the U.S., the outcome of the 2015 stock market downturn is likely to be far different than 1998's quick rebound.Based on the experience of the 1998 crisis, expect positive market responses to news which shows Chinese government economic stimulus.The market open on August 25, 2015 (See Stocks Surge as China cuts rates ) showed the hopeful response from the U.S. equity market.In my opinion, investors should beware that history cannot repeat itself if the same fundamental circumstances are not the same.As of August 2015, the stock market appears to be at the front end of a deflation-driven market correction, the likes of which have not been experienced by any investors unless they were alive in the 1930s and 40s.In a deflation-driven stock market fall, the earnings power of consumers and businesses is destroyed because the government retracts money from the economy in order to keep the size of government debt relative to GDP at a manageable, proportional size.U.S. debt to GDP in the early 1940s reached over 100%, just as it is today.In order for the government to get its books in order after WWII, the Truman 1946 budget set forth to balance the budget.The fiscal policy spending cuts in the mid 1940s were resoundingly deflationary, and the stock market corrected over 20% and stayed stagnant for multiple years.For reference, changes in the Dow relative to U.S. interest rates through the time period can be seen in the following graph: The 1946-1947 time frame is the only time in post WWII history when the U.S. has experienced a lift-off from a zero interest rate policy.The stock market reaction during this time period was negative, with a peak to trough decline of 22%.If you applied a relative adjustment to the Dow peak in 1946 to the current market environment in 2015 (a bit of a stretch because conditions statistically were more optimistic in the 1940s than today), then the S&P would drop to at least the 1,700 before forming a bottom, and the Dow would drop to 14,000.Not surprisingly, the political remedy for the deflationary ailment was eventually tax cuts and more government programs in 1948.Sound familiar?The way the Fed has tried to avoid similar fiscal constraining actions from tanking the market since 2012 has been a massive buyback of U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet.However, economic reality cannot be fooled by smoke and mirrors.The debt still exists on the government books and either has to be paid off or rolled over.The recent actions have done nothing but buy time for politicians to mount a campaign for the next dose of "hope-ium".Why would the current stock market correction be more prolonged and deeper in decline than the 1940s experience with Fed rate lift-off?There are many statistics and historical parallels between 2015 and 1947 that, although they line up, lead me to expect that the upcoming market downturn will be deeper and more prolonged.First, the U.S. employment picture was robust in the mid 1940s.Industrial activity picked up as the 1948 Marshall plan was implemented, and U.S. exports grew as post war rebuilding in Japan and Europe gathered pace.The analog of the U.S. Fed efforts through central bank coordination with Japan and the EU to monetarily recreate a "post war reconstruction period" similar to the deflation ridden 1940s in the present day seems evident to me, but yet to hear anyone in the media recognize the similarity.Central banks have implemented massive QE efforts in both the EU and Japan in an attempt to stimulate their economies through currency devaluation, as the U.S stands apart as the one western economy that actually has (had) some strength.The primary difference is that the late 1940s witnessed real human effort being applied to build infrastructure; the current day efforts are mostly virtual, seemingly a paper exercise.China has been the one major world economy that has been building their economy over the past 25 years.But an unavoidable economic impasse is now being reach with China due to its closed, export-driven economy that is strangling western-based economies with deflationary wage forces.In line with my recommendation at the beginning of 2015, my opinion is that investors should continue to sell U.S. stock market rallies and build cash or near cash reserves.Currently, I do not forecast an imminent stock market collapse like 2008, but rather an extended period decline probably very similar to the year 2000 through 2003.I expect there to be many investors who may mistakenly see the current environment to be much like 1998, so once a near term bottom is set expect a retracement surge going into year-end and extending into 2016 once a near-term bottom is set.However, the intraday gap down on Monday was just an opening round of what I think will be a slow, prolonged grind downward in U.S. equities.Election years can be unpredictable, but I expect the U.S. equity market will not return to an upward "bull market" trajectory until it establishes a new fair value low.I think the fair market low this time around will be somewhere between the 40% move down in stocks in 1937 and the 22% move down in 1947.Establishing the low will require market resolution between the panic selling in the commodity markets relative to the high value of most U.S. equities, particularly technology.The trend line is now negative for stocks, and I expect it to remain so until the Financial Relativity index shows that market metrics have returned to a more realistic equilibrium, and the "coast is clear" for a return to building U.S. equity positions.Daniel Moore is the author of the book Theory of Financial Relativity .All opinions and analyses shared in this article are expressly his own, and intended for information purposes only and not advice to buy or sell.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
