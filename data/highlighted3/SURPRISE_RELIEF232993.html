(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Like many industrials headquartered in the United States, this global reach has been a thorn in the company's side as of late.The strength of the USD has hamstrung company results as the majority of EnerSys sales come from outside North America.For a company in a mature market that frequently logs 1.5-2.5% organic growth, the impact of this foreign currency shift on year/year results has been crippling, which has led to weaker share performance in the past year compared to prior years.Nonetheless, shares have been a long-term outperformer, trouncing the long-term returns of the S&P 500 and peers when looking at extended timeframes.Does buying in now provide a chance to take advantage of the next leg up?Total revenue has grown at a 3.16% rate since EnerSys' fiscal 2012.Roughly half this revenue growth is attributable to organic sales growth and the other half from a flurry of small acquisitions (over twenty) the company picked up in 2013 and 2014.Gross margins have expanded meaningfully, primarily predicated upon falling commodity input prices used in company products and restructuring inefficient operations overseas.Raw material costs make up more than half of cost of revenue, so fluctuations in lead, steel, and copper can have outsized impacts on the bottom line.To combat this problem, EnerSys has structured roughly one third of its selling agreements that fluctuate based on a market-based index for lead, but the company can never fully protect itself from input cost changes.Derivative use within the company has fallen, with only $341M in lead hedges in place at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to nearly $2.4B in fiscal 2014.The company does not hedge any other commodity costs.Growing SG&A expenses and restructuring/litigation costs have dented the resulting value from gross margin expansion in relation to operating margins.EMEA operations have been a target for management in this regard.In fiscal 2012 and 2013, the company began restructuring its EMEA operations, transferring manufacturing of certain products between facilities and enacting cost cuts by reducing redundant staff and shuttering some ageing plants.EnerSys incurred a fair amount of employee severance and other restructuring costs at the time of implementation, but the efforts will save $13M in annualized pre-tax earnings.In fiscal 2014, EnerSys focused on its Bulgarian operations, creating $20M in annual savings going forward.In fiscal 2015, the EMEA segment was the only segment to have grown net operating earnings, in large part I believe due to these initiatives.Operating margin in EMEA of 6.9% in fiscal 2013 has nearly doubled to 12.8% in fiscal 2015, even in a tough operating environment for Europe and during a global bear market where operating margins fell in both the Americas and Asia.As the largest segment, I expect management to move on to seeing what costs can be saved in the Americas in the coming years.If management can do half of what they did in Europe, operating results will continue to improve meaningfully.Unfortunately operating cash flow has fallen slightly even as net income has grown, primarily due to changes in working capital.These adjustments will likely fall off in the future, freeing up cash flow.Capital expenditures in this business are relatively light, so in any given year roughly two thirds of operating cash flow is available for business acquisitions, share repurchases, or debt retirement.The company has elected to lever up slightly, increasing long term debt to roughly $300M net of cash, a little more than double 2012 levels.Most of this additional debt funded stock repurchases in fiscal 2015.If EnerSys wanted to, it could be debt-free in a few short years.Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates fall in a tight range of $4.00/share, down slightly from 2015's $4.32/share.This impact is primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency rather than business weakness, which is expected to send revenue down 7% y/y despite moderate growth in constant currency.EnerSys shares trade at 9.68x EV/EBITDA, roughly in-line with the vast majority of the industrial peer group.The slight discount given by the market likely reflects the comparatively small dividend yield (1.34% as of this writing) and outsized foreign currency risk compared to alternatives.Overall, the shares reflect fair value at these levels in my opinion.Additionally, while I'm not a technical chartist, shares now trade quite closely to the 200-day moving average, which reflects a key level for the company.A dip below that level and a lack of nearby established support means a bottom may not be found until $55.00/share.Patient investors may be rewarded with a chance to buy 10% cheaper than current prices if that scenario unfolds.This is definitely an interesting company to watch and keep on any retail investor's radar.We only use your contact details to reply to
