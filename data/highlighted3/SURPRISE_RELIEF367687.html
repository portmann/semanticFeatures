it takes ten years to build a bridge."For Mumbai, read India: the country's transport network has failed to keep up with huge increases in passenger numbers and freight volumes over the past couple of decades.The lack of efficient roads and railways lowers productivity, depresses aggregate demand, raises costs and stymies trade-all impediments to economic growth.Narendra Modi's government has put improving transport infrastructure at the top of its agenda.India will not be able to raise growth or create a manufacturing boom without building new road capacity and unclogging congested railways.It needs a better transport network to cope with population growth, and to help raise incomes and reduce poverty.Indian leaders look enviously at China, whose economic boom was built on channeling investment into hard infrastructure.They believe that extra investment in roads, rail and power could push GDP growth up to their 8% target and provide millions of low-skilled jobs in the process.The good news is that India's latest infrastructure push, financed initially by public investment, is showing signs of traction.February's budget for 2016-17 allocated a hefty $32 billion to roads, rail and other infrastructure, a substantial increase within a broader environment of fiscal consolidation.The road and rail ministries are headed by two of the government's most capable ministers, and there is widespread optimism that improvements will be evident within two or three years.India's spending on infrastructure remains far behind China's, even as a percentage of its much smaller GDP.But India has more potential than any other large economy to crank up fixed-asset investment, which should substantially boost its demand for coal, steel and other hard commodities.India is growing faster than any other major economy, but growth remains below the government's target of 8-10%.One major reason is weak capital investment, which has been depressed by banks' unwillingness and inability to lend, and by a shortage of alternative funding sources.An earlier infrastructure push is part of the problem, as projects were held up by regulatory problems.For example, dozens of road projects contracted to private enterprises got stuck in the construction phase, if they got that far at all: many contractors found themselves sitting on bank loans but unable even to acquire the land needed to get the project up and running.Out of banks' INR8.4 trillion exposure to infrastructure, an estimated INR2 trillion is categorized as "stressed" - loans that show signs of going bad.To kick-start investment, New Delhi is dipping into its own pocket and reforming financing requirements.Road projects, for example, will not be sanctioned until after land has been acquired in contrast to the previous situation where private sector entities were granted a road contract and then encouraged to themselves assemble land.The central government has spent two years building up a substantial public land bank that it is now freeing up for infrastructure construction.In the railway sector, it has allowed state governments to raise debt via special purpose vehicles - a good example of its policy of giving more fiscal autonomy to states, which have traditionally played little role in developing railways.It is also encouraging much greater private investment, with foreign companies allowed to take 100% shares in rail infrastructure projects.Finally, the Ministry of Rail plans to generate extra funds by developing real estate investment on state-owned land around its stations.It aims to invest INR8.6 trillion over the next five years, about $130 billion.Reforming Indian Railways, known as the "lifeline of the nation," is a priority.It operates 19,000 trains, carrying 23 million passengers and over 3 million tonnes of freight per day, and employs 1.3 million people.But the sprawling network is fundamentally the same as that laid down by the British before Independence.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The comparison with China is <b>startling</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In 1990, China's 58,000 km rail network lagged behind India's 62,000 km.By 2015, it had doubled to 121,000 km, whereas India's had barely grown to 66,000 km.China built 9,000 km of new railway in 2015 alone.As a share of GDP, China invested about three times as much as India on average over the period 2005-2012.In per-capita terms, China invested 11 times more, even though both countries have similar populations.Years of underinvestment have resulted in a lack of capacity and chronic congestion.Because passenger and goods trains share the same track, only 35% of capacity is used for carrying freight.That means there is little room for goods trains, which average a speed of just 25 km/h.Roads have taken up the slack, pushing rail's share of freight traffic down from around 50% in 1990 - the current figure in China - to just over 30%.China carries three times more coal per freight hour than India, at less than half the cost per ton.Studies indicate that India's outsized reliance on more expensive road transport costs the equivalent of 4.5% of GDP every year.A lack of freight capacity threatens to retard economic development.Coal accounts for almost half of the freight volume on Indian Railways, and the system barely copes: almost all the major trunk routes operate above 100% capacity.For India to sustain economic growth of 8-10% per year, it will require massive increases in power generation and the transportation of bulk commodities.The government forecasts that total coal demand will rise to 1.5 billion tons by 2020, up from an estimated 900 million tons in 2015.Steel use is expected to grow more rapidly, rising from around 80 million tons in 2015 to anywhere between 300 million and 500 million tons by 2032.Given that a ton of finished steel requires three to four tons of raw material, the transport requirements for the steel industry will be huge.After years of bureaucratic inertia, new rail minister Suresh Prabhu is shaking things up.He is trying to turn Indian Railways, once known as a cesspit of cronyism, into a professional institution.Capital expenditure is budgeted at INR 1.2 trillion this fiscal year, nearly three times the annual average under the previous government.Prabhu claims daily track commissions have risen to 7 km from 4 km, and will rise to 13 km in 2017-18 and 19 km in 2018-19.Foreign investment is also flowing in.India will adopt Japanese technology for its first proposed high-speed line, which will run 508 km from Mumbai to Ahmedabad in Modi's home state of Gujarat.Japan has agreed to provide a 50-year loan worth more than INR790 billion, with a 15-year grace period and an interest rate of just 0.1%.Separately, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) and Alstom ( OTCPK:ALSMY , OTCPK:AOMFF ) have won contracts worth a combined INR400 billion to supply new locomotives, which will see both companies set up factories in India.The long-term aim is to create an efficient freight network, with the proportion of freight traffic using rail rising to 50% by 2032.Two dedicated rail freight corridors are being built; a further four are on the table.These will feature feeder routes for coal and steel, and will connect to industry clusters, logistics parks and ports."Such an initiative will transform Indian manufacturing industry with 'Make in India' becoming a reality," last year's government Economic Survey claimed.Dedicated freight lines will not in themselves make India a manufacturing power, but they are a crucial building block to achieving it.And as more freight is moved onto dedicated lines, this will free up space for passenger trains.Speeds on selected passenger routes are set to rise to 160-200 km/h, similar to those on the UK network.India's roads have benefited from far greater investment than its railways over the past two decades.The National Highway Development Project, launched in 2001, has greatly improved connections between the four largest economic centers of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.Construction of the "Golden Quadrilateral" was completed by 2012 with a total network length of 5,846 km.Still, most national highways are not access controlled, and are a world away from China's sealed expressways.On the section of the Golden Quadrilateral between Delhi and Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan, farmers drive tractors down the wrong side of the road and people dodge oncoming trucks on foot.The immediate problem is to re-start road construction, which ground to a halt after infrastructure loans started to go sour two or three years ago.The roads minister Nitin Gadkari claims that highway construction fell to 2 km a day under the last government, but has risen to 20 km under his leadership, and should hit 30 km within six months.He has a reputation for shady business dealings, but also for getting things done.He has pushed for the government to acquire land and secure project approvals before contracting out to developers, and he has allowed regional offices to grant forest clearances for new roads.Project awards rose substantially last year, and Gadkari said in February that only seven out of the 384 highway projects "that were stuck when we took over" have yet to be resolved.His department plans to invest $250 billion over the next five years.Many problems remain, not least bureaucratic.Road building has long been hampered by delayed clearances, multiple overlapping authorities and jurisdictions, frequently changing rules of engagement with the private sector and unyielding land laws.For all of Modi's promise to make it easier to do business, India remains tangled in red tape - though states like Rajasthan are leading the way with more flexible rules on labor and land.It is easy for ministers to announce bold new targets and declare they are doing better than their lazy, ineffectual predecessors.But even cynical observers believe rail and road construction is gaining traction."There will be a considerable improvement in transport infrastructure in the next three years.There is no doubt about it," says Reuben Abraham, head of the IDFC Institute, a think tank under India's largest infrastructure finance company.The government must take the lead in managing and financing India's infrastructure build-out, laying the groundwork for the private sector.India cannot build the infrastructure it needs without private contractors, especially when it comes to road construction, but New Delhi believes that public spending is needed to "crowd in" private investment.The evidence suggests that marginal changes in public investment have a positive, outsized impact on private investment.During India's investment boom of 2004-7, a modest increase in public spending was accompanied by a surge in private investment, whose share of GDP jumped an impressive 8pp.And as the share of public investment edged down in 2010-2014, the share of private investment fell much more sharply.And if government action is the key to kick-starting India's stalled investment cycle, transport infrastructure is the obvious place to start.The Modi government can blame opposition in parliament for blocking "big bang" regulatory reforms on tax, land and labor; but there is no political excuse for failing to improve the nation's roads and railways.This is a crucial test of the government's ability to get things done - one, the emerging evidence suggests, they appear determined to pass.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
