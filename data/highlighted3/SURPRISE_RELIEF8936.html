turn the call over to Steve for his prepared remarks and then I will provide details regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results and our outlook for the fiscal 2016.Thanks Rick and thanks for those of you joining our call today.We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $16.9 million solidly within our guidance range.On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 18% from a year ago and represented a third consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth within our target range of 15% to 20%.We continue to see an improving return on investments we've made and sales and products over the past two years.In addition, we're pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million was above the high end of our guidance range.For the full year revenue was $61.4 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 15% on a constant currency basis.Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $2.7 million.Looking at our results in more detail, license revenue of $12.9 million in the fourth quarter increased 14% on a constant currency basis, while project revenue of $4 million represented constant currency growth of 36% from a year ago.On a full year basis, license revenue grew 14% on a constant currency basis, up from 11% growth a year ago.This very positive trend is a result of our strategy to expand our sales team, which led to strong project revenue and up by 14%, which in turn help drive growth in license revenue in FY '15.As we discussed last quarter in FY '15 we had a strong record of converting project activity to licenses.We expect to make further progress in improving constant currency license revenue growth in FY '16 with a significant portion of that from healthy project revenue in FY '15, which was $11.7 million, up 22% on a constant currency basis.It's important to point out that our improvements in growth over the last year don't yet reflect the impact of the accelerated product investments we've also been making in this past year.We expect to start to see the impact of these investments in our products during FY '16.Considering our continued high revenue retention rate, expansions at existing customers and the ongoing realization of the benefit of simulation driven design, we entered FY '16 with confidence in our ability to again deliver double-digit growth for the year.From a geographic perspective our 22% and 19% constant currency full year growth rates in Asia and North America demonstrate our ability to grow at the upper end of our target range.Growth in Europe was 10% on a constant currency basis as certain customer restrained their growth initiatives as a result of economic headwinds in Europe.This regional growth combined to produce a consolidated growth rate of 15% for FY '15.From an end market perspective in the fourth quarter as in all of FY '15, we saw strong momentum from the passenger car market.The end market continued to be very strong in North America and reasonably strong in Asia and both were driven by China.In Europe, we are optimistic as most recent data points for just the bottom in car sales may now be behind us after six years of decreasing unit sales.While end market health is just one factor that contributes to our performance, we continue to see secular drivers such as increased regulatory pressure and vehicle model proliferation generate increasing demands for our technology and solutions.The heavy vehicle market continue to show signs as well of improvement despite components of the agricultural and mining equipment markets that experienced significant year-over-year unit sales declines.We're delivering solutions that serve the diverse needs of this market and of the same products and technologies used to serve are passionate to our customers, ranging from aerodynamics and thermal challenges in highway truck market to thermal and acoustic constraints in the off highway market.In direct support of our license revenue growth objectives, our most important product news in the fourth quarter was the release of Exa Cloud into general build ability.Exa Cloud offers a software-as-a-service version of our full power flow simulation software suite.We believe our SaaS offering will help to shorter the time customers take to migrate from successful projects to recurring license engagements by removing all of the upfront barriers to getting started such as a software and hardware purchase decisions.This will also reduce the barriers for in-house license customers in need of additional simulation capacity to meet their peak needs.While eliminating the barriers to entry is critical to getting more customers engaged in our solutions, the most compelling value of operating in a cloud solution is the area of collaboration.Having a single repository for the entire set of models and results allows you to just work simultaneously on projects, without the painful efforts to synchronize their work.In addition to being able to access all of your simulation results wherever you are in the field or in the studio will enable real time collaboration and innovation as our customers work to find solutions to their very challenging engineering problems.While it's too soon to see any definitive trends yet, our ambition is that Exa Cloud will become an increasingly meaningful contributor to our revenue and we look forward to reporting on our progress during the course of the year.While Exa simulation driven design enables manufacturers to create better products faster, our soon to be released design optimization capabilities take this one step further.Exa's design optimization solutions use a [band solvents] [ph] that automatically explore the design space to highlight multiple potential solutions simultaneously, something that is simply just not possible with even a team of engineers conducting simulations one at a time.Having completed over 100 early access optimization projects with customers, Exa Solutions are now being made available to help all of our customers improve the performance of their products by automatically exploring the available design space to discover more optimal solutions.FY '15 was the year, Exa saw increasing momentum and success in further penetrating existing customers and adding new ones.In the passenger car market, we've meaningful relationships with 14 of the top 15 car markers, but we believe we remain significantly underpenetrated within these customers and have substantial growth opportunities still ahead of us in our most mature market.Of course we’re still in the early stages of establishing ourselves in the aerospace market however more than half of our aerospace revenue is already delivered via licenses for on-premise or cloud based usage.These early stage customers are proving how our solutions can be leveraged in develop more efficient and quieter air frame, cabin and landing gear design to meet the end market needs.It may be interesting to note that while we initially entered the aerospace market based on our products developed for the auto industry, we've also recently seen that capabilities that we developed primarily for the aerospace industry are finding their way back into the auto industry.Improved physics model that enable us to effectively address wing design for aircraft are just as applicable to motorsports.The application of new patents relative to accurate modeling of wings are now beginning to relatively used by Formula 1 teams where aerodynamics is the dominant design factor.In summary, we're pleased to have delivered sequential improvement in constant currency growth over the past four quarters.We continue to develop and expand our core market while leveraging our technology into new vertical applications, positioning us again to deliver solid double-digit constant currency growth in FY '16.We believe our results and outlook demonstrate that our investment strategy is working and we expect to further evidence -- to see further evidence this year this year as we bring new products and technologies to market.While we're adding new customers and expanding within existing clients, we remain significantly underpenetrated in our market and are optimistic that we will continue to make progress in FY '16.Now let me turn the call over to Rick to provide more color on the fourth quarter and full year financial performance as well as our guidance for FY '16.Thanks Steve.I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015 results and then provide you with our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016.Revenue in the fourth quarter was within our guidance range at $16.9 million and represented growth of 11%, 18% growth on a constant currency basis and at the upper end of our longer term target range of 16% to 20% constant currency growth.License revenue was $12.9 million up 7%, 14% from a year ago on a constant currency basis as typical yearend activity was weighted more to the third quarter fiscal 2015 rather than the fourth quarter as it was in fiscal 2014.Project revenue of $4 million in the fourth quarter increased 25%, 36% on a constant currency basis.From a geographic perspective, 46% of our fourth quarter revenue was from Europe, 26% from the Americas and 28% from Asia.We will discuss our profitability measures on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in our earnings press release issued today with the only differences being stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles.Total GAAP operating expenses were $17.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% from a year ago primarily due to planned investments throughout our organization to support our growth.Our pace of hiring to support new development and the scaling of our business was in line with revenue growth.Combined with the small positive foreign exchange impact from operations outside the United States, operating expenses were slightly below our expectation in the quarter.This resulted in a GAAP loss from operations of $0.2 million consistent with a loss in the same period a year ago.GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter was $1.1 million or a loss of $0.08 per share based on $13.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.This compares to a GAAP net income of $0.1 million or $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.GAAP expenses include $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $0.1 million in amortization of intangible assets.Excluding these non-cash items, non-GAAP operating income was $0.7 million, an increase from $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Non-GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter was $0.6 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.4 million in the same period a year ago.With $13.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, non-GAAP net loss was $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter compared to income of $0.03 per share in the same period a year ago based on $14.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.The variance for prior year and expectations in both GAAP and non-GAAP net losses was primarily due to higher than anticipated tax provisions due to geographic profit mix and higher than anticipated forward withholding taxes.For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and was above the high end of our guidance range due to the lower than expected expenses.For the full year, revenue was $61.4 million up 15% on a constant currency basis.License revenue was $49.7 million up 14% from fiscal 2014 on a constant currency basis.Project revenue was $11.7 million up 22% from fiscal 2014 on a constant currency basis.As discussed during the Q3 call and as expected in Q4, the FX impact on revenue and FY '15 was material at approximately $1.3 million.From a geographic perspective 48% of fiscal 2015 revenue was from Europe with 25% from the Americas and 27% from Asia with positive revenue growth in each region.This compares to 50% of revenue from Europe, 23% from the Americas and 27% from Asia in fiscal 2014.GAAP operating loss for the full year was $2.4 million compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million in fiscal 2014 reflecting increased planned investments particularly in products during the year.GAAP net loss was $19.2 million or a loss of a $1.39 per diluted share in fiscal 2015, compared to a GAAP net loss of $0.7 million or a loss of $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2014.Non-GAAP measures for fiscal 2015 results exclude $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets.Excluding these non-cash items, non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2015 was $0.1 million, compared to $1.4 million in fiscal 2014.Non-GAAP net loss was $17.5 million or a loss of $1.27 per share based on $13.7 million weighted average diluted shares in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.3 million or $0.02 per share in fiscal 2014 based on $13.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Note that the full year GAAP and non-GAAP net losses reflect the impact of two non-cash tax related charges in Q1 totaling $15.2 million to record valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and to reduce our Section 382 state net operating loss carry-forwards.Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $2.7 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $3.3 million in fiscal 2014 again due to planned investments in the year.Turning to some highlights of our balance sheet, we ended the year with $21.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $2.1 million from $23.9 million at the end of the third quarter.Total deferred revenue of $26.9 million was up meaningfully from $11.7 million at the end of the third quarter due to normal seasonality.Total deferred revenue decreased 6% year-over-year primarily due to the timing of invoicing and billing patterns and does not represent a decrease in customer commitment levels.Note that deferred revenue does not include non-cancelable orders that are not contractually committed, but have not yet -- that are contractually committed, but not yet have been dealt.Operating cash flow for the quarter was a net outflow of $1 million, compared to an inflow of $4 million a year ago.For the year, operating cash flow was an outflow of $3.1 million, compared to an inflow of $8.4 million in fiscal 2014.This was driven by the timing of orders and billings as reflected in the deferred revenue and account receivable changes.As I noted, deferred revenue will fluctuate due to timing and seasonality.Now turning to our outlook, for the first quarter and full year 2016, we’re pleased to have delivered steadily improving revenue growth in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2015 as well as three consecutive quarters of constant currency growth in our target range of 15% to 20%.Customers continue to see strong value from our stimulation base design as we continue to make investment in our growth including increased sales productivity and enhancing our technology offerings and we expect our Exa Cloud offering to help customers ramp up more quickly on our platform.The strong project activity in fiscal 2015, we expect to see a more balanced growth between license and project revenue in fiscal 2016.In addition we continue to see signs of investments we’ve made in the past quarters paying off and we continue -- we plan to continue the strategy of investing in our top line growth to fiscal 2016; however, at a more moderated pace.Our success in fiscal 2015 gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver similar constant currency top line growth in fiscal 2016.However, although adjusted EBITDA margins will improve on a constant currency basis, actual margins will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange in FY '16.Exa generates approximately 75% of its revenue from outside the U.S. Due to some U.S. dollar-based foreign contracts approximately 60% of our revenue is exposed to currency fluctuations.Although we have some natural hedging with internationally based cost and expenses margin exposure to foreign currency can be as high as two thirds of each revenue dollar that is to say for every revenue decreased due to FX impacts, EBITDA can be impacted negatively by as much as $0.66.Our fiscal 2016 outlook has been impacted by the significant movement in key currencies, which began in Q3 and accelerated into the second half of Q4.We are not anticipating a recovery in these FX rates to FY '15 levels in this guidance and will be taking short-term actions and reviewing long-term options to address the impact on our business model.In the short term, we will closely manage the pace of investment with focus on balancing the timing of expenses and the impact on topline growth.This will enable us to continue a successful growth investment strategy, which we believe is in the best interest of shareholders.With that backdrop, for the full year fiscal 2016 which ends on January 31, 2016, and based on an exchange rate assumption of 1.13 U.S. dollars per euro and 118 Japanese Yen to the U.S. dollar, we expect revenue to be in the range of $64.7 million to $67 million.This represent constant currency growth of 13% to 17% and an estimated negative foreign currency impact on our revenue guidance of between $4 million and $5 million based on FY '15 average rates.We anticipate adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.8 million to $2.5 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 3% to 4%.FX headwind negatively impacted this adjusted EBITDA guidance by 2 to 2.5 margin points.Excluding this impact on a constant currency basis, this would represent an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 5% and 6% and we anticipate non-GAAP net loss to range from $4.3 million to $3.6 million.We estimate basic share count of 14.5 million shares and fully diluted share count of approximately 14.9 million shares for the year.Looking at the first quarter, we expect our typical seasonal pattern of sequential decline in revenue from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, specifically on the profit revenue line as we experience a seasonally strong fourth quarter.It is important to recognize that customers renewing with additional capacity also typically add simulation capacity in the second half of the prior year also resulting in license revenue that can be sequentially flat or down from fourth quarter to first quarter; therefore our stated first quarter guidance is as follows.We anticipate revenue in the range of $14.5 million to $15.1 million at guided exchange rates and constant currency revenue growth of between 11% and 16%.We estimate a negative currency impact of approximately $800,000 to $1 million based on FY '15 average rates.We anticipate adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $0.8 million to $0.3 million and we anticipate non-GAAP net loss to range from $2.1 million to $1.6 million.We estimate basic share count of 14.3 million shares and fully diluted share count of approximately 14.8 million shares for the first quarter.In summary, we're pleased with the progress of fiscal 2015.We believe that our steady growth through the year built a strong foundation for fiscal 2016.We are excited about the opportunity that we are anticipating in the year ahead including bringing the ExaCLOUD more widely to the market, which will enhance our overall growth.Our progress in fiscal 2015 both financially and from a product perspective gives us confidence in our fiscal 2016 and longer term outlook as we look to scale our business and drive shareholder value.Thank you.Good afternoon.First question is just with respect to headcount and OpEx, how do you see -- where did you end up the year with headcount and where do you see that going?Jim, its Rick.We ended up at 296 heads and as I mentioned, we expect to continue to invest that's just going to be on a more smoothed out basis over the quarters and we will continue to focus on field resources and R&D as we did in the prior year.Okay.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And I know its early days yet , but I 'm <b>wondering</b> if you can maybe elaborate on the reception to the Cloud offering .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Can you talk a little bit about the verticals where you might be getting some early traction?Yes absolutely.We’re already seeing early traction especially in as we go away -- as we expand away from -- or in addition to the automotive OEMs and the large manufacturers into the smaller highway machinery accounts, supply chain and others.We’re seeing a lot of interest that where they don’t naturally have that in-house high promise computing capacity or capabilities and it’s really been a barrier to start.They see a lot of benefit of actually just having a zero investment -- upfront investment to make to get going.So that's really the target market for us is the way to expand the use in the broader access of customers that can access all of the capabilities as we work towards going into those smaller manufacturers.So Steve is this getting into some newer customers or is this basically what you're seeing so far is just getting a little deeper with some of the existing customers?Well the existing project customers is really the target.So they're existing and they've done projects typically the smaller ones would take -- would do a lot of projects to really build up the justification for making the in-house investment to get going.Even if they were using our on-demand facility, they still need all the clients offer in house and so they would take more, they would do more projects to really gain a solid ROI calculation and determination of the business case before proceeding.Now they can take that step with just no investment to make, they can just keep going and so we're already seeing the first signs of those early adopters just moving right through into a more license usage mode be it a Cloud rather than staying in project mode longer.And that's critical for us, it's critical for us cost structure wise to really bring down that cost structure what it takes to get customers to move into that recurring license because that's obviously the business model that we’re focused on and what we need to continue to support for strong growth.Great, this is Matt Lemenager on for Steve Ashley.I just had a question about the new project activity and a little bit of color there is obviously really strong.Can you talk about maybe was it stringed from new logos, people using different applications on the platform maybe within auto, outside of auto, outside of aero and just general comments around the project activity?Yeah so let’s see.So it’s still the traditional same mix that we have, which is certain set of the project activity is just panel and peak needs to customers helping them if they have a critical time slots to get things done.But most of it is actually either teaching new customers new logos and getting them engaged with the technology solutions or working with existing customers on new applications.So let’s address the existing customers and new applications first.So in auto industry there continues to be in the passenger car side that continues to be still quite a bit of work and brake cooling and fan noise related issues.Now into drive cycle simulation capabilities who are actually working to predict how the car is going to perform under a full one hour long drive cycle both thermal and aero.Other things around passenger comfort and cabin comfort as we work in those areas.So those are critical areas that we work with customers in new departments demonstrating our new capabilities and work towards getting them into full deployment mode where they can really establish the value prop for them and then establish their engineering process to leverage their capabilities.In new logos, it's generally already existing applications.We tend to go after existing new accounts with existing capabilities where it's already proven out well established and we sort of replicate those capabilities and help support that in new accounts.So and the project mix is always a mix of those things.It fluctuates a little bit between new logos and existing customers and new applications and that mix has been fairly consistent over the last couple of years I would say.Great that's helpful and on the ExaCLOUD and I know it’s early, but do we know or maybe what you expect the percent of new projects that would be launched in ExaCLOUD, is that going to be all of them, half of them and then maybe what do you think if you were to kind of quantify the change in set up time, is there any directional guidance you can give us there?Yes so on projects, certainly we’re going to deliver all projects now, all of our projects will be delivered via the Cloud but customers even any project coming off will have an immediate engagement from our products and our capabilities via the Cloud.So we will start off with these customers engaging them first in the easier step, which is the post processing visualization of results, weathering them then go explore natively and naturally the result that we were calculating in determining as part of their project.We'll explain that basis, what we calculated, what we delivered and then let them go explore on their own.That will be the sort of the first engagement that we will make with them Cloud based and then over time migrate them through to do incremental design changes what if design alternatives and then ultimately the entire process.Got it and then just sort of on the change setup time, do we know like just roughly how much time that might save?So initially here the work flow is -- there is a number of automation steps that we’ve taken, but it’s not massive in terms of -- in terms of time savings.The benefit here is really going to be the integration of the pieces and everything in one place and being able to work through that, have multiple work together and work through those steps.As we migrate the Cloud to more application specific one of the benefits we’re going to be able to do is drive more application specific capabilities in the Cloud and present to user interface that's a little bit more streamlined for certain applications and that I think will help them reduce the time to progress.Thanks to the questions.First what are you guys doing differently everyone is asking about this Cloud stuff on this call I guess, but and I see [Avanti] [ph] try to do Cloud and neither of them really kind of got the stale.Are you doing stuff materially different from what they did or do you think it’s just more the time is right because fundamentally that’s really the argument that like Autodesk makes in a difference space, so that will be question one.And then I think twice in the prepared remarks that you went through a few minutes ago was you talked about the fact you feel you're underpenetrated in a lot of these accounts, I guess I would agree, but why do you think that’s the case?Is it product, is it sales execution or what, because I think there is opportunity I’m just trying to triangulate around it or it just because if you get cloud, will that do it etcetera.Thanks.Okay, so may be the first question so on cloud, I think certainly some of the things that have happened in the last couple years that have made I think the cloud offering a much more attainable position is the true Cloud offering that's been the latency in internet connections.And a low latency is critical if you're working with very complex three dimensional models like our customer are and you want to interact with them, spin and interact with them, you've got to have a very low latency between the thing of calculating the data and your display in how it's connected to you.So latency has been a significant improvement on last year's infrastructure and most customers now have access to that.So the technology enables us to be, seamlessly it looks like it’s running on your desktop, but you need only a browser at your hands to operate everything.So, that’s going to be I think effective change that we’re taking advantage of here in this offering.But the rest is I think is just making sure that we have an established work flow.One of the big benefits of our product -- underlying product, which is true for on-premise or in the cloud is that it's a very straightforward set up process, it’s not complicated to put your geometry and prepare your geometry and run stimulations, create stimulations without complexity of users and grid dependence and also issues that make general products very difficult to use.All of that’s not there, so we can combine in a Cloud offering, a very automated process that connects all the various pieces to get results.So it’s really just been -- the customers we're targeting, it's going to be a faster way to get them moving.On the underpenetrated side of things, so what guides us here is as you know, we work very closely with customers in our industries, in our target markets and that closeness enables us to see what they're doing today and what they ultimately want to do and we actually have long term relationships with the customers in long-term steering committees that we sit on with them will be actually map out a multiyear plan of deployment and deployment strategy, what solutions that they are capable of using today, what solutions they want to deploy that we're already capable of delivering and the times gone to which we're going to work with that process change and then what new things they want from us.If we just took -- if we just took existing applications and got every automotive OEM to be at the equal level of deployment of the best automotive OEM in that category, our revenues would be substantially higher all right.So we've proved points in the industry of our applications being capable of being deployed and now we want everyone of our customers to use that application for those -- our solutions for that application.That gives us a map and then from there, there is a whole set of other applications and capabilities that we’re working to develop and bring to market with our R&D expense that will enable customers to do other and solve other problems that are really important to them.And then may be one point on under penetration, the regulatory piece, the fuel economy targets, I think we've mentioned this quite a few times before, but they’re having to work, even the things that they currently do and do well, they’re going to have to work much harder and do many more simulations in order to get to the new levels of targets.So that’s also a factor driving growth for us.Great.This is actually Adam Borg in for Brad.Thanks for taking my question.Can you provide some additional color on the economics of the cloud product and how it compares to your on-premise license offering?So from -- yeah from an economic point of view, we’re trying to be neutral pasture for the customers.The upfront investment is the big differentiator, but on an ongoing basis, the software on the cloud is the same price point except to add, added to that price point is the cost of the hardware in storage that you’re also using.So it's a slightly higher price point, but it includes everything and the license product in house is just for the software piece for you, then responsible for them buying and maintaining the hardware piece of it.So we’re really just adding the hardware component on to that it really commoditized at this point.There’s well established pricing for hardware hours out in the world and we just add that incremental cost to the total cost of our solution.Got it great.And then specifically about APAC, is there anything you could share with the individual geography therein maybe Japan or Korea or even China will be great?So China is the strongest region from a growth point of view, but also the smallest of the three.Asia for us is really -- we’re really only operating directly in China, Japan and Korea.And China is the fastest growing and the smallest of the three regions.Japan in particular had very strong growth this year especially as we worked to moving on -- moving in addition and staying to beyond the automotive OEMs and we have had very strong success in the heavy vehicle both highway truck and off highway segments within Japan, which has been a target for us and we’ll really starting to see that drive quite a bit of growth.I mentioned Asia was up 21% in constant currency for the year, year-over-year and that was heavily driven by the expansion of one of the most significant drivers of the expansion heavy vehicle in Japan and the overall growth in China.Korea is a set of narrower customers, but still a very strong region and a strong steady grower for us heavily dominated by Hyundai in particular in the auto industry.Got it, great.And just last from our end, I think you mentioned that agriculture and mining were a little bit weaker this year or during the quarter.Could you just share a little bit more about what’s going on behind that?Yeah so if you just look at -- if you look at just headwinds in the market some of the large scale mining equipment manufacturers in that industry and agriculture markets are seeing very substantial drops in unit sales.As commodity pricing of minerals continues to and natural resource continues to drop, that’s dropping end users sales, I think in some cases we've seen reported sales drops of 40% and unit sales of some of the customer base.So that all -- those kind of headwinds are always more challenging for us to establish even very economic -- very value oriented solution that can really save our customers money.Very hard to get mind share when you’re in that kind of a market.So we adjusted those kind of minor issues that are happening in the market and focus on other customers where their revenue and outlook is stronger.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Just <b>wondering</b> if you can provide to us what the Aerospace market represented for the full fiscal year and how you see the outlook for that business coming up this year ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I don’t know exactly that number, but it’s a few percent of our revenue, it’s in the storm of single digit I think.It's still 10 or 15 customers that are really that we're focused on.We’re really focused on the early adopters in that space.There’s a lot of work going on.Published logos that we published and covered in our press materials or include NASA, Embraer, Gulfstream, MBD, which is our major landing gear manufacturer.But in terms of the investment it is -- was it fair to say it’s consuming a reasonable amount of the investment you’re making.Absolutely, it’s still an investment market for us still.We’re generating an off revenue to start covering most of the cost -- incremental cost from that effort, but it’s still an investment opportunity.It looks, it continues to look quite strong.We’re bringing capabilities to the Aerospace market, they have never seen, I think they've never been able to do before.So there’s -- we’re generating quite a bit of excitement, but as you can imagine, process change and others are taking time to understand that and work through how they can really leverage it.But very clear, we have a position to take air and Aerospace very clear.This is a long-term market for us in the technology and now we’re -- our job is to size proportionately the investment we make and modulate it relative to the time response of customers.But certainly the market can continue to add -- the way we think about Aerospace is not necessarily percentage of our total revenues, because the ground transportation market continues to be very strong and growing and so what we really think about, there are so many points of growth that can add all right.And we think about aerospace adding one, two, three, four percentage points of growth over the next few years each year.And really leveraging the fundamental product capability and architecture of all the products that are added extensions for high marking of our capabilities that have opened up opportunities in aerospace and like I mentioned, some of that is actually is feeding back into Formula One and passenger car business.So it's a good synergy between the efforts, but we'll modulate the investment based on growth and we'll work towards making that breakeven area of our business and then a profit piece of the business as it gets a little bit more scale, but not to be much larger than it is now to get to that point.Thank you.I am showing no further questions.I would like to hand the call back to Steve Remondi for further remarks.Okay.Well thanks for joining our call today.We're pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and believe we ended FY '15 in a much stronger position that we started it.We're pleased that our sales and product initiatives are gaining traction and we're optimistic that we continue to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth with improving profitability in FY '16.We look forward to speaking with you again soon.Thanks good bye.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.This does conclude today's program.You may all disconnect.Everyone have a great day.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Exa Corporation released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on March 19, 2015.</div></body></html>
