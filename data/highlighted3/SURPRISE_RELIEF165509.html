(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In the fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings call, Matrix management provided some clarity: "We reviewed the estimate.We did site visits.We reviewed the schedule.We analyzed who our joint venture partners were going to be and the client.So we were, at that time, fairly comfortable with the project.It was only -- the project at the time of the diligence, was approximately 17% complete,.The construction being less than that and the other portions of the project being more.But on average, it was only 17% complete.Frankly, we thought that the estimate was, while it was aggressive, was doable.But the other members of the joint venture, the owner, because they were providing some key pieces of equipment, they all had to do their jobs.As we know, we would do ours.And so, in an EPC arrangement, in this case, for this project, which is -- EPC, for those who don't know that, that's engineering, procurement and construction, Matrix is providing the construction services and our partners and our client are providing engineering and procurement services.So when pieces of those engineering and procurement break down, as they have on this project, it makes the construction piece of the job that much more difficult.So anyway, so we -- there was a full diligence on the project.We appreciated the risk associated with it as well as the rest of the organization.And the acquisition of the company took into account those associated risks and benefits, obviously, that we saw in this acquisition.So again, this is, like I said, is a lump-sum project.We are today approximately 89% complete.We are beginning commissioning and startup of the project.We've got a commercial completion date and obligation to the owner by the end of our fiscal year of 2015.And, sometimes, when you get into the commissioning and turnover of these projects is when some of the issues related to the technical aspects of the job begin to raise their head and create complexities for the contractor to pull all the pieces together.And so that's kind of where we are related to this project."Could Matrix Service end up in the same predicament again?It is possible but not likely probable.There should be opportunities to forego such challenges in the future based on lessons learned on the Calpine Garrison Energy Center.To gain confidence in whether the lessons were indeed learned, backtracking through the closing remarks of the fiscal 2015 quarterly earnings calls seems to show a humility and then a regaining of confidence.Q1 : "We expect to be the best at everything we do.So when you have a goal to be the best as we do, you have to set very high expectations for yourself.And we have confidence in our ability to achieve those expectations."Q2: "The performance in the balance of the business is on track with our expectations and we remain excited about our position in the marketplace."Q3 : "Bottom line, our market position is as strong as ever and we see this continuing for some time."Disclosure: I am/we are long MTRX.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
