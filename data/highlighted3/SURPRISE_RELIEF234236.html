class='textDiv'>ROFIN-SINAR Technologies' (RSTI) CEO Thomas Merk on Q4 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Welcome to the ROFIN-SINAR’s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call.Today’s call is hosted by Mr. Thomas Merk, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ms. Ingrid Mittelstädt, Chief Financial Officer.Following management’s comments, you will have the opportunity to ask questions.Please go ahead.Thank you, David.And good morning or good afternoon to everyone and welcome to ROFIN-SINAR Technologies fourth quarter conference call.Joining me on today’s call here in our headquarter in Plymouth, Michigan is my colleague Ingrid Mittelstädt, our CFO.I hope you all received the press release containing our fourth quarter 2015 results.We will give you a summary of our performance during our fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 including observations and the full year performance, and then we will open it up for questions.Now before we start, I would like to make the usual statements about the information you are getting in this conference call, Safe Harbor statement: Our discussions may include predictions, estimates or other information that may be considered forward-looking.While these forward-looking statements represent our best current judgments on what the future holds, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.Throughout our discussion, we will attempt to discuss important factors relating to our business that may affect our prediction.You may also want to review our last 10-Q and 10-K filings for a more complete disclosure of financial risk.The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.So let’s get started.As you can see from our press release, we delivered strong financial results in our fourth quarter and full fiscal year.We are proud to announce that this was our strongest quarter in fiscal year 2015, based on earnings and revenue, both of which surpassed our guidance.We continue to see positive effects of our cost reduction strategies, and we have launched additional initiatives to further reduce costs and improve efficiency, including consolidation of our worldwide structure, more details you will hear later.Let me quickly review the main highlights of our fourth quarter.Net sales of the quarter reached $142 million, above our high-end guidance of $140 million.On a comparable currency basis, net sales would been $155.7 million in Q4, representing 7% growth year-over-year.We improved gross margin year-over-year from 37.4% to 39.6%.We achieved record highs in revenue and units for our high-power fiber laser.We doubled sales of our ultrashort pulse lasers on a sequential basis, as we continued to gain traction in this market.Net income for the quarter rose by 24% year-over-year to $14.8 million.Quarterly earnings per share increased 21% year-over-year to $0.52 from $0.43.The continued improvement of ROFIN’s profitability, underlines the effectiveness of our strategy.And we expect to see additional cost savings of at least $5 million in fiscal year 2016.Some key items of the improvement of our performance were, the production of our 3rd generation high-power fiber laser is running very well.We further improved our margins in the manufacturing of these lasers through better fixed cost absorption and scaling effects due to the higher business volume.In our second growth area, the ultrashort pulse lasers, we experienced very strong sales in Q4.Revenues more than doubled sequentially Q3 to Q4 due to a project.We made more first installations for the cutting of brittle materials in Asia and Europe and were granted an additional fundamental patent in the U.S.We also made progress on our efficiency program which we announced in our Q2 earnings call.For example, we merged our companies in Switzerland and are preparing to merge two of our German companies.Our strong results for the quarter were driven by the traction we have gained with our fiber laser and ultrashort pulse laser product portfolio which are our two major growth areas.High-power fiber laser revenue and unit sales hit record highs in the fourth quarter.On a sequential basis, we were able to double revenues of ultrashort pulse lasers.Strength in key industries such as medical device and flexible packaging businesses as well as an improved electronic business, supported by solid machine tools and portable pipe demand.And last but not least, a robust components business.On a geographical basis, Europe and North America showed firm business levels.These regions contributed 46% and 20% respectively to quarterly net sales.Quarterly revenue in Europe would have grown by 13% year-over-year to $74.6 million on a constant currency basis.The Asian business softened, declining 7% to 34% of net sales compared to 36% in Q4 fiscal year ‘14.Let me take a moment to review the whole fiscal year 2015.Annual revenue amounted to $519.6 million, highlighted by a strong North American business with year-over-year revenue growth of 10%.On a constant currency basis, our overall net sales would have reached $569 million, an increase of 7.3% year-over-year.We increased net income by 64% to $41.3 million.This year, we appointed a leadership team focused on addressing our key areas of operations such as high-power fiber laser, ultrashort pulse laser, main regions and cost reduction.I will provide more color on our operations, markets and outlook later in the call.But now, Ingrid will comment on the financials for the quarter.Thank you, Thomas.Good morning and good afternoon to everyone.As already mentioned by Thomas, we are proud to report the best quarter of fiscal year 2015, in terms of revenues and earnings.Let me walk you through the performance of our different business areas, and this is without adjusting to constant currency exchange rates.Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, sales in our marking, micro business decreased $3.9 million or 6% to $65.5 million, mainly as a results of the weaker marking business.Micro marking contributed 46% of total quarterly sales.Sales in our macro business decreased slightly by 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and reached $55.6 million.The macro business contributed 39% to the quarterly revenue and included a solid machine tool business, which contributed 36%.Consistent to our expectations, the product mix for high-power fiber laser, shifted from CO2 towards more units of high-power fiber laser.The Q4 of fiscal year 2014 allocation mix was approximately 62% to 38% and in Q4 2015, we were at nearly 36% compared to 64% with high-power fiber laser.Our component business increased 8% to $20.9 million and contributed 15% to quarterly sales.As usual, the strongest contributors were the fiber portfolio of Nufern, the laser diode business from Dilas, and the optical component product portfolio from Optoskand.Our component business is part of our well-diversified core business and has gained importance since 1997, when we acquired Dilas, as a contributor to the Group’s revenue.Today components have a revenue share in the range of 13% to 15%, making it now an inherent part of our business.Select acquisitions of high-end component manufacturers are part of our long-term acquisition strategy.In addition, we are confident that our comprehensive component business, which also serves our laser manufacturers can benefit from the overall growing laser market.The breakdown of our quarterly sales by industry was as follow: The machine tool industry contributed 36% to revenue and reached almost the same percent level as in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year; semiconductor and electronics reached the same level, representing 21% in both periods; automotive sales contributed 10% to the quarterly revenue, which was a slight decrease from the 11% in the prior year; other industries made up 33% of sales compared to 31% in the same period of fiscal year 2014 with solid contributions from medical device and flexible packaging.During the fourth quarter, we shipped a total of 1,436 lasers compared to 1,466 labors last year, about 2% or 30 units less.Of those, 588 units were for macro applications, and 851 units were shipped for marking and micro applications.Let me now turn to the income statement.We are pleased to report very strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, in terms of revenues and earnings, although the quarter was affected gain by significant exchange rate fluctuations of several currencies.For example, between Q4 2014 and Q4 2015, the euro dropped versus the U.S. dollar by roughly 18%.Because ROFIN generates the majority of its sales in other currencies and mainly in euro, this currency movement negatively impacts our top-line results.We expect this effect to have an impact until the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.The exchange rate fluctuations decreased our quarterly revenues by $13.7 million and gross profit by $3.5 million in comparison to last fiscal year’s fourth quarter.Nevertheless, we were able to improve gross margins from 37.4% to 39.6% year-over-year.Significant contributors to this improvement were the reduced production cost in the manufacturing of the high-power fiber laser sales to the use of the 3rd generation design, the higher efficiency in production, better absorption of fixed costs related to the high business level, and a favorable product mix was of course included the good sales with ultrashort pulse lasers, already mentioned by Thomas.SG&A expenses without amortization, decreased 11% to $24.2 million and represented 17% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ‘15, compared to 19% in the corresponding prior year quarter.This decrease is mainly a result of lower labor cost, exhibition and traveling expenses combined with the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in commissions as a consequence of the high revenue level in the quarter.We will consider the overall business climate and economic conditions in the different industries as we continue to evaluate the approximate level of overhead going forward.R&D expenses decreased 15% to $9.8 million, representing 7% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ‘15 compared to $11.5 million or 8% of total sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ‘14.This decline is mainly due to the reduced material and labor costs, impact of exchange rate fluctuations, and partially offset by lower R&D grants.Turning now to other income and expenses: The quarterly net other expenses amounted to $1.3 million compared to a net other income of $2 million in the comparable period of fiscal year ‘14.The decrease in net other income mainly relates to higher net exchange losses of approximately $0.4 million compared to net exchange gains of $1.9 million last fiscal year and higher disposals of fixed assets.Our effective tax rate on income before taxes and minority interest for the fourth quarter was 27% compared to 30.5% for the same period last fiscal year.And the lower effective tax rate is a result of the generation of taxable income mainly in countries with lower tax rate.Even with slightly lower revenues compared to the same period last fiscal year, we were able to increase our quarterly earnings by improving our gross margins to 39.6% of net sales and controlling our operating expenses.This resulted in earnings per share of $0.52, based on 28.3 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to $0.43 based on 28.1 million weighted average shares outstanding from Q4 2014.And this represents an increase year-over-year of 21%.Now, coming to the balance sheet.Comparing the exchange rates from September 30, 2015 versus September 30, 2014, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar mainly against the euro, resulted in a change of approximately 13%.Other currencies like the Japanese yen, had a fluctuation of approximately 10%; the Swedish krona has filtrations of approximately 17%.Therefore, the impact on the balance sheet position could be different depending on the geographical distribution of the corresponding balances.Trade accounts receivables decreased by $11.9 million compared to last fiscal year and amounted to $96.1 million.At September 30, 2015, the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation on accounts receivable was a decrease of approximately $8.2 million.The day sales outstanding was 67 days compared to 74 days last fiscal year.Net income decreased by approximately $9.3 million to $181 million during the 12 months and inventory decreased $16 million due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations but was partially offset by an increase in our stock of 6.7 million due mainly to some projects with longer lead time included in the ending backlog.Based on the cost of goods sold figures, inventory churned approximately 1.8 times.Now, I would like to give you some information related to the cash flow.Cash and short-term investments increased by $33.9 million to $175.6 million during the 12 months of fiscal year ‘15.The impact of the exchange rate fluctuation was to decrease cash by $15.2 million.During the 12 months period ending September 30, 2015, the company generated $68.6 million from its operating activities.$26.9 million were used in investing activities, mainly due to capital expenditures of $34 million that included the acquisition of the new production facility for our micro headquarter, and the expansion of some facilities like Dilas in Germany or our production in UK.These were partially offset by the net sales of short-term investments of $60.5 million.$11.7 million were provided by the Company in financing activities, mainly due to a long-term debt for financing the acquisition of the new German facility and the issuance of common stock.And this was partially offset by payments to minority shareholders of $0.4 million related to the acquisition of additional sales of one Chinese subsidiary and $0.8 million for a payment of contingent acquisition related obligations.As we reported in our earnings release, our Board of Directors, yesterday, authorized the company to initiate a share buyback of up to 50 million of the company’s common stock to be executed over the next 18 months.The company expects to purchase this -- the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the company’s discretion.Now, coming to our earnings guidance, based on our current project base, we are confident regarding our full year 2016 performance.Typically, ROFIN’s normal business cycle is characterized by a slow start to the fiscal year and the better second half after the Chinese New Year.Against this background, we estimate our net sales for fiscal year 2016 to be approximately in the range of $525 million $545 million, with gross margins in the range of 38% to 39%.We target earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90, representing year-over-year growth of 23% at the mid-point of the range.This guidance is not including the potential impact of the share buyback program.As you know, ROFIN’s first fiscal quarter is traditionally seasonally lower and business improves over the following quarters.The first quarter of fiscal year 2016 guidance also takes into account the expected unfavorable impact of the average exchange rate, resulting from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.The majority of any such impact affects the sale level with net income being affected to a lesser degree due to natural hedges.Within this contract and based on our current project basis and softer economic environment in Asia, the company currently forecasts revenue for the first quarter in the range of $113 million to $118 million.We also estimate gross profit for the first quarter at around 35% to 36% of net sales, mainly as a result of less favorable expected product mix and the lower overall business volume.Period expenses including intangible amortization are expected between 28% and 29% of net sales.The effective tax rate depends mainly on the overall mix of results in the different countries and the non-deductible expenses for tax purposes, should be around 28%.This estimation does not take into account the possible range statement of the federal R&D tax credit in the U.S. Intangible amortization and fixed asset depreciation are estimated as approximately 3.5% of net sales.This guidance is only an estimate and again subject to all the risks of our Safe Harbor statement.Thanks, Ingrid.Now, I will provide additional details on our operations and market for the past quarter.Let’s start with the geographical overview.Europe and North America showed a robust and stable business, contributing 46% and 20% to quarterly sales, respectively to our fourth quarter revenues.Asian demand softened by 7% year-over-year, contributing $48.5 million to quarterly sales and representing 34% of total revenue.On a constant currency basis, overall Asian net sales would have been at the same level as Q4 in 2014.Highlights were the strong contribution of Japan and also Korea improved, showing the strongest revenue in the last quarter of the fiscal year.Chinese sales reached 18% of overall net sales.We would also like to remind you that the geographical split only shows direct sales in the Asian countries.We estimate that a higher portion is ending up in Asia as many of our labors are integrated by OEMs and then shift to Asia.Turning to the business area and industries.We had a strong quarter in the electronics industry, which was also due to some projects for our proprietary filamentation technology to cut brittle materials like glass, sapphire and transparent ceramics.Other applications in this industry have been plastic welding, welding of electronic components and marking and precision cutting.The main region for this industry is Asia.In the automotive and sub-supplier industry, we delivered another strong quarter.Sales of the automotive industry made-up 10% of quarterly sales, slightly down from 11% in the prior year quarter.The biggest contributor in this quarter were our high-power lasers, both CO2 and fiber.Polymer welding and marking as well as driving of conrod were also large contributors, again showing our wide footprint in this industry.Our semiconductor revenue declined in Q4 2015 versus Q4 2014, which was largely driven by declines in Taiwan.Although this was offset to some extent by new account wins in China.In general, we see new micro applications in the pipeline; we expect the recovery of our semi business in our second quarter.Our solar business was pretty solid year-over-year, but of course dropped from the high number in Q3 where we delivered a volume order.The main applications we see are for crystalline solar sales in order to achieve high efficiencies.We had received additional orders in Q4 for turnkey systems for crystalline solar cell manufacturing.The medical device industry showed a strongest quarter in this fiscal year.The main applications included precision cutting and welding as well as marking of surgical instruments and implants.Ultrashort pulse lasers play a more important role since the post-processing processes can be significantly reduced or even eliminated.We started to ship the first units to the new key accounts the sent [ph] applications.And cutting was especially strong in the quarter and ROFIN has a leading market position in this sector.Our sales in advanced applications, M&D continued to grow, and again we are positive about the outlook on this sector.Coming to the main product suite, low-power CO2 lasers from Hull, UK had their best quarter in the fiscal year; while electronic applications suffered, we were strong in the leather and jeans markets.Our high-power CO2 laser business was 9.5% of total revenue in fiscal year 2015 and is becoming less material over time, further demonstrating the company’s successful migration to fiber laser technology.I already mentioned that we had another record quarter for high-power fiber laser.Unit sales were up by roughly 80% compared to last year’s fourth quarter.Order entry for high-power fiber laser units was again at a good level, even slightly above last quarter.In addition to China, we are in promising discussions with customers in Japan, Europe and United States.We have received very positive feedback from the market on our powerful 2 kilowatt modules and on new features of our high-power fiber lasers.These results clearly show our progress we are doing in the high-power fiber laser market since 2007 when ROFIN and its board identified the market opportunity and begun to pursue it, becoming one of the industry’s first movers.Since then, we have made significant investment in R&D and simultaneously applied fiber laser knowhow with our company’s policy [ph] and blueprints to build proprietary high power fiber laser technology within ROFIN and achieve vertical integration.ROFIN’s first high-power fiber laser was delivered in 2009, and we have since grown this business to almost $94 million in fiscal year ‘15.ROFIN has developed, both in-house and acquired capability across the entire production chain for fiber lasers.It now has a fully vertically integrated supply chain and is poised to realize margin expansion.Without question, we are now seeing a very attractive return on our investments as we are currently number two in the market in terms of portfolio.We continue to have clear R&D projects running in order to reduce our manufacturing costs further.It is our goal to reduce the costs in the mid to upper teens and to enter fiscal year 2016.In addition, we are working on higher power diode modules which we want to implement mid fiscal year 2016.We are also making progress in our own chip material.We have been able to improve on the yields recently.In order to increase the efficiency of our pump module further, we are also working on the chip design itself.In the high-power range of products, ROFIN aims to grow unit sales again in the range of 50% in fiscal year ‘16 and win additional market share.We have also made advancements, product introductions in the low and mid-power fiber laser range since our entrance in the fiber laser market in 2007.In the meantime, we have developed one of the broadest fiber laser portfolios in the industrial lasers space and are well-positioned to increase market share in the estimated $1.1 billion fiber laser market of 2015 as published by Strategies Unlimited, in the beginning of this year.Our ultrashort pulse business is gaining momentum.We have done several installations, first installations for our proprietary filament application in Asia and Europe.We see future growth in the medical device and automotive industries as well as portable take.Due to a project we delivered, we had a nice jump in sales in our fourth quarter and we could sequentially double our sales with ultrashort pulse lasers.In the last quarter, we got additional fundamental patents for cutting of brittle material, granted in the US.We feel well-prepared for this future business.Order entry: Q4 order entry of 128.8 million, declined 9% when compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter, which was $141.3 million but would have amounted to the same revenue level on a constant currency basis.Out of the $128.8 million order entry, 22 were in North America, 32 in Asia, and 46 in Europe.Finally, let me touch on our outlook before opening the call for your questions.We see a stable outlook for business and projects in Europe, North America and most parts of Asia.In China, we expect a softening prior to the Chinese New Year.Regional and industry outlook: In the new fiscal year 2015-2016, we expect a further increase of our profitability as well as our top-line numbers.Our successful initiatives on the cost side coupled with the strong product portfolio, gives us confidence that we are well-positioned for the new fiscal year.We see attractive opportunities in the consumer electronics and worldwide OEM markets for high-power fiber lasers.We see the biggest potential of growth opportunities for fiscal year 2016 by focusing on these two important areas.We are in promising discussions with potential high-power OEMs from which we might see first order entries in Q1 or Q2.I want to repeat that we have our first reference of customers for the glass cutting application to be on opportunity for volume orders in the fiscal year.We see a stable year for our base business, mainly with our component group but also with our new high power guide lasers and the low power CO2 lasers.As mentioned earlier, our outlook for Q1 fiscal year 2016 reflects softer order entry in Asia, although we have received positive feedback at a recent tradeshow in Shanghai.In U.S. and Europe, we expect business to be on a stable level.In addition, other Asian countries may be negatively impacted by development in China.Our first quarter outlook reflects a weaker semiconductor industry as well as the equally adverse currency translation effects.As always, our outlook for the next quarter Q1 2016, P&L is based on lead time of orders.We expect the typical ROFIN seasonal pattern, a weaker first quarter due to season affects us but improving business over the following quarters.Again, we are confident about our operational and financial performance for the full fiscal year 2016, providing that the economic conditions including the economic environment in the Asian region will not show a substantial deterioration.Outlook Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 is as follows: Macro, we expect significant growth in our high-power fiber laser business.High-power CO2 will be a bit lower based on the weaker bookings from Q4, low-power CO2 should be quite stable.Micro, we see a stable business in medical, packaging and photovoltaic, the further interest for glass cutting.Marking, we should see a positive impact on our part business on semi in China, on automotive and mainly on the European business.We don’t expect volume orders from semi and electronics in Asia.We expect our components business to be stable or even increasing.M&D is slightly increased with first orders in Q1 and we expect growth in order entry in Q2.General outlook and strategy: We continue to follow our strategy for profitability and expect to see benefits from the measures we have implemented such as operational consolidation initiatives, which I might add, have been underway for quite some time now.As we mentioned, this is an ongoing process, and we expect to see more positive effects in the quarters to come.With our efficiency program that we announced in Q2, we are proactively targeting further cost control while also actively promoting sales and development in key areas and markets.For this purpose, we have strengthened our executive team to better address the different projects.So, the important take away from this quarter I would like to summarize as follows: We delivered strong performance in Q4 with net income increasing by 24% and EPS by 21%; we hit another record in sales for our high-power fiber lasers, showing that our investment in this technology beginning in 2007, are paying off now; fourth quarter gross margin improved to 39.6% of net sales; although our Q1 ‘16 outlook is tempered, we expect a strong overall fiscal year 2016; finally, are instituting a share buyback program that highlights our ongoing confidence in the long-term financial prospects of the company and our strong commitment to increase shareholder value.Our expectation for ongoing margin and cash flow expansion are driven by the strength of our product portfolio and our robust momentum in fast growing high-power fiber laser and ultrashort pulse laser technologies.We are well-positioned to continue our balanced approach in investing in the company’s growth, including through potential acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over time.Lastly, I want to inform you that we are presenting at the Needham Conference in New York in January 2016.Please get in touch with Needham, if you want to meet us there.This concludes my comments.And as always, we want to thank the whole ROFIN team for their contribution, performance, and achievements during this fiscal year.So, starting with high-power fiber lasers, good momentum obviously on a sequential basis, and you expect that to continue into the fiscal ‘16.Are the potential projects that you have, I think you said you could report in the first or second quarter, are these with the big boys, with top 10 cutting tool OEMs?And are you, just to be clear, are you potentially displacing the incumbent or you more likely be qualified as a second source supplier?And any additional details I think would be well appreciated.I think the strategy first of all is that we want to continue to make a nice business with our high-power fiber lasers in China.But also due to the little softening there in China, we will go also in other regions.And you know that they are nice and interesting regions; it’s Japan, it’s also Europe, it’s Turkey, it’s Korea.And we will form our strategy in that regard.We will address of course the big players, but also the Tier 2 and Tier 3, but they are new players getting into the market and of course, it is sometimes easier to convince a new player.But definitely, we will address both of them.Maybe you could shift in 2016 guidance, especially on the EPS line.So, what are the assumptions, Ingrid, for gross margin and also for operating expenses to get you to what looks like the midpoint is 23% EPS growth?Okay, thanks.You only you gave the fourth quarter.Does the EPS guidance includes any other expense like you saw this quarter, like the FX losses?Okay.And then finally, last for me here.So foreign exchange is obviously negatively impacting your top-line, as you’ve rightfully called out.But obviously we’re also getting push to break out what is a currency benefit to your cost of goods sold and also to your OpEx or are you able to do that today to give us an idea of how much FX is kind of hitting profits looking past the sales headwind?Let me see, I think I already mentioned in the gross profits, I mentioned $3.5 million negative; SG&A expenses, it was $2.5 million; and in R&D, $1.2 million.Number one, just wanted a housekeeping item.If you could give us the backlog on macro and marketing and components, the orders on the same basis and spare parts as a percentage of revenue?Yes, of course.I think the backlog, let me begin with the backlog, macro $59.5 million, marking micro $68 million, and component $16.8 million.Order entry, macro $54.7 million, marking micro $54.9 million and components $19.1 million, and services, spare parts 26%.And then just kind of coming up with current annual guidance outlook, you gave a lot of details by saying, and you gave a lot of details by end markets.And you’re explaining the way the down take and normal seasonality.So I guess my question is, this current environment feels like is a tougher environment than perhaps what I would say the normal fiscal year, as you’re entering it, especially given some of the consumer market visibility around China.I’m curious as to why you’re comfortable that is all be a normal seasonal back half of the year?And then also on the guidance, so I’m curious if you changed the way that you guide given that the last couple of years achieving your original outlook is proven most difficult?Let’s talk about our thoughts with the China.For sure, the order entry was a little bit lighter in Q4 and we also have seen some push out recently from Q1 into Q2, mainly of the high-power fiber lasers.Nevertheless, we also had a good show in the last week, this was the sheet metal exhibition in Shanghai, where we’ve got positive feedback, honestly better than expected.So, we see a stable situation there.In addition to the machine tool business, we do see a stable photovoltaic market, stable medical market, and electronic markets in China.We also see in other areas in Asia, for example in Japan and in Korea, potential for us to increase the business.And that in total, gives us outlook for Asia, a positive outlook over the whole fiscal year.Situation in Europe, I think you have seen that we did a strong order entry in Q4.This was a nice growth, if you take the currency exchange rate of 2014.And also in the United States, we can increase the business as we expect in 2016.And I think, Patrick, important is to take into account this project situation with the ultrashort pulse laser.This is new product.And of course, as we mentioned, replaced our equipments and the customers are testing that.So, we expect some volume orders, but the realization of these revenues for sure will be in the second half of the year.And my next question, Ingrid, is if we think about ultrashort pulse, you talked about it doubling sequentially.Can you help me understand the level of which it doubled from, number one?And then number two, we think about this equipment that’s being placed aggressively I would think in the second half of your fiscal year and that’s embedded into some of your confidence in guidance.How could that revenue run rate -- I guess and that being relative to your current ultrashort pulse revenue?I’d tell you, these are new applications and behind that we have high volume order.So that is the reason, you have seen also in this fiscal year already that we are strong in Q3 and Q4 with our revenue growth in comparison to Q1 and Q2.And with this project, we are more confident even for ‘16.We have a pretty stable situation on medical device, on automotive, and what we see as a potential growth are mainly for the areas in the consumer electronic side and they are of course the cutting of the cover glasses of the electronic devices.But also on the photovoltaic side, they are using more and more ultrashort pulse lasers and also we do see challenges there.In both areas, photovoltaic and consumer electronics, if we get a volume order there, the numbers and the volume is significantly higher compared to the medical device business for example.That’s why we do see a pretty nice opportunity in 2016.And just last one for me on high-power fiber laser, Thomas, I want to make sure that I heard you correctly that $94 million was your annual run rate in 2015.Is that accurate?Okay.What is your percentage of fiber, that high-power currently?And then you talked about your high-power units doubling in fiscal year ‘16.Can you help us understand what unit volume is currently and what can your high-power output be on an annual basis?What we said is not double the units, we want to grow again in high-power fiber laser 50%, like this year and this is stable as what we said last quarter.What I said is that unit sales were up by roughly 80% compared to last year’s fourth quarter, Patrick.That was the number.And the expectation for full fiscal year is 50% more units in ‘16 compared to ‘15.As you know, we would like not to disclose what we are going in high-power fiber laser but I have to say that by the end of the year, it’s more than 50% of course.So, it’s a main part of our fiber laser businesses.And within that without disclosing exclusives, [ph] can you help us understand mix of 1 kilowatt versus 4, and then I believe you’ve [indiscernible] so we can get idea.At the moment, we are still with the trend, but we are selling more lower power, so 1 to 2 kilowatt units.But we have of course some projects and revenues with 6 kilowatts, 4, 6 kilowatts, 8 kilowatts some projects there.But the quantity of course is now at the moment still 1 to 2 kilowatts.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Just <b>wondering</b> in terms of the percent of internally manufactured diodes , what are you estimating in your fiber lasers ; what that percentage should be this quarter and what 's your goal for the end of next year -- for this fiscal year ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Sorry.I think that’s interesting question.I think taxes and also as we have targeted, so we have increased our yields recently quite substantial by solving some of the technical issues on the production side.For the upcoming year 2016, Mark, we have two targets.Of course number one is to get the internal chip production up to further absorb our fixed cost but also to increase, and this is -- would be a big effect to increase the power of our pump modules, in the next step.We don’t want to talk about a fourth generation by only doing that, but we expect that we should be able to increase the power of the pump modules by roughly 20% which could give us a nice and positive impact in reducing the manufacturing costs.To do that, it is necessary to change the design of the chips a bit.That’s why both things play a role.And we also are using of course the chips not only for our high-power fiber lasers but for the whole portfolio we do have.These two goals are the main goals for 2016.So, we’ve made really progress in our yields in this quarter.As Thomas mentioned, we planned to grow unit wise the high-power fiber laser by 50% and the end it was 80%.So, the relations is a bit difficult.And I guess that by the end of next year, we will be producing with our nearly full capacity but probably having the additional second source, as planned.If you would get your 50% growth in terms of units and also improve or greater number of diodes from any of you fabs, I imagine that would have a -- can I say that would have a significant impact on margins year-over-year and would you be willing to stick your neck out to say how much, if you did at your own?What we explained already is that we will absorb the fixed cost we have with this production now.So, we will not really reduce significantly the manufacturing cost of the products but we will really absorb 100% of the fixed cost and that is the target.So, it will of course have an impact but it’s not like the impact in redesigning.And that’s the reason why we also are already working on a new design, this will be a contribution.Other part, the chip situation though the one of the pillars to reduce the cost as we set our goal there is to reduce the manufacturing cost of the high-power fiber laser in the upper teens.And this is one of the pillars there.You mentioned there was some weakness in margin.Can I assume that was due to semiconductor market softening up for you or were there other factors behind that?Yes, you are right.The semiconductor, you know that ROFIN is doing very well in that market, basically on the semiconductor area but also of course looking for volume orders from the consumer electronic industry, which was also a bit lower now as we get that.And I think it’s known and mentioned also by our competitors that the low-power fiber lasers, the price pressure is very-very tough.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And just the final question from me , just was <b>wondering</b> about momentum in China .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Do you see -- is it stable from where it was three months ago or do you see some improvements , or just <b>wondering</b> any changed momentum in China ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I think I would not say that it’s better than three month ago.So, we have definitely seen in Q4 little bit of weaker order entry, and we also actually experienced one of the other push out from Q1 into Q2 which is also one of the reasons why we see a slight dip in the Q1.Nevertheless, very positive, really very positive, have seen the Shanghai metal show, we have seen last week where we had the chance to get in touch with our big OEMs there and the situation turned out for ROFIN to be significantly better than what we expected even.So, we do not expect a bigger drop on the machine tool side or on the high-power fiber laser.And in addition, as I said, we do see chances and opportunity in photovoltaic and in medical up also, mainly of course in the consumer electronic market with our ultrashort pulse processes.On the outlook 2016, you actually -- well, it looks a bit weak and does not correspond to your peer group development.Why is ROFIN showing signs of weakness in the market and what is the management doing as countermeasures here?Honestly, I can’t see that.As I think we just reported that we do see a very strong fiscal year that we expect the business will grow, even if we have the situation of the currency exchange rates.We even expect that the bottom-line means the income will grow strong top-line.And I think that the numbers we have reported in terms of that are competitive, even if you take our peer into consideration.And Thomas already mentioned that we have in management structure now somebody taking care of markets where we are not strong as of today, and we are addressing that.And as already mentioned, we’ve already begun this fiscal year with our cost reduction program and we will see there an impact of more -- at least $5 million in OpEx in ‘16 and we expect also strong 2017 because some of the projects analyzing, structuring the whole structure [Technical Difficulty].But when you say on the OpEx, you mentioned this 5 million decreasing, is this a kind of FX translation effect, you mentioned before that this is your kind of natural history?Not at all, this is really the cost what we already identified that we will be able to reduce through the year in the corresponding currencies.So, it’s independent of the impact of the exchange rate.By the way I think that over the complete fiscal year ‘16, if nothing changed dramatically, will not be so significant as in Q1 and Q2.So, maybe also some words from my side.It’s really not the currency exchange rates.Of course there is on the bottom line a little percentage [ph] with the currency exchange rate but these are real cost reductions.Cost reduction for example by merging companies as we did it -- you read that, in Switzerland for example and also here in the United States we did it very successful.It’s real cost reduction.But, I mean if this is the case, why wouldn’t you, let’s say, you have not provided these figures, let’s say, on the -- you said you improved your margins to 40% but not provided this figure on a constant currency basis or even provided the necessary details to allow stockholders to view the gross margin on a constant currency basis.Well, I don’t agree, sorry for that.But I think that we mentioned here in the call and also in the corresponding Ks the impact of the exchange rates.And when we do our guidance and our plans, I have to estimate what will be the expected exchange rate for the corresponding period for the different currencies.So, in our guidance we already have an impact from our natural hedging because we plan based on local currencies and at the end we consolidate in U.S. dollar.Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.I’ll turn the call back to management for closing comments.Thank you very much for listening and your interest in ROFIN-SINAR.If there should be any questions left on the topics we walked through, please get in touch with us.I look forward to joining you all in February, in our Q1 earnings call or maybe some of you guys, we are able to meet at the Needham conference, early January.Thanks a lot for listening again.And all the best.Have a good holiday season, if we talk again in the new calendar year.Thank you.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking
