Investor Relations page.I'm Sharon Birkett, Vice President and CFO of Multi-Color.I will be leading today's call, and I'm joined by Nigel Vinecombe, our President and CEO.I will begin with an overview of how our company performed this period and provide a detailed analysis of our financial results.Nigel will conclude with final comments, and then we will take your questions.Before we discuss our

Safe Harbor statement is also included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.For those of you who are listening and viewing our web cast via the Internet, please take a look at slide number 2, net revenues.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, net revenues increased 6% to $205.5 million from $193.5 million in the prior year quarter.Net revenues increased by $14.4 million or 7% due to acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Organic revenues increased 4%, due to a 3% increase in sales volume and a 1% favorable impact of pricing and sales mix.Revenues also decreased by 5%, due to unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the Euro.In addition, year-to-date revenues increased 15% to $810.8 million, from $706.4 million in the prior year.Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2014 accounted for 13% increase in revenue.Organic revenues increased 3% due to higher sales volumes and 1% due to favorable impact of sales mix and pricing.Foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the Euro and American currencies, and led to a decrease of 2% in revenues compared to the prior year.Please turn to slide number 3, gross profit and margin.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 gross profit increased 13% from $39 million to $44.2 million, including a $2.1 million contribution from acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter fiscal 2014.Core gross margins increased to 22% of revenues from 20% in the prior year quarter.The increase in gross margin is primarily driven by improvements in operating efficiencies in North America, South America and Asia Pacific.For fiscal 2015, gross profit increased 31% -- from $130.1 million to $173.3 million, including a small contribution from acquisitions occurring beginning of fiscal 2014 of $19.9 million.For fiscal 2015, gross margins increased to 21% of net revenues, compared to 19% in the prior year, due to improved operating efficiencies in North America, South America, and Asia Pacific.Please turn to slide number 4, operating income and margin.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, core operating income increased 9% to $25.9 million from $23.8 million in the prior year quarter.Core operating income increased due to improved operating efficiencies in North America, South America and Asia Pacific.For fiscal 2015, core SG&A increased to $11.2 million -- an increase by $11.2 million or 20% compared to the prior year, acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2014 accounted for $7.5 million of the increase.The remaining increase primarily relates to professional fees and compensation expenses.Core SG&A as a percentage of sales were 8% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we anticipate core SG&A for fiscal 2016 to be in the 8% of net revenues range.For fiscal 2015, core operating income increased $29.9 million or 39% to $107.1 million.Core operating income increased due to improved operating efficiencies in North America, South America and Asia Pacific and a strong contribution from fiscal 2014 acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2014 contributed $12.5 million to the increase of operating income.Please turn to slide number 5, net income.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, core net income increased 11% to $12.6 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by strong operating performance in North America, South America and Asia Pacific.Core net income increased 52% to $54 million for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.The core effective tax rate was 35% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to 34% in the prior year quarter.The effective tax rate on core net income was 35% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, and we expect projected tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be 35%.Please advance to slide number 6, diluted earnings per share.Excluding the impact of non-core items, core earnings per share increased 9% to $0.74 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, from $0.68 in the prior year quarter.For fiscal 2015, core earnings per share increased 50% to $3.20 per diluted share from $2.14 in the prior year.Please turn to slide number 7, free cash flow.Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 consisting of cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $30.7 million compared to $12.1 million in the prior year quarter.The increase was primarily due to stronger operating performance, changes in working capital requirements and the timing of interest payments related to bonds.Free cash flow for fiscal 2015 increased $27.5 million to $77.8 million, primarily due to the growth in operating income resulting from improved operating efficiencies.Please turn to slide number 8, core EBITDA.This slide shows core EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.Core EBITDA is defined core operating income plus depreciation and amortization.Core EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is $36.2 million compared to $34.2 million in the prior year quarter.Core EBITDA for fiscal 2015 is $148.5 million compared to $115.1 million in the prior year.Please advance to slide number 9, capital expenditure.Our fourth quarter capital expenditures were $6.5 million compared to $7 million in the prior year quarter.Fiscal 2015 capital expenditures were $29.2 million compared to $30.4 million in the prior year.Projected capital expenditure for fiscal 2016 is $44 million.Please advance to slide number 10, depreciation and amortization.Our total depreciation and amortization was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014.Total depreciation and amortization expense of fiscal 2015 was $21.3 million compared to $37.8 million in the prior year.Please turn to slide 11, debt; the company has $458.5 million of debt as of March 2015 compared to $478.2 million as of March 2014.During the last four quarters, the company has paid down $70 million in debt, and borrowed, including prior debt, $50 million in relation to acquisitions.During the last four quarters, Multi-Color has made acquisitions in Ireland and the United Kingdom.Thanks Sharon and good morning all.Our 4% organic growth continued in Q4 and we see the growth is across most region s, with North America and Western Europe continuing to show low single digit growth.And interestingly, our developing markets, such as China, Africa, South America and Poland, double digit growth continuing.As a result, the majority of our capital expenditure installations in Q1 and Q2 of FY 2016 is for more capacity in developing markets, as we forecast further strong demand there, plus we are seeing healthy margins.Overall, in Q4, gross margins are up 22%, reflects the fact that three quarters of our plans showed year-over-year quarterly improvement in fiscal 2015.SG&A was higher, at 9% of sales in Q4, due primarily to high professional fees that related to the full fiscal year, not just for quarter.We forecast SG&A to continue to be 8% of sales for fiscal 2016, as per fiscal 2015.Our improved profitability overall, up 2% of sales for the year, drove better cash flow, better returns and a lower leverage.Cash flow up over 50% year-on-year.Return on invested capital improved to a more respectable 9%, and our debt-to-EBITDA leverage reduced from 3.6 to 3 times over the year, on a pro forma EBITDA basis, including acquisitions annualized earnings.We are pleased to have made an acquisition in France in May, circa $30 million revenues per annum.This gives us market leadership now in wine there, and good improvement opportunities in this business, in fiscal 2016 for fiscal 2017.We like the French wine label market and have five years of good experience operating in it.We have also consolidated a small acquisition in food and beverage labels, in Queensland, Australia, into our existing operation there in Q1 FY 2016.Thank you.[Operator Instructions].And your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird.Please go ahead.Hey Nigel, on the volume growth of 2% for the quarter, was that in line with your expectations and can you give us a sense as to how that performed by your various end markets, you call that geographies, but how about the various product lines?Net of FX.Yes.I mean, it was up 3% volume wise for the quarter, and so that's up reasonably consistent with what we would expect.Okay, how is it looking across the different segments?I think for the home and personal care segment, it has continued to look low single digit growth in North America, and double digit growth in the developing markets.I think in wine and spirits, we see stronger growth in North America and mid-single digit growth and low single digit growth in Europe, its our next biggest market for wine and spirits.And in food and beverage, we are seeing low single digit growth.And is there anything that you can share with us in terms of the trendline for April and May?Its pretty late in the quarter, so just better check on that?North America, okay.And just one final one on the price mix, which has been consistently positive recently, at least over the last few quarters.How should we think about that for 2016 -- for fiscal year 2016, as we kind of finalize our model?Thanks so much.Okay.I think in terms of mix, I mean, it typically varies in any given year from minus one to plus one.I think the mix should continue to do -- be neutral to slightly positive, because in essence -- whilst we are seeing a bit better organic growth in the mid-single digits now than perhaps previously, we are seeing about organic growth, is somewhat curtailed by us deliberately exiting some lower margin business and replacing with high margin business.So we'd like to think that will be reflected in a healthy mix, even though it will drag our organic growth rate a little bit.Thank you for your question.Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets.Please proceed.Sharon, just a quick clarification on the free cash flow.Did I hear you right, your free cash flow this year was $78 million or so?So your core net income this year was $54 million, your free cash was $78 million, so obviously there is a significant gap between the two.Can you help us bridge that gap?Sure.I would give you some -- recent capital needs did reduce, so that's probably the biggest bucket.But you may also recall, that we took out a bond in November of 2014, and so the bond interest payments scheduled for December of 2015 and June of 2015.So there is probably a $5 million delta, just created by the bond, but none more than that.The rest of it is working capital and just the mix of our operating profits.Got it.Thanks Shannon.And with regard to fiscal 2016, what do you expect in terms of working capital, source, drag, neither?Okay.That's okay.I will wait for the K to come out.Nigel, in terms of demand that Ghansham was asking about, the segment breakdown, can you give us a regional breakdown compared to how it was -- compared to what it was three, six months ago?I know you said, North America softened in May, but can you talk about what regional trends were like in the quarter?Yes.We saw low single digit growth in North America.We saw low single digit growth in Europe, and we saw double digit growth in the developing markets.There, the developing markets are much small percentage of our revenues today, but growing strongly off that small bets.Okay.And in terms of the quarter-to-date update Nigel, any particular segment in North America that have softened a bit?I would say, our food and beverage business in our heat transfer area, last year was really going very strongly, and another stronger start to this year.Got it.I appreciate that.And just -- in terms of the gross margin from the experience in the fourth quarter, obviously on account of the better efficiencies across your regions partly related to acquisition and integration.Do you expect -- how much more of that do you expect to continue this year?Well, we still have a number of underperforming plans.They have dropped from a third to a quarter of our plans, but there are still opportunities for us to get significant improvement.But we would still suggest that people think about gross margins in that 20% to 22% range.We don't want you to be bullish, we'd rather you be conservative.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you guys would share just a couple of like 2016 or even 2017 targets ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Just kind of like return on capital, free cash flow, any sort of different metrics that are loose enough for you, not tied in, but just to give us a direction of what you're hearing from your customers?Okay.Well at least from a return on invested capital point of view, we recognize that we have been underweight in recent years.So its good to see some progress this fiscal 2015 from 7 to 9.We are looking for 10 in the year ahead, and we believe that w should be in double digits and hopefully stay there.So some progress, but more progress we make, we think we can make that progress in the coming year.In terms of growth, we've said historically 3%.We'd now say 3% to 5% organic growth range, continuing to look at that 20% to 22% gross margin range.In terms of CapEx, we mentioned a number of 44, so we would see that coming in higher in fiscal 2016, at about 5% of sales, compared to a lower than normal CapEx last year.Our free cash flow should be strong, perhaps not quite as strong this year, given the slightly higher CapEx, but certainly in the 60 plus range.Okay.And is there any sort of target there that you want to keep at around 100% of net income, or its just whatever way it flows?In terms of cash flow?We do have some NOL still, that's from the York acquisition.So we do get a little bit of a bump there, circa $4 million to $5 million.In terms of the year-over-year, its just last year that didn't drive up [ph], because we have had it for both years.But we still had another year or so to run on that, so we will get a bump from that as well.It will vary from quarter-to-quarter.But on average, we'd expect it to be in that $15 million to $20 million range per quarter.No, we haven't.We have made a plant consolidation last year in Norway and Watertown.And really we didn't see the benefit from that flow last year.We do expect some benefit this year, but we haven't quantified those.Small acquisitions, we have just made, and we will have a small benefit in the rest of the year.But nothing of substance.The other activities have really been around improving our underperforming plants and continuing to do a better job in the plants that are already doing well.And we think there is still good scope for that.Okay.So well the benefits are all sort of baked into your targets?I guess I can back into that.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And I just <b>wonder</b> if you could share with us , sort of your lay of the land in terms of acquisitions and what you 're hearing from your customers in terms of where you could add some <i>more</i> -- where your product line hauls are , or where you could sort of beef up your capabilities ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Anything you can give us in terms of end markets and geographies?Thank you.Well, I guess if you look at our acquisition history in the last half of the year, it has averaged about $100 million in revenues a year.So last year, in the mid-30s, it was lighter than the normal year for us.We will have to see how we go this year, but we would expect it to be a more normal year in terms of acquisition revenues.So it wasn't last year for sure, and we have already basically done as much as last year, with a couple of acquisitions in May.So that's looking positive, and obviously, we have got stronger position in terms of the cash flow and debt and leverage.We feel that we can support that and do more in this current year.What was the second part of the question?Well for home and personal care developing markets, we think that customers are rewarding us, as we develop our footprint into developing markets, and we believe there is more scope for that.I mean, wine and spirit area, its more a question of developing our satellite footprint in Western Europe, where most of the world's volume is, and we are still heavily underrepresented in terms of market share.And just for one last one, sorry.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you -- what 's going on in the competitive landscape ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Are you seeing any sort of -- as you're really getting a lot bigger in revenues and profits and market shares, are you seeing any of the smaller guys having more difficulty competing in some of these markets and customers becoming more demanding?I think its hard to generalize.There are so many small guys, and some will struggle and some will continue to do very well.I think, perhaps its more the medium size guys that will find life tougher over time, as large customers want to deal with larger groups and small customers wanted to be small and close to them.So I think, there will be plenty of opportunities for the small guys, and some as they have exit strategies for one reason or another, will come to market on a regular basis.I think its more the medium guys that longer term, will struggle.And then as you become more global, you think you can start to see more synergies, like better penetration with some of your more global customers?Absolutely.We have seen that, as we have developed the footprint, and we are in more places if they want us to be.We are definitely seeing the benefits of that, in terms of volume and in terms of margins that are [indiscernible] to developed markets.So we have been rewarded for that, and we hope that that will continue to be the case.Thank you for your question.[Operator Instructions].And your next question comes from the line of Greg Eisen of Singular Research.Please go ahead.Thanks.Good morning folks.Nigel and Sharon, can you talk about the foreign exchange expectations over the next quarter in June?I guess you already talked about revenues for April and May.But you know better than me, what are your expectations for foreign exchange benefit or not, as you look into the next quarter?It is a very good [ph] forecast, but basically what we have surveyed, we would think that it was inconsistent with last quarter.The only thing we'd reiterate is that, whilst it looks like [indiscernible] quite a bit, it really has no reasonable impact on the bottom line.It has less than 1% impact on EPS.So it just doesn't -- all of our risk is translational risk, and this has a very small impact at the end of the day.Net income as a percentage of sales, and you multiply that by the foreign exchange difference, you get less than 1% impact.Understood.And just regarding kind of the longer range expectations of the firm, you did a nice job in growing your core EBITDA, from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015.As you look out on a two to three year horizon, is it still reasonable to expect that you could see 20% plus in EBITDA at some point?Is that a reasonable expectation on my part, that you could get to that level?I think the target range for us is 18 to 20.So we'd like to think we can continue to improve our current position, and we will be somewhat subject to acquisitions, and what kind of acquisitions they are, and do they -- like the average.But on our current book of business, we think we can continue to make progress within that 18% to 20% range.Thank you very much indeed for your questions.I would now like to turn the call over to Nigel Vinecombe for closing remarks.Thank you.Well we certainly feel positive about the fiscal year ahead, and certainly very focused on it.And thank you for your time today.Thank you for joining today's conference ladies and gentlemen.This concludes the presentation.You may now disconnect.Have a good day.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Multi-Color Corporation released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on June 05, 2015.</div></body></html>
