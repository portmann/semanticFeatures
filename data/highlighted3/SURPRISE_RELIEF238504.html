(NYSE:NKE) | Seeking Alpha Nunez Enterprises , Teach Me To Invest (35 clicks) With Nike trading at high multiples, some investors may feel they've missed the boat.Here's why they're wrong.A history of excellence with revenue and profit growth year over year and the momentum continues.Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE ), the 51-year-old king of sports footwear and apparel, wrapped up a stellar fiscal year 2015 and recently completed first quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same profitable momentum.The business reported revenue of $8.4 billion, an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis in comparison to first quarter 2015.Net income also increased 23% to $1.2 billion and gross margin came in at 47.5%, a year over year increase of 90 basis points.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At a current P/E of 30.8 times earnings and forward P/E of 29.2 ; many may <b>wonder</b> what else can this company do to continue reaching new heights .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Despite being around for over half a century Nike categorizes itself as a growth company meaning they are nowhere near done innovating and they consider the business to be growing rapidly in relation to competitors and the economy as a whole.In this analysis, we take a closer look at some of the key strategies Nike will be incorporating in order to generate $50 billion in revenue by 2020.Nike ended fiscal 2015 with $30.6 billion in revenue, an increase of 14% in comparison to fiscal 2014.Net income also increased 22% year over year to $3.3 billion thanks to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower tax rate.Revenue has been growing at an average CAGR of 11% year over year: Taking these factors in to perspective, the goal of $50 billion by 2020 appears realistic but the company still has some serious work to do.Can they do it?Lets dive right in.Rapid Growth in Direct to Consumer Business The direct to consumer, or DTC, business has been thriving at an accelerated pace during the past several years.In fiscal 2015 alone, DTC revenue increased 29% to $6.6 billion driven by new store openings, 16% comparable store sales growth, and an eye-opening 59% surge in online sales.Direct To Consumer includes Nike owned online and factory stores as well as online sales through Nike owned websites.The chart below shows a comprehensive view of the growth in year over year sales in said category including all geographies and product lines: Source : Nike annual reports, 2011-2015.As confirmed by management, one of the reasons why gross margins reached 46% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 120 basis points in comparison to fiscal year 2014; was a result of both, higher average selling prices as well as higher margins in the DTC business.Growth plans for the DTC operations include an emphasis in the digital business including online sales, as well as an emphasis to continue sales growth in Nike-owned factory stores where Nike projects revenue will reach the $16 billion mark by end of fiscal 2020.Over the next five years, incremental growth in the DTC revenue is expected to be driven by e-commerce sales which are projected to grow to $7 billion.According to Nike's president of distribution and merchandising, Ms. Jeanne Jackson, Nike is the world's top athletic brand for women.The women segment wrapped up fiscal 2015 with sales of $5.7 billion.By fiscal 2020; Nike plans to double global sales in the women's category to reach $11 billion.One technique they plan to implement to reach said goal is expanding retail space for women across all locations and offering exclusive merchandise through their wholesale partnerships and Nike owned stores.During fiscal 2015 Nike opened approximately 173 of such designated spaces worldwide.Leveraging technology and digital venues such as training applications on smart phones, are also at the forefront of strategies designed to grow sales in this category and across the board.Applications such as Nike Training Club have recorded well over 20 million downloads offering about 100 million workouts.Studies find that a majority of the users of digital training apps are women.Nike-sponsored running and training clubs are very popular and drive traffic to online stores as well as brick and mortar locations which often server as meeting hubs for runners.At the present time, Nike has a digital community of over 70 million women around the world.Approximately 54% of the runners logging in runs in the popular Nike+ Running app are women.The popularity is not only within North America but at a global level considering that during 3rd quarter of 2015; the Nike's women's training business grew at a double-digit pace in Europe on a currency neutral basis.Nike inc. has partnerships and licensing agreements with wholesalers all over the world including Greater China, Europe, Japan and Emerging markets.The largest sales segment after North America is currently Western Europe where the business generated $5.7 billion in sales during fiscal 2015 a 15% year over year increase in comparison to the $4.9 billion generated in fiscal 2014.Over the past two years, consolidated segment revenue for locations outside of North America generated over $16 billion in sales on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2015.Segment growth in those markets have been increasing in the mid to high teens over the past two years.For developing geographies, including emerging markets, greater china, central and Eastern Europe; Nike expects to grow at a low double-digit average annual growth rate within the next five years.The emerging markets geography is expected to grow at a low double-digit average annual growth rate.Greater China is expected to grow at a mid-teens growth rate over the next five years to reach $6.5 billion in revenue by end of fiscal 2020.Most of us would agree that Nike is a phenomenal company with the kind of international brand power that many business would envy.Not only has this company remained at the forefront of its industry for over 50 years but still works hard behind the scenes to make sure they continue this momentum.While the $50 billion plan may seem ambitious to some; judging from Nike's historical performance and their clear and specified plans for growth going forward the objective appears doable.I'd keep an eye on revenue, net profit, gross margins, and specially growth within the DTC business which appears to be accelerating at a rapid pace.If you are a current shareholder of Nike sit back and enjoy the growth that is ahead.If you are still on the sidelines, take a minute to analyze the business and prospects for the future.Decide whether this would be a quality addition to your portfolio, if you decide that it is, what are you waiting for?Disclaimer: Never invest, or cease to invest, based solely on my analyst reports.Always be sure to do your own due diligence.I am currently long Nike.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
