(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>These are the elements that have contributed to the five consecutive years of positive same-store sales now and as we look to the future growth of our business it will be through this multilayered growth strategy and the successful further development and implementation of it that we see continued growth in earnings per share in a very healthy way.The momentum and the source of the momentum, this is also a consistent theme I think that you should become accustomed to over the years.As you look at the things that have driven our business over time, this kind of discussion about this flywheel in the last several years, as a matter of fact, the last three years in particular, the National Media piece has had very positive impact on that and in the process driving average unit profit, driving average unit sales and average unit profit and in turn really picking up the development activities of our company as well.So, we'll continue to talk about the momentum in our business and what drives the momentum.This framework that you see here will have application last year will this year, will next year, there are other aspects of our business I think that get a little more granular in terms of continuing to drive the momentum, but we feel very good about the momentum of our business and we feel good about this method and thinking about how we drive the multilayer growth strategy and how momentum in these aspects of our business play a role in doing so.In October, when we talked about year end, we laid this out for you, this same type of chart, the average unit volume growth and where we were for fiscal 2015 versus prior years and now where we are anticipating being for 2016 and how this plays into a little more longer term goal that we've been discussing with our franchisees for the last several years.So while we laid this out in October for our investors, we for at least the last three years have been talking to our franchise leadership about thinking about the business this way and looking to at the end of the decade, that 2020 average unit volume goal of $1.5 million.Our view of this is, is this very achievable.Why do we say that?Because the capacity is already present in Sonic for achieving this.We anticipate in the year we just finished we probably will have one drive-in that did $4 million, a conventional Sonic drive-in and we have many drive-ins in newer markets going - we are achieving -- core in newer markets achieving that $1.5 million and more.So with the media, the creative, the new products and that blade strategy, we see ourselves continuing to grow average unit volume, and it is these characteristics that contributed that 5.3% comp in the first quarter, but should also continue to do that quarter-by-quarter going forward.Now in the more recent past, the recent product and promotional activities that we've had in place have played a very significant role in continuing to drive that momentum and in turn drive the pace and success of the business.We're doing this as you would expect as we have historically by focusing on premium items, but also focusing on value and value in a Sonic way that has worked fairly well.You can see depicted on the right the percentage of sales by daypart, this too I think from an investment standpoint should be very attractive to you as it has been historically, meaning we don’t get a significant – we don’t get - the largest majority of our business is lunch and dinner like most of the QSR experiences, ours comes across these five dayparts; breakfast, lunch, afternoon, dinner and evening.So we'll continue pursuing that blade strategy.We will continue doing it with good quality and differentiated products, but we'll also do it in a promotional way that really drives value in a Sonic way that's very positive.As an example, very successful implementation of wings in the last year, but this fall and into the winter, we have wing night on Mondays, buy one get one free, and the consequence of this have been very positive, particularly on an evening during the week in which we can use the momentum of our business and we have minimal interference from our competition.We also have - being promoted in the month of January, Two Can Eat for $9.99 two meals entrée, side order, drink for $9.99, and it involves either a burger or a Footlong Coney with tots and a drink.But, again a focus on our products doing value in our way in this case, it would be a larger transaction, but good value for the consumer avoiding just the approach to cheapness that some of our competition focuses on.We will continue focusing on breakfast and some other initiatives, but will continue with our Morning Drink Stop, and of course for the last several years, our half priced Real Ice Cream Shakes after 8 o'clock have done extremely well in the spring and summer evenings.So these type of -- focusing on these good, strong products, but different ways to appeal to the customer, we are finding the customers really respond to this very well, help us drive traffic but also drive average ticket along the way.And the view of our customers is they really do crave the differentiated food but they are also willing to pay more for innovative flavors and particularly in premium categories such as chicken, ice cream, and the fountain differentiation that we offer.What we have seen over time is as we have refined our value strategy really quite different from where it was at the beginning the recession '09 and '10 we've really gotten very good scores from our customers related to value.What you see depicted here is a result of surveys of QSR customers generally by the Service Management Group.So it is a third-party survey.100 points to be average and you can see how they are liking us from a value standpoint versus our key competition the QSR sector.When they look at what they got to pay versus what they receive, so it is not just a question of cheap, it is a question of good value and we get very high marks here.And from our viewpoint it is a consequence of very concrete things we've pursued the last number of year.But the consequence of this we believe we're not only better positioned in an absolute manner, we're better positioned versus competition, better positioned than we were when the recession began five years ago and more, but better positioned versus our competition to compete with deep discounting that any of our competition might pursue because of the quality what we're offering and they way we're going about that promotional activity in which we engage.Now the very concept of momentum that we talked about earlier meaning being key to our business, we continue to focus on because we know that driving same-store sales is a key part of driving the continued growth in sales and profitability at the store level and the growth of our brand.The earlier flywheel that we have utilized in this presentation, but also utilized for years focuses more broadly on media, products, new store development and we see that continuing in our business.But what you see depicted here is a little bit more of a narrow flywheel, a flywheel related to technology and also social media initiative, one that we refer to internally as ICE, our integrated customer engagement.And it is these series of interlocking initiatives that we feel very optimistic about over the next several years because it will help us leverage some of our greatest differences that we use technology that is being embraced rapidly and broadly by consumers, but leverage it in a very differentiated way where for us every customer can customize and they've done this for years, but it will make it even simpler for those customers to customize.And because of our physical differentiation with 25 stalls at the average drive-in not only can every customer customize, but every customer can be first in line when they come to Sonic.And the combination of these I think is very powerful, particularly with the millennial population that uses these initiatives more and more.And we've seen based on CREST data, we've seen that millennials actually were getting a disproportionate share of milleninials in our business.So the utilization of this over the next several years I think will be hugely positive for our business and will be a big driver of the momentum in this more narrow way, but complement the broader drivers of momentum that slide where we talked about for so long complement that in a very positive way.Now as we continue to roll out these initiatives there continues to be good news here in terms of the implementation as it relates to software based point of sale system we now have the point of sale system in 1500 drive-ins across the Sonic system and as it relates to POPS that is moving as well slightly behind in absolute numbers but moving with 1300 stores now with POPS installed, we anticipated the completion of each of these initiatives at the end of calendar year 2017.We continue to see positive comps from the implementation of these when we look at sonic drive-ins with the implementation of POPS versus like sonic drive-in we are seeing positive comps that drive sufficient return on investment and that again is from a program piece or piece in greatly its most rudimentary stages.So evolution of that over time should play a very significant role in utilization by consumers continue to grow traffic and to grow our store level profitability.Now all of these as they grow sales and profits also make the investment in a Sonic drive-in more attractive to an existing or new franchisee.And this past quarter, the first fiscal quarter, evidenced that by new stores signed to commitment by new or existing franchisees.In other words, a year ago in the first quarter we signed up future development for 10 more stores, but in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we signed commitments for 45 new stores which puts us really on pretty good pace for what we anticipated having occur this year which is 170 or more new store commitments, so very much on track with that for the first quarter with 45 new store commitments.And the consequence of this pipeline beginning to grow like it is, so you see on this page the commitments stepping up nicely, we anticipate the impact as well from that being very positive in the next number of months and years.You can see the depiction here looking at fiscal year 2016, we anticipate spring and the summer you will see a kind of breakaway in terms of new store openings the lower portion of these bars in red last couple of years 40 and 41, we anticipate kind of breaking away from that pace that we experienced in the last couple of years with into the 2016 in the spring we'll begin to see that pace move up and with the relocation and rebuilds also picking up slightly very nice contribution to system wide sales, very nice contribution to sales and profitability for the average operator.So development playing more of a role in our story going forward and I believe in the spring you'll start seeing the moment of that pick up nicely.Now it relates to new store development, you'll become accustomed to this map given the fact that we are a domestic presence only, but we did open in the quarter our 45th store in our 45th state Rhode Island, the state motto which is Hope and so that's a great little symbol for the 45th state and the opportunity for our continuing brand.We are continuing growth of our brand.I think it is fair to say at this point that we are really very much a national brand.We may have a super regional footprint still at this point, but that means that there is great expansion opportunity available for our brand at a much lower risk than any entrepreneur would experience in developing most any other concept.So 45th state very happy this CR opening in Rhode Island, but are also very optimistic about continued growth and development of our brand.Now the last thing I want to talk about before turning it over to Claudia San Pedro, our Chief Financial Officer, is that the continuing use in a very positive way our free cash flow and how this has evolved very positively over the last several years.Our business as you know generates a pretty healthy amount of cash flow, free cash for investment in our brand, but also returning cash to our shareholders.One of the neat things about where we see ourselves now in our fiscal 2016 is we expect to return more than five times as much cash to our stockholders as we did in fiscal 2012.Now our view is we're investing nicely in our business and the areas that we see the need to do so, but we also believe that deploying our cash to purchase shares and distribute dividends is a highly effective use of our cash and we'll continue on that path in the future.So with that, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer Claudia San Pedro to discuss our results in more detail.Claudia?Thank you Cliff.Given our strong performance for the same quarter a year ago, we are very pleased to report system wide same-store sales growth of 5.3% and earnings per share growth of 33%.We are particularly proud of the fact that the same-store sales performance continues to be balanced across all of our dayparts and is driven by a mix of traffic and check, but weighted slightly more towards check.We remain on track to achieve our multiyear goals of $1.5 million in averaging of volumes for our drive-ins with our current promotional media strategy in place.As Cliff mentioned we are approaching an exciting milestone with almost half of our system with our new digital menu boards and our new POS system.The basic functionality in the digital screen continues to drive traffic in check and we're pleased with those results.Beginning this fiscal year and continuing over the next several years we will increase functionality in digital menu screens and across different technology platforms to enhance and personalize the customer experience.We expect this to be an important layer of same-store sales growth over the intermediate term.Total company operating margins improvement by 180 basis points to 17.9%.This big improvement in operating margins was fueled in part by strong company drive-in level margins.For our first fiscal quarter company drive-in margins have reached 140 basis points above our outlook for the full year.Food and packaging saw a 60 basis points improvement driven by more favorable commodity cost environment particularly in beef and dairy combined with improved inventory management from new PLF tools.This was partially offset by free and fully new program that we instituted at the company drive-in level.We continue to realized benefits as you've seen from this new improved inventory management tool that expect that this will be the last quarter where we'll see a full benefit of that if we lap implementation of that tool in the second fiscal quarter.We have locked in commodity cost for most of our larger cost items for the fiscal year and anticipate commodity cost inflation to be flat for fiscal 2016.We lapped over our price increase from last November into the small additional price increase in the month of November.With this increase we are winning approximately 3% of pricing at our company drive-ins.As Cliff discussed previously we take a very strategic approach to pricing with tiered price points for different categories emphasizing a good balance of premium products like out Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and targeted value messages such as our Monday night Wing Night in America promotion with buy one get one free boneless chicken wings.Our strong comp performance and expense controls also enabled us to leverage labor and other expenses.SG&A expenses increased 11.5% to $20.9 million in the quarter as we continue to reinvest strong topline performance against our technology initiative, particularly in increased headcount.During this fiscal year we do not expect to see leverage in this area as we continue to make brand investments in line with the performance of our business.As we look at drive-in level margins for the fiscal year we continue to expect 75 to 125 basis points of margin expansion with continued favourability on the food and paper expense line driven by lower overall commodity inflation and supply chain improvements.For first fiscal quarter margins were higher than our full year outlook as a result of higher commodity cost inflation in the first fiscal quarter of 2015.Our franchisees have seen substantial profit growth in the first quarter and we expect them to continue to post record profit numbers for the fiscal year.Their confidence is exemplified by their capital investment in our technology initiatives and in their investments in relocating, rebuilding and developing new drive-ins.With respect to our capital structure, Cliff already highlighted our increasing return of cash flow to investors a trend which we plan to build on in coming years.A key advantage of having a strong franchise business model is the predictability of our cash flow generation and moderate capital needs.This model gives us the flexibility to invest in our brand when initiatives meet our return on investment criteria and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.While we are currently slightly under our three times targeted debt levels, we are evaluating different options to increase our leverage to fund ongoing share repurchases.We plan on accessing the debt markets in the first half of calendar 2016.We ended the quarter with $36.8 million in unrestricted cash and expect free cash flow to be in the $70 million to $75 million range in fiscal 2016.We define free cash flow as net income, depreciation, amortization expense and stock comp expense less capital expenditures.This fiscal year we plan to repurchase about a $126 million of stock with $47 million of that amount already completed as of the end of this first fiscal quarter.We also expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share.With respect to capital expenditures; we expect to spend $35 million to $40 million reflecting continued investment in technology and support as we remain on track to have 100% of the system on POPS and POS by the end of calendar year 2017.This guidance includes new company owned drive-in as well as several built to suite drive-ins that we build on behalf of franchisees that we expect to sell upon completion.Our free cash flow guidance does not assume we will sell any units to franchisees, but going forward we continue to evaluate opportunities as warranted on a store-by-store and market-by-market basis.In summary, the first quarter represented a strong start to the fiscal year.We are maintaining our fiscal year 2016 outlook which we summarized on the next slide.We expect strong growth in same-store sales, modest operating leverage, favourable commodity cost and the implementation of several key technology initiatives to combine to maintain our operating momentum.We expect earnings per share growth of approximately 16% to 20% in fiscal 2016 over our adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 in 2015.These are based on the following assumptions.3% to 4% same-store sales growth, 50 to 60 new franchise drive-in openings, drive-in margin improvement of 75 to 125 basis points, SG&A expense of $81.5 million to $82.5 million, depreciation expense of approximately $45.5 million to $46.5 million, capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million and as I stated before free cash flow of $70 million to $75 million and a tax rate between 36.5% and 37.5%.I would like to make a brief comment about the recent tax legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law this past December resulting in several tax credit programs, more significant of which is implementation of the Worker Opportunity Tax Credit.This credit was reinstated retroactively to January 2015 and made effective through calendar year 2019.Because of the timing of the reinstatement we will record the full benefit of the calendar year 2015 reinstatement to fiscal year 2015 in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016.We estimate the benefit attributable from January to August of 2015 will be approximately $300,000 to $500,000.We are currently evaluating the favourable expected impact of this legislation on our full year tax rate for fiscal 2016 and plan to give an update of this during our March conference call.I wanted to follow up on the comments you made regarding premium and value in the period which sounds like both of those contributed nicely.Can you talk about if you felt like one of those was stronger than the other, if the consumer is gravitating more toward your new premium offerings or more toward your new value offerings?And then secondarily, if you have any plans, just given the influx of more value promotions from your peers, if you have any plans to change up any of your value strategy from here?Well, I think the objective of each of these, well, can be slightly different.They overlap and yet they have different objectives meaning that there are some things that we do that are aimed at our customers is more value oriented and/or needing to utilize those for different purpose, specific purpose.But as an example, our Morning Drink Stop that we implemented a couple of years ago system wide, we’ve added portions of the system before then, while very much aimed at a customer that was using convenient stores and using that discounting more so.So that was very much for that intended purpose, and it certainly was successful in driving traffic initially and then ultimately sales and profitability.So that has a different objective versus on a broad basis, the concepts of affordability for everyday use.So, we may do certain things on a periodic basis, and I don’t care to discuss which ones and why, although I'll kind of talk about the why a little bit and not which ones necessarily relate to that, but maybe there are things that we do periodically to affect a broad customer perception value, so we want to continue to focus on customization and quality of food, and yet positively impact the customer in terms of affordable for everyday use, but avoid doing, avoid achieving that by simply having cheap food every day.So as we’ve watched and end of the recession and afterwards with changing pricing and laddering of products and appropriate pricing in that laddering, and then the nature of promotion, we’ve seen our value scores do very well and doing well with the mix of high quality full price, but then also customers using us for these dayparts or occasions where they’re more sensitive to price.So we are - there is no doubt we are kind of trying to have our cake and eat it too, but we seem to be achieving that pretty well.Got it.And just a quick follow-up if I could on commodities, you mentioned that was down nicely year-over-year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was just <b>wondering</b> sort of what the changes were sequentially , it sounds like most of your food basket was down a little bit sequentially , but I saw you ticked up just slightly , so I did not know if there was a little bit <i>more</i> sort of targeted value in it that drove that up , just a little bit or if there was something else going on either seasonally or something else ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Thank you.Claudia and Cliff, with respect to the guidance, I guess should we view this as prudent conservativeness early in the year or is this somewhat of an expecting of a little bit of a slowdown, the 2% to 4% was the standing guidance before, but obviously you just lapped the second hardest of your compares, an 8% you have 11.5% now, you are lapping, but certainly the fiscal second half gets significantly easier on a comparison basis.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm just <b>wondering</b> how we should look at the 2 % to 4 % range guidance after putting up a 5 % if that is just purely being conservative or is there something within the model that 's driving today 's comp that you anticipate maybe losing momentum in the back half of the year ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Well, a couple of things on that Matt, one is we’ve tried to and I think we have, and I’m not saying anything you don’t know, and that is we try to provide framework for where we see the business going over the next several years and how we’re going to get there and provide that in a pretty broad sort of way.And that of course the name store is the $1.5 million AUV at the end of the decade.To achieve that, we need to average like a 3.7% that was at the beginning of the fiscal year, but we need to average a 3.7% comp year-by-year, you could say quarter-by-quarter in order to achieve the $1.5 million into the decade.This is why we talk in terms of the 2% to 4% range.If we hit that 2% to 4% range, we can get to high teens, 20% even better perhaps if we are at the higher end of that 2% to 4% range.We can get to the 20% and better earnings per share growth, and so this does not anticipate slow momentum.From my standpoint, to sustain positive comps, you've got to have continuing momentum in the business.So, I don’t think of that as slowed anyway, but the fact that we are continuing given that guidance you should not interpret negatively, the momentum we had last fiscal year has continued into this year, last winter we had hit.So last winter would have been going out of 2014 into 2015 calendar year, and we hit a period of time where we were I think three years into our national media, two to three years into a better product pipeline that included more food -- much more foods than we had promoted historically.And so, as we moved out of the summer with focus on drinks, ice cream, treats, et cetera, and into the fall, autumn, and winter where consumers rather naturally moved to some heavier foods and so on, we were better positioned than we had been historically to leverage that.So with good weather a year ago, great promotions, good media, nice product lines, new chickens, et cetera, lot more chicken I should say chickens [indiscernible], the chicken products for snack usage, varying meal usage, but we now move into this winter with a premium chicken sandwich at $5.99, much more attractive sandwich, much more expensive sandwich something much more like you would see at a casual dining restaurant.So I’m not, we’re not suggesting slowing, and we’re not, what we’re trying to give you is a framework for continuing growth of the brand at the unit level and as a system and at the same time remaining very optimistic about customers embracing us more fully across multiple dayparts for a whole variety of purposes.So we’re feeling good about the business.That’s extremely helpful, I appreciate that.I guess along those lines and historically when weather has been disruptive, you’ve called it out and sort of ring fenced it on how much of an impact it has.Should we view that there was little commentary if any about the Texas ice storms and the El Nino effect I guess in late December there with respect to your Texas stores that that was not meaningful enough to call out, so it’s not going to have an impact?Two reactions, one is December is in the winter quarter and we’re reporting on the first quarter, so that’s a primary thing, but the fact is the ice storms of recent have not been a material issue for this quarter.Well, thank you.Just two quick questions.One to follow up on an earlier one and it’s one that we consistently hear.Given this favourable cost environment it seems like it’s enabling a lot of the brands in this segment to make some pretty aggressive value offers, so a lot of them starting for example this week right.And I just want to ask just to be clear, you’re having tremendous success across the dayparts across the products, platforms et cetera does it worry you at all to see the industry start getting so aggressive at these value price points that are all exceedingly launching right now, yes I'll start there?Thanks.Okay.So, you can go about this in a couple of ways Keith.Would I rather have no competition, well maybe so, although competition makes you work harder, whenever there is no competition that is not going to happen.So I have to accept that there is competition.Would I really have competition pursuing a strategy rather that competition pursuing no strategy at all, probably so but that’s not going to happen.So would I rather have competition pursuing a strategy that’s a strong contrast to our own where it’s much more about price and perhaps depending upon the circumstances even some commoditization of their business.I’m not saying that is the case with many of them, it’s not the case, but would I would rather have pursuing prices and differentiation instead of service and quality differentiation, the answer to that is yes, I'd rather have them pursue that.This is a structural one on the POPS this is, tremendous success having this program really and rightly big upticks in units each quarter recently and tremendous success in comps across the brand.So you mentioned earlier that the sales look is of there are showing very nice returns.As we try to think about that cadence of contribution is, as the number of units kicks up, how do we think about the contribution from POPS,?It is clearly having some good impact, so when we try to think about modelling in the cadence of that rollout, could you add some colour about the impact it is having or is it hard to differentiate from all the other good things that are happening at the same time?Well, you've raised a very interesting point in your last comments about the hard to differentiate, because at any given point in time we don’t ever look to just one thing is driving our business and any attempt to really describe at that way I think is misunderstands the way that we approach the business.As it relates to POPS though it will be difficult for you over time, I think to try to isolate that initiative and say – see they had a 5% comp, 2.5 was because of POPS because that the role that is going to play as we talk about the momentum in our business, about the flywheel, historically we would talk about television media, but and in two and three years from now your question is almost going to have to go to how many people are have, have adopted our app, how many people joined a loyalty program, how many people what percentage of our business is now coming from web based payment methods say as opposed to cash, as opposed to credit cards on line.So all of these thinks tie so well as it relates to use of technology and so we may come out in a period of time where we have a very effective promotion at some point because of the product or because of the pricing.And yet the ability to separate that from POPS, gee we sell this many online and yes they were depicted on POPS as opposed to folks who ordered off lot and may not have ordered that product.So, I think it’s going to become more and more difficult, not less difficult.The fact we get rolled out across the system only means we'll be able to use it more effectively and that will relate to check on line but it can also relate to effective use of the app off lot.It can also relate to the degree of gifting and gift certificates have become more successful because you’re flashing the ad in their face after they've ordered or once they bought they had the food delivered.So, I think it’s going to become more difficult.That’s not the answer you will prefer.Is this the answer we prefer because these things link together and there is no one thing that we rely on.We don’t worry about the winter quarter because there is not one thing we're relying on to drive the winter quarter which I believe to be the case today, even though and people may think it’s just whether its not, it is media, it is product, it is value proposition that people see getting stronger, its POPS on live in 1300 stores now helping with average check.So these things – they will get more, they will get less transparent not more.And by the way, I can say they'll get less transparent to us too.We'll try to understand it, but I think all these things will work.It’s not as though we'll be able to keep it secret, that’s not the point.Point is you have more drivers and you weave in with the way people live more effectively.In light of all this recent sales success you’re having, what is it Cliff that keeps you up at night related to sustaining the comp momentum at Sonic specifically, is it were oil driven economies go from here or is it intensifying competition you are seeing just share more thoughts on that will be helpful?Well, I have been with our company for a little than 30 years and I have been CEO better than 20 years.And one thing that has been fascinating to see is the cycles over time because rarely do we have one good year and then that's it, because we always focus on this flywheel and these multiple initiatives that one leverages the next and so when I look where - I mean fiscal year 15 was exceptional year and I mean that in a generic sense, it was just a great year.But I don’t look at 15 has being an isolated experience.I see the things that drove it and then when I look at the next several years of Twentieth century business model working very well, moving into a Twenty First century business model that we're in process of implementing and then leveraging.I feel better about the business then I felt in 30 years or 20 years as CEO so, I mean it’s always a challenge.When you talk about moving into the Twenty First century and all that with the technology, one question is, is the app and how that ties into the POP systems, when will that be rolled out to the system and when will consumers start to actually be able to use the app?We anticipate that we'll begin promoting more actively later in the fiscal year our app.I mean the app is there and it exists, but it doesn’t exist in the state that we want and then need and expert for it to be and of course it will be become more vibrant, it’s a better term than that, robust, it will become more robust over time.But we anticipate later in the fiscal year beginning actual promotion of that on a very broad public basis and then hope, expectation, adaptation and utilization growing thereafter.Thanks.Good afternoon.Two quick questions from me.Cliff if you look out to the 2020, $1.5 million AUV goal what would be the long term impact on profitability, whether it’s still be a 17% to 18% store level margin or would that change in some way?So Nicole, I think that from our perspective we still continued to think that there is room for improvement.To give you an exact range is somewhat challenging because we know that we’re going to be facing increased wage pressure over the next few years.So what we feel confident about is that over the next few years we can get to over 17%, 18% to give you again an exact number, I don’t think we'll feel comfortable at this time because they are a couple of moving parts that we're going to have to look to.I can tell you that our multiyear goal under that $1.5 million AUV is about on an absolute basis about $200,000 an average unit profit for system drive-in profitability.Alright, that’s actually very helpful.Thank you.And then looking at the, the price conversation earlier 3% price is traffic more or less 2.3% more or less or is there some kind of mix impact?So there is a little bit of a mix impact there.What you'll see is, we had less traffic this past fiscal quarter than we’ve had over the past, over fiscal year 2015.So what we saw was that the impact of price that positive product mix shift, particularly if you look at promotions we had in line and that's for the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich at 5.99 and reintroduction of our Boneless Chicken Wings in the 6, 12 and 24 piece size, those have all driven higher product mix shift which we think is really positive, because what we’ve seen in association with that is not only increased sales of those higher premium products, but also increased number of size going out with them and [indiscernible].Thank you.Just a couple of questions on sales and may be a couple of costs, but on the sales side isn’t this when the unique times where there are - transparency on the POPS versus the non-POPS stores, I mean just looking at the comps in the POPS stores versus the non-POPS stores can you share those with us?So, the answer to, it is in point in time with the greater transparency or at least visibility, the answer is yes, this will be a movement in time where there is the greatest visibility because we’re using it in such a rudimentary way and it will become much more nuance over time Joe.So the answer to your question where you asked a question, can we see it more clearly than we might be able to see down the road if we have more nuanced elements, the answer is probably yes.Then your question will be, okay do we know that number?And the answer to that is, yes we know that number.And then the question is going to be, do we share that number and the answer is no we don’t share that number.So it’s how much of it is POPS overall?I mean we could back into it, but there is no reason for us to do that and it will be a continuing contributor for years, but the answer is it’s positive of now and it’s positive enough that our vendors were happy to go and invest with us, to roll it out and pay for it, they will be invested across, be implemented across the system and our operators are taking it in month-by-month.Okay.I guess from the fact that company operated comps drove the franchise comps and the company stores all have the POPS makes it a little puzzling and if you could maybe address that that might be helpful?Yes, well in a - and I guess in a purely linear sort of fashion, you might expect otherwise, the fact is our market that accounts for almost a quarter of the system sales that are doing the best in terms of comps right now are those that don’t yet have POPS or POS, those would be our developing markets and they have been experiencing the strongest comps in the system.So this is a part of it.They are lower AUV, but they are healthy now, they’re lower AUV portion of system that’s experiencing stronger comps, so some of that kind of disguises that.Those are - that’s probably one of the single largest factor Joe.Hi and Joe going forward you really don’t expect our company drive-ins to outperform our franchisees as we continue implementing POPS and POS in our franchise system and we are saying that we continue to see the benefits so we’ll – no we don’t expect to see them outperforming franchisees.To Cliff’s earlier point as we implement the mobile apps, increased functionality on POPS screens and while we have good visibility right now on just what we have out there in the system it won’t become a lot more nuanced.Okay.And then just a couple of questions on cost, so I think the food cost outlook actually went from deflationary to flat for the year, so is that because of some of the factor improvements that you have planned or is this something that happened in the commodity markets that moved in that direction?It’s not anything significant.I mean what we said I believe is flat to slightly negative, so I don’t think there is anything significant there.It’s just some things that moved around, but nothing of note.Okay.And then Claudia I think you may have addressed this in the formal remarks, but this new healthcare plan and the new installable bonus plan is all that kicking in January and should that be a year-over-year cost benefit on both counts?So in January the new healthcare plan will come into effect, so we should start to see the benefit of that in the second fiscal quarter.We’re still working on refining the compensation model, so that maybe more towards, no we haven’t decided the timing of that.So that should come into play.So we’ll see – I think again our expectation is still our outlook remains the same for the fiscal year with most of that 75 to 125 basis points coming from food and packaging and other expenses with just a little bit of leverage from labor.Yes I’m sorry.One more just on Texas and the energy markets anything to call out in that regard from a sales standpoint?Thanks, could just a couple of follow-ups please.One is just on the comments on leverage in talking about looking at debt, you’re close to the - I think you’re under but still very close to 3 turns, so it wouldn’t seem like there is much room to add to that.So is 3 a long-term target and you’re happy to go above it in the short to intermediate term, is that what you’re trying to signal or is it otherwise I think by my calculation only a tenth or two tens of a turn below it?I mean, I think from our perspective John, we’re comfortable at that three times range.So the question then becomes, we believe in our business, we believe it’s going to grow over time and our EBITDA is going to continue to allow us to naturally de-lever.So then the question just becomes how do we pace and sequence that.So I think whether we’re at three times, whether we’re at a little over three times and naturally de-lever, it’s that what we look at, we also look at the fact of as we look at the state of our business, our targeted debt ratio and what are the opportunities that we have to return cash to shareholders.So what is that range?I mean some companies talk about a range instead of a plain estimate like, a turn or two range 4 to 6 times, 3 to 5 whatever it is, is there a range then you are thinking about versus the point you can share with us?When you take on the leverage going to bump up above it and when you operate well and reduce it over time.We’re going to hit periods of time where we will blow it and at the point will – yes that kind of range is slightly below and then a little above.Claudia mentioned 3 to 3.5, once you take that step you've got to step up or you're deleveraging, start deleveraging immediately so… Okay, could I – if I could just do as what is just on development you talked about stepping up to this run rate of 50 to 60 units, is that carry through to 2017 and what I mean by that is that the run rate in 2017 will therefore be appreciably higher, can you talk about what you expect at this early stage where 2017 run rate of new units are given what you are seeing in that pipeline?Yes, we haven’t given a number on that, but the objective is to have the rate of growth pick up year-by-year.So not just add to a number, but have the percentage growth rate pick up year-by-year.Your objective would be over time to push forward that 3% on a net basis, but that will be a multiyear build.Got it.And then just last of this it may be just a higher level answer to the question, but you talked about how POPS gets rolled out, it’s going to be more nuanced in terms of telling what the difference is, what the contribution is that from, so what are the functions that are going to be added that make it harder to track?Is it all more App based that tracks back to the POPS where their functions what is that make that harder, what are the bigger things that get added to the system later this year?So John, as an example for instance, when we rollout the mobile App, our mobile app will be applicable to the majority of our drive-ins whether not they have POPS or POS.So the benefit of having that mobile app will not be dependent on having the digital menu board in your drive-in.So that’s where it becomes a little more nuanced as compared to, as we increase, we will have increased functionality on our digital menu screens in our POPS locations and those would obviously only apply to drive-ins that have POPS so in that situation they would only see those benefits in POPS locations.So while we're looking at those and we’re seeing internally from our perspective, we from a market perspective our goal is again to continue to drive to 2% to 4% same store sales on an annualized basis driven by these multiple initiative but that’s were becomes little more new ones because unlike our other initiatives that you can say, look it’s a – this one applies to all, this one is being saved again.We’re going to be in the process of implementing multiple initiatives that have different impacts depending on what they are and what it could mainly have.Does that make sense?I’d like to start off with, can you just tell me where you are in terms of what you’re seeing on wage rate inflation and turnover?And then also have you given any thought or had any conversations with your franchisees as you to what could happen with [indiscernible] the NORB [ph] and the joint employer type change?So, a couple of things on wage rate pressure, from a company drive-in perspective we have not seen any significant wage pressure and again we know it’s coming but we haven’t seen anything significant and that may be we believe in great part due to the fact where our footprint is.Two, we know that our franchisee is depending on the markets there and seeing a little bit more of that and so we’re monitoring that.From a turnover basis as a result of we’re not seeing any major wage pressure at this time we're not seeing anything significant on the turnover, on our employee turnover.Our overall multiyear goal again as we work towards getting to $1.5 million AUV is we have been starting last year as you know been making investments in our human capital at the drive-in level so we can not only prepare for this but make sure that were in a good position to overtime decrease turn over and build a strong workforce and a good strong bench.With respect to the NORB [ph] at this point we are not doing anything with franchisees are waiting to see were letting it work through the process.We’ve had normal discussion with franchise leadership.We have not had formal engagement with franchisees on a broad basis on that topic, but private discussions with franchise leadership as a group because we do have formal structure with them but no action or plan to discuss with you today.No I think that 1% closure rate is a good way to think about the number of drive-ins that we’ll be looking at every year.And can you share a little bit in terms of what your daypart – what the percentage growth was by daypart?We don’t ordinarily discuss that and we probably won’t today either, but I would say that with the variety of products we promote and the manner in which we promote them has resulted in positive daypart growth this past quarter all dayparts and for roughly for the last two years we’ve seen, well as a matter of fact in the last two years we have seen it, but even month-by-month roughly for the last two years, we’ve seen positive daypart growth for all dayparts.I should say positive growth for all dayparts.And within your food and packaging saving leverage, can you give us a little bit of a breakdown between how much of that is coming from lower food cost and how much is coming from just overall better management through the POS system?You know I think when we look at it, I would probably tell you about at this point, it’s skewed a little bit more towards the commodity cost just because they were so high in the first fiscal quarter of 2015, but again still seeing very good improvement from our inventory management tool.And then as I will say, we have to partial offset this past fiscal quarter with approximately about 30 to 35 basis points from implementation of our employee meal program.I'll just ask two quick, just two quick follow-ups.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Cliff , you mentioned developing markets have been a big driver because of some of the comps , I was <b>wondering</b> if you can parse out at all the spread between what you 're seeing from developing markets and roughly how many stores at this point are in that developing market comp base ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So the sales of the system are something more than 20% from developing markets.We do not ordinarily break out comps by market type.I would tell you that in the last quarter that all market types were positive from a sales standpoint and last fiscal year all types of markets were positive from a comp standpoint, so they’re all healthy, but we don’t break that out and so.And part of the thing is at any given point in time based on the maturity and the circumstance of those stores and the initiatives that are underway even local promotions et cetera, there could be variable results and it doesn’t mean that the brand is unhealthy in a different market just because comps are different, so we don’t – we've had those initiatives quite intentionally based on market type and so, but we don’t break that out on a quarterly or annual basis.Okay.And then follow-up question for Claudia, how much was the benefit year-over-year from the inventory management tool that you'd now be I guess lapping as you go forward?Okay.And did you get the full benefit of that starting in Q2 last year or did it kind of ramp up as you went through?It ramped up a bit, so we started to see the benefit of that in the second fiscal quarter, the first - the third fiscal quarter was the first full quarter where we saw a full quarter benefit.Thank you.I think that was the last question.So I want to thank all of you for participating today.I will be available hereafter for questions that you have.But we felt very good about the first quarter and feel good about the momentum of the business.So we’ll look forward to speaking with you along the way and it should be a good ride.So thanks for being onboard.Take care and happy New Year.And again that does concluded today's conference call.Thank you all for your participation.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.Error in this transcript?Let us know .</div></body></html>
