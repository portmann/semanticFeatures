(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Read my lips (or my typed words) once more, Greece will not exit or be forced to leave the euro.Back in 2010 if Greece did leave the euro, then all of Europe would have fallen apart and we would have had a financial mess of biblical proportions on our hands.Because back in 2010 sovereign interest rates were breaking records to the upside.And if Greece did go back to the drachma, then the market would have forced Italy, Ireland, Portugal and perhaps even Spain to do go their own way also.However if Greece exits the eurozone today, it would not matter much.All European countries are able to meet funding needs, both for rolling over debt and for fiscal purposes.So the market as I see it does not worry about Europe falling apart if Greece leaves the eurozone.Not only that, but there is no country in Europe today, with interest rates so low, that has any incentive to leave the eurozone, Greece included.So if a Grexit won't tear Europe apart, why doesn't the EU force Greece to exit?Well, basically there is no benefit for anyone.I mean Greece will instantly default on all of its debt, and at the same time Europe will have a humanitarian catastrophe on their hands.No one wants to see this and no one wants to be the one responsible for provoking it.Many months ago in the Greek press I wrote that when the new SYRIZA government gets elected there is a chance that the ECB will curtail ELA funding from Greek banks, which will be devastating for the Greek economy.In addition, if the SYRIZA government insists on its insane policies, the economy will deteriorate to such an extent that the Greek government will eventually default on pensions and government workers.If this happens (and the chances are increasing by the day), it will be devastating to the Greek economy as a whole and it will bring Greece many years back.Well as it turns out, the situation is so bad in Greece at the moment that the above scenario is probably the best thing going for Greece.How so?The reason is simple.The longer this government stays in place, the more damage it will do to the Greek economy in the long term.In fact, I think that the damage done to Greece will be multiple times the damage if ELA funding is stopped temporarily than if this government stays in place for another twelve months.Think of it, say the government gets the funding to stay afloat, so what?Will the SYRIZA government implement free market reforms so as to entice investment so unemployment levels come down?Will the market trust this government, so as to bring back the 100 billion euros that have vanished from Greek banks?The answer is no.These people are Marxists and they intend to govern Greece with a iron "left wing" fist if it's the last thing they do.Therefore, in my mind, the faster this government falls the less overall damage they will do.And after they fall, a new government can come to power and we can get on with our lives.Because if this government stays in power for another year or so, they will cause so much damage, that it will be irreversible.Now assuming the above scenario takes place, where does that leave the Greek banking system and especially the National Bank of Greece (NYSE: NBG )?Well like I said on my last take on NBG, the biggest problem is liquidity not capital.I mean, in my mind capital is also an issue, but I will give the benefit of a doubt to the company's balance sheet for now.But assuming ELA funding is curtailed or even cut off at some point - due to a re-pricing of Greek bank collateral by the ECB - then I have to assume that NBG will be 100% nationalized, with shareholders and other debtors totally wiped out as a result.Now I have also been on the record saying that ELA funding will not be cut off; however I never expected this government to act so irresponsible either.I mean at some point, if this government insists on this insanity, ELA funding will eventually be curtailed by the ECB.And if that happens, temporarily at least, the Greek economy will be in a tailspin and Greek banks will be totally worthless.Whatever happens in the short term, my view is that the longer the SYRIZA government stays in power the more damage it will do to Greece and the Greek economy longer term.In fact, my view is that if this government stays in power for another year, the damage will probably be irreversible.As such, I prefer short the term pain of Greece temporarily getting cut off from the ECB, or the government not being able to pay government workers and pensioners.However what I think is good for Greece in the short term, is very bad for Greek banks.Because of the above scenario takes place, then the entire Greek banking system will probably be worthless and shareholders will take a total loss.Source: The Best Option For Greece Is The Catastrophic Option Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
