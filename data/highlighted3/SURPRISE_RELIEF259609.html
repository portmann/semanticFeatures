(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The island does not have access to Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which governs municipal insolvencies and allows public entities including cities, towns and municipal agencies to file for bankruptcy restructuring.An existing bill to extend bankruptcy protections to Puerto Rico has made little headway in Congress so far; neither has a proposal to improve the island's federal healthcare funding.The Obama administration has urged lawmakers to help Puerto Rico, but influential Republicans in Congress, which the party controls, have opposed the idea.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch is among Republicans who have said there can be no help for Puerto Rico without better financial disclosure.House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said Democrats wanted the Puerto Rico issue included in the spending bill to fund U.S. government agencies and the military through fiscal 2016, or in a bill to deal with a number of expired business tax breaks.As talks over the $1 trillion U.S. spending bill dragged on, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said on Tuesday they would seek to pass a stop-gap spending bill to avoid a government shutdown early on Saturday.[L1N13X198] What’s Next: Tomorrow’s Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
