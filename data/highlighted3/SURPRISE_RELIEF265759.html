International Q4 Earnings Conference Call.My name is Chris and I will be your conference moderator for today.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. David Asai.Sir, you may proceed.Thank you, Chris.Good afternoon everyone.For your convenience, we’ve posted the text of today’s prepared remarks in the Investor Relations section of our website.Go to www.learningtree.com/investor.I am David Asai, Chief Financial Officer of Learning Tree International.First, I will read the disclaimer on forward-looking statements and then discuss our performance in our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015, which ended October 2, 2015.Richard Spires, our CEO, will provide information on our future plans and then Max Shevitz, our President, will provide some forward-looking information about our first quarter fiscal 2016.After those remarks, we’ll open the floor for questions and discussion.As a reminder, the statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on Learning Tree.Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of Learning Tree.There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Learning Tree will be the same as those anticipated.Learning Tree cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied or projected by such forward-looking statements.Investors should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements since they are based on key assumptions about future risks and uncertainties.Some of the factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today with the SEC that could affect us include risks associated with: changing economic and market conditions; the timely development, introduction and customer acceptance of our courses; competition; international operations, including currency fluctuations; technology development and new technology introduction; efficient delivery and scheduling of our courses; a majority of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by our Chairman and his spouse; adverse weather conditions, strikes, acts of war or terrorism and other external events; attracting and retaining qualified personnel; reliance on key vendors for technical services and support; and the U.S. Government’s ability to continue to resolve its budgetary issues and avoid disruptions.Learning Tree is not undertaking any obligation to update forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments or changed circumstances.In order to help the reader assess the factors and risks of our business that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, we discussed in the Form 10-K, those risks in Item 1A, Risk Factors.Please read the Form 10-K, including Item 1A, which is filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s Internet site, www.sec.gov.Before discussing our results, I would like to remind everyone that we follow a 52 or 53-week fiscal year.This means that our year-end and quarter-end dates are the Friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter.This method is used in order to better align our external financial reporting with the way we operate our business.Since all courses have a duration of five days or less, and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week, under the 52 or 53-week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place.Accordingly, our fiscal year 2015 ended on October 2, 2015 and, as with most years, it comprised 52 weeks.Fiscal year 2014 ended on October 3, 2014 and comprised 53 weeks.The additional training week for fiscal year 2014 occurred in the fourth quarter.As previously reported, we completed the sale of our subsidiary in France, Learning Tree International S.A., to Educinvest SPRL.The sale resulted in a loss of $2.5 million.This loss plus the results of operations for Learning Tree France included in the 12-month period ended October 2, 2015 and the three and 12-month periods ended October 3, 2014, respectively, have been reclassified to the income/loss from discontinued operations line on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.In addition, historical Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow amounts for Learning Tree France have also been reclassified as discontinued operations.Unless noted, the following discussions reflect comparisons of our continuing operations which exclude Learning Tree France.Now, let me summarize some key line items from our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.Revenues in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were $25.6 million, a decrease of 14.7% compared to revenues of $30 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Our gross profit percentage in our fourth quarter was 46.3% of revenues, compared to 46.4% in our same quarter of fiscal 2014.Operating expenses decreased in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 to $11.1 million, compared to $13.7 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Net income for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $0.7 million.During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold our headquarters office building realizing a $6.3 million gain.After combining the result of this transaction with our operating results, net income in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $6.8 million.And income per share on a diluted basis for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $0.06, compared to $0.52 in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Reviewing our performance for our full fiscal year 2015, I’d like to point out the following key line items.Revenues were $94.9 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $12.2 million or 11.4% from revenues of $107.1 million in fiscal 2014.Gross profit was 41.2% of revenues for fiscal 2015, compared to 41.3% for fiscal 2014.Operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were $48.8 million, or 51.4% of revenues, compared to $52.3 million for fiscal 2014, or 48.9% of revenues.Loss from operations before other operating items was $9.7 million for fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of $6.0 million for fiscal 2014.And finally, net loss for fiscal 2015 was $9.8 million, compared to a net loss of less than $0.1 million for fiscal 2014.Results for fiscal year 2014 include the $6.3 million gain on the sale of our headquarters office building.Net loss per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2015 was $0.74 compared to net income per share of less than $0.01 for fiscal 2014.Now, let’s discuss our fourth quarter revenues in more detail.In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, our revenues of $25.6 million were 14.7% lower than our revenues of $30 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2014.This principally resulted from a 10.9% decrease in the number of participants and a 4.3% decrease in the average revenue per participant when compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased revenues 3.6%.Overall, during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we trained a total of 16,080 course participants, compared to 18,043 course participants in our same quarter last year.Compared to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, attendee-days of IT training decreased by 19% to 32,291 from 39,890; attendee-days of management training decreased by 18.4% to 19,062 from 23,371; and total attendee-days of training were 51,353, a decrease of 18.8% from 63,261 in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Next, I’ll discuss our operations in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and how they compare with our same quarter of fiscal 2014.During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we presented 1,441 events, a 16.2% increase from the 1,240 events conducted during the same period in fiscal 2014.Cost of revenues was 53.7% of revenues in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 53.6% in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and our gross profit percentage accordingly was 46.3% compared to 46.4% in our prior year.The change in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily reflects the combined effects of a 4.3% decrease in revenue per participant and a 4% decrease in cost per participant.The decrease in the revenue per participant and cost per participant was driven primarily by the introduction in fiscal 2015 of one-day intensive boot camp courses.Changes in foreign exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentage, since exchange rate changes affect our cost of revenues by approximately the same percentage as they affect our revenues.During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, course development expense decreased by $0.1 million to $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2014.Course development expense was 6.8% of revenues in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 6.1% in the same quarter of fiscal 2014.In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we introduced one new multi-day IT course title, three new multi-day management course titles, and 67 one-day boot camp courses.We did not retire any course titles in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.Our library of instructor-led courses numbered 345 course titles at the end of our fourth quarter 2015, which was comprised of the following: 122 multi-day IT course titles at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared with 117 multi-day IT course titles at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; 70 multi-day management course titles at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to 62 at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and 153 one-day boot camp course titles at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to no such courses at the end of the same quarter of fiscal year 2014.In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, our sales and marketing expense decreased by $1.7 million to $4.6 million from $6.3 million in the same quarter last year.The decrease was primarily the result of decreased direct marketing costs.General and administrative expense during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $4.8 million, a $0.8 million decrease from the $5.5 million spent in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.The decrease primarily resulted from reduced staffing salary and benefit costs.During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized a $6.3 million gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters located in Reston, Virginia.In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded income from operations of $0.8 million, or 3% of revenues, compared to income from operations of $6.6 million, or 22% of revenues, in the same quarter of our fiscal 2014.Income from operations in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 included the $6.3 million gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters facility.In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014, we had other expense, net of less than $0.1 million, respectively.Pre-tax income in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $0.8 million compared to pre-tax income of $6.6 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.The income tax provision for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was less than $0.1 million, compared to a benefit of $0.2 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Net income for our fourth quarter was $0.7 million, or 2.9% of revenues, compared to net income of $6.8 million, or 22.8% of revenues in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.During our fiscal year 2015, the total of our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.9 million to $17.9 million at October 2, 2015 from $29.9 million at October 3, 2014.This decrease primarily resulted from cash used in operations of $9.5 million, capital expenditures of $2.3 million, and the negative effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million.I will now turn the call over to Richard Spires, our CEO, to discuss some current developments for fiscal year 2016.Thank you, David.This is Richard Spires, the new Chief Executive Officer of the company.I am very pleased to take on this leadership role of the company that has had such a meaningful impact in helping improve the skills of millions of IT professionals over the past 40 plus years.As we move into fiscal year 2016, Learning Tree’s objective is to grow our position as a leading worldwide provider of training and workforce development to IT professionals and managers and to become the provider of choice for large national and multinational companies, medium-sized companies and government organizations.To that end, we recently introduced IT Workforce Optimization Solutions, a comprehensive suite of services to support IT organizations in: defining organizational structure, processes, and job roles; assessing current staff skills and abilities; and implementing process and performance improvements by enhancing the skills and abilities of staff.IT Workforce Optimization Solutions augments and enhances our core training capabilities by enabling Learning Tree to partner with our customers in helping them develop a high-performing organization through workforce development and process improvement.While we are expanding our services through Workforce Optimization Solutions, we will continue to work to provide the highest standards of excellence in educating and training IT professionals and managers throughout the world.We believe these standards have driven and will remain the basis for our long-term success.Our course participants have consistently rated Learning Tree instructors and courses at the top end of the scale because of the quality of our courseware, our instructors and our technology for instructional delivery.We have 605 course instructors located around the world who are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge.Our average instructor has over 20 years of hands-on, real world experience in the fields that they teach.In terms of the quality and innovations in instructional delivery, we offer our patented MagnaLearn Instructional Enhancement System, AdaptaLearn Hands-On Learning System, After-Course Instructor Coaching, Computing Sandbox for Practice and Experiments, and our AnyWare e-Learning platform which extends the full range of Learning Tree features and standards to our online participants, so that they enjoy the same results as our in-class participants.Now, let me turn it over to our President, Max Shevitz, to address our projections for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.Thank you, Richard, and welcome to the company.Because we conduct approximately half of our business in currencies other than US dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect revenues and expenses when translated into dollars.If the exchange rates of December 1, 2015 remain constant for the remainder of our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we would expect changes in foreign exchange rates to unfavorably affect revenues by about 4.1% in our first quarter compared to our same quarter of fiscal 2015.For our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we currently expect revenues of between $19.4 million and $20.4 million, compared to revenues of $24.4 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2015.We expect a gross profit percentage in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 of between 36.7% and 37.7% compared to 43.7% in our first quarter of fiscal 2015.We expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal 2016 to be between $10.8 million and $11.4 million, compared to $12.1 million in the same quarter a year earlier.As a result of the above factors, we expect to incur a first quarter operating loss of between $3.1 million and $4.3 million compared with an operating loss of $1.4 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2015.We expect first quarter other expense, net to be less than $100,000.Overall, we expect to report pre-tax results for our first quarter of fiscal 2016 of between a loss of $3.1 million and a loss of $4.4 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $1.2 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2015.The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the US makes our effective tax rate subject to significant fluctuation depending on small changes in our pre-tax income.As a result, we no longer provide guidance on our next quarter’s effective tax rate.Does your guidance for Q1 include any impact from the Federal budget bill presuming that it might pass?And could you talk about, in general, how the Federal spending impacts your business?At this point, we don’t expect that the current Federal spending bill will have any impact on our fiscal Q1 because their actions will not take effect until probably January which will be after the completion of our Q1.So I’d say we’ve already seen whatever the government is going to do.Having said that, the US Federal government represents a significant portion of our revenue.And so, if for example they were to shut down the government for some period of time as we’ve seen a couple of years ago that would have a significant impact on the company’s revenues.If they were to expand spending, we would expect that to have a positive impact on the company’s revenues.And just one more question, could you talk a little bit about, I think that the quarter that you just reported, the revenue was up sequentially, but then down from a year earlier.Is that mainly due to seasonality or there were some other factors there?That is mainly due to seasonality.As I said, the US Federal government represents a significant portion of our revenue and they tend to spend a great deal more in our fiscal Q4 than the other quarters of the year.Couple of them.First on the boot camp platform that you have, can you give us a little more granularity maybe in terms of participants or is there any material difference in your gross margin profile on boot camp versus multi-day?Well, I won’t go into much detail about the participants because we don’t break out our various lines in terms of participants in each product line that we have.It is a different profile for us.It is totally online and so our cost of delivery for those courses tends to be less, given that there is overhead associated with any course, a one-day course is going to be more expensive than one quarter of a four-day course, but because it’s presented 100% online, it allows us to be much more flexible in how we schedule these and where we schedule them.And so we tend not to incur the same level of expenses as one would expect.I know you can’t give exact numbers in terms of your participants in the boot camp programs, but maybe you can give a little color in terms of how that program is rolling out or developing relative to what your internal plans were?Once again, we don’t break that out in much detail, but we have continued to see growth in that business and it does represent some portion of our revenue that we continue to schedule the courses.Once again, as you can see, if you look the number of days of training offered through our one-day courses, it is significantly lower than what’s offered through our multi-day courses, but we still do see a reasonable number of people enrolling in those courses and w have had our private clients who bring their courses in-house begin to use those courses also.And then as you look out the company in the next couple of years, let’s say, one of the big operating costs you have is related to your contingent lease liabilities.So could you give us some general thinking in terms of what the total number of leases or how do you see that playing out in terms of total real estate leased couple of years out from where you are now?Do you expect that to shrink?Yes.We’ve already signaled that we will not be renewing our leases in California and Chicago, Illinois, several of our Chicago, Illinois.So we are looking to right size our real estate to our needs.We do have a couple of leases coming up in the next couple of years, again we will be looking for less space as the size of our classrooms has decreased.It’s at the back end of 2016 when these leases start to expire.So it will be a very small impact.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And then in terms of the worldwide operations , I think you indicated on your last call we had some problem areas in United Kingdom and Sweden , I was <b>wondering</b> if you could comment a little bit about those specific regions and then maybe some other positives or negatives in other parts of the world ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We’ve seen weaker response in Europe than we have in North America and we continue to put out special programs in both Sweden and the UK to try to bolster our sales in those countries.So at this point, we just believe that it will take a little bit longer for these programs to have an impact than they have in North America.One thing to note is Europe, not just with Learning Tree, but with many other training companies has been slower to adopt online attendance and courses.And therefore, a lot of the programs that we’ve been introducing, for example the one-day courses, see a slower uptake in Europe because of people being more reluctant to attend courses online.I guess lastly, just in terms of cash balances, [you exited] about $18 million in Q4, you’re guiding for somewhere between $3 million and $4 million loss.By the way, David, will your operating loss be roughly equal to your cash burn in Q1?Our operating loss, let’s see, we [drew off] a little bit of depreciation, so depending on what happens with the deferred revenue numbers, I would expect it to be about the same.And then so continuing on that line, as you roll out – by the way, is Q1 seasonally your slowest quarter?So have you guys had a chance to go through budgeting through the fiscal 2016 year and identify any other cost cutting that might be able to shrink that cash burn, if you will, because it’s looking like it’s going to get a little close towards the middle part of the year?We have them booking at that and we anticipate that we will continue to rely on our balance of cash and our cash flow from operations to finance our operating needs and we believe such funds will be sufficient to get us through the end of the year.Richard in his remarks and I guess also in the press release discussed objective for 2016 that’s consistent with what we’ve heard in recent years, qualitative.Is there any quantitative objectives that you can provide or share with shareholders for fiscal 2016?Not at this time.We’ve made the projections for the first quarter, of course.And the way this business is operated, we carry a relatively small backlog.We’ve got this new Workforce Optimization Solutions rolling out.And I would say that we are beginning to get working that and in that regard that’s a positive.But it’s just too premature at this time for us to make projections for the rest of the fiscal year.We’re projecting minimal CapEx this year between $1.5 million and $2 million, basically replacement of existing hardware at our offices and at centers.In terms of the NOL, when we sold the building last year and repatriated some cash from our foreign subs, we drew down the NOL, but this year’s results are adding back.So that is basically what our NOL is looking like, it’s the results from 2015.And then final question on IT Workforce Optimization, [is this a form of a course] because it’s not quite clear, it almost seems more of a consultative approach?Yeah, Kevin, actually you’re correct.Being a customer in my past, having been the CIO a couple of different times and been in the IT industry for the past 30 years, this whole notion of supporting IT organizations and the lifecycle needs for professional development we found over the last couple of years we’re getting more and more of that kind of work that’s, if you will, related to but not directly training.So skills assessment for individuals so that you can really understand their competency and skill level in a particular technical or managerial discipline so that you can tailor training and other types of professional development activities to get them up to the level that you need them at.Even organizational design, how you optimize your organization, your IT organization to best meet your customer needs.And then on the back end, things like taking our instructors and leveraging them into opportunities to not only train, but also to be part of the workforce, whether it’d be just coaching, or whether it’d be actually embedding them for a while to help the organization to change.I mean, we’re doing major change initiative for government agency around ITIL.We’ve got instructors embedded working on agile development programs to help an organization get the skills, get the change management processes in place so that they can then take that on themselves and carry forward.But just the training alone has not been enough.And we’re seeing more and more those kinds of opportunities.So we bundled all of that into something we’re calling as IT Workforce Optimization Solutions to provide that end-to-end capability, which as you say is much more related to consultative work, but also then is an augmentation, if you will, or enhancement of our training and we believe gets us much closer to the client in a much more partnership model rather than just being a training vendor to these organizations.I think that your current roster of IT trainers are able to implement all these steps, or are you actually hiring other professionals to come in and do things like the skill assessment in the organizational design?It’s a good question.In some cases, the instructor core that we have and not all instructors, but some of the instructors fit very well into these kinds of activities.We are also looking at not so much hiring directly, but partnering potentially with some consultancies that have very high end kind of consultative skills to augment what we might not be able to bring ourselves.Have you been able to sign any contracts in this area?Is there a typical contract date in terms of length and size?I think that’s probably a little early to say that we’ve got a typical contract now as far as length and size.We do have a number of engagements on the skills assessment area that are underway.We also have a number of engagements on more of the back end where, as I said, we’re taking some of our instructors and actually helping the organizations on site, both from a coaching as well as actually embedded consultative arrangement.So I just don’t think I can answer the question directly.I think we need more time to see how this shakes out as far as what the size goes.But I want to reiterate that what these engagements themselves might not be so large.We believe it really positions us much more effectively to be a partner with the organization to support them in their core training needs.And lastly, did you – it sounds like this has [quick, ticked off] pretty swiftly.Did you generate any revenue in fiscal Q4 on this?As Richard stated, we’ve been doing some of those type work for customers all along.So that’s standard work, as normal would be in the fourth quarter, but there was no new specific contract, I think, under this in the fourth quarter.We’ve been doing it for a number of years and we are now formalizing it and really expanding the level of services that we’re offering through Workforce Optimization Solutions.Once again, I’d like to thank you.Over the past 40 years, Learning Tree’s mission has been to provide technical and business professionals with the skills and knowledge that significantly enhance their on-the-job productivity, and thereby improve the performance and increase the competitive advantage of their employers.We continue to strive to fulfill this mission.Good evening.Ladies
