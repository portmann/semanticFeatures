time I would like to welcome everyone to the AEP Industries, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2015 Results Conference Call.All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Thank you.Mr. Lamplough, you may begin your conference.Thank you, Jackie.Before we get started, I would like to remark briefly about forward-looking statements.Except for historical information mentioned during the conference call, statements made by the Management of AEP Industries are forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause the company’s actual results and future periods to differ materially from forecasted results.Those risks included, but are not limited to risks associated with pricing, volume and conditions of the markets.Those and other risks are described in the company’s filings with the SEC over the last 12 months, copies of which are available from the SEC or may be obtained from the company.During this call, we will also discuss a non-GAAP financial measure.Please refer to the table included in our press release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure and the related discussion thereof.Today’s format will be as follows, Brendan Barba, Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss operations and then Paul Feeney, Executive Vice President Finance and CFO, will discuss the financial results.After the prepared remarks, Brendan and Paul will be available for questions.Thank you.Good morning, everyone.Welcome to our 2015 year end conference call and a happy new year to everybody.Paul Feeney, our CFO will do a financial review of AEP in 2015 and I will be concentrating now on our operational side of the business for 2016 and in the future.Last year John Powers, an Executive Vice President with the company for 26 years was promoted to President.John has a complete understanding and command of AEP and its nine operating divisions.And management and the Board are very comfortable with John’s promotion and I think it addresses a successor plan in a need in orderly manner.We continue to expand our company.We understand that we are doing this with a certain level of capital constraints.So the investments that we are making are in specific areas where either there is an essential need or we are extremely busy and we need added capacity to support sales.We’re going add another feature to these statements on capacity increases where on each line that we commit we will advise approximate operating rates, which is a different way than we did it in the past.In our custom films division we’re adding 10 million pounds of capacity in our Chino, California plant.The line start date is 5/15.The expected operating rate is 90%.Again in our custom films division we’re adding another 10 million pounds of capacity in our Waxahachie, Texas plant start date of the line is about mid-June; operating rate of about 75%.In our retail Canliner division we’re increasing capacity by 8 million pounds in our Montgomery, Alabama plant.The start date of the line is about 4/15.The operating rate is between 50% and 60%.There is a reason why we can’t outsource that film.That machine produces film that goes to a converting department.It’s a secondary operating.The film has to be perfect.So we really can’t outsource the film.We lose control of it if we do that and our experience doing some of that in the past has not been good.So the operating rate is not as high as we would like, but there is compelling reasons to make the secondary operation efficient that we go ahead and we have made that investment.In our institutional Canliner division, we’ve increased capacity 2 million pounds in our Waxahachie plant, the start date is March 16th operating rate of about 75% to 80%.So the total capacity for the year is 30 million pounds.We expect CapEx for 2016 to be around the same as 2015, about $20 million in CapEx.And we are under some self-imposed constraints, but I want to assure everyone that there is absolutely no negative effect on any of these constraints for our ability to meet the forecasted capacities of 2016.All divisions have enough capacity to meet the sales quotas without any problems.Things certainly have settled down at AEP.We are away from the two acquisitions that we did everything is done, we’ve completely consolidated, we’ve changed products, we’ve cut staffing, it’s in place the way we would like it.The missing link was sales volumes of course we had to build those and I’m happy to report that that we’ve made a significant amount of progress in the acquisitions and they’re moving ahead with dramatic improvements.Sales in 2015 was certainly below expectations.Paul will go through some of the reasons for it.We’ve made some changes to correct that and I’m pleased to announce that for the first two months in November and December of a new fiscal year, volume is up 8.7 million pounds over 2015.We’ve put in a huge amount of effort in our R&D group driving new products and improved products and it’s had some very impressive results.Resin, Resin right now there is a resin increase in place and the resin supply is trying to implement and increase since October of $0.05 a pound.They pushed it to November, they pushed it to December, they pushed it to January and now they pushed it again to February.We’re in a process of evaluating that increase and our opinion is even if it goes through it will be short lived.There are some tight conditions taking place in the resin market over the next three or four months where there is a lot of maintenance turnarounds.The market might be a little bit short of material.So -- and from a time extend point the vendors have got picking the period of time when the business starts to increase in volume for seasonal factors.So they may get it but the net result is over the year we expect year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter eventually resin prices will come down.So at the end of the year they will be down somewhat and it’s almost impossible for me to tell you how much it’s very, very complicated process.We are entering a huge capacity increase in the resin industry.It’s a staggering amount of capacity being added between 2016 and ‘19 about 17 billion pounds of resin capacity will be coming on stream, incredible amount of added capacity.While it’s almost impossible to forecast what will happen and we certainly can’t forecast over a four year period what will happen.We expect that resin prices will be coming down dramatically probably year-over-year with this much capacity coming on stream all the time.Price increases always have a negative impact on earnings.We have just the opposite [ph] take place when there are resin price decreases.So we are looking at the reversal of the types of difficulties we have in 2014 when earnings were poor and we had faced at that time toward the end of that period $0.22 in resin increases and I don’t have to tell you on a billion pounds what that number is, it was an impossible task and of course we didn’t get the increases through on a timely basis.There is always a lag a normal lag and you don’t always get every increase.So it’s a difficult time.That is all changing and we are really in much better shape moving forward for quite a few years here as you can see.Over the years AEP has done a good job of increasing shareholder value with stock buybacks.So I think that’s one of the things that we’ve done quite well with.Yesterday I’m pleased to announce we declared $1 a share dividend payable effective to ‘16 at $0.25 per quarter and again we believe that’s obviously a positive step towards creating more shareholder value.We are very comfortable with the direction of the company where it’s going; the investments we’ve made, the new markets that we’ve entered the new products that we develop.So I can tell you that management has a very, very positive and upbeat feeling for 2016.Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, very quickly a happy New Year to everybody.I’m sure you are happy to see our results.Net sales in this fourth quarter decreased $38 million to $278 million.The decrease was the result of a 6% decrease in average selling prices combined with a 6% decrease in sales volume.The selling price decrease was a result of a partial pass-through of lower resin prices to customers in the quarter.Volume in the quarter was 235 million pounds, a decrease of 15 million pounds from the 250 million pounds sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘14.Net sales were at $1,141 million in fiscal 2015, that’s a decrease of $51 million, or 4.3% from the $1,193 million recorded in the prior fiscal year.The decrease here was also the result of a -- this time a 3% decrease in average selling prices, combined with a 1% decrease in sales volume.Fiscal 2015 volume was 939 million down 8.7 million pounds from the 948 million pounds sold in the prior fiscal year.We believe our year-to-date decline in sales volume are a result from a number of factors including inclement weather in our first and second quarters and the natural tendency of the marketplace to minimize inventory levels in a business environment characterized by decreasing costs.We are happy that we were able to report volume increases in our second and third quarters and although we expect our marketplace will continue to be extremely competitive we think we have experienced market share gains in 2015.We attribute the volume declines experienced in our fourth quarter to an order flow disruption caused by resin cost decreases in that period.Book gross profit for the fourth quarter increased $17 million to $51 million.Adjusted for the LIFO reserve fluctuation in both quarters there was a gross profit improvement in the current period of about $3.7 million.Adjusted for LIFO gross profit per pound in the current quarter is $0.157 a pound, in the fourth quarter of the prior year it was $0.133 a pound.Book gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased $59.8 million to $181 million.This includes a LIFO reserve decrease in the current year-to-date period of $26.6 million as compared to a LIFO reserve increase in the prior year’s fiscal period of $3.6 million.Adjusting for the LIFO reserve movements in both periods of $30.3 million there was a gross profit improvement in the current period of about $29.5 million.Adjusting for LIFO, gross profit per pound in the current fiscal year is $0.165 a pound.In the prior fiscal year, adjusted gross profit per pound was $0.132.The gross profit increase in both the fourth quarter and the 2015 fiscal year results, resulted from resin cost reductions throughout the fiscal year partially offset by decreasing selling prices and increasing manufacturing cost.Our second and third quarter results were marginally helped by sales volume increases in those periods.Although explainable the overall volume decline for the year 2015 fiscal year is still having a negative impact on year-to-date results.Management expects the situation will reverse in the coming fiscal year.Operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were $120.3 million, an increase of $6.3 million as compared to the prior fiscal year.The operating cost increase in 2015 are primarily due to increased share based compensation cost associated with the company’s stock options and performance units of $5.6 million and increased incentive bonus cost of $3 million even partially offset by decreases in delivery expenses, due to reduced fuel cost and a reduction in volume sold.2015 results also include a $1.3 million gain primarily due to the disposition of a warehouse.Fiscal 2014 results included a $2.1 million recovery of business interruption, insurance recovery for business interruption expenses, which was the actual cost was actually incurred in prior years.Fiscal 2015 interest expense declined $800,000 due to reduced borrowings in our credit facility.Net income in fiscal 2015 was $28.8 million, or $5.64 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of $5.5 million, or $1.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2014.We run the company for adjusted EBITDA, which was $76.1 million in 2015 as compared to $46.1 million in the prior fiscal year.We continue our discounting activities, but because of the reduced reductions in resin cost we now have approximately $35 million dedicated to that effort.Capital expenditures for 2015 were $12.2 million and our capital expenditure forecast for 2016 is $20 million.Availability is currently around $155 million.Brendon previously mentioned, our dividend we expect that the record date for our first dividend payment will be February 1st and the payment date will be February 16th and that will be followed by a May 1st record date and a May 17th payment date and August 1st record date and an August 16th payment date and a November 1st record date followed by a December 16th payment date.We are expecting all of these declarations will be for a dividend in the amount of $0.25 equaling an annual dividend of $1 a share.The 6% volume decline in the fourth quarter, Paul were you saying essentially that that was customer reduced stocking on falling resin prices?I think that’s primarily what that was.It is normal for our marketplace particularly when we’re talking about our more sophisticated distribution days to customers.To manage the inventories when they were expecting a resin cost decline they hold off at their purchasing activities when they can, when their inventory level allow them to do that so that they can buy at a cheaper price after the price reduction is announced.So that’s basically what happens.And we think that that’s really is what happened in retrospect since as Brendon previously noted, we have an 8.7 million pound increase in the first two months of fiscal ‘16.And I know it’s hard to tell in [ph], you look at [indiscernible] and others and just different ideas of where resin is going or what the producers are announcing.But do you think that given the volatility that these customers might destock more in potential anticipation of resin falling further or if they look at some of these other indices might start perhaps restocking ahead of what could be some potentially resin price increases?In our stock businesses and by the way we were able to verify our statement that we saw a declining of volumes in our stock businesses.Those are the businesses that the customer can pick up the phone and say ship it because it’s in stock as oppose to a custom films division where maybe take three weeks.So they can play an inventory game a lot easier from our stock businesses.I think generally speaking we always believe that in our stock businesses if customers expect the product, the resin cost to go down that there will be some effect on what they buy, if you thought something was going down and you were going to buy a commodity of any type you’d hesitate if you thought you could get it cheaper the following month.Understand.Do you have any outlook on what volume this might do in this 2016 fiscal year versus ‘15?We have internal forecast that we are paying very close attention to, but we’re not giving out a volume forecast at this time this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We were expecting a volume increase last year , by the end of our third quarter we thought we were locked into a very nice increase and we were completely <b>surprised</b> by the fall off in volume in our fourth quarter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So we’d like to be a little bit more certain of where we stand in volumes and what the forecast would be before we make those things public.We don’t like to disappoint the market and in so far as volumes are concerned we did disappoint not only the market, but we disappointed ourselves.So that’s kind of where we are.Understand.Last one for me at this time is do you think that you have a fiscal ‘15 LIFO gross profit per pound you are seeing benefitted from among other things falling resin, if you think resin remain at least for in ‘16 relatively constant or at least more constant toward the beginning of the year, do you think you’ll be able to maintain that LIFO, gross profit per pound in fiscal ‘16?We are not only working toward maintaining existing metrics in gross profit per pound we’re trying to improve them and we think that improvement is possible.[Operator Instructions] It appears we have no further questions at this time.Now I’d like to turn it back to management for any additional closing remarks.Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you very much for attending this conference call.You all know Brendan and I we are available if you have any specific questions.But with that we will conclude and we hope you all have a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year.Thank you.Thank you.This concludes today’s conference call.You may now disconnect.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.Error in this transcript?Let us know .</div></body></html>
