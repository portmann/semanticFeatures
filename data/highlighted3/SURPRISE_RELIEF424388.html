(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In January of this year we asserted that the labor market was weakening, when most pundits on Wall Street were arguing just the opposite.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls increased a measly 38,000, which was the slowest pace in more than five years.Even if we add back the 35,000 Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) workers that were temporarily on strike, the total of 73,000 falls woefully short of the consensus estimate of 160,000.Furthermore, there were downward revisions to the prior two monthly estimates that subtracted 58,000 from the total.That results in virtually no net new job creation.These same pundits called this disappointment statistical noise.We call it a validation of our research efforts earlier this year to identify trends in leading economic indicators.One indicator we introduced at the beginning of the year was our revision index, which looks at the size and frequency of the downward revisions by the BLS between its initial jobs estimate and the second revision to that estimate two months later.A detailed description of this index and how it was compiled can be found here .We have updated it with Friday's numbers below.This index shows that the very weak payroll report was no outlier.It is the result of a weakening trend that began more than a year ago, as the number of negative monthly revisions has risen and the average revision over the trailing 12-month period has turned negative.This is reminiscent of what we saw just prior to the economic downturn in 2007 and early 2008.Additionally, on the premise that consumer spending is the primary driver of job creation, the weakening trend in the rate of growth in retail sales and overall consumer spending on a year-over-year basis told us that the rate of job growth would slow.Most on Wall Street operate on the false premise that job creation is the primary driver of consumer spending, when it is wage growth that drives consumer spending, and consumer spending that drives job creation.The BLS also reported that the unemployment rate fell from 5.0% to 4.7%, because 458,000 people gave up looking for work last month, pushing the labor-participation rate back down to 62.6%.This followed 362,000 people who no longer chose to look for work in the month of April.This is a far better example of statistical noise, and the number is so absurd that it is difficult to comment.The unemployment rate is significantly higher than the 4.7% that the government is reporting, and that is all there is to say about that.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey climbed to 51.3 from 50.8 in April, with readings above 50 indicating growth in the sector.This was the third consecutive month of readings above the 50 level, but the improvement in May was not a result of improvement in new orders, production, inventories or the backlog of new orders, which all declined.The main driver of the increase was the prices paid sub-index, which mutes the headline improvement.Still, this is better than contraction.The Institute for Supply Management's services survey, which represents a much larger segment of economic activity, fell well short of estimates, from 55.7 to 52.9 in May.This was the weakest reading since September 2014.More troublesome was the fact that it was led by a drop in the employment sub-index to 49.7, which indicates contraction and confirms the weak jobs number for May.There were also significant declines in the new orders and new export orders sub-indices.Both of these surveys combined show a composite that now looks very similar to the Markit Economic composite , which can be seen below, and that we reported on last week.These purchasing manager surveys peaked nearly two years ago and have been weakening ever since.By our estimation, auto sales peaked for the current economic cycle in 2015 at 17.47 million vehicles.In the latest monthly report , auto sales declined in May by 6% on a year-over-year basis, but this was mostly due to two fewer selling days in the month.Regardless, the annualized sales pace continues to slow, as does consumer purchases at dealerships.The largest US auto company, General Motors (NYSE: GM ), saw its sales decline 18% on a year-over-year basis.Sales incentives overall for the auto industry increased 11% in May on a year-over-year basis, which is evidence demand is slowing.Construction spending tumbled 1.8% in April, which was the largest decline in five years.This decline isn't as bad as it seems though, because March was revised upward from an increase of 0.3% to 1.5%.Construction spending is still up 4.5% on a year-over-year basis, led by a 5.7% increase in residential construction.Public construction is up 1.2%.This was a good report.Factory orders rose 1.9% in April, which was the first back-to-back monthly increase since the summer of 2014.Tempering our optimism is the fact that this was fueled by a surge in commercial aircraft orders, which are extremely volatile from month to month.Factory orders are still declining on a year-over-year basis, as can be seen below, but the rate of decline is lessening.Our greatest concern remains the continued decline in business investment spending, as measured by the 0.6% decline in April for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft spending.Personal income rose 0.4% in April, while personal spending, otherwise known as personal consumption expenditures or consumer spending, increased a whopping 1.0%.We have no clue what sparked this reported surge in spending on both goods and services, but it was supposedly fueled by savings rather than income.We didn't realize there were any savings available to be spent, but it is the only way to explain the increase in spending.This is consistent with the most recent retail sales report, which was driven by a surge in spending on autos.Personal income is up 4.4% over the past year, while real consumer spending has risen 3.0%.The personal income figure is not our preferred measurement of income growth, as average hourly earnings are a more accurate leading indicator of the trend in consumer spending.This is because average hourly earnings exclude the highly compensated, who spend a much smaller amount of their overall income than do workers who earn an hourly wage.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in May and are up 2.5% on a year-over-year basis.We will report on the increase in real average hourly earnings when we learn about the increase in the rate of inflation for May later this month.That is our key leading indicator for real consumer spending growth.Last week was loaded with economic data, and most of it suggests a continued slowdown in the rate of US economic growth.The surveys of purchasing managers in both the manufacturing and services sectors imply continued weakness in business activity.Auto sales, which have been a driving force in the rate of consumer spending growth over the past several years, appear to have peaked.Capital spending by businesses continues to decline.Construction spending, led by residential housing, continues to be a bright spot.The latest jobs report raises serious doubts about a pickup in the rate of growth above 2%.Our forecast for 2016 remains 1%, which is what it was at the beginning of the year.The first quarter will likely be revised to 1% or higher in the coming month, based on upward revisions to March data.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
