(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Timing of weather does impact usually parts of Q2 and Q3, but we know we make up those days in Q4.We’re now into the bidding season for new and existing contracts that will start up in the 2016, 2017 school year or as we know it as our fiscal 27 year and we are very encouraged by what we are seeing.We estimate the total dollar value of viable contracts coming out for bid and approximately $550 million across North America.We will view only a portion of those contracts to bid a strategically attractive to our business model.The market opportunity is sizable and we are well positioned to build on regional density.It’s not just the bid opportunities that have us optimistic about growth prospects but perhaps more importantly, we are pleased by what appears to be unfolding within the pricing environment.After five plus years of operating in a market bearing zero to 1.5% price increases reflecting CPI based cost of living increases, we’re not seeing more meaningful price power on both our own renewals and with new bid we expect to see that will contribute to our growth next year and into the following years thereafter.We believe the improved pricing environment can be attributed to a combination of the relative strength of the overall economy, the demand for increase wages and a tightening work force, by more importantly responsible pricing by many industry participants as we all have come off historic low renewals.We are seeing School District own operations also increasing their wages for drives as well as justifying our increase.Some customer have continued to support increases as many are insisting on quality, service, innovation, safety, user of cleaner alternative fuels and expanding onboard technologies to further reduce cost.So what I am saying here is, there are customers who will pay for better service and then returns expect either figure out how to eventually lower their cost and improve their service.I know that’s a market we like to play in and I’ll talk about later how we’ll do that.We’re also pleased with our margin expansion during the quarter and we’ll hopefully see that going forward by installing new operational management systems that we’ve rolled out.We’ve been increasing the GPS units on our fleet with new telematics software so that once we deploy these items and train our folks that will hopefully continue to translate into lower operating, maintenance and fuel cost by providing us with real time data from individual buses.And lastly, we are improving our in house routing technology which has allowed us to optimize or make efficient the routes we run for schools as we look to reduce assets.Asset management is extremely important to note as we have developing this in house which is helping us reduce the number of vehicles required to generate the same revenue.Through optimization, we expect to see a reduction of 350 to 400 units taken out of our fleet during this school year due to the aggressive review by our operating teams.This initiative lead by our COO, Pat Vaughan, along with our Senior Vice President of Fleet Maintenance can have the effect of reducing replacement capital expenditures by 20 million to 25 million for the coming 27 fiscal year, that is significant and a great start.We have noted many times we have the youngest age fleet in the industry and with an average age of just less than six years.Recently the reported industry average is now closer to ten years, we do know that buses made better today by our manufactures than they were 15 years ago and we have gotten better ourselves with our outstanding team of maintenance techs and the preventive maintenance training we added with sharp shooting diagnostics included in our telematics.So there can be an extended life program here of one to two year overtime, which will lower capital requirements for replacements even further and still be comfortably well under the industry average.While these investments and new behaviors collectively provide some benefit to our second quarter profitability, we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface of what they deliver in terms of cost reduction, productivity and operating efficiency for our business over the composing years.We expect to gain momentum as we brought in the rollout of these programs and more importantly, train our staffs throughout our over a 150 locations.As we grow and win new bids, it becomes easier to install and train the new teams as they start operations with these systems in place they won.As we all know chancing behavior is difficult but change is constant and we know we have to get these systems in place as soon as possible.We have invested in and implemented a lot of new changes, systems, programs and initiatives over the last few years.While some of these are not new to large delivery logistics companies us FedEx or UPS, they are to an old school business like school transportation.Now we can learn a lot from others as technology changes become more affordable.These new ways to review and managed cost will help us improve margins and get better utilization of our assets.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Not <b>surprisingly</b> , <i>lower</i> fuel prices contributed to our improved profitability .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Fuel expense was just under 5% of revenue in the second quarter, down from 7% last year, however that did include a retro fuel tax credits due to the passage of the alternative fuel tax credit legislation that Pat Walker will further explain.Based on the current market forecast and the portion of our overall fuel usage that we have locked in and have yet to lock in, we expect fuel to be a year-over-year benefit for the balance of this fiscal year well into next fiscal year and possibly even into fiscal 2018, which some of the fuel expense savings - some of our fuel expense savings in attributable to our increasing use of alternative fuel vehicles, specifically vehicles that run on propane.Now we are currently buying propane for a $1.20 to a $1.30 per gallon equivalent and with the temporary alternative fuel tax credit of $0.50 per gallon that helps to lower at even further.These vehicles run somewhat less efficient though on an MPG basis they are cleaner and quieter than diesel buses and are enhancing our ability to win bids and renewals with attractive rate increases.They are easier to maintain, they have better performance in extreme cold weather locations.Some of the 30$ of our customers who we convinced over the past few years to purchase fuel for us it’s part of our contract, basically that’s the risk of fuel with our customer paid fuel, well they are seeing the savings and putting those dollars back in the classroom but they can also be used to help in our contract renewal negotiations.We are finding that more and more school districts are interested in propane proposals and we are uniquely position to meet that demand.We have also seen our operations teams becoming more aggressive in managing fuel with our increased company-wide effort to reduce idling and monitoring in identifying vehicles going off route.Vehicles can now be electronically shutoff after not moving or idling for more than five minutes by this new technology.Now drivers had to get use to this but this have an added impact to our lower fuel usage.No longer will vehicles be running excessively at schools or events.The benefits of these operations efficiencies and lower fuel cost on our profitability for the first half of the year, we are partially offset by high wages.Driver wages have increased and right lease through, mostly though as a result of a tightening of the labor pools due to lower unemployment rates in the U.S. and many of our markets.This appears to be a positive indicator for the overall economy especially in the U.S. where we also track increase housing starts in our markets.Kids are going to school and the school is still the safest way to get there.With our STI brands of family culture, we are always trying to attract new drives as well as retain the best drivers as we’ve done each year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Visit our websites and social media sites to see just some other things we are doing in our communities , it 's <b>amazing</b> and it does make a difference .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Ticking clocks that of terminal by terminal with their help by reducing idling, eliminating excess mileage and improving operating efficiencies is part of that strategy.As I have said before, our greatest growth opportunities this year and next are on the bottom line and increasing our cash flow per share.There no mistake these programs and investments we have made will increase cash flow and margins which then allow us to grow the top line more efficiently once we perfect their capabilities.We have a long and successful history of safely and efficiently operating school bus fleets all over North America and as I hope, you’ve taken away from my comments today, we continue to get better out it.We’ve remained the safest provider of the major carriers and that’s the stat we are most proud of.But we’ve identified another - a number of other opportunities to leverage our experience and relationships in the industry to boost out top line growth without deviating from the core of its competencies and with what we view as very attractive business with little no hard assets.Our managed services group of companies which I brought Tom Kominsky onboard to head up is our asset like group we have mentioned previously and is now comprised of a few small business unit consisting of school district consulting contracts and management of 13 school district operations plus various technology businesses that offer school districts and contractors enhance services and products to manage their bus leaves more safely and cost efficiently than ever possible.Now this is the chance to get a small piece of the government owned $18 billion industry, AKA [ph] that 66% that I’ve talked about of school districts and state owned side that still operates their own fleets.We are still very interested in showing them how we can take over the entire operations, but if they still insist of owning, well then we would like to sell them some of our expertise products and services to make them more efficient without the expense of capital.SafeStop currently is in more than 5,000 vehicles and we are scaling it up from there.Like other things I’ve discussed in this old school industry, SafeStop is breaking new ground and we are doing daily demonstrations with enquiring customers.We continue to believe parents will want, even demand the app as we get more exposure with new subscriptions.We are encouraging school business officials to require SafeStop for their transportation departments then also make it part of new bids and allows either school paid, parent paid or sponsor paid programs or even a combination of those.Currently we have all of those options available as additional revenue sources for us.Now unlike some competitor, unsophisticated cheap knockoffs apps, SafeStop is the only one compatible with all the current GPS and routing providers in the school transportation business.School officials are keenly interested in SafeStop analytics unique and proprietary key performance indicators.SafeStop provides them real time data and statistics to not only know the basics such as where the bus is, it also provides statistical data for on time performance in schools, ridership data where they are late vehicles, comparison times on routes, traffic patterns and then even eliminates phone calls to their schools.This allows us to then get in there and promote and offer additional services through our newly expanded consulting group.Our TSC Partners Club has now been retooled the new deals and programs with many vendors have been renegotiated.Tom and his team are designing a new sales program for launch this spring where school district fleets can simply take advantage of our purchasing power, expertise and technology to improve their operations and lower their cost while generating non-asset revenues for us.All they do is sign up, join the club and the benefits and the programs are they are to take.So the pieces are coming together for this new group.It has taken time developing any new business does but we need to get this right.While still a relatively small portion of our overall revenues for this year, it will be a growing contributor with the $12 million to $15 million revenue run rate at the beginning of fiscal ‘17 and we expect accelerated growth of that group as they learn to cross sell and leverage the sales channels each team has developed.If it contribute similar margins as the core business we expect but with little earned assets, it will a nice contributor to the overall company and lower our payout ratio even further.There are tremendous growth opportunities in this business as well.Thank you, Denis.Good morning and thank you for attending out Q2 conference call for fiscal ‘16.We’ve released our Q2 result yesterday.We also filed the quarterly financial statements in the associated MD&A for the second quarter ended December 31st, 2015 on SEDAR yesterday and EDGAR this morning.Both will include more detailed information.And as Doug had noted, unless otherwise indicated, all financial information discussed will be in U.S. dollars.The operating results summarized in the press release include revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the second and first six months of fiscal 2016.We use adjusted EBITDA internally as a usual measure for tracking the performance and as noted previously adjusted EBITDA in a non-GAAP measure.In advance of discussing the operations results for the second quarter of fiscal ‘16, I will note the seasonality of the school bus transportation industry and thus the company’s operations as I have done on previously conference calls.Based on the seasonality, the financial results of the company for any one quarter are not indicative of the financial results for full fiscal year.The company’s second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2016 reflected the continued growth of the company through the executing of our ATC growth strategy.The company started operations on a 11 new big contracts in July for the 2016 fiscal year, three of which were tuck-ins.In addition, we continued operations on a bid contract which started in the third quarter of fiscal ‘15.As such the second quarter and fiscal six months of the prior fiscal year do not include any operations for the new bid win secured for fiscal ‘16 and that one bid contract that started in the third quarter of fiscal ‘15.And looking at the results for the second quarter of fiscal ‘16, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal ‘16 totaled a 167.4 million, an increase of 9.9 million, or 6.3% over the second quarter of fiscal 2015.The change in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar from the second quarter of fiscal ‘15 to the second quarter of fiscal ‘16 in connection with the translation of our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars had a negative $3.1 million impact on the period over periods change in revenue.10.7 million and 2.9 million of the revenue increase for the second quarter of ‘16 is attributable to the net new business noted along with the same-terminal operations, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal ‘16 totaled 41.5 million, an increase of 5.5 or 15.3% over the adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal ‘15.And again the change in exchange rates to in the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar had a negative impact here of 900,000 on the period over period change in adjusted EBITDA.3.7 million of the net increase in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is attributable to the net new business noted earlier.Same-terminal operations reflect the adjusted EBITDA contribution associated with the same-terminal revenue increase combined with reductions in fuel expense of 3.3 million, maintenance cost of 800,000 all of which were partially offset by increases in wages, operating expense and G&A expense.In regards to our fuel, the reduction in fuel expense reflects a combination of lower market fuel prices, some alternative fuel tax credits on our propane usage and some overall fuel efficiencies.On December 18, 2015, Federal Legislation resulted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 being signed into law.The act reinstated retroactively so going back to January 1st, 2015, certain tax benefits and credits that had expired at December 31st, 2014.The act retroactively extended the alternative fuel and alternative fuel mixer tax incentives due December 31st, 2016 providing for a $0.50 per gallon excise tax credit allowance for alternative fuel use.With the reinstatement of the $0.50 propane credit, retroactive back to January 1st, 2015, we picked up approximately $800,000 to $900,000 in tax credits for the period January 1st, 2015 through June 30th, 2015 which would have been the second half of our fiscal year 2015.Excluding the portion of the tax credit associated with this prior fiscal year period, same-terminal fuel would have been 5.4% in the second quarter of fiscal ‘16.As we have discussed on past quarterly calls, we have fuel mitigation features in our revenue contracts in the 60% with approximately 30% reflecting customer paid fuel and 30% reflecting other forms of fuel mitigation.’With the continued decline in market fuel prices, we still benefit to some extend on the 30% of contracts that had mitigation features other than the customer paid fuel.In addition, we have also discussed the lock-ins we have done historically in regards to fuel exposure.We look to lock-in approximately 20% of our fuel exposure with fixed price contracts annually with the remaining 20% of our fuel exposure being fully exposed.As such, we have seen improvements in the fuel percentage component in fiscal 2016 based on the fiscal 2016 mitigations and lock-ins being lower than the fiscal ‘15 lock-ins and fully exposed fuel benefitting from the continued market decline as well.The decrease in maintenance expense reflected lower net parts and tire expense along with lower outside repair cost for the interim period.The increase in cost of operations wages primarily reflected higher driver wages which is Denis noted reflects a tightening of available drivers resulting from the lower unemployment rates in many of our markets.We also had some increase maintenance and safety wages, while the increase in operating expense reflects another year of vehicle lease cost.The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to the additional net new work secured for fiscal 2016 as well as some compensation cost - increased compensation cost.During the second quarter of fiscal ‘16, we’ve recorded a non-cash impairment charge pursuing to an impairment analysis we performed for oil and gas assets based on the continued decline in the market price of oil and natural gas.The impairment analysis knows as the ceiling test and under U.S. GAAP, the ceiling requires the use of tax effected discounted cash flows using a present value technique.The pricing assumptions used in each ceiling test are based on the 12 months average of realized prices for the current quarter ended period.As both oil and natural gas prices that continue to decline over the last 12 to 18 months, the results of the current second quarter end ceiling test resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 1.2 million.Subsequent changes in the estimates of discounted cash flows and/or the pricing assumptions used in the ceiling test could result in further impairment in the future.Net income for the second quarter of fiscal ‘16 was 5.5 million reflecting net income per share of $0.06 compared to net income of 3.5 million reflecting net income per share of $0.04 for the second quarter of fiscal ‘15.The $2 million increase in net income for the current fiscal year second quarter results primarily from the $5.5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA combined with a $1.3 million decrease in interest expense and the 0.2 million increase in other income those were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in operating lease expense, the 1.2 million impairment charge on the oil and gas assets, the $0.9 million increase in tax expense and the $0.8 million in foreign currency loss.And looking at our fleet capital deployed for fiscal ‘16, in the first half of fiscal ‘16, we utilized leasing for approximately $14 million in growth capital expenditures and 57 million in replacement capital expenditures.These operating leases have six year terms with effective fix rates in the 2.6% to 4.2% range.The lease expenses recorded in the P&L as a direct expense.We purchased 55 million in fleet directly in the first six months of fiscal ‘16 and received cash proceeds from equipment sales of about a $1 million.The majority of the fleet purchased directly related to 11 or 12 new bid contracts and the vehicles associated with addition rout secured as part of the net new business for fiscal ‘16.As we have discussed on prior calls, the company finances the replacement fleet value through purchases of buses where we own the buses outright and through operating lease financing where the lessor the buses.The buses purchased by the company are included as assets on the balance sheet and are included in replacement CapEx spending.The buses leased are not included as assets, as the lessor retains ownership of these buses.The operating lease payments are included in the operating expenses as I just noted on the P&L and thus reflected as cash flows provided by operations in our cash flow statement.Included in the net replacement capital expenditures purchased for fiscal ‘16 is approximately $3 million in lease buyouts for leases that we entered into for the 2010, 2011 fiscal year.We purchases approximately 197 vehicles related to these lease buyouts, these vehicles have an approximate fair market value of about $6 million and a remaining useful life of eight years of more.We most likely will continue to purchase these lease vehicles at the end of their lease term to benefit from the remaining eight to nine years of the asset life as we keep them.We continue to view leasing as the financing option available to us as we look to increase our retain cash for growth.In terms of our common share activity during the period, our monthly dividends, we paid cash dividends during the second quarter and first six months ended December 31st, 2015 of 9.6 million and 18.2 million respectively.On October 21st, 2015, we’ve renewed our normal course issuer bid providing for the repurchase of up to 8,403,000 common shares in the 12 month period through October 2016.During December and January, we’ve repurchases approximately 332,000 common share leaving the balance of the current normal course issuer bid and approximately 8.1 million common shares.And looking at our balance sheet, at December 31st, 2015, out outstanding debt balances totaled approximately 280.6 million which included a 113 million in convertible debentures, 35 million in senior secured notes and 131.8 million in credit agreement debt.The company’s credit agreement currently provides 225 million in available commitments and includes a $100 million accordion feature for additional capacity when and if needed.The current credit agreement has maturity date of August 19, 2019.The 35 million in senior secured notes has a fixed rate of 4.24%, the maturity date of November 10th, 2016.And then the convertible debentures included Canadian dollar denominated 6.25% convertible debentures that were issued in November 2013 and matured in June 2019, an U.S. dollar denominated 6.25% convertible debentures issued in June 2011, which become due in June 2018.Before I turn it back over to Denis, I’d like to conclude with a few remarks.We entered fiscal ‘16 with an estimated 7% growth in year-over-year revenues as we previously reported, that was associated with the 11 or 12 new dibs for fiscal ‘16.We are trending right on that target based on the results for the first half of the current year.We have been and continued to review additional bid opportunities for fiscal ‘17 as well as Denis had noted and continue to see some increased contract pricing in the current bid market.We continually review and monitor the senior debt agreements and debt markets as well as exploring new lease financing opportunities.At the end of the second quarter, we have approximately 90 million in availability under the current credit agreement commitments with the potential of an addition 100 million under the accordion feature.In addition, we are beginning the annual review process in regards to lease financing proposals.In the last two fiscal years, we’ve received lease offers in the $100 million to $220 million which certainly exceeded the levels that we used in each of those years.We expect the similar level proposals for fiscal ‘17 which we will utilize to some extend as part of the fiscal 2017 replacement cycle.Our replacement capital expenditures deployed for fiscal ‘17 along with the growth capital expenditures to be deployed will be depended on the final outcome of our current bid season.As Denis had mentioned, we are currently in an active bidding season for new contracts as well as renewals for some of our existing ones.Additionally the contract renewal negotiations were taking place with customers were increases and that’s why we’re reviewing that replacement capital expenditure cycle required for fiscal 2017 very carefully.We do as anticipated to have a reduction in total dollar expenditures for replacements due to the efficiencies we’re implementing in our operations which lowers our replacement requirement.Once we have that information firmed up, we will then have the option to either purchase some of these replacements and/or use low cost operating leases which I noted will be readily available.We expect to know more in the coming months, we’ll have additional information on this during our Q3 call in May.With the current availability under credit agreement depended in the pending lease financing proposals, we expect to receive, I think we’re in good shape to cover any potential additional new bid opportunities along with the replacement capital expenditure cycle for fiscal 2017.Thanks Pat.So to sum it up, we’re highly enthusiastic about our prospects for improved performance.Our addressable market is large and growth opportunities available in both the core and managed services group.With the recent firming up of prices on both new bids and renewals, the long view is very encouraging.Our current corporate infrastructure platform is highly leverageable, we have always said this is being built to last not for the next quarter.We will be concentrating on efforts to expand margins as our organization drives more and more benefits from the systems we’ve invested in to better manage out cost and improve the efficiency of our fleet.This will hopefully enhance our attractiveness to more and more retail and institutional investors who see simple stable businesses with steady performance.We have completed the purchase of some of our shares on the market through or normal course issuer dib program this past quarter where we can buy back shares in market price and we will continue to do so as we see the share price below where we believe to be the intrinsic value of a company like ours with a consistency and stability of our business which we have shown overtime and for the dividend we provide.The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the quarterly dividend as you saw in the press release today in advance payable and then had set for the remainder of this fiscal year.We expect to have additional news on new bids and other exciting items coming out as those occur.The macroeconomics are in our favor, we need to capitalize on them.Prices are rising, cost of operations are being reduced, interest rates and fuel are at very attractive places for us, we’re training and developing our staffs for better performance.The young millennium moms continued to drive how we are all changing the way we do business.Moms today want safe operations, cleans fuels in and around their schools and new technology and improved communications to let them know more.This is perfect for us and we’ve been building a business over the past years to capture that market.Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Neville with Scotia Bank.Your line is now open.The 350 to 400 buses that you’ve talked about taking out of service next year, I assume that there are 350, those some of your older business or oldest buses and I assume that shouldn’t have any real impact from the top line next year?No, I doesn’t any impact on the top line, it have an impact on the revenue per vehicle which now goes up because we’ll be running - on a steady state, we’ll be running 350 to 400 less vehicles.On average, that’s you know in a 150 some locations it’s like - not that every location is the exact same size, but it’s literally like taking two vehicles out of every location.So some we took a lot more out of and some we weren’t able to take out of.Okay.And the 20 to 25 million that will save you, you said next year for replacements, I think this year, you’ve spent about including leases suppose 55 million or close to value to date, so next year should we be thinking something on the range of 40 to 45 million for replacement?Yeah, Mark.Mark, sorry about that.Yeah, I think that range is pretty good again.As I noted, we still have some renewals that we are looking at and there could be some deployments or redeployments, so that number may change a bit, but I think that’s a pretty good range.Okay.And is this sort of a onetime event, I mean is there a lot of room to maybe potentially take more buses out or again is that just sort of maybe one time?I don’t know that it’s - you know it’s not like it’s going to an annual backlog, you know we can continue to do that, but I can tell you that as we start to look you know more closely in the optimization Q and these are programs of routing and scheduling.You know we’re negotiating with districts right now, we’re talking a look at location by location, obviously we’ve kind of rated that like the most vulnerable to you know not being able to take any out.And when we do that, we’re looking at not change in bell times, not change in anything initially.Then the second you know kind of round is what if we could go back to the school district and say, hey listen we can cut 5% of the fleet out or whatever if you move 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the afternoon bell times.So with those kind of things, it really get the juices going and gets the discussion going with a lot of school districts because we don’t make more money running more buses, we make more money running less busses more efficiently.So if we can pull some more hire now and we can - with the driven, lets call the pending driver tightening you know I will call it shortage, we got a tightening, it literally helps solve that problem as well.So we can reduce some cost, we did this in a school district in Pennsylvania and we’re able to - Pat Vaughan is here, we were able to what cut down ten vehicles.In Pittsburgh, PA and we’re on game sharing program with them with where literally we get almost 50% of the revenue in the first year and then it goes - and then I think it goes down to 25% patter and then for the remaining kind of term out.So they were happy to have us commanding kind of promote that kind of program.So that’s the kind of need things that I think we got to do, we got to become more logistics you know kind of operators.I mean I guess just on that, I mean one last follow-up, the acquisition, are they consulting in the management services business, they did subsequent to the quarter, can you just maybe - I appreciate there seem fairly smaller, maybe just give us a little more color on those businesses?Yeah, absolutely Mark.This is Tom Kominsky, Chief Growth Officer.You know consistent with we laid out, their consulting business does effectively management consulting for school transportation for school districts all across North America, on the trainings that we acquire one of the leading training business in the industry, so we’re thrilled to have them as part of the team and I think that this provides a tremendous platform for us going into fiscal ‘17.So I had a question for you and you guys have a fairly large section lease about it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was <b>wondering</b> if you could talk a little bit about how low fuel prices and what seem to be continued low fuel prices , how you see that impacting the propane versions and that space within your fleet forward ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Okay, currently we’ve got about just on the 2,000 about 1,800 or so of our fleet is on propane, so round about what Pat, about 14% or so of the fleet.Yeah, 14% or so of the own fleet is on propane.And so to give you an idea, going back a couple of years on where we you know we talk about our locked-in as Pat Walker talked about the locked-in price you know because again we have 30% as pass through, 30% is mitigated, 30% - 20% is lock-in and 20% is what we call at risk.We’ve certainly seen the at risk portion doing better for us today you know as fuel as come down.So the 20% that we locked in and that had a - that has a bearing on the mitigation because it’s generally the price of fuel.But you know two years ago, we were at 3.40 a gallon.Last year - for the current fiscal year, we’re closer to 2.40 a gallon.And we’re locking in a portion of next year fiscal ‘17 at $2 a gallon or maybe even a little bit less.So we’ve left about 25% of that 20% still open and available for us.Now on propane what we are seeing is the price of propane has really come down.I mean we’ve seen three years as high as $1.80 a gallon or so or $2 a gallon, we’re seeing in Omaha when we kind of started.We’re seeing now a - we just got quoted the other day a $1.12.So even though in my remarks I said we are kind of averaging between a $1.22, a $1.30, it is regionally, you know I mean there is regional prices and we’re seeing that effect.We also know that our move to go propane you know four years ago - three to four years was the right move not only from a pricing point of view but a market perception point of view of 60% less carbon monoxide in and around our schools which I said the millennium moms are kind of loving and driving.We are going to be awarded several contracts we think maybe it will be one, maybe it will be two or three like we did last where we are not low big but because of safely, because of technology, because of innovation, we’re able to get support from the community that wanted to make those kind of changes.So we see you know fuel low long, you know we watch it very closely obviously, we saw this morning you know we’re still under $30 a barrel.I mean unfortunately we’ve locked in for fiscal ‘17 at some rates higher than that but the rates that are lower than our current fiscal year, so that’s why we’re seeing - we’re going to see margin improvement or we’re going to see lower reduced fuel cost for fiscal ‘16 that we’re in we know we’re already going to see lower fuel cost for ‘17 and what we’re trying to talk to our vendors about now and our fuel vendors is you know what timeframe do we need to kind of lock-in fiscal ‘18.You know is fuel going to go to $19 a barrel?I have not ideas.Fuel going to go to $100 a barrel?I don’t think so.So we do think that fuel is going to be long.We think it’s a definitely tailwind for us and it is helping us.It’s going to give us the momentum we need to have some margin improvement.At the same time, all of the telematics, the fuel savings programs, I mean we’re pushing fuel savings programs unfortunately harder today than we did when fuel was at 3.50, but a lot of that is driven by the technology that quite frankly we didn’t have.And so we had to go make that investment to get that technology to see some of these costs.Gotcha.Thank you very much for that.So it sounds like the current fleet allocation is about 14% propane, do you expect a deceleration and you are push to more towards propane given how attractive sort of the gas based fuel contracts are right now or are you still going to push in the better proportion or larger proportion of propane allocated fleet?This is Pat Vaughan.Our 2020 goal is to move the fleet up from the 14.3% to 25%, so we’re going to continue to market and our school districts as Denis mentioned parents love it and obviously our P&L love it because of the saving and the cost per mile is being significantly reduced.They are easier to maintain right?So from maintenance point of view, it’s a gas engine with a fuel injection system in it you know versus the diesel combustion engine, right?Exactly, exactly.The - just in terms of the operating expenses, the operating expenses for the maintaining of the propane versus diesel and the propane would change eight quarts of oil, on a diesel you change 16 quarts of oil.So from maintenance cost perspective significantly better, from a cost per mile perspective significantly better and obviously better for the environment.And our final question comes from the line of Johnson Lamers with BMO Capital Markets.You line is now open.Just circling back on the analyst question about the CapEx range for fiscal 2017, 40 million to 45 million those discussed, is that total replacement CapEx including leasing?No, no, no, that’s just a replacement, so we’ve taken that down by about $20 million to $25 million versus you know fiscal ‘16, our projections for ‘17 will be $20 million to $25 million less than fiscal ‘ 16.But I think also as Pat noted and I just want to clear that this is all quite frankly subject to the bidding season, we are purposely - you know we used to go around and you saw that in my comment, we covered ourselves at being 95% renewal over 18 years that means when customers comes with us, they stay with us.So you know we’ve had an excellent renewal over 18 years, we’re on our fourth set of five year renewals, you know what I mean.So in this particular case thought, we’ve come off of these five year contracts with no increases and we’re saying to our very good customers we can’t do this anymore, we need to get price increases from you.So we’ve had - some of them are regulated by you know stack dibbing loss where those say, if you don’t accept CPI, you must go to bid, so we will take the risk and put those to bid.But what we’re seeing is prices are coming in significantly higher and so that’s a risk we’re prepared to take.We also know that we don’t a pure 20% a year of our contracts coming due, so a five year deal, you’d say okay, well 20% should come due every year.We don’t necessarily have that because we’ve been very good at getting longer term contracts.We’ve been very good at extending contracts prior to their expiration.So you know the market is going up and we’re actually stocking some contracts that we got to maintain.The once that we can we are kind of forcing out the dib in some cases.But what this also has led to Jon is that it’s led to our ability to sit down with our customers and negotiated increased.So for example in three school districts in Texas, we’re able to negotiate a very high single digit rate increases versus - single rate increase, digit rate increase for the renewal versus the CPI of 1%.So those are the kinds of that, because again the customer they are saying geez, if we go to market we are seeing price just come in 15%, 20%, 25% higher in certain cases, so customers are now quick to draw back and say, okay what do we got to do, so that’s why we’re also pushing the telematics, we are pushing the - let’s get more efficient for you, you know can we run less busses for you, can we help you reduce the cost in that particular way.And so that’s the real challenge for us, but it’s a really good challenge for us to have right now.Okay.And Pat Walker, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a retroactive fuel tax credit benefited the fuel expenses in the quarter by I think was 800,000 to $900,000?That was just a retroactive piece, okay.So do you have an updated guidance for fuel expenses as a percent of sales for the full year 2016?No, I think, I don’t know that we have guidance, but you know I think, Pat we’re probably comfortable that we were going to be - go ahead, I am sorry.I would say, we kind of - we anticipated to some degree that credit begin passed not that were genius is in terms of legislation or anything.So I would think pretty much that was included in where our thoughts were originally Johnson.I just go back and look at, I don’t know that was what we thought fiscal ‘16 was ultimately going to come in at and that we thought ‘17 - I am sorry - ‘15was going to coming in, ;16 was going to be a bit lower.Right.Okay, and I think the company had discusses overall EBITDA margin improvement in the range of 1% to 1.5%?Would that still be appropriate or given the lower maintenance expense and lower fuel expense and some of the cost efficiencies this quarter would high range be appropriate at this point?Jon, I think I’d be you know - I’d be loving to have two.I think we are kind of pretty well on target for the 0.5.Okay.And just on the productivity and cost efficiencies, can you give me any sense of how that may have impacted cost this quarter, I saw maintenance expense declined, was that related to a decline in the frequency of as a shop for maintenance repairs for example, now that you have all the telematics data on the maintenance needs of the buses?I think Pat Vaughan is going to answer, but I think also you got to consider the fact that we’ve gotten more rest of our warranty, more rest of our part rebates and things like that as well, our purchasing side has been really improved too.Yeah, I think it’s fair to say we’ve been aggressive on negotiating side, on the purchasing side also over the past 12 to 18 months and we just finished our installs at as Denis pointed out over 150 locations of the system, a maintenance system within each location and with that thus far as give us visibility in terms of the cost write-down to the vehicle and also the vehicle’s utilization.So as an example some of the 350 to 400 that we’re going to be able trip by way of improved efficiency comes through improving the utilization at the locations, have been spoke maintenance as well.And in terms of compliance in managing the assets much better, we are now properly equipped to be able to monitor each location and have a higher quality of maintenance.Okay and then one last, the $12 million to $15 million annual revenue run rate, was that for the overall asset including SafeStop and management consulting services?Hey, Jon, it’s Tom Kominsky, great to hear from you.Yeah, that’s absolutely right, it’s the consolidated group of businesses.Thanks Jon and welcome.We appreciate you, your first time on our call and obviously one of our new analyst.Thank you.Hi guys.Just a question about your payout ratio, can you tell me where that is currently and where you might see it going in the coming quarters up ahead here?Yeah, I mean Greg, we kind of look at this on an annual basis and we anticipated this year being in the low 70s, you know last year I think we’re probably 74, I think we this year begin 70 or 71 and going forward we expect that to be in the low to mid-60s, you know but again on an annual basis.And is that comfortable, is that where your goal is, I mean is it comfortable now, is it would it be - is it your goal to reduce that further going ahead?I think our goal is always to get it reduced right, and we’ve been working towards that.You know we’ve been able to bring it down three years in a row.The goal is to more it further.We don’t have a bottom to it.We’d love to have it as low as possible.We think with some of the efforts that we’re doing maybe some increase share buyback; we’ve got room and availability to do some share buyback.We can continue to lower that as well too.So you know the long term goal is to get into the - with the five hand on it and get people stop, again we’re going to - we just approved our 138 consecutive monthly dividend, we’ve been doing this awhile.Chini, we’ve got to wrap it up.We’ve got to get back to work, we got kids to take the school this afternoon and I got to drive probably, so.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference.This does conclude our program.You may now disconnect.Everyone have a great day.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.Error in this transcript?Let us know .</div></body></html>
