opening remarks, Tracy will then review the first quarter results for the three months period ending January 31, 2016 in more detail.After Tracy's remarks, we will answer as many of your questions as we can as is our normal practice, we will only take questions from analysts and institutional investors during the Q&A session.We also offer other shareholders the opportunity to submit questions in advance of our earnings call.Instructions regarding such submissions are included in our press release announcing the date and time of our call.As we expected our results in the first quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment.In particular, we continue to experience demand weakness in the oil and gas and mining specialty markets.Many of our products for these specialty markets require specific product and solution expertise and tend to have higher gross profit margins.As a result, our gross profit margins for the quarter were negatively impacted.We are also seeing downward pressure on pricing in certain of our markets, particularly within our Superior markets.In light of these market conditions, we are continuing to focus on those factors we can control to position OCC for future success.We continue to pursue opportunities to increase sales, realize operations, efficiencies, and we will reduce cost to improve our bottom-line results.We’ve received positive feedback from our customers on our new product lines which we expect to drive future top-line growth.In addition, we continue to invest in product innovation in order to extend our broad suite of top tier and upgraded connectivity in cabling solutions.In fact, as you may have seen in a press release this morning, we are excited to announce that we have received a notice of allowance for the patent application covering printed circuit board and related technologies that enable the achievements of the pending Category A performance standard in the popular RJ-45 modular connector.We believe this groundbreaking technology is a key to unlocking high-speed Cat 8 performance in a cost-effective manner.OCC has long been a leader in copper data communication connectivity and this announcement is another example of our capability.Today, our expertise reputation for innovation is growing far beyond the pioneering designs of fiber optic cables for which we are well known.Building on our acquisitions of SMP Data Communications and Applied Optical Systems, we have created a comprehensive range of top-tier fiber optic and copper connectivity and structured cabling management products and solutions.With this comprehensive and innovative suite of product offerings and solutions, and our commitment and our continuing product innovation, we have a strong foundation in place.In addition, OCC continues to have a strong market position.We believe we are well positioned for growth and success and we are taking the right steps to enhance shareholder value.I will now turn the call over to Tracy Smith to review some specifics regarding our first quarter of fiscal year 2016.Thank you, Neil.The company achieved consolidated net sales of $14 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, compared to net sales of $17.4 million for the same period last year.We experienced a decrease in net sales in both our enterprise and specialty markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to the same period last year.As Neil mentioned, OCC’s net sales continued to be negatively impacted by the decrease in demand in the oil and gas and mining specialty markets, due to continued macroeconomic weakness in these markets.Additionally, we are also continuing to see downward pressure on pricing in certain markets, particularly the wireless carrier market.Net sales outside of the United States continue to be negatively impacted by the strong US dollar relative to other international currencies.Gross profit was $3.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 24.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to 31% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.Net sales decreases in certain specialty markets and pricing pressures in certain markets, particularly the wireless carrier market, negatively impacted gross profit during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to the same period last year.The lower gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 when compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower sales volumes overall.Additionally, the sale of certain lower margin products negatively impacted our gross profit margins.Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis and may vary based on changes in product mix.SG&A expenses decreased to 11.1% to $5.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $5.7 million for the same period last year.SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 36.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to 33% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.The decrease in SG&A expenses was a result of targeted cost reduction efforts across all expense categories.For the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we reported a net loss attributable to OCC of $1.7 million or $0.28 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $228,000 or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.As of January 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $6 million on our revolving credit facility and $1.6 million in available credits.We also had outstanding loan balances of $7.2 million under our real estate term
