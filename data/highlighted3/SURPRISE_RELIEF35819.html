year 2016 is a year of great potential for us, but we're also watching the energy markets carefully and evaluating the impact of oil prices on our businesses, particularly those located along the Gulf Coast.Overall I am pleased with our results for the fourth quarter.The integration of the nuclear and industrial operations at WSI is complete and already generating benefits in customer service, improved efficiency and effectiveness.Our legacy galvanizing and electrical businesses continue to perform well in spite of some bad weather and lower rig activity.We are making progress with NOI and key operational metrics are improving which bodes well for fiscal year 2016.We are gaining traction on several important M&A activities including a few international joint ventures.We remain committed to maintaining disciplined M&A process and never getting deal fever.WSI is benefitting from improved operational performance and a more normal nuclear outage cycle.The high refinery utilization rates and strikes in the fourth quarter did generate headwinds for WSI but we are optimistic as we head into the new fiscal year.We look for WSI to benefit from their continued international focus and rebuild North American sales team and are seeing a high level of activity already in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.Our galvanizing business is solid and has accelerated several new products and service growth initiatives.The price of oil has a limited impact on this segment but generally we feel good about the upside in this business both organic and inorganic growth.We remain active on the M&A front in this segment.For galvanizing services we will continue to focus on operational excellence, pricing on our value and continued growth through acquisitions and also new metal finishing services.We have a fairly high concentration of galvanizing capacity in the US Gulf Coast area.So are monitoring the economic impact of low oil prices careful, so far the impact has been small, though we are seeing a few fabrication project delays.For our legacy electrical business the results overall are meeting our expectations with some businesses doing well and others being a little more challenged.This platform's overall performance is reasonably good given their mixed market conditions.The electric utility market in the U.S remains sluggish, but we have benefitted from strong international opportunities and a good backlog.We are optimistic about the opportunities, as we enter fiscal year of 2016.We are focused on establishing international joint ventures to provide quick market access and on improving their operational efficiencies and customer service.The legacy electrical platform as with the Galvanizing has a stable leadership team and solid operating performance and also some good niche technology.The exposure to oil pricing effects is relatively small for this platform and focused on the API to been a hazardous duty lightning businesses.These represent approximately 5% of AZZ's overall revenues.We are also focused on keep fundamentals during fiscal year 2015 and improved our tax position and emphasis on cash efficiency.Additionally, we have aligned our incentive programs more closely with the investor community.We have converted our profit sharing program to a performance based bonus program, this program designed predominately around operating income, cash flow, return on assets and productivity.To help drive results to every employee is now a participant in the incentive program.We have also extended equity based compensation deeper into our management ranks.I'm happy to be here at AZZ believe we have the leadership team, products, capabilities and balance sheet to generate above market results for a long time.We have taken a lot of the actions during fiscal year 2015 that have positioned us for a stronger performance in fiscal year 2016.Based on our confidence, we are confirming our previously announced guidance range for fiscal year 2016 at $2.75 to $3.25 EPS and $875 million to $925 million in revenue.Thank you, Tom.For the fiscal year 2015, we reported record net sales of $816.7 million an increase of $65 million or 8.6% over the prior year, EPS also grew 8.6% to $2.52 and our backlog finished at $332.6 million up 2.3% versus last year and up 10.8% sequentially from the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We were also successful in theories of focus for the year taxes and cash.Our effective tax rate fell from 36.5% in fiscal 2014 to 27.9% for fiscal 2015 and we closed to 10.1% growth in cash flow from operations year-over-year that's up $10.9 million to a $118.2 million.As for our full year statement results, fiscal 2015 revenues in our energy segment were up 10.1% to $458.3 million compared to the prior year, our operating income fell 13.1% to $38.7 million compared to the prior year reflecting the effect of cost related to our previously announced realignment program and projects cost over runs at NOI and WSI recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.In our Galvanizing services segment full year revenues grew 6.8% to $358.3 million compared to fiscal 2014, yet operating income rose just under 1% to $88.6 million compared to the prior year and was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions and higher zinc cost we paid during the year.Looking at fourth quarter performance.Since fourth quarter of 2015, we reported revenues of a $182.3 million and EPS of $0.63, as compared to a $181 million in revenue and EPS of $0.40 in the same quarter last year.Our fourth quarter book to build ratio of 1.18 drove backlog up to $332.6 million.We expect to shift 24% of that backlog outside of the U.S.The effective tax rate for the quarter fell from 39% in the fourth quarter last year to 14.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.As for our segments in the fourth quarter revenues for the energy segments for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 fell to $97.2 million, as compared to $103.5 million in the same quarter last year.A drop of 6.1% actually driven by the effect of strives at certain refineries, we expect to be able to recover this delayed refinery projects during fiscal 2016.Operating income for energy increased to 6% to $9.8 million compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year.Operating margins for the fourth quarter we're 10.1% for the quarter as compared to 8.9% in the prior year period.Revenues for the galvanizing service segment for the fourth quarter we're $85.1 million compared to $77.5 million in the same quarter of and saying three of last year and increase of 9.8% from a combination of the acquisition result our Juliet plant being fully online and organic growth.Operating income was $20.3 million as compared to year period an increase of 8.8%.Operating margins for the fourth quarter we're 23.9% compared to 24.1% in the same period of last year.We believe that our ability to generate cash and our strong balance sheet are two of our core strengths and when coupled with the access to borrowings under our existing banking agreements we can support growing our operating platform.During fiscal 2015 we paid down about $68 million in debt driving a yearend balance of $337.8 million while further improving our leverage ratios.We also used our cash to purchase [indiscernible] galvanization business and to increase our dividends to our shareholders.I'm very pleased with the progress we've made this year on key fundamentals, like cash flow generation, working capital, management, SG&A cost control, tax efficiency and creating a much greater focus on returns on capital deployed.For fiscal 2016 we expect to continue to focus on driving returns on capital, cost control and cash generation and we expect to achieve an effective tax rate closer to 33% for the year although there may be variances between quarters,.With that I'll turn it back to Tom for concluding remarks, Tom?Thanks Paul.The key takeaways that I'd like to leave with are these, I believe AZZ remains a compelling investment due to our 28 year profitable operations, our strong balance sheet and cash flows, great portfolio of products and services, significant international growth opportunities, and a talented and seasoned leadership team.We will continue to focus on growing our galvanizing business both organically and through acquisitions, we will continue to expand the presence of our electrical businesses internationally both directly and through joint ventures, we are accelerating our emphasis on operational excellence and customer service at both WSI and NLI.While we have made significant progress over the past year we have tremendous upside going forward as our leadership team continues to gain traction on our key initiatives and our customers experience the improvement in our service performance.We are looking forward to continuing improvement in our businesses and greater impact from our new growth strategies as we enter fiscal year 2016.Thank you, we will now begin the question and answer session, [Operator Instructions].The first question will come from John Franzreb of Sidoti and Company, please go ahead.Good morning Tom and Paul.I'd like to start with the galvanizing business.Another quarter of -- we'll call it below historic norms on the operating margin.Last quarter you called out pricing pressures.Seems to me that you are calling out the weather.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you kind of talk to what 's having the <i>greater</i> impact on the margin profile , now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And, how does it play out going forward?The weather impacted our volume a little bit in the quarter.Particularly, along the Gulf coast, there as I mentioned last time -- we did have some new competition come into the market, so there are some pricing pressures and, quite frankly, the growth in the Gulf coast market didn't really materialize as people have been expecting with a large petrochemical build out for obvious reasons.But also, we've taken some large projects, at lower prices and the cost of asset has gone up fairly significantly.So those are all the things that have happened in the last couple of quarters to our galvanizing business.I think, going forward, we are seeing more stabilized cost on acid, we've got a lot of initiatives to reduce our usage of acid and the fact that we are driving project activity and the new products, I think, are going to have a positive impact going forward on our margins.New services, providing more all-inclusive service capabilities to the customer base in the form of more sandblasting, more pickup and delivery transportation services, trying to be more of a -- I had to call it a one-stop shop, but because of our size and our presence in so many parts of the country, we are well-positioned to take on additional services and then we do have some new technologies we are not quite ready to talk about that we think will help impact more towards the end of the year or even in outer years.Okay.Great.And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the nuclear business -- I think you phrased it is more normalized.Could you talk a little bit about the outage cycle for the first half of the year how it's looking compared to your expectations going into the year and discuss that at some length?I think the good news, for us, and what we are looking at is our coating activity into the nuclear segment it is up and we are seeing not just more opportunities, but larger opportunities in both our WSI and NLI operations.So, when we say it's normalized, it's because we are seeing more activity.In the US marketplace, we do have some international initiatives.But for the most part, it's -- our coverage is US.So, our sales organizations are feeling better about what they're seeing.They are seeing more activity and whether it's more outages I haven't looked at the numbers in the last month or two.But, at least there's more activity on the outages that we are participating in.Okay and one last question.What do you think about how the structure, the energy segment looks now?We've been there for a while.You've done some realignment.Is there further moves that have to be made?Or are you comfortable with the structure as it now stands?Very comfortable with the structure, now.I've got three good general managers over the three different business segments.The Vice President over legacy electrical has been here, I think, 27 years.Long-standing executive.Once we integrated WSI, and really integrated the leadership team, integrated the operational structure between nuclear and industrial, we still have separate sales forces in that organization.The Vice President and the general manager of WSI and SMS, real solid performance.It doesn't really show up in our numbers that much, yet, but it made a lot of headway and we are seeing, how we are quoting, the ability to take market share because the sales force is back in place.And, just the better level of service and management that we are bringing to bear there and then, on NLI, the general manager there was brought in, I believe, May of last year.So, coming up on one year under his belt.And once again, the results aren't reflecting at, yet, in the financials.But, our on-time deliveries are up, our cost of quality is down.The plant is a different plant than it was a year ago.So, feeling good about that organizational structure.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Tom , Paul , I <b>wonder</b> if maybe just help me get comfortable with where the revenue guidance is right now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At the midpoint, it seems like you're expecting a rather kind of a sizable acceleration in the growth profile of the businesses.Kind of help me understand, what did you lose maybe in fiscal Q4 that you think you're going to get back in fiscal 2016?How do we get again how do we kind of get comfortable with where that guidance is?I guess especially in light of the fact that the backlog is only modestly up at this point on a year-over-year basis and the electrical order patterns have actually been down in the last couple of quarters.So, again, maybe just talk about where you see the opportunities?Yes.Good question, Schon.Let's start with NLI and I will remind you we've been talking about probably ever quarter, the delayed large projects in NLI.We anticipate those shipping this year and I don't know that we've given any real numbers around it.It's over $25 million of these past due or delayed projects that we anticipate will go out.So, there is one big difference as we go into 2016.Two is WSI.We have really pulled in the rains once we integrated the management team.Stop taking what I consider to be riskier jobs.Beefed-up the contractual reviews and we've walked away from projects in the last couple of quarters that just didn't meet our risk profile.And part of that was clear in the decks, so that WSI could perform could perform on the projects what that they do take.Get new technology, in terms of welding solutions, brought to bear.And, let the organization stabilize.So, we anticipate in a more normalized refinery turnaround cycle, as well as just a better presence in the US nuclear outages as we talked about.We are going to have nice increase in activity and shipments at WSI and SMS.And then on the electrical, most of what you've seen in the downturn over the last couple of quarters, or call it stagnant sales activity, it's our tubing business, our lighting business, the ones that are exposed to rig counts and price of oil.That business is off and we don't insist it that's not we are not anticipating that's going to come back significantly, at all.So, that's what's not in our guidance.And the other electrical pieces is, we are looking at a normal year.It's we're seeing opportunities some of it will come from taking market share and some of it will come from the better presence internationally in China and the Middle East.But, we are not looking for dramatic improvement on the electrical side.Because of the headwinds from the price boil.Okay.And then maybe, if we could address the margin profiles of these businesses as we go into fiscal 2016.I mean it sounds like maybe there is some internal work that you can do with galvanizing in terms of sourcing, but maybe not a lot of change there maybe, I don't know.As you look, maybe particularly at the energy business, what should we anticipate kind of getting back as we move into fiscal '16?So I think about the cost overruns that you had earlier in the year and some of the lower margin projects.You get a little bit of the purchase accounting back, what is reasonable in terms of the margin profile for energy as we go into '16?Could we be looking at another 100 basis points, 200 basis points of margin expansion there?What's a reasonable outlook?You pretty well nailed it, Schon.Paul will probably comment here in a second.NLI will not have those really ugly -- what they did ship was ugly, as we've talked about.They took some pretty large losses on jobs.Those are gone.The projects that have remained in their backlog that are delayed are much better margin.And, mostly around our performance on those jobs, is far better.In the legacy electrical, that's pretty much normal stuff.We will anticipate a little bit of improvement there from operating improvement activities, a little bit of some of the international stuff and then we are anticipating much better performance out of WSI.That is just where mid-single digit margins was kind of ugly and it's indicative of all of the changes that one, needed to be made, but two, in my view we were late making them by about a full-year before we really integrated the management, put the businesses back together, started to leverage the operating platform and leverage the resources.So, all of that is behind us.So, yes, we are looking for 100, 200 basis points, is well within my expectations.But Paul may want to give you a few more specifics there.That's exactly it.I actually won't give you specifics on where we are going to put those segments, but I think Tom nailed it, we've been talking about it for the last year that really the value here is getting NLI and WSI turned around, if you will.We've been talking about this for a while, that we see WSI is definitely answering the helm.We see improvements going on there.They ran into a little bit of headwind in the fourth quarter based on the strikes.Otherwise, the operating margins were actually up on the energy side of the fourth quarter, year-over-year.We are expecting NLI to do the same thing.We were starting to see the green shoots of spring come forward there and those are going to be the two areas of improvement for the year.That's our expectation.Quick question, first.Is there any way you can quantify just how much the strike you think impacted revenues and profitability within the energy segment?Well there is actually -- it's hard to put an exact number on a.We think that it's probably revenue wise around $6 million to $10 million-ish.And I will also say, Noelle that from what we've seen those strikes are over, they're still negotiating in a couple places, but that's done.Okay.Great.And then second, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on some of the segments within galvanizing, specifically most curious to hear about the electric transmission side.Just what you are seeing in that market -- in the submarket in terms of demand now and how you are thinking about those moving into '16.Noelle, what you're seeing on the transmission distribution side is some nice upticks.It remained stable.We are seeing a much more solid year ahead of us than we did last year.On the solar market, we are still seeing nice, steady growth in that area, it's much smaller projects as we discussed in previous calls but it's still good, solid business for us.Okay.Obviously, some of these Petrochem projects aren't materializing to the extent you were expecting but are you starting to see -- are you seeing a little bit of an uptick in demand there?We've seen some nice fourth quarter especially, we saw some nice project rolling forward.It looks to be solid for us throughout the year with some impact of the oil prices still remains a little sketchy going beyond FY16.Okay.And then also, on the industrial side, I know that's a relatively sizable market within galvanizing.Are you seeing -- what we are hearing from a lot of larger industrial companies is that broadly industrial is slowing down because of the oil price declines.Is that something that you are seeing, or is actively there holding in relatively?Right now, what we consider the industrial market is so well diversified we are looking at it to remain stable for us throughout the year.We are seeing a little bit of weakness on specific projects but overall, the OEM outlook is remains some very solid for us and is overshadowing a little bit of weakness we are seeing in the industrial market.Okay.Perfect.And then Tom, I want to go back to your comments on the JVs in the international markets and then also the comment you made in your press release that you are aggressively pursuing international expansion.Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the markets that you see as most attractive and just how the potential acquisition candidates, how kind of pricing is looking in the markets?Sure.That's a couple of good points, there.We don't have a large international presence.WSI is located has a facility in Poland and headquartered out in the Netherlands.We've got some new relatively new operations, in Brazil and then we've got several of our businesses are up in Canada.So as we look at a lot of the growth opportunities for our high voltage bus and our medium voltage bus products are in the Middle East and in China.And we need to have more of a local presence and we really just don't want to go by ourselves in this case.So, a big factor there being speed to market and familiarity with the rules and customs in the regions.But that's where we have a lot of opportunities and those opportunities are going to continue for several years.That's where we are looking at joint ventures.With the new Vice President of business development that we brought on a few months ago has very good contacts in those areas and very seasoned in those international markets.As well as, most of the people we've either promoted or brought on into the ranks on the team have a lot of international experience.So, we feel very comfortable, at this point.We are in some negotiations.Obviously, I don't want to get into any specifics.But over the next quarter or two, you'll see some of those announced.And I just think that assures that the opportunities we are bidding today we'll be able to close and bring in and that's on the electrical side, primarily although, we have made some additions to the sales team, primarily and WSI and NLI to focus on the international side.And then, we are looking at some new reps and we've tightened up our rep agreements.But, at the same time, we want to change over some of the reps that have been around a long time and haven't generated much for us.So, as we go into and that would include Latin America because, we've been doing some things on the technology front for some of our products, so that they comply with international electrical standards and we can move them into Latin America relatively easily.So we've kicked off an initiative there that's been under way for a relatively short time.On the pure acquisition and divestiture side, we talked about the divestitures were on the electrical platform related to more of the oil and gas side and that's just we put it on hold.The pricing in that market, right now, when it be conducive to divesting asset that are reasonably good for us.We just think that there is probably other people that can do more strategically with them then we can.But, were not willing to give them away.On the acquisition side, I think mostly it's around galvanizing.I don't think it is mostly around galvanizing.We've got some good activities ongoing and obviously we've got NDAs in place on both sides of those, so we can talk about them.But we've been they been under way for a few months.These are not brand-new things.These are ones we've been negotiating.So, you can anticipate, hopefully we'll have some positive news here in over the next few months.And so that the difference would be Zalk and yes I will put you in the ballpark on Zalk it's for fiscal 2015 versus 2014, your revenues is up about $4 million.Okay.And then the margin uptick in the energy segment on lower sales, nice to see, was mix a big benefit to you this quarter, because you would have had less kind of services turnaround work or can we kind of look at this as more operating efficiencies driving the improvement?Well, believe me tell you what.Actually, I'm not going to call it mix.I think we are seeing some operational improvement on the energy side.It's still early days, so that should improve as the quarters play out in fiscal year 2016.So I hate to call it mix, too because I think, when we look at -- we are trying to drive margin up in all of our businesses on the energy front and, like I said, you will see the benefit of improved margins at NLI.They were up in the fourth quarter.But, it's still pretty marginal.Basically, everything was up except for what we saw going on with the headwinds at WSI.So, you are getting a nice positive tailwind from all of them.Okay.Fair enough and then the uptick in quoting activity on the nuclear side, is this safety upgrades, or what is it you are specifically seeing right now?It's kind of across the boards we're seeing some upgrade projects, we're seeing some safety-related projects, we're seeing just the delayed components for maintenance are now being -- are now active.So, it's kind of like they've got to spend some money now to keep their facilities running.They've stabilized around what the regulations are.Even though, as we read pretty regularly, they are not real profitable, these are just activities they have to go forward with and some of it is compliance.But most of it is just the delayed maintenance that needs to take place.Nothing on the nuclear side.There is noise out there, but nothing that I'd consider even firm enough to be budgetary quotations, at this point.Okay.One last one if I could.With the refineries strikes causing some delays in turnaround work I think you put a rough number around it, $6 million to $10 million.Does that potentially fall here into the first quarter?Is a kind of spread across the year?How do we think about that?A - I think it falls into the fourth quarter and then coating activity for the fall season turnaround cycle is also pretty high.Those are things -- how quickly they actually spend that, because there are some offsets, there are some companies that are delaying maintenance activities, the integrated oil companies.So, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, but we're very active right now in the first quarter and we are very active on quotations for the fall outage season.So, whether it's falling into this quarter it's going to fall later in the year, they are going to happen because this is maintenance that needs to occur.Turning back to NLI and WSI, obviously expecting some nice improvement in margins in those businesses here this year but as we look forward, how much more improvement can we see in those businesses, sort of, independent of any really meaningful increases in the top line?I guess I'm just trying to get a better sense than what more can be done internally to improve those margins, any comments in that regard?I think there's a couple of things, one, the sales organization on the WSI side, the rebuilt sales organization is already allowing us to either regain old market share or take a new market share, whichever way you want to look at it but also, as they are doing that, they are back out there selling our value in the real high-quality solution capability that WSI brings to covered vessels, to containment shells, things like that, that there's not a lot of companies out there to do.But we lost those relationships.So, I think part of this is, as we are able to demonstrate that value again to old customers that may be coming back to us, you are looking at a couple of hundred basis points down the road for them in the longer-term.We will see maybe a little of it this year but I think most of it actually comes post fiscal year 16.Over and above what we already have in our guidance for this year.NLI, we've got to normalize that business and decide what it really needs to be going forward.So there's some decisions we made to make.It's going to have a big shipment year this year because of the delayed big projects in its backlog.So, this year, would actually be somewhat of an anomaly just like fiscal year 2015 for NLI was an anomaly on the low side.But there, we are going after new services.We have invested some capital and new equipment for seismic testing, for instance and I think on a normalized basis, once again, I'll stick with that 200 basis points 300 basis points of margin improvement beyond this fiscal year is where we are trying to take them.In the NLI case, we may decide to maintain them at a somewhat smaller revenue level than we have this year.So those are the things that we'll talk about as this year wears on before we get into next year.Yeah, correct.At WSI, they've got their marching orders.The team's in place.They've been taking the actions.The sales force is rebuilt and engaged and internationally they are in good shape.Poland is a great operation for us and Brazil has come up nicely, in spite of lower activity levels at Petrobras.NLI, the team's in place.They've taken a lot of the actions.We've got to clear those backlogs that we've been talking about and then see where we are at.Second question looks like you could generate another good year of free cash flow.I assume that's going to continue to be directed towards debt repayment and on a broader sense, how you look at the capital structure and what kind of leverage you think is appropriate for this business?It's Paul.I'll stay consistent with what we said in the past, which is we are a lot more comfortable between one and two times levered than over two, obviously we'll pay down to do the math yourself, record about two in the quarter turns EBITDA right now.We've done the other things, made small acquisitions, in the last year and Tom's already talked about we are active in M&A and we will continue to drive for that kind of low leverage and utilize the cash flow to add on to the operations of the business.We are not calling it out right now and say there's a normalized level that will stay about the same.But, if we look at some buy versus build for the year.And ladies and gentlemen.This will conclude our questions and answer session.I would like to hand the conference back over to Tom Ferguson for this closing remarks.Very good.Thank you for participating in today's call.And we look forward to talking with all of you again at the conclusion of this current quarter.Again, thank you and have a great day.Ladies and gentlemen.The conference has now concluded.We thank you for attending today's presentation.You may now disconnect your lines.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this
