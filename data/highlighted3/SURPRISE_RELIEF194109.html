Manufacturing: A Tale Of 2 Economies?| Seeking Alpha The economy has reached a critical stage in this recovery.While construction spending has accelerated, manufacturing activity is fast approaching stall speed.Despite the growing concerns about manufacturing, new orders remain near their all-time highs.The economy is approaching a very critical moment right now.Many sectors are doing rather well, particularly those with more of a domestic focus like housing, autos, restaurants and certain aspects of technology just to name a few.On the flip side, any business related to energy, materials, manufacturing or commodities is having a terrible year.Crude oil prices remain trapped below $50 a barrel, and they show no signs of breaking out to the upside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices continue to trade near their all-time lows.And with the exception of coffee, virtually the entire commodity complex is flat on its back.As if all of that weren't enough, both stocks and bonds have at last entered correction territory for the first time in four years.From the macro perspective, the fact that the S&P 500 now trades below its 200 day moving average just about says it all.So is now the time to start passing out the "crying towels"?Well, before we answer that, investors ought to consider some of the recent economic data releases which we discuss below.On that score, the data for construction spending and ISM Manufacturing data present an interesting contrast for investors to consider.To begin with, we note that construction activity remains one of the most notable strengths in the economy, In fact, based on the latest data from the Census Bureau, private construction spending is now expanding at an annualized rate of 16+% on a year over year basis where it now stands at an annualized level of $787 billion.Interestingly enough, the growth rates for residential and nonresidential construction are essentially identical which illustrates how broadly this expansion seems to be.It's worth noting that when you include public construction spending ($298 billion), total U.S. construction spending now exceeds $1 trillion.As we show in Figure 1 below, this represents a tremendous acceleration in spending since the beginning of 2015.The doomsday crowd likes to remind us that current construction spending levels of $1.085 Trillion brings us back to near the peak levels we saw in mid-2006.And while that may be true, that statement ignores the fact that private residential construction spending remains well below where it needs to be.When you consider the effects of total population growth (both organically and from immigration), the U.S. needs at least 1.5 million new housing units each year to meet overall demand.With building activity providing only 1.2 million new units on an annualized basis, the homebuilders still have a lot of unmet demand out there.Although there are regional differences for sure, rising home prices clearly reflect the broader imbalance in the housing market.It is also worth noting here that rising construction levels are having a welcome impact on GDP.All one needs to do is watch the construction spending counterparts: Residential and nonresidential fixed investment data.Bearing in mind that the fixed investment data coming from the BEA includes more aspects of the building process than does the construction spending data, the growth has been nothing short of impressive.In fact, as of the latest reading for Q2 2015, residential fixed investment reached $600 Billion for the first time since 2007.Meanwhile, nonresidential fixed investment now stands at an annualized rate of $2.3 Trillion, the largest amount on record.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although not too <b>surprising</b> , the ISM Manufacturing Index declined yet again in September to a level of just 50.2 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While this data still suggests positive growth, the margin for error is getting pretty slim here.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's worth noting that because monthly ISM manufacturing data is highly correlated to Industrial Production growth rates , the pullback in ISM data should come as little <b>surprise</b> given that August IP data revealed a deceleration in year to year growth rate to just 0.9 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>IF there is a trend here, it's not looking good.Meanwhile, the decline in the New Orders component of ISM Manufacturing could be throwing out the proverbial caution flag.As one of the most reliable leading indicators, no one should be happy to see the new orders index sitting at 50.1.To be sure, this is not the first time this has occurred in this recovery, but things have changed quite dramatically since the ISM pulled back in 2012.Apart from the ongoing secular decline in manufacturing output, things are really different this time.Indeed, the strong U.S. dollar is wreaking havoc among our globally-diversified manufacturers.And lest we forget, a strong dollar also plays a role in driving down commodity prices throughout most of the commodity complex.Granted, one can argue that commodities are merely an input cost for many businesses, thus improving the profit outlook for many firms.But on a global basis, a number of commodity-centric economies are really having a rough go of it.And that, of course, leads to lower demand for our exports, which are now having a negative impact on GDP.Before writing off the entire manufacturing sector, it's important to look at some additional data from the Census Bureau.As we show in Figure 3 below, Manufacturers new orders appear to be sticking within a range of $65 to $70 Billion on an annualized basis.At first glance one might assume that New Orders peaked one year ago and that there appears to be no discernible growth profile at all.But we can't lose sight of the fact that $65 to $70 Billion of new order activity represents some of the strongest levels on record.Moreover, this data excludes aircraft orders, which have also been registering some of their strongest gains in history.It's well understood that housing has been one of the primary growth drivers for this economic recovery.And the fact that construction spending continues to accelerate, we see no reason to throw in the towel just yet.Granted, manufacturing data continues to frustrate many investors, however new orders activity from the Census Bureau presents us with a good reason to hang in there.As much as we respect ISM Manufacturing New Orders data, it's not the only indicator out there.Indeed, we think it's a real stretch to assume that manufacturers new orders are about to fall off the proverbial cliff.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
