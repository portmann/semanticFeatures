call.On today’s call are Mr. Zhengdong Zhu, Chairman and CEO; and Mr. Mark Marostica, co-CFO.During management’s prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.Following management’s prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.Before we start, we would like to remind listeners that this conference call contains forward-looking statements.These statements are made

the Company’s Investor Relations website at ir.cdeledu.com.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zhu to discuss the operational highlights.Mr. Zhu, Please go ahead.Thank you, everyone for joining our second quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call.Our operating results were released earlier and are available on our Company website as well as on the Internet newswire services.I will begin on slide four with an overview of our results.We achieved second quarter net revenue growth of 8.1% year-over-year, at the low end of our guidance range.Second quarter results were driven by our healthcare and accounting verticals, which delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 18% and 12% respectively, partially offset by continued sluggishness in our engineering and construction vertical, and a decrease in revenue from books and reference materials.Cash receipts from online course registration declined 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter.The decline was primarily due to lower than expected cash receipts in our healthcare vertical, which decreased by 14.9% year-over-year, partially offset by growth in cash receipts of our accounting vertical which were up 10.4% year-over-year.We believe the decrease in the healthcare cash receipts was primarily attributable to an earlier start to the enrollment season for our National Practicing Medical Doctor Qualification Examination test preparation courses, which kicked-off in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and a later start to the enrollment season for our National Pharmacist Qualification Examination test preparation courses compared to the year-ago period.The later start to the enrolment season for our National Pharmacist Examination test preparation courses is because the actual policy detailing the educational and professional qualifications of a license pharmacist has yet to be released by the government, creating uncertainly among prospective students and resulting in slower enrollments and cash revenue growth for our licensed pharmacist test preparation courses.While we experienced weakness in healthcare cash revenue in the second quarter, we remain optimistic about the significant long-term growth prospects of our healthcare vertical.The standard of medical care in China is rising dramatically, fueling greater need for more effective healthcare education.With our years of healthcare education experience together with our leadership position in China’s growing online professional education industry, we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this trend.I’ll now spend a few minutes updating you on our previously announced plan to acquire Xiamen NetinNet Software Company Limited.We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition in April 2016.Xiamen NetinNet is a leading learning simulation software provider specializing in practical accounting related learning solutions for China’s college market.We believe it is a perfect fit to enhance our suite of learning solutions within our growing College Cooperation Program by enabling us to offer comprehensive simulation based learning opportunities to college students to master critical accounting skills.With more than 1,300 college customers, Xiamen NetinNet also provides unique cross-selling opportunities to our College Cooperation Program.In addition, we plan to integrate learning modules of Xiamen NetinNet accounting software with our online platform in an effort to serve not only college students but accounting professionals as well.Looking ahead, while our growth strategy is underpinned by organic growth and internally developed programs, our Xiamen NetinNet acquisition demonstrates how we also diligently seek and evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our financial and strategic criteria.Turning to Zhengbao Yucai, our business start-up training subsidiary; we continue to move forward with our plan to list Zhengbao Yucai on China’s New Third Board, as previously disclosed.We look forward to further enhancing the Company’s brand and visibility within the China market and opportunity to raise capital from the Chinese capital market to fund future growth.While we see compelling growth opportunities ahead for our business, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders.As announced during our last call, on February 24, 2016, we further increased our share repurchase program by an additional $20 million to a total of $40 million.As of March 31, 2016, we had repurchased approximately 1.6 million ADS in open market for a total consideration of $21.4 million, since the approval of our share repurchase program in August 2015.In addition, we also paid a special dividend of $31.1 million to our shareholders in January 2016.Together, the special dividend and share buyback activity through March 31, 2016 represent a return of $52.5 million to our shareholders.Both the share repurchase program and special dividend distribution underscore our confidence in the long-term value of the Company.Now, I will provide a brief update on our growth strategy.In an effort to broaden our market reach, we look for opportunities to offer new courses and enter new vertical markets.We are making good progress in the K-12 teacher continuing education, and currently have agreements in place in three provinces while we continue to focus on expanding our services to additional provinces.We look forward to further developing and growing our course portfolio in the future.Turning to our open learning platform.In the second quarter, total cash registration revenue from our opening learning platform grew 4.6% year-over-year to $1.9 million for courses and services delivered via our open learning platform or included a component of service commitment that required us to deliver online real-time interactive courses.We plan to continue to focus on developing China Distance Education as student’s premier lifelong learning partner.Our mobile learning platform continued to gain traction as well.The average number of daily active mobile users in the second quarter of our accounting and healthcare verticals increased 20% and 30% year-over-year, respectively.As of March 31, 2016, we offered 60 mobile applications with cumulative downloads of 14.5 million, up from 13 million at the end of the Lastly, our College Cooperation Program is progressing well.We have expanded the number of participating colleges to 340 compared with nearly 300 at the end of December 2015.And we are working hard to ensure the business processes and infrastructure associated with this program are in place to provide students with a high quality learning experience in their upcoming 2016-2017 college school year.Looking ahead, reaching a broader range of students through our college cooperation program, strengthening our leading position in existing verticals via exploring growth opportunities in other areas, expanding our presence in the lifelong learning market, enhancing mobile offerings, and further innovation in the area of big data will remain our key priorities.We are confident that our proven multi-pronged growth strategy will help us gain market share and further strengthen our industry leadership.This completes my update on our business operations and strategy.Now, I will turn the call over to Mark, our co-CFO, to walk you through our key operating metrics and financials.Mark, please go ahead.Thank you, Mr. Zhu.First, let me quickly summarize some of our key operating metrics on slides 7 and 8.In the second quarter, overall enrollments in our online accounting courses were up approximately 17% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong enrollment growth in CPA and continuing -- accounting continuing education courses.To the contrary, the decline in other accounting test preparation enrollments was primarily due to weakness in accounting certificate test preparation enrollments, partially offset by strong enrollment growth in our tax advisor courses, as the tax advisor exam was held in February 2016 but not held during fiscal 2015.The ASP decline for CPA courses was mainly due to enrollment mix as we stop offering higher ASP multi-year courses beginning in fiscal 2016.For other accounting test preparation courses, the ASP increase was primarily due to enrollment mix, as we recorded more enrollments from relatively higher ASP tax advisor courses together with an increase in the ASP of our accounting certificate test preparation courses.Enrollments in online healthcare test preparation courses in the second quarter decreased by 3.4% year-over-year, primarily due to an earlier start to the enrollment season for our Doctor Qualification Examination test preparation courses and the later start to the enrollment season for Pharmacist Examination test preparation courses compared with a year ago period, as previously discussed.ASPs in our healthcare vertical decreased by 11.9%, year-over-year, mainly due to enrollment mix.In the second quarter, enrollment in our online engineering and construction test preparation courses declined.E&C test preparation enrollment growth continues to be sluggish due to a challenging economic backdrop for China’s construction industry.However, the decline in E&C test preparation enrollment was more than offset by an increase in our E&C continuing education course enrollment.The fluctuation in E&C test preparation course ASPs is mainly due to enrollment mix.Now, let’s turn to slide 10 to look at some of our key financial metrics.Before I get started, I would like to note that the further depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our results in the second fiscal quarter.The average exchange rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 6.5394 compared with 6.236 in the prior year period, representing renminbi depreciation of 4.9%.As a reminder, our earnings release together with this call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures.I encourage you to refer to our earnings release, which contains a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Total net revenues increased 8.1% to $24.1 million from $22.3 million in the prior year period.Net revenue from online education services was $19 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, a 12.2% increase from $16.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Net revenue from books and reference materials decreased 26.1% to $1.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Net revenue from other sources increased 9.1% to $3.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, mainly due to higher revenue for business start-up training courses.Gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with 50% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Non-GAAP gross margin was 57% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with 50.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.The year-over-year increase in gross margin was attributable to decreased lecture fees, cost of books and reference materials, and other miscellaneous expenses.This increase was partially offset by increased salaries and related expenses.Selling expenses decreased 27.7% to $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $7.3 million in the prior year period.Non-GAAP selling expenses decreased 27.8% to $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $7.2 million in the prior year period.This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in commissions for the Company’s online distributors and less spending on marketing and promotional activities, partially offset by increased salaries and related expenses.General and administrative expenses increased 25.3% to $3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $3.1 million in the prior year period.Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses increased 30.6% to $3.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.6 million in the prior year period.Excluding [ph] Yucai listing expenses, Xiamen NetinNet acquisition expenses and a reversal of bad debt provision, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses increased 12.8% year-over-year.As a result of the foregoing, the non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 21.3%, up significantly from 6.3% in the prior year period.The broad-based improvement in margins was a result of our disciplined expense control amid continued revenue growth.Income tax expense increased 126.3% to $0.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $0.3 million in the prior year period.The increase was mainly due to an increase in taxable income.Net income increased 107.7% to $2.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $1.2 million in the prior year period.Non-GAAP net income increased 73.1% to $3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $1.8 million in the prior year period.Now, let’s turn to slide 11 to review our cash flow.Net operating cash inflow decreased by 7.7% to $12 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 from $13 million in the prior year period.The operating cash inflow was mainly attributable to net income before non-cash items generated in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, income tax payable and deferred revenue also contributed to the operating cash inflow.This operating cash inflow was partially offset by the increase of accounts receivable, inventories, prepayment and other current assets, and the decrease in refundable fees.Cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash as of March 31, 2016 was $109 million, down from $135.9 million as of December 31, 2015, mainly due to the distribution of dividends of $31.1 million, the repurchase of our ADSs on the open market of $8.2 million, the payment of acquisition deposits for Xiamen NetinNet of $4.9 million.This decrease was partially offset by cash flow generated from operating activities in the second quarter of $12 million and a capital contribution of $4.9 million raised by Zhengbao Yucai from its issuing shares to selected employees.This completes my financial overview.Now, I will return the call back to Zhengdong for concluding remarks as well as financial guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2016.Mr. Zhu, please.We have established China Distance Education as a formidable player in China’s online professional education industry with our deep understanding of the market, strong courseware development and innovative capabilities, and the proven ability to evolve and adapt our technology to address market demands such as our open learning platform and our mobile initiative.Our strategy is to provide our growing student base with the highest quality courseware and services to meet their lifelong learning needs.In addition, while remaining focused on organic growth, we’ll continue to look selectively at merger and acquisition opportunities.Our acquisition of Xiamen NetinNet will enhance the competitiveness of our college cooperation program, increase our penetration in China’s large and growing college market, and strengthen our educational offerings for accounting professionals.Moreover, through our planned Yucai listing on China’s New Third Board, we anticipate more flexibility to explore value enhancing acquisitions and investment opportunities here in China.Turning to our outlook, we expect our third fiscal quarter revenue to decline, primarily due to the uncertainty associated with the Pharmacist Exam, as previously discussed, and the corresponding decrease in healthcare cash receipts in the second fiscal quarter and in April 2016, together with softer than expected accounting cash receipts during the second fiscal quarter and April 2016.We expect to generate total net revenues in the range of $27.3 million to $28.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, representing a year-over-year decline of approximately 5% to 0%.For fiscal 2016, we are reducing our previous revenue forecast.We now expect to generate total net revenue in the range of $108.2 million to $113.6 million, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 0% to 5%.Our prior guidance range was $124.4 million to $129.8 million.Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray Please ask the question.Good evening and a question for Mr. Zhu and for Mark.Mr. Zhu, in terms of the pharma side, there’s been difficulty obviously without resolution [ph] from the government.And what are the potential outcomes in terms of what the government will say and how does that impact your business?And then separately for Mark, is the growth -- this year you’ve been clear about what 2016 looks like.Are there any high level thoughts about what top line growth potentially could be in 2017?Thanks.Thank you, Gene for the question.I’ll address the last question first and then turn it over to Mr. Zhu for commentary on license pharmacist situation.Regarding fiscal 2017, while we’re not providing specific guidance today for fiscal 2017, I think a good way to think about it is to look for growth in the range of 15%.And that’s based upon growth in the three core verticals, accounting; healthcare; and engineering and construction, blending together for about 10% to 15% growth, and then layering in NetinNet, which will provide some incremental revenue growth for us.I am also taking into account currency because we have been seeing, as we talked today about a 5% currency headwind with the devaluation of the renminbi, I think it’s prudent to assume that further devaluation will continue to about the same degree next year as well.So, I am factoring that into the equation to arrive at that relative growth range for fiscal 2017.Basically, even right now the situation is the policy is unclear, and as a result, demanding for the exam prep courses is not very strong.However, from the long-term perspective, as we are very well diversified, even if the ultimate outcome of the policy is not very positive, impact to our Company’s long-term growth is going to be very limited.It does.And just a follow-up question in terms of the tax business did well because of the easy comps, I guess.Is there anything structurally changing in your accounting business?Even though we regret to -- we are regretful that we have to reduce our revenue guidance for the year; we actually have not seen any structural changes either to accounting vertical or to our business or the market in general.We don’t see any dramatic changes in our business environment, the impact of the macro economy to the company or anything like that; having said that, the whole management team of the Company are very committed to work hard.The online education has very large market potential and we are very confident that we will be back to high growth profile and high growth track, soon.My first question is on whether we’ve seen any structural change in terms of the competition landscape and job demand and supply dynamic in the accounting vertical?Second question is, how many schools out of the 340 schools in the Enterprise Partnership Program, is already paying us and what’s the ARPU of each school?And the third quarter is, given that we’ve seen a weaker core business this year, will this impact our dividend distribution policy?First of all, even though we have been in accounting vertical for quite a few years, what we see is this is a very big market, and we have -- even though there are some new entrants in the more verticalized or sort of niche market segment of accounting vertical, they are not serious threat to us.As such, we don’t see any major changes in competitive landscape in accounting vertical.We believe the key to competitive strength is students’ trust, which rely heavily on providing high quality education.And it is exactly our strength.Through providing high quality results driven sort of training courses, we sort of develop our brand, sort of trust amongst students.In addition, our College Collaboration Program and our sort of acquisition of NetinNet basically help us build an ecosystem whereby our traditional training courses are combined and added to the online simulation practice to the and internships as well as joint major development programs.And in addition, we also offer -- we also have recommending potential candidates or student candidates to potential employers.All of those programs have formed [ph] fairly comprehensive offering, value offering to our students building ecosystem and competitive differentiating fact on the market.There are some overlaps of customer base, our College Collaboration Program and NetinNet businesses.All-in-all, between NetinNet and our College Collaborations, we cover almost 1,500 colleges and universities with the two programs.Of those 1,500, about 100 schools, we have already started the actual collaboration.We have started paying dividends since 2012, and we paid dividends five years in a row consecutively.There is a very clear Board resolution on dividend policies.That is we look at our cash flow and any excess net cash flow, we give it back to shareholders in the form of dividends.And this policy is still the same, and we do not see any changes.Thank you.Sorry, if I may follow-up with another question.What is the current Baidu conversation rate and do we see any pressure in the second half as Baidu might potentially increase the bidding price and reduce the outlook?Our business has never had been -- we drive our business through a lot of channels and means.There is no single factor that will dramatically or significantly influence our operational results.And we don’t rely on a single marketing or promotion approach.Baidu search ranking page, search ranking has value to us and we do generate customers through that means, but it is not our major revenue source and it is not our major customer lead generation form.As such, we do not see -- one is we do not see the potential price adjustment by Baidu in the second half of the year will affect us significantly.That is the answer.First, could you discuss how is that all macro is impacting student enrollments and potentially contributing to some of the volatility in demand in this last year?And then secondly, just given the lower guidance and outlook for fiscal ‘16, where do you see margins moving to?Thanks.Thank you for the question.And regarding fiscal 2016 guidance, from a bottom line perspective, we believe net margins will be impacted.We believe net margins will hover around 20% on a non-GAAP basis for fiscal 2016.Now, that’s down from just over 24% in fiscal 2015.One item to note here -- or a couple items, but one in particular, is the dilution that we did talk about previously from the Xiamen NetinNet acquisition will account for about a 100 basis points of non-GAAP net margin pressure.So, that’s important.Second thing I would mention, in the second half of the fiscal year, you will see our gross margins be impacted primarily because of the lower revenue growth assumption embedded in our guidance for the second half of fiscal year and the fact that our cost of goods sold does have a significant component of fixed costs.And so, we need to carry those costs in a lower revenue environment, hence impacting gross margins.So, I think those two notions should be considered as you look at our guidance and consider the margin pressure situation.The macroeconomic environment is fairly challenging in China at the moment.However, we do not believe education in general would be affected by the softness in the economy.On the contrary, the more severe the competition for limited job positions, the more people are going to turn to professional designations as well as then practical job field trainings to improve their competitiveness in job market.As such, to adapt to such a change or the situations in China at the moment, we work very actively to roll out courses, especially in the practical skill enhancement training area to meet the demand of the market.Thank you for taking my question.This is Jason Huang on behalf of Fan Liu.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Just <b>wondering</b> , as the National Pharmacist Qualification Exam policy getting clear , do we expect the revenue to pick up again in the second half of the fiscal year 2016 ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In regards to the certified pharmacist exam, even though the uncertainty would be -- right now policy is uncertain.As such, students are waiting for the more clear policy guidance before they take any actions.However, even though the policy uncertainty got cleared up, which will happen eventually, if the policy has a long lifecycle, let’s say, if the policy would be good for a period longer than a year, then the students will not have the agency to register for the exam right away.And as such, to be conservative, we do not plan for scenario whereby we will see very strong bounce back as soon as the new policy comes out.But on the contrary, we actually think that and the improvement once the policy got cleared up will be gradual rather than the superfast in growth pace as you’ve seen before.However, in general, as we are very diversified and operating quite a few verticals in areas such as healthcare, accounting, construction et cetera; our business is very resilient to risks of any given vertical.And again, we are very confident that after a period of adjustment, you will start to see much better growth soon again.So, just one more question on the sales and marketing spending.Since we kind of control the cost for this quarter, but for the next quarter and the fourth quarter, do we expect it to reaccelerate?Thank you.Yes, regarding selling and marketing spending, the fourth quarter is usually a seasonally lower quarter for selling and marketing spending, as we are entering the wrap up of the exam season at that point in time.So, we would expect selling and marketing spending in the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, perhaps modestly higher but not that materially higher.As a Company, you have had an excellent record over the last few years of capital management.You’ve talked about the dividends you’ve paid and the buying back of stock.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> whether you can please explain the rationale behind the listing on the third market of one of your new subsidiaries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Surely, if we expect high growth rates, we would not want to be diluted.You’ve already talked about how the recent acquisition is likely to result in some dilution.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And therefore , if you actually already own something that is growing fast and you have sufficient cash flow , I <b>wonder</b> what the rationale about listing on the third market is and what the structure is .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I do have a supplementary question after that but I thought let’s start with that.I will start off with the question, and if Zhengdong has something to additional, he can do so.In regards to our plans to list Zhengbao Yucai on the New Third Board, certainly we believe there is a potential to unlock value that isn’t otherwise recognized by the markets, given that Zhengbao Yucai is only about 3% of our revenue, and it gets lost in the wider business model of China Distance Education.We believe Chinese investors will likely better appreciate that business model and better understand it, because it is unique to China.Secondly, the idea of having a listing in China for Zhengbao Yucai is not just about listing that business but it’s having an entity around which we can grow the business to be much larger, more meaningful business through potentially other acquisitions.And we believe that listing would allow us the platform to do that in the China market.So, I believe these are a couple of key reasons for our decisions to pull it out of our business and move it over to the Chinese New Third Board.Zhengdong, do you have anything to add?Mark’s answer is already pretty comprehensive, but I would like to add a few points.One is the CDEL; the U.S. listed company will remain very focused on online education and other forms of online learning.At the same time, Zhengbao Yucai as a China listed company, it will also be on lifelong learning, most of its business will not be purely online and in fact you may have a major component of offline earning.So, we do have a clear sort of separation of what’s in each of the listed entities.Thank you.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My other question is I <b>wonder</b> whether we can use this opportunity to talk about the potential for the college program and the online learning platform going forward .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>You’ve tried to quantify the college program by talking about the number of colleges you’ve engaged with and the fact that of the 340, about a 100 are about to start generating some income.It will be very interesting to have an idea as to what you are expecting these elements to contribute over the next three to five years, over the medium and longer term.I do understand that some of the activities were reinforced on the existing programs elsewhere, but I am sure that you’ve worked out what kind of return you expect from the investments that you’ve making in these businesses.I think I will take the question and then Zhengdong can add other remarks if you would like.First of all, Philip, thanks for your question.Stepping back, I think it’s important to help frame the potential market size here for the college cooperation business.We think the potential market size is as high as $200 million.To give you a sense of how we get there, we believe there is likely 3000 colleges in the area of accounting education at the college level.You can look at potentially 300 students at college and ARPU of about RMB 500 and consider that these programs run over three years.We do believe we could generate some pretty nice revenue in the future in this area, given the market size.That being said, today the market -- excuse me, the revenue contribution from the College Cooperation Program is not that significant.The focus that we have in place right now is laser focused on growing the number of colleges to be at a much higher level and then ensuring that we have the proper infrastructure and operations in place, and technology to make sure we serve the student in the best possible way, so that when we start off the upcoming school year in the fiscal ‘16, fiscal ‘17 that our high quality offering will keep the students coming back.And so, that’s the focus right now more than a near-term revenue opportunity.But, we believe the opportunity is quite large or wouldn’t be going after this business at all.Today, it’s just accounting, but there is no reason in the future it can’t be other verticals like healthcare, like E&C in terms of the college market opportunity.Well, thank you.On behalf of the management team, we thank you for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our progress.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.Thank you for participating.You may all disconnect.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Error in this transcript?Let us know .</div></body></html>
