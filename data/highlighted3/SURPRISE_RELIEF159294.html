(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, the stock ran up too much and valuation is stretched.Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) engages in the manufacture and sale of coffee and tea.The firm operates through the following segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; China/Asia Pacific; Channel Development; and Other.Its brand portfolio includes Starbucks Coffee, Seattle's Best Coffee, Tazo Tea, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange, and Torrefazione Italia Coffee.SBUX is a truly exceptional business with awesome profitability, growth, dividends, and competitive advantage.Their business model is selling two of the most addicting drugs known to man: caffeine and good customer service.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , while the company is <b>amazing</b> , the stock has problems : it simply ran up too much too quickly , and at these elevated valuations , sales growth is decelerating and margins are struggling to improve .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>SBUX is currently trading at $55.63 per share, a market value of $82,566 million, and an enterprise value of $82,771 million.The stock's current dividend yield is 1.2%, -87 bps below the dividend yield for the S&P 500.The stock performed very well over the past year, returning 4,343 basis points relative to the S&P 500, or 45.% in absolute return.SBUX's revenue grew by a CAGR of 12.0% over the past 3 full fiscal years.Analysts' consensus is forecasting revenues to grow 16.4% this fiscal year, reaching $19,153 million and by 11.7% the following fiscal year, reaching $21,393 million.Over the past three full fiscal years, SBUX's EBIT margin increased by 384 basis points from 15.8% to 19.6%.Analysts' consensus is forecasting EBIT margin to contract by 59 basis points this fiscal year to 19.0%, and expand by 87 basis points the following fiscal year to 19.9%.So not much of a margin story here.Over the past 3 years, management decreased its diluted outstanding common shares by 2.4%.As a result of the revenue, margin, and share dynamics, EPS grew at a CAGR of 18.7% over the past 3 fiscal years.Going forward, consensus is forecasting EPS is to increase by 16.8% reaching $1.58 this fiscal year and to increase by 18.5% reaching $1.88 the following fiscal year.Profitability metrics are strong.ROA is 18.1% ROE is 30.9%, and ROIC is 27.2%.The balance sheet looks solid.With net debt of $205 million, it is meaningless in the face of its trailing 12 month EBITDA of $4,120 million.Debt to Equity is 13%, current ratio is 1.8 and Altman's Z Score is 9.0 - all incredible numbers.Using consensus estimates for next fiscal year's results (FY2), SBUX is currently trading at an EV/Sales multiple of 3.9, an EV/EBIT multiple of 19.5, a P/E multiple of 29.6, and a FCF multiple of 34.7.Relative to the S&P 500, SBUX is trading at EV/Sales premium of 136.6%, an EV/EBIT premium of 47.8%, P/E premium of 96.9%, and FCF premium of 96.1%.SBUX's PEG ratio is currently 1.6 compared to the S&P 500's PEG ratio of 1.4 - this is a premium of 15.0%.Focusing in on the key EV/EBIT, P/E, and FCF metrics, SBUX deserves a 100.0% premium to the S&P 500 due to its highly profitable business model, strong brands, strong balance sheet, and strong expected EPS growth.Applying such a premium to these valuation metrics implies a price target of $62.86 or a 13.0% upside potential from the current price.For such a high growth stock, 13% is not a lot of compensation for the vast amount of risk one has to take.For example, if SBUX has one bad quarter, the stock will get killed.I recommend you buy it when that happens.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
