gentlemen, and welcome to the Student Transportation, Inc.Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2015 Results Conference Call and Webcast.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Doug Coupe, Director of Communications and Investor Relations.Please go ahead.Thanks Jonathan.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results, which ended June 30, 2015.Joining me today on the call are Denis Gallagher, Chief Executive Officer, and Pat Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Yesterday, the earnings release, MD&A and financials were disseminated.The release, MD&A and financials are accessible on SEDAR, EDGAR and our Web-site at ridestbus.com.In addition to our standard disclaimer about forward-looking statements, please also note that all figures are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified.I will also remind you that this conference call is being Webcast live on our Web-site.Thank you, Doug.Good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us and happy dividend day.This was a pivotal year for us in many ways.As we indicated at the end of the third quarter, we closed the fourth quarter and wrapped up our 2015 fiscal year on a very positive note.Year-over-year revenue was up 13.4% and our adjusted EBITDA increased by 14.2%, with margins increasing to 18.4%.Our earnings per share and net income doubled that of 2014 and our total debt decreased by just under $70 million.Our payout ratio continued trending lower coming in at around 71%, including some share buybacks, compared to 74% for fiscal 2014.And all of our shareholders received their dividends which we approve each quarter.Declining fuel cost during the year helped drive down our operating cost along with new investments in technology and innovation, which will boost efficiency and improve margins going forward.The new GPS telematics that we've been installing on our vehicles are providing an enormous amount of data which will help us operate more efficiently.We're learning a lot from the vehicles that are now talking to us.We're developing ways to use that data to reduce our operating and our asset cost.Our core business continued to grow and our asset-light Innovation and Technology Group broke new ground this year.I'll give you a brief summary of our fourth quarter results and then share some of the highlights of the full year before turning it over to Pat Walker, our CFO, to review the complete financial results for fiscal 2015.After Pat's remarks, I'll wrap-up with a look at what's ahead for 2016, then we'll take some questions from our analysts.Our fourth quarter revenues for fiscal 2015 were $152 million compared to $142 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Adjusted EBITDA was $34.7 million compared to $33 million for the same period.Guided by our new vision I set out last year, we increased revenue for fiscal 2015 to $555 million from $489 million in fiscal 2014.This as I said earlier represents a 13.4% growth in full year revenues over our last fiscal year.Our full year adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 improved to $102 million from $89 million in 2014, reflecting an 18.4% margin, which is well within our historical range and I believe within consensus expectations.That income for fiscal 2015 was $3.7 million or $0.04 a share compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.02 a share in 2014.We did return cash dividends of $33.7 million to shareholders during the 2015 fiscal year.As reported in June, after much discussion, our Board of Directors approved the change in the dividend currency to U.S. dollars which began July 1 with an August 17th payment.With 90% of our revenue coming from the U.S. and our reporting in U.S. dollars, we believe that this move mitigates the impact of volatile swings in the currency markets.Now I'm aware that some Canadian shareholders disagreed with that policy change and some just got bad formation from their advisors or may not have understood the change.I'd like to be clear, the dividends our Canadian shareholders receive are Canadian dividend tax qualified as they always have been.There is no change in that policy.As we and many of the Canadian banks thought, the Canadian dollar has weakened, the U.S. dollar strengthened, due to the decline in oil prices, and thus our dividend today represents 5% increase in cash to our Canadian holders, let alone the best tax treatment available.I suggest Canadian investors and brokers look at us again as a safe haven for a stable dividend income investment, as we have been for the past 10 years.As our results showed again, we have been consistent year-over-year in our operating results despite the market and despite an unwarranted sell-off in the lower Canadian dollar.Today, which is September 15, is dividend day.We are issuing our 128th consecutive monthly dividend today to shareholders of record, and last week the Board approved monthly dividend payments for the upcoming quarter, a trend that we've had since our inception.That dividend has been as steady as the consistency and safety of our operations and our historical results.As we continue to lower our payout ratio each year, we know our shareholders appreciate the stability of our business and their returns and we are making adjustments to our communication program to keep all shareholders better informed.First, our payout ratio is published in our Annual Information Form which will be filed as usual by the end of September on both SEDAR and EDGAR.Secondly, our investor presentations I often give on non-deal roadshows will also be available on our Web-site, so everyone will have the up-to-date information on all of our activities.We also have videos and news about many things going on that are available for all of you to see and that of course is on our Web-site, which is ridestbus.com.As you know, safety is the foundation of our business.It's another area which we are proud to lead the industry.Our year-over-year safety record continues to improve.We operate the youngest average age fleet in the industry and our safety, training and compliance programs are literally the best in the business.Safe operations create trust, and in this business trust drives continuity and continuity drives growth.When we bid new business, we have customers contacting new customers recommending our service.That's an effective reference.Driven by strong service, creative thinking and new technology, our local operations teams won a dozen new contracts this year while working diligently to lower our cost of operations.We added nearly 1,000 vehicles and more than $50 million in new revenues for fiscal '16, which we are in.We established new regional hubs in Missouri, Colorado, Oregon and expanded our footprint in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Texas and California.As a result, we already have booked 7% growth for fiscal 2016, and the year is young.Many of these new customers were attracted by our commitment to new cleaner alternative fuels which improved the air quality in and around our schools and communities.Our fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles grew by 35% this past fiscal year and has become an important marketing advantage for us.Meanwhile, our historic contract renewal rate remains at the steady 95%, which is a mark we've held for the past 18 years, and the trend toward long-term contracts with price increases and customer-paid fuel continued as the year drew to a close.30% of our contracts now include customer-paid fuel provisions.To drive growth in our newly formed asset-light group of businesses, we appointed Tom Kominsky, Chief Growth Officer, in June.Tom's background in strategic business growth, investment banking and capital markets makes him a tremendous resource for me and for our team.He's working to leverage our core competencies to develop new business strategies and launch new sales programs in our Innovation and Technology Group.There are tremendous opportunities to market our team's operating and management experience, safety expertise and now technology to the 10,000 school districts that continue to own and operate their own fleets.We also added a new member to our Board of Directors in June, Barbara Basney, as Vice President of Global Advertising and New Media for Xerox Corporation.Her strategic approach and insight into today's new media makes her a valuable resource not only for our Board and our leadership team as we talk to new customers, the 1.5 million parents who have children that ride our vehicles.As a member of our Innovation and Technology Committee of the Board, Barbara will work closely with us to develop a better understanding of these needs of today's parents who are driving changes at local school boards.Understanding our parents' mobile and social media interactions will help us improve communications and increase loyalty among these new customers.As I said before, we're redefining exactly who our customers are and we are learning how to mobilize them to our benefit.SafeStop, our mobile app, is already the leading school bus tracking app, but we've only just begun to see its potential for growth in the market that includes 36 million parents who have children who ride buses to schools.SafeStop is signing agreements with several schools to allow for the setup and on-boarding of data required that allows us then to market to the parents or to have the schools do so directly.We are also working with several companies to license the service and for cooperative selling opportunities.It's a nice complement to our core customers but the real opportunity obviously is the bigger market.As we continue to roll this out this year, we will also be updating you on any number of subscribers and vehicles that are SafeStop ready.There are several competing products through GPS providers but none we feel that offers the same B2B and B2C service as we do, let alone the very specific features of our app that we have developed.There will always be cheaper knockoffs but ours is the real deal.Our new TSC consulting business also grew by entering into a strategic partnership this year, making a minority investment in the school consulting business that will bring new growth in 2016.We don't control the company nor the Board, but we are working on ways to sell cooperative services to their over 200 school customers.We are looking at further growth opportunities in similar school service businesses that complement the core, but yet strengthen the entire company with non-asset and asset-light revenues.Now I'll turn it over to Pat Walker, our CFO, for a more detailed review of the financial performance, and then Pat will shoot it back to me.Thanks Pat.Thank you, Denis.Good morning everyone and thank you for attending our fiscal 2015 year-end conference call.As Doug had mentioned, we released the 2015 fiscal year-end results yesterday.We also filed the fiscal 2015 financial statements and the associated MD&A on SEDAR and EDGAR last night, which include more detailed information.And as Doug also mentioned, unless otherwise noted, all financial information discussed is in U.S. dollars.The operating results summarized in the press release include revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2015.We use adjusted EBITDA internally as a useful measure for tracking performance, and as you know, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.The Company's results for fiscal 2015 reflect the continued growth of the Company through the execution of our ABC growth strategy.Company started operations on 14 new bid and conversion contracts last July for the 2015 fiscal year, two of which were tuck-ins for our existing operations.We also closed a small acquisition in Ontario in December of fiscal 2015 and an acquisition in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.The acquisition completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 results in the bargain gain that was included in the results for the prior year.As such, the prior fiscal year results do not include any operations for the new bid wins secured for fiscal '15 or the fiscal '15 acquisition, and only partial operations for the prior year acquisition completed in February of 2014.In addition, the Company did not renew four contracts for the 2015 fiscal year.Looking at the results for the full year for fiscal 2015, revenue for 2015 totaled $554.8 million, an increase of $65.3 million or 13.3% over fiscal year 2014.$52 million of that revenue increase is primarily attributable to the net new business noted.The change in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar from fiscal '14 to fiscal '15, in connection with the translation of the Company's Canadian operations into U.S. dollars, had a negative $7.4 million reporting impact on the year-over-year change in revenue.Same terminal operations basically make up the remaining $21 million revenue increase, resulting from net increase in service requirements of existing contracts and contract rate increases.During the fourth quarter, we recovered substantially all of the $6.2 million revenue deferral present at March 31, 2015 that was primarily related to weather days that we noted on the Q3 call.Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year 2015 totaled $102 million, an increase of $12.7 million or 14.2% over adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from the new business identified.And again the change in exchange rates between the Canadian dollars from 2014 to 2015, fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, in connection with the translation of the Company's Canadian operations in U.S. dollars had a negative $1.9 million impact on the year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA.$7.9 million of the net increase in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 is associated with the net new business noted earlier, and the remaining $6.7 million increase reflects the adjusted EBITDA contribution from the same terminal revenue increase just noted, partially offset by increases in salaries and wages, operating costs, fringe benefits and insurance cost.The same terminal increases in wages primarily reflect higher driver wages, maintenance wages and operating wages.The operating expense increase reflects an initial year of operating leases, the fringe benefit cost increase is primarily related to higher payroll taxes and the insurance cost increase resulted from some open claims development.Fuel expense for 2015, overall, our fuel expense came in at 7.2% for the full year of fiscal '15, compared to 8.8% for the prior fiscal year.Same terminal fuel expense for the school bus transportation side decreased in fiscal '15 by $4.6 million compared to fiscal '14.As a percentage of revenue, same terminal fuel was 7.7% of revenue for fiscal '15, compared to 8.9% of revenue for fiscal '14.As we have discussed on past calls, we have fuel mitigation in our revenue contracts in the 60% range, with approximately half of that 60% reflecting customer paid fuel, or 30%.On those previous quarterly calls, I had noted that while this contract fuel mitigation that we have in place, we're still exposed to the impacts of higher fuel prices under some of these mitigation features.And now with the decline in fuel that we've seen in fiscal 2015, we certainly have also benefitted to some extent with that decline in price under the mitigation features of those contracts.In addition to the contract mitigation, we also discussed the lock-ins that we have done historically in regards to fuel exposure.We look to lock in approximately 20% of our fuel exposure with fixed price contracts annually.For fiscal 2015, we locked in that 20% range in August 2014, which was basically the start of the school year, and that was prior to the substantial market price declines that started in October and continued through November 2014 and December of 2014.And then for the remainder of our fiscal 2015 fuel exposure and after the contract mitigation and the fuel lock-ins, we certainly benefitted from the market price declines experienced in the October to December 2014 period, with the lower price levels maintained throughout the end of fiscal 2015.As we noted in the fuel press release that we issued mid third quarter, with the October to December decline in market fuel prices, we expect the total fuel to be in the 7.5 to 7.7 range for the full year 2015, and as just noted, we basically hit that target for fiscal '15.With the continued lower price environment that we've experienced through the end of fiscal '15 and also into the beginning of fiscal '16, we see the opportunity to start locking in that 20% target for the next two fiscal years.For the annual 20% target range of fuel exposure lock-in for fiscal '16, we locked that target range in October 2014.And then for fiscal '17, we needed to lock in that target range in August of 2015.As such, we would expect to see further improvements in fuel percentage component in fiscal '16 and '17 based on the lock-ins secured already for both of those upcoming years and the continuation of lower market fuel prices.And looking at our net income, net income for fiscal 2015 was $3.7 million which reflects net income per share of $0.04, compared to net income of $1.4 million which reflected a net income per share of $0.02 for the 2014 fiscal year.The $2.2 million improvement in net income for fiscal '15 reflects the $12.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA combined with the $5.1 million swing in other income which was partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in operating lease expense, the fiscal 2014 $2.8 million bargain gain that is in the prior year statements associated with the 2014 acquisition, the $1.1 million net increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, the $800,000 increase in interest expense, the $0.6 million decrease in unrealized gain on our FX contracts and the $0.5 million reduction in unrealized gain on the conversion feature of our U.S. dollar denominated 6.25% convertible debentures.And looking at the cash flow statement, reflected investing activities, we have purchases of property and equipment that totaled $33.5 million for fiscal 2015, while proceeds from equipment and property sales totaled $2.1 million.In addition, we made the $1.7 million equity investment in the consulting and management services firm that Denis mentioned and we funded one small acquisition in fiscal 2015 which amounted to $0.4 million.Of the $31.4 million in net capital expenditures for fiscal 2015, so that's going to be net of the proceeds from the equipment sales, $25.8 million relate to the 14 new bid and conversion contracts and additional route secured as part of the net new business for fiscal 2015, $4.6 million relate to net replacement capital expenditure spending, and $1 million relates to O&G investments.In regards to 2015 replacement CapEx, in addition to the $25.8 million and $4.6 million in purchased growth and net replacement CapEx respectively, which is reflected in the cash flow statement for fiscal 2015, we also financed approximately $38 million in growth and $38 million in replacement CapEx under operating leases.These operating leases have six year terms with effective fixed rates in the 2.7% to 4.4% range.Thus combined, the purchased and leased replacement CapEx deployed totaled approximately $43 million, which represents approximately 7.8% of revenue for the full 2015 fiscal year.As I've discussed on prior calls, the Company finances some of our growth and replacement fleet value through the purchase of buses where we own them outright and through operating lease financing where the lessor owns the buses.Buses purchased by the Company are included as assets on our balance sheet, the buses leased are not as the lessor retains ownership of those buses.The operating lease payments are included in operating expenses on the income statement and thus are reflected as cash outflows on the cash flows provided by and used in operating activities line for the cash flow statement.Included in the net replacement CapEx purchased in fiscal 2015 is approximately $1 million related to lease buyouts for the leases that we entered into in the 2009-2010 fiscal year.We purchased approximately 100 vehicles related to these lease buyouts.The fair market value of those 100 vehicles is approximately $3.2 million and they have a remaining useful life of six to eight years.We most likely will continue to purchase these leased vehicles at the end of their lease term to benefit from the remaining six to eight years of their asset life.We continue to view leasing as a financing option available to us in addition to our credit agreement.I'll talk to you on the lease proposal secured in connection with our capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2016 towards the end of my remarks.Included in the financing activities you will see cash dividends associated with fiscal 2015 totaled $33.7 million and we purchased 161,000 common shares under our normal course issuer bid for approximately $900,000.In addition, in March 2015, we completed an equity offering bought deal resulting in net proceeds of approximately $65.7 million.And then at fiscal year-end, we repaid $40.1 million in 6.75% convertible debentures that matured on June 30, 2015 utilizing a portion of the net proceeds from the March bought deal.And turning to our balance sheet, at June 30, 2015, our outstanding debt balances totaled approximately $205 million, which included $120 million in convertible debentures, $35 million of senior secured notes and $50 million in credit agreement debt.Total debt decreased from the prior year by approximately $70 million.The credit agreement includes commitments of $225 million and a $100 million accordion feature for additional capacity when and if needed.In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we amended the credit agreement extending the term back to a five-year term, we added two new banks to the lending group, we increased commitments to the $225 million level from the previous level of $165 million.The $35 million in senior secured notes have a fixed 4.24% rate and a maturity date of November 10, 2016.I'd like to just point out a couple of concluding thoughts prior to turning it back over to Denis.As we entered fiscal 2015, we estimated a 12% growth in year-over-year revenues, primarily based on the 14 new bid and conversion contracts secured for 2015.We ended up with a 13.3% increase in top line revenue, slightly above that target level we initially estimated.Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.2% over fiscal 2014 as I had mentioned, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 18.4%, again well within our historical range as Denis had mentioned.The full year operating results for fiscal 2015 reflect the positive momentum that was built up throughout the year.The strong results exhibited again this year demonstrate the steady predictable nature of our business and resulted in a continued improvement of our payout ratio which came in at 71% for fiscal 2015 compared to 74% for fiscal 2014.We anticipate continued margin improvement in the core school bus business with continued lower fuel cost levels, as mentioned earlier, and some strengthening revenue contract pricing in the market that we saw in our most recent bid season.Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, in August of 2015, we amended our normal course issuer bid to increase the number of common shares that we can potentially repurchase if the trading price range remains below what we believe is the intrinsic value of the shares pursuant to the strong fundamentals of our business.In follow-up to the Q3 discussion of operating lease proposals for our capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2016, in July and August of 2016, we secured approximately $58 million in lease financing in connection with both the growth and replacement CapEx for fiscal 2016, $11.5 million of growth vehicles released and $46 million of replacement vehicles released, which covers the majority of such replacement CapEx.These leases again have six-year terms and now the indicative rates this year are in the 2.7% to 4.2% range.With the expanded commitments and availability under our credit agreement, the continued availability of low rate lease financing, lower fuel rate secured for the 20% of the fuel exposure we look to lock-in annually for the next two years, combined with the continued overall level of lower fuel market prices and the expansion of our Technology and Innovation Group, we have more than covered the initial replacement and growth CapEx for fiscal '16, we're in good shape in terms of our off-season funding and we anticipate continued improvements in operating and financial results going forward.Thanks Pat.As I said, 2015 was a pivotal year for us in many ways.New access to data will impact everything we do and its impact on our performance will assist us in our expected improvements for fiscal 2016 and beyond.Local managers are being trained in new expense controls and learning how to optimize their operations.Our routing team is planning on a total review of our operations after schools opens and settle down.They'll be looking to reduce routes and take out assets.With 145 locations, the goal is to reduce at least one vehicle per location.Now while that doesn't seem like a lot, it represents between $5 million and $11 million in capital depending on whether it's new or used vehicles that we take out.It also means 145 drivers we can use for additional growth.Another titbit, 1 gallon of fuel per day per bus for the school year doesn't seem like much, but it's a potential $6.5 million in annual fuel cost reductions if it were to happen.Each vehicle that goes off the designated route by just a few miles a day is extra miles driven in cost that can be reduced.There are many small items like this that can generate huge opportunities for us.We do need to have all of our folks onboard and trained and incentivized as we have to change many habits.The upsides are there and we are committed to increasing operating cash flow as we've said.When we walk into a school customer and we say we can reduce routes, we have to show them real savings, savings they can use in the classroom.That's part of our job, that's what makes a difference with us in just one small way.We can make more money running less buses more efficiently.In the year ahead, STI will continue to grow and lead the industry in safety, service and innovation.The investment that we made this past year in people and in expanding our Technology and Innovation Group will all have a positive effect on improving our results in the future.We are increasing revenue per vehicle with some of this, lowering cost, reducing assets, and building new asset-light businesses all at the same time.The lower cost fuel environment we're in globally will also contribute to the improved results as we are anticipating.We have secured a portion of our locked-in or contracted fuel again this year at lower prices than the last fiscal year.We have already secured some of our fuel for next fiscal year in 2017 at lower prices than we have for this fiscal year.We've locked-in some low interest rates.While the Fed may or may not raise rates, we have lived through all of this many times before.Most of our forward-looking improvements will come from these areas as we deploy new systems and what we call our on-board technologies.The impact these initiatives can have on improving our operating and financial results is exciting.Schools have started up in all of our regions and we're off to a good start.Now there's always some challenges, but like every year, our local teams are spending these first few weeks working with customers to fine-tune routes in our driver assignments.We're good at this, so everyday things are running a bit more smoothly.We have never been more confident in our business and in our 14,000 employees.These are volatile times in the financial markets and we encourage investors to learn more about our business and go beyond our financials.Kids are going to school, we're approaching our 11th year as a public company on the TSX, our 18th year since I started this Company, and my 39th year full time in this industry.We're proudly serving our communities with outstanding safe service.This is a business that is stable and predictable and one that should be in everybody's portfolio.So that concludes our remarks.We'll now take some questions, Jonathan, from our analysts, so if you want to open the lines?The 7% growth that you booked for next year, is that inclusive of rate increases or is that just bids conversions?Yes, we got some, we did get about 2% this year in rate increases.Pat, I think it was 2%, a little bit over 2% or 2%?And then, Mark, the rest was currently some of the new contracts that we're running, as we said, Missouri, Colorado, Oregon, Texas.There are additional routes that are going to be added to a lot of our operations now that school is underway.We're adding – we're just waiting on final approval, but kind of not unusual in our business that schools will tend to add routes versus take away routes, believe it or not, after schools [get started] [ph].Okay.And on that growth, did you have I believe last quarter you talked about roughly about $50 million of growth CapEx, is that still the right number for next year?Okay, and the maintenance, I think before you said about $50 million and $45 million of that is leased roughly?Okay.Then maybe just on the – so the asset-light stuff you talked about, can you just – again, there's been a number of school boards have signed up for SafeStop and there's a lot of stuff going on, so just if you can remind us maybe of the current size of that business?And again this is something that I mean I'm not asking everybody [indiscernible], so I'm just saying, this is a product that took us a while to get this thing going, we had to build it, we had to break it, we had to build it, we had to break it, but we've currently got about 1,000 buses that are out there now, some of them are ours and some of them are school districts' and actually some of them are competitors'.It's being adopted by some school districts.There is a lot more in the queue coming on.So currently right now, Mark, I think a safe number would be about, we got about 1,000 buses, and I'll just talk about this in a second, the goal is to get that between 3,000 to 5,000 vehicles this year.It's over 100 schools currently.So what we do is part of our – part of the plan is there's various different revenue and marketing opportunities here.So we either have the school district pay for upfront what's called an on-boarding fee.So I'll give you an example.School district would pay maybe 10,000 to 15,000, maybe even as high as $20,000 depending on the number of buses and kids and things like that for an on-boarding charge, and that literally allows us to suck in the data from their student data and from their routing and put it into our SafeStop algorithms and our SafeStop system.And then what we do is we decide with the school district, do you want us to market to the parents or do you want to market to the parents.So again there is both of those systems out there.Where we're marketing to the parents, the price will vary per parent per month depending on whether the school paid for the on-boarding or not.If the school doesn't pay for the on-boarding, we try to go with the retail – we do the on-boarding ourselves and [incur] [ph] the cost and then we try to go after the retail number which is kind of in the $4 to $5 a month range.If it's school district doing the on-boarding, we can bring it in at a lot less than that, half of that for the school district.We've got school districts that are collecting the money, we've got other situations where we are collecting the money.So again, this is going to be a nice – as I said, really just a nice complement but Tom Kominsky, our new Chief Growth Officer, is literally working on some licensing agreements with some of the GPS providers and some of the manufacturers are interested in literally making it kind of an OEM.It is a software system to a hardware program.So we are not the guys that developed the hardware.Those are the GPS providers.The good thing about ours, and there are many good things, is that our system works with all of the GPS providers basically that are out there in the system today, whereas some of the competitors, literally theirs works with theirs, so the GPS provider and their software is going to work with their system.Our kind of enables the school district, if you have Verizon, if you have Synovia, if you have Zonar, if you have XYZ, ours can work with theirs, we literally – our tech group has been very good in getting up to speed really quick.We just built this out.So we've made this investment in that.On the other side of the non-asset or the asset-light kind of business is the management and consulting business, and as Pat said, we made an investment in a very small company but they are very good in this business, and again we don't control the board nor we have controlling shares.But what we're doing is we're doing coming and setting up the table here for a lot of cooperative selling.So these guys are out selling consulting and management services to school districts but they are not selling any of the unbundled kind of services that our TSC company is offering.So we're partnering with those.We're also looking at some other M&A opportunities for other businesses that are kind of support services to schools in transportation and/or school transportation.So, there is a nice potential here that that's going to be picking up.Just a couple of quick ones here.On the cost side, Pat and Denis, I understand we are seeing the fuel cost come down, but when we actually look at the translation and to what it means for EBITDAR margins, we're seeing – I mean it's within the range of what we've historically seen, 18.4% this year, it's within sort of 10 or 15 basis points of what we saw in fiscal 2014.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was <b>wondering</b> when we 'll start to see that margin lift flow through .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Is this because of the contracts still being locked in at the higher prices, and if so, what kind of percentage on an actual EBITDAR margin basis would you expect to see in fiscal 2016?Yes, on the flow-through, a couple of things.Number one, 30% now of our contracts have customer-paid fuel.So we're not going to – again, there is no risk for us and there's no benefit, there's no loss for us on that.Actually the customer in this case with fuel being low is benefiting by doing that.Remember where Pat said last year for fiscal 2015, we were locked in at literally fiscal 2014's prices.So we didn't get the true benefit of that.We are getting some of the benefit that we'll see in 2016, but our 20% which is at risk, and what we call at risk means a lot of our rural and suburban markets where we don't have fuel tanks and/or access to bulk capacity, we literally fuel at a lot of local stations.That 20% is going to be at the low end of the pricing.The 20% that we contract for fuel with our suppliers is at literally $1 a gallon less than we paid in 2015.So to your point, the answer to your point is, we are sitting here saying, we need to get more out of the margin from that.Now we did make some investments that we actually expensed in fiscal 2015, we also keep our driver wages very competitive and we like that because our driver wages are long term, our drivers are long-term with us, we have one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry, and that helps our safety record and that helps the continuity side.So the answer to your question on that is, we've kind of looked into the current year, we're seeing fuel going to be down in the 6% kind of range, and again my 40 years and the 39 years in the business I have seen fuel as high as 10% of revenue to as low as 5%, I really haven't seen it much less than 5%.And so, we're going to be getting into the 6% range, 6%, 6.5% range, and we are anticipating about 1 point to 1.5 point improvement on the margin.Getting back to on Mark's last questions on the asset-light business, got a lot of great color as to how it works and what's going on with the parent versus the school board versus Student Transportation, but what's the total value that this is contributing to the Company at present?I know you mentioned it's a complement, but are we talking tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions or tens of millions of dollars from revenue [indiscernible]?I would say the past year was about $800,000 and I mean the goal will be to get it to around $3 million.You could say a year to two years.Again, we don't like to – I mean on-boarding is one thing and we've got school districts that are paying for the on-boarding.Then we have to go and what we do is, we figure roughly a 25% take-up rate.So that requires some marketing for us to get to the parents, right, and we've got to literally get out and convince parents that this is, moms, this is an app that you need, dads, you are at work, this is an app that you need.So again, depending on what the school district – if the school district is paying the on-boarding cost, a lot of times they want the price per subscriber down.We have to do a good job, I won't say a better job because we are literally rolling this out, we've got to do a really good job at marketing.If we're going to 25%, we've got a $20,000 on-boarding customer and we've got a 25% take-up, we probably got another $20,000 to $20,000 there.That's $40,000 for that customer, okay.We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of customers.And the school districts decides and the industry decides, I mean we're working as I said with even competitors now who want that and we're doing some gain-sharing with them.So does the thing have legs?Yes, it's got legs.Do we know how big it can be?No, but we are going to continue to just keep making the changes, we're going to have to add like I said to marketing kind of ideas to this to bring the take-up rate up to 50% and go from there.Got it, that's good color.Getting onto the sort of core bus business growth, I think I count about 1,019 buses starting in September.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Just <b>wondering</b> if that 's pretty accurate in your growth side ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And then on the same avenue, what does the bid pipeline look from here going into kind of going into the end of the calendar year?Greg, you have to excuse us because I'm in Toronto and Pat is in New Jersey, but about 1,000 buses or so for this year.Clearly that's an attainable goal for us for 2017.Again, as I might have said it on the show this morning on BNN, we look at almost $1 billion worth of contracts on a yearly basis.Last year we bid on $500 million worth and we won 50, and those 50 were at our rates in our markets that we wanted to be in with things that we wanted to do.So, we have not lost the discipline, we're not going in and doing that.I will tell you this also.When we did a route by route, contract by contract analysis this year, we literally, Pat Vaughan, our COO, and his team literally plotted out strategically for us for this coming year going forward which contracts that are below market.And part of what I'm saying here is, a lot of you will remember, our contracts are driven on CPI increases.Over the last five years, CPI has been 0 to 1.And so, we've been literally stuck with expenses going up and revenues being tight, and the revenue that we've gotten has been from the growth.And so now, we're taking some of that as we did this past year, we actually took some business and said, you know what, we are going to follow the lead of a couple of the bigger guys who are bidding up or out and we are going to throw some of ours out and see if the market, so we won some of that back at higher rates, we lost some, but the net effect was the 7% or so that we got between price and volume.So we are going to be looking at that again for fiscal 2017 and we are saying that we are going to have to put some of that 10% or 20% I think of our contracts that are on kind of not in ranges that we want, that were coming due.So if we've got a five-year kind of average life, we have always got about 20% cliff each year kind of coming off, right.Just I mean we always look to make sure there's no big steep hills and cliffs.So we don't have 50% of our contracts all coming up the same year and that kind of thing.We try to keep it around 15% to 20% a year that are up for renewal.While the school districts in this case are going to want to renew, and in our case we are going to say, no, we think those contracts have to go out to tender, have the bid, because for the last five years we really haven't gotten much of an increase out of that.And that's where you're going to see us I think increasing our revenue per vehicle.When you also take a look at this SafeStop and whether it's with our own customers or not, if we're doing the $40,000, we're literally in that one example I gave you, we literally picked up in that particular contract an extra 1.5% revenue on literally revenue per bus in that.It just happens to be through a different arm of ours called SafeStop, but when we add, we add across them than we have down.So they are all part of the same company.So that's kind of where we are on that.We think that there is some tremendous opportunities.Some of the contracts that are going to come out, there is more privatization this year than we have seen in the past, I'm not saying that's a trend, but we are seeing more school districts than we have seen in the past that have decided to go to bid.And so again, that and market share bidding, we're going to be looking at a lot of opportunities.We are not going to be lowering our standards, we are going to be raising the multiple, we're going to be raising the margins and we're going to be looking to upgrade our own contracts.Just one last one for me, Pat, you mentioned that this year you bought out 100 buses from your 2009 lease program for $1 million with I guess a remaining value of 3.6.Presumably that's a fairly predictable schedule.How many do you anticipate you're going to be able to buy out for this upcoming year and what kind of lift do you think you'll see on those?Greg, I think it's right under 200, so about 190, 195, and I think the range of the purchase is right around $3 million, value we have is about $5.8 million.I just had a question, I'm going to circle back to Greg's first question now on the EBITDA margin.I realize that the fuel was locked in at a time when prices weren't favorable.I'm just going back historically and thinking, you guys have made a lot of changes to the business in terms of trying to be more efficient having these new asset-light business put in place, and if I go back to 2011 when you had fuel prices around 7.7% of the total, so about flat, you were getting close to a 20, you got 19.6 or 19.7 EBITDAR margin, the year before that you had 21.So comparable fuel environment, but the margin is actually declining even though you have arguably a better business today than you did four or five years ago.So what's happening here?I think just to reiterate the answer that I just gave, a lot of it has to do with the pricing, and when their costs were going up, and again no pun intended, drivers are the big driver and 40 plus percent of our revenues, we keep and maintain driver wages.And so we were literally giving more in wages than we were getting in revenues.So in other words, on average, we are giving 2%, 2.5% wage increases and we were literally getting 1% or 0% in some of the contracts.So that's where the pricing in that case literally – and you've heard me talk about this before, we were also in an environment where a lot of our big guys were taking the prices backwards and it was kind of hurting everybody's margins.Needless to say, that didn't last for them and they have changed their marketing strategy and I think it's a positive.I think we're going back to the kind of margins that we had there for a couple of years ago.Okay.And then on your cash flow goal, would you mind just commenting again what it was?I think it was 6%, I'm not sure if that was on a per-share basis or absolute and how you are tracking?For this current year, it's going to be – our goal, it's a goal, right, so we hope to score, is to improve our operating cash flow per share by 5% to 7%, and we're goaling for that to be – there's no word there, we got to goal for that for the next three years at least.Revenue increases on the contracts, the additional revenue increases from the non-asset business and then the lower fuel cost environment, and then the telematics that are literally helping us reduce the operating costs.We are literally now, in fact I got an e-mail this morning, we are about 70% of our fleet now has the GPS and telematics.Three years ago we had 5% or 10% of our fleet with it.So we have made a lot of investments over the last two years and now we're literally as I said in my remarks, we are training our staff how to use the data, how to understand what it is, how to understand what one gallon per day per bus is for the entire fleet, how to understand when you take one bus out, if capital cost is 60,000 or 80,000 to buy a new vehicle and we take 100 buses out, there is $8 million or $9 million of capital.If the driver goes off the route by 5 miles, you get 5 miles a gallon, there is a gallon of gas or a gallon of fuel and there is 5 miles more on tires and maintenance costs and things like that.So the telematics that we didn't have, and again this was, no pun intended, an old-school business, okay.We were controlling costs and not controlling costs with the same data.So now the data is available to us and that's what we got to zero in on.So we believe that if we can train our folks correctly, we've got the monitor systems in place and now we've got to act on those, but between price increases, the increases in revenue from the non-asset businesses, the lower fuel cost environment and literally a time and mileage on the equipment and fuel.For example, we now have through the GPS systems and the telematics, we can actually shut a bus off if it runs more than 5 minutes standing still, obviously called idling time.A lot of states now, three or four different states, not a lot, three or four different states in U.S. where we operate don't allow you to operate the vehicle standing still for long periods of time, you could actually be fined.So however, for literally every half hour or so, we're burning like half a gallon of fuel.We would have – I mean so again there's good opportunities we have.I was in one of the dispatch offices the other day and the driver called in and said, this is crazy, every 5 minutes my bus is shutting off.Okay, great, now you are getting the message, shut the bus off while you are waiting.And so, those are the kinds of things from an old-school business where the new telematics can really make a huge difference.I just wanted to ask about cost inflation.You touched on talking about I think wage increases 2% to 2.5%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I just <b>wondered</b> how that level of increase trended as the year went on and maybe what sort of levels of wage inflation you are expecting in your next fiscal year please ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We have on our drive on, which is probably our largest cost in the business, on the driver wage side we probably have about 2.5% driver wage increase on average throughout the Company, and as Denis had said, over the last several years our revenue increases, while this year we're probably at 2% for fiscal '16, they have been down in the 1% to 1.5% range over the last several years due to just lower CPI, lower consumer price indexes where we have contracts based on that, and just in the markets overall.But we have about 2.5% wage increase on driver wages as we look into fiscal 2016.I don't think it's going to accelerate all at once.I mean it probably have been consistent in that range over the last few years.Denis, any other thoughts there?No, I mean again it is market-driven.I mean so what we're giving is kind of an average overall.It's the overall Company average.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I was <b>wondering</b> if you could take the opportunity , first off , since you have been a public company you 've grown revenues and bus count and contracts and EBITDA , EBITDAR , done a good job , but net earnings per share have n't kept up with any of those other metrics .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So I 'm <b>wondering</b> if you could spend some time speaking to that , whether you feel your net earnings per share reasonably portray what 's happening economically , and if it does not , what is the key issue , and I think maybe spend some time on the difference between depreciation and maintenance capital spending , and if you could spend some time on that I 'd appreciate it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'll try to answer some of that, and Pat, maybe you can jump in too, because again we're in two different places here.But I think there is – first of all, just a little bit about our history, we came out of and we went public in 2004 and what was called an income trust kind of a structure.So it was a high-yield kind of a structure where we had one common share and one high-yield bond and they were clipped together and traded as a unit.And then eventually we unclipped them and we literally started and we listed both securities and we traded them separately.So the Company has been structured from the initial public offering to be able to pay a high yield, more of a utility like kind of structure, and so the essence is to have a lot of interest expense basically to offset and not have a lot of net income because if I'm giving you back C$0.56 which we have for 10 years, we are giving our cash flow that was coming to you in the form of a dividend versus net income.So I think that's first and foremost and I think a lot of our retail shareholders really understand that.I think net income to them is the dividend versus net income to the Company and the good use of debt to be able to kind of keep us aware we're not paying a ton of taxes and not paying a ton of dividend.Pat, did you want to add to the second part of that on the depreciation?I mean I think – let me just make a quick color on that.Depreciation is one thing but when you also – we're now leasing 25% of our fleet.So you've got to look at the lease expense that we expensed through the P&L, and it's actually an accelerated expense.And so when we're literally seeing 100 buses that we have coming off lease this year, those are from six and seven years ago.So now this past year, Pat, how many did we lease this past year, 400?So when those buses start coming off and we are able to run those in the balance of the six years, that's when the benefit comes from those.So you've got to look at depreciation plus lease expense to get you back to, if we were to own our own fleet, to 13%, 14% kind of ranges where depreciation is historically and has been for a number of years in this industry.So I think that's kind of the thing.Pat, did you want to add any other color on that?The only other thing I would say is, take our large school buses and probably two thirds of our fleet, we depreciate those over 11 years because that's kind of the norm in the industry, so kind of following the lead guys.That's for accounting purposes.That large bus will last us probably 13, maybe even into 14 years.We will run it 12 or 13 years, we'll use it as a kind of spare bus in the 13th and 14th year, and then we'll get rid of it and normally we realize proceeds and maybe a small gain of maybe $1,000 a bus.So I guess the addition I would make there is that our economic life if you will is a bit higher than the accounting depreciable life used.Just so I understand that, so you depreciate them over 11 years, you run them over 11 years and then the redundant buses… Okay, you run them over 13 years.Now [indiscernible] either state regulation or federal regulation that limits the life of a bus, are there regulatory requirements that constrain the use of – hypothetically if a bus was very successful and lasted 15 years, could you use that in all of the states?There is only one state in the union which is New Jersey that has an age requirement and that's 15 years.So the state of South Carolina, I'll give you an example, who runs their own buses, has an average age of 20.Now we're not going there but we kind of like useful life in the 13 range.Could we go 15?Sure, we could go 15.We are doing 15 in New Jersey.We run the state law in New Jersey, we run to 15.So that's where we are.You get to a point, and again in this business, you learn that, you get to a point where it's maintenance cost versus capital cost and/or lease cost, and that's what we always look at.So if we've got a really good bus in a really good condition, let me tell you the road conditions are different in Maine, Vermont than they are in Southern California, you don't have the salt and you don't have the winter and you don't have things like that.So it's not like plain vanilla and you can run one bus in California and one bus in Maine and Vermont and say that they are the same maintenance cost and things like that.It is all there, okay.And so just so I understand, circling back to part of your strategy on your lease payments is, you are saying in effect your strategy is to buy out – these are at the conclusion of a lease and the depreciation is front-end loaded in the first six years, and then… The expense, effectively baked into it, you addressed what the effective interest rate is, you gave us that range earlier in the call, you've given it to us in the past, so you are buying a below-market vehicle at the conclusion of six years is your strategy, and then you'll have some benefit for six to seven years.Yes, we have an option value [equipment] [ph], okay, that is pretty tremendous if you look at all of the vehicles that we have.I mean it's not a number we can put on our balance sheet because it's an option, right, that if we want to exercise the option to buy that equipment, we could buy a bus today for $20,000.At the end of six years that's probably market value for $35,000 to $40,000 and we are going to run it out the next six years.And some folks – I don't know what the disclosure practices of the bus companies are, but the airlines tend to give capital spending forecast, at least the Canadian airlines, five years out, they say what type of aircraft they intend to purchase and they provide the numbers.Would it be possible for you to go beyond fiscal 2016 and provide that type of disclosure in terms of replacement of your vehicles?The answer is, obviously we could.Whether we will or not, I think, Roland, when you look at this and as we said, depending on what we win, depending on what we lose, contracts that we tender if we want to get out of certain things, we're going to redeploy those assets on other contracts.So I'm just not sure how helpful that's really going to be.It's really trying to understand what maintenance and capital spending will be on a go forward basis to see what the free cash flow… I think if you go back a little, historically we have kind of been averaging in the 7% of revenue for that year.It's not a rule of thumb, it's just more data that's historic.That's under a growth world, if you will, where you are buying, you're getting new on a certain growth.If the growth changes, those numbers, that percentage will change.That concludes our remarks.We obviously appreciated that you all joined
