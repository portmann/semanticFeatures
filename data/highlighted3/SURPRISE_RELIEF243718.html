(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Presumably markets should not act with <b>surprise</b> if rates are raised in December therefore .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Fischer also suggested that the strong US Dollar is holding down US inflation by reducing import prices invoiced in foreign currencies and also by crushing the price of commodity imports priced in US Dollars.Fischer's analysis of exchange rates, output and inflation was concluded to be a signal that US inflation will rebound strongly very soon.Nothing could be further from this conclusion since inflation and strong growth will have to wait until the US Dollar falls; and thus far speculators are still buying Dollars based on the view that US interest rates will rise.This strengthening US Dollar is however already doing the Fed's tightening for it by reducing both inflation and output so that the expected growth and inflation, during the Dollar's weakening phase, has already been taken away from the future by today's strong Dollar.Fischer, like Alan Greenspan, excels at saying nothing that can be measured precisely whilst appearing to be profoundly analytical with supporting data.Fischer also ignores the fact that if America's trade partners decide to devalue against the US Dollar, then deflation gets baked into the global economic system until all nations involved stop the competitive devaluation process.The rebound in US growth and inflation is therefore conditional upon foreign trade partners, and not just what the Fed does to interest rate differentials.William Dudley then opined that December could be the lift-off date if the data confirm that this is appropriate.In his view of the housing market, clearly some of the economic conditions for lift-off have been met.This was also confirmed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) annual report to Congress , which showed that its mortgage insurance fund's capital ratio stood above the two per cent Federally mandated threshold level for the first time since 2008.The New York Fed's consumer credit report shows that housing credit is driving credit growth and also that this is being driven by individuals with the highest credit scores.There is therefore little evidence of the housing market being the place to look for signs of another "Credit Crunch" repeat, as the Fed tightens.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was somewhat more forceful in her demands for higher interest rates based on the improving economic data.Jeffrey Lacker was even more forceful in calling for a rate increase in December and completely discounted the headwinds from the terrorist incident in Paris.Perhaps Lacker was alluding to the expected fiscal expansion that the expanded war on terrorism will now create.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Anxious not to <b>surprise</b> markets , as Stanley Fischer promised , Atlanta Fed Governor Dennis Lockhart signaled that the pace of rate increases will be slow and also that this incremental pace will be a stop-start process , dependent upon economic conditions at the time .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>New Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan's tone was more consistent with the latest FOMC minutes , which show that the words "it may well become appropriate" have been inserted in relation to the potential for a tightening in December.Kaplan is less Hawkish than his predecessor Richard Fisher and explained that he believes that the Fed has been correct in holding off on interest rate increases thus far.He did however make it clear that the word accommodative does not mean zero interest rates, thus suggesting that the normalization process is going to be framed as less accommodative but not a tightening of policy.This nuance has yet to be fully understood and discounted by the markets.Chicago Fed President Charles Evans then introduced an even more guarded baseline, from which to negotiate about the December lift-off, with a speech entitled " A Cautious Approach to Monetary Normalization ".The title could not have been more explicit as to his thinking.Evans reasons that whilst being close to achieving the employment mandate target, the Fed is still a significant way off achieving its inflation mandate target.The Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker is ready to debate Evans however.Jeffrey Lacker empirically understands that what Evans is suggesting pertains to the trade-off between inflation and employment known as the Philips Curve.Janet Yellen also alluded to this curve, when she candidly admitted that the Fed needs to study the transmission effects of QE to the real economy in more detail.To all intents and purposes, the Philips Curve that existed prior to QE has been broken.The debate is now over whether it suddenly comes back with a vengeance, in the form of a jump in inflation, or whether the permanently unemployed have been lost to the labour force forever.Whilst Yellen and Evans remain undecided, Lacker is willing to wager that QE has temporarily distorted rather than permanently shifted the Philips Curve to the right.Ultimately, over the long term, Lacker believes that the historical Philips Curve will return with a nasty bout of inflation that the Fed will then have to overcompensate for with above normal interest rates.No doubt this debate will degenerate into what one subjectively defines as the short-term versus the long-term for which there is no single answer.Nearly six years of QE and disinflation cannot honestly be called the short-term however, even by Lacker.One cannot help thinking that the Fed is leading global central banking and hence global capital markets into new uncharted territory.Robert Kaplan has suggested that the normalization in interest rates will occur whilst the Fed remains in an accommodating stance.This has profound implications for capital markets and suggests that there is a very strong bid that will put a floor under any "risk-off" panic corrections.Kaplan's chain of thought should also be put into the context of central banks', that have been involved in the QE process, own prognoses on this unconventional tool.Whilst many independent commentators suggest that QE has been a failure, because its benefits have not flowed from "Wall Street" to "Main Street", central bankers have no intention of grading themselves as failures.In fact there is a growing school of central bank thought leadership that wishes to officially recognise QE as an accepted policy tool.QE is therefore "normal" monetary policy rather than crisis management, and the normalization of monetary policy will involve QE remaining in the financial system permanently to a greater or lesser degree.Alternatively, one could say that crisis management has become central bank standard operating procedure.What this therefore means is that QE was not in fact a temporary monetary expansion, as it was presented.QE is now becoming a permanent monetary expansion by fiat, which has profound implications for inflation.The global economy is now experiencing a permanent increase in the money supply, which amounts to official currency debasement.This permanent increase in the money supply now has two choices.It can remain frozen in financial assets causing bubbles there or it can flow into the real economy creating price inflation.Elected policy makers can also avail themselves of this permanent increase in the money supply to finance fiscal expansion.The IMF provided the feedback from the global economy that the Fed should still remain on hold, until there are convincing signs of stronger inflation together with an improving labour market.The normalization of interest rates is clearly going to be a gradual process based on the remarks from the Fed officials attending the conference.Perhaps more interestingly for the Fed is the postscript, from Simon Evenett at the University of St Galen, to the OECD's findings that global trade is contracting.The advanced economies have blamed this collapse in trade on the emerging nations, and the emerging nations have blamed the advanced nations for a collapse in demand because of their embrace of fiscal austerity.What neither side is ready to do, at this point in time, is to accept Evenett's evidence of a collapse in world trade during the period following the Credit Crunch as a consequence of the increase in protectionism.If Evenett is correct, then political divergence can be added to interest rate divergence as another significant risk to the global economy.The last report suggested that Fed officials will be carefully monitoring the performance of the markets to provide them with key signals in order to make informed policy decisions going forward that will not undermine the global economy.Perhaps the first order of business in the monitoring process should be an analysis and explanation of the widening bid-offer spread in G10 currencies along with the erratic trading that this occasions.This could be due to increased regulatory risk capital costs, forcing banks to price risk more conservatively and to carry less dealer inventory as a consequence.It may also be due to risk aversion in relation to the expected rise in American interest rates.The Fed and other global central banks will however have to deal with this issue using tactical policy tools rather than just academic research.The situation is beginning to resemble that found in the immediate unfolding of the "Credit Crunch"; therefore it needs explaining carefully before speculators assume that it is business as usual again.Liquidity is already tight by market measures even though there is an abundance of QE in the global economic system.This actually implies that the central banks should be easing and not tightening.The matter needs to be resolved swiftly and conclusively; but unfortunately the Fed wants to take its time.This is not an environment in which to be taking risk.Large Cap equities look especially vulnerable , given that once the QE spent on share buybacks dries up, the earnings-per-share numbers look terrible because there is no growth in the earnings numerator.The Eurozone's current threats to Mario Draghi's ambition for expanded QE were highlighted in the last report .The threats became an opportunity when the European Parliament, headed by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, fell out with Jean-Claude Juncker's European Commission over the composition of the newly planned European Fiscal Board.Despite all attempts at deeper fiscal integration, there is still no evidence that this is occurring beyond ambiguous rhetoric to this effect.The devil in Europe is always in the details.It is also worth noting that a study of European history shows that nothing political is born of words but only of war.At inception, both protagonists could agree to some vague notions about how the new fiscal oversight body will independently opine and advise on member nations' fiscal trajectories.At implementation they now disagree on how it will operate.For Dijsselbloem's Eurogroup, Juncker's blueprint is too political and not independent enough from the European Commission.The European Commission fought back by evoking the spirit of the moment in the Remembrance services for the two European wars to seize the moral high ground, by arguing that history is on its side and not the side of the nation statesman.Frans Timmermans, Juncker's Deputy, emotively lectured that "all other forms" of European politics except those behind the European Commission "lead to war".Dijsselbloem and the Eurogroup are therefore the warmongers, and Juncker and the Commission are the alleged peacemakers.Seizing his opportunity, Mario Draghi neatly folded the current spat between the Eurogroup and European Commission into the issue of Britain's demands for EU membership renegotiation.The timing of Draghi's manoeuvre, to coincide with the Remembrance of shared European suffering in its two conflagrations, was both apposite and enlightening.If Britain exits the EU as a consequence of its failure to reform, Draghi warned that the ECB will have to act, although he was less than forthcoming about what such action would be.Most observers took this to mean more QE.Draghi did however make it clear that the only currency in the Eurozone by treaty is the Euro, which suggests that any such action would be taken to prevent other nations from leaving the Eurozone and establishing domestic currencies of their own.Currencies leaving the Eurozone will leave the ECB balance sheet vulnerable since it holds sovereign bonds from various nations as part of the QE process.The ECB could be left with unsustainable capital losses in the event of a nation, whose bonds it owns, leaving the Eurozone.Deeper fiscal integration is therefore something that is crucial to the survival of the ECB as an institution.Draghi's strategy for survival however, involves gambling further with potential ECB insolvency by expanding the QE programme so that the ECB in effect becomes too big to fail.Britain's Eurosceptics understand that creeping fiscal integration will ultimately oblige Britain to adopt the Euro at which point political autonomy will be lost.Mark Carney, a man who truly understands who pays his wages, has therefore been careful to align the Bank of England with the autonomous unitary political vision of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne.In his latest comment on the "Brexit", Carney said that the Bank of England would conform to British public opinion on the matter.Osborne and Cameron must now frame this public opinion.Germany and Britain actually seem to be aligned on EU reform.Both nations share a common desire for political autonomy; or at least further integration on their own terms with get-out and veto clauses attached.In addition, the powerful Bundesbank does not share Mario Draghi's enthusiasm for insolvency risk through expanding the QE programme to nations who may ultimately be forced to leave the Eurozone.Jens Weidmann refuses to directly opine this real issue and instead prefers to resist Draghi's attempts to expand QE by opining that inflation and economic growth do not justify such a course of action.He was however tempted to reveal his true hand when he discussed the matter of Eurozone bank capital adequacy in relation to sovereign debt holdings.According to him , Eurozone bank sovereign debt holdings should have the same capital adequacy requirements as private borrowers; and in addition, Eurozone bank exposure to sovereign debt is too large.Weidmann therefore implies that if the Eurozone banks should provision for capital losses, in relation to their sovereign bond portfolios, that the ECB should also do so by default in relation to its QE portfolio.The ECB provision would necessitate the raising of capital through which the Bundesbank would exert greater control through an increased subscription.In the political background of the Eurozone, the recent atrocities in Paris will in some measure have increased the momentum for deeper political integration since the "enemy within" is well dispersed throughout the Eurozone.Political commentators are already proselytizing how the attack on shared cultural values is an attack not only on Europe but on western democracy in general.These shared cultural values have already translated into a shared political response to inward migration at a summit in Malta with Africa.These shared cultural values will also drive the calls for shared military engagement with boots on the ground in Syria and the expanding conflict zone wherever these values are violently attacked.Shared cultural values have also made the question of what happens next a key issue in America and Germany's upcoming national elections.Mario Draghi is therefore betting on the endgames of Eurozone political integration and NATO solidarity as he bets on ECB insolvency.ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio moved Draghi's wager onto the Governing Council's agenda when he said that although it was too early to gauge the impact of the Paris attacks they certainly provided challenges to economic growth.ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet maintained the momentum for expanding QE by suggesting that there is a heightened risk that inflation expectations will become "de-anchored" if the ECB fails to raise them.He also revealed that some Governing Council members were pushing for an expansion of QE back at the October 22nd meeting in Malta.This urgency was echoed by Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny, who said that the creation of Eurozone aggregate demand is required in order to avoid a situation similar to that in Japan.Praet and Nowotny have signalled a clear concern over the low level of wage inflation in the Eurozone.Low consumer prices have translated into low wage demands.By triggering inflation, they hope that they can boost pay demands.An economic stimulus could just as easily be achieved by a fiscal stimulus; however, Nowotny knows that this would get bogged down in the fiscal austerity drive that still persists.The political stalemate, over fiscal austerity, was highlighted by Italy's current dialogue with the EU over the conditions by which it may get granted fiscal flexibility.Flexibility is on offer, but this remains conditional upon Italy's pledges to meet austerity goals.Spain is also being warned that it will miss its 2016 deficit targets and has been asked to submit a new plan to the EU.By therefore calling for an aggregate demand stimulus in the presence of fiscal austerity measures, Nowotny is calling on the ECB to act again.There is however room for fiscal stimulus in relation to the terrorism threat and related immigration issues.France has already been given some budget flexibility in relation to the terrorism threat, and the EU has said that it will give flexibility to those nations that can show a link from fiscal expansion to the immigration crisis.Moody's has already factored this in to France's fiscal position and now assumes that the nation will miss its fiscal targets because of terror related spending.The way forwards for fiscal wiggle room, via terrorism and immigration, is therefore open.The EU and especially Angela Merkel may find that fiscal wiggle room is the only answer to the resistance , to their open-armed refugee policies, from within the Eurozone.Mario Draghi's bet on European solidarity is therefore based on a rational understanding of the political landscape.His testimony to the European Parliament was therefore made in this understanding.Whilst falling short of giving a firm commitment to do more QE in December, Draghi outlined the risks to growth and inflation that will justify it.The last report discussed Governor Carney's inability to preserve his own omniscient image and respect for the Bank of England's guidance strategy.The majority of City economists still believe in his omniscience however, despite the Bank of England's equivocal guidance.The Bank's poor record on guidance was exemplified in the equivocation of the Bank's Chief Economist Andy Haldane, who is unwilling to speculate on whether the next interest rate move will be up or down.Haldane was however able to redeem himself by providing greater context for his view when he opined that there is little evidence that either businesses or consumers are piling on excessive levels of debt.He went even further and provided a true long-term economic outlook when he suggested to the Trades Union Congress that up to 15 million British jobs will be lost to robots.This technological transformation of the UK economy is not yet something that is in the mainstream; and should it become so, the pressure on the Bank of England to remain accommodative will become stronger than ever.The last report also observed how Nemat Shafik had been the first Bank rate setter to come to the defence of Carney's sagging halo effect when she said that it is not necessary to know when interest rates will rise.She has now been joined by Ben Broadbent as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) corral the waggons around the besieged Governor.Broadbent reiterated that speculation on the timing of the expected interest rate rise is futile.Having come into office with much fanfare about the efficacy of guidance, Carney and his team now appear to be abandoning it because they can't make up their minds about the economy.The recent swift deterioration in the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) own guidance on the prospects for manufacturing served to illustrate the dilemma for the MPC.Guidance seems destined to join the likes of NGDP targeting as another one of Carney's flash gadgets that then proves to be lacking in any real substance in practice.It is also likely that the MPC is now trying to U-Turn on guidance because it is making its members look stupid.They therefore have to surreptitiously distance themselves from the subject so that observers forget that it was the MPC who promoted it in the first place.Watching this hair shirt removal is amusing, but it also leads to a new question mark looming over the MPC.The risk now is that abandoning guidance robs the MPC of any real ability to influence markets and relegates its members to the level of the data dependent speculators whom they are trying to control.The IMF staff gave their approval for the Yuan to join the SDR currency basket, paving the way for a final approval from the Fund's executive directors on November 30th.Having sold the IMF, China is now preparing for a slide in the Yuan from the secure peg of IMF SDR currency basket membership.President Xi Jinping opined that whilst the Chinese economy is stable, that it will face significant global headwinds going forward.He is therefore positioning the Yuan and the Chinese economy for transition, during SDR currency basket entry, to the following period of intense competition with China's trade partners.This signal was confirmed by ex-PBoC adviser Yu Yongding when he said that a more flexible attitude to the currency should be adopted going forward in order to boost its adoption as a global currency.Chinese policy makers will therefore use the combination of weak economic fundamentals and their abandonment of a fixed exchange rate policy, after IMF SDR currency basket entry, as the rationale for embarking on another round of currency depreciation.A cursory glance at China's reserve position explains why the country is in such a hurry to join the IMF SDR currency basket club and then start devaluing rapidly afterwards.The rate of decay of China's reserves to maintain the outright exchange rate level at which to join the club has been a very painful one, which has undermined the country's ability to deploy its reserves in stimulating the economy.The only course of action to stimulate the economy left, after gaining membership, is to devalue.This of course begs the question of whether China can actually afford to join the club in the first place if its membership were delayed for longer.A second glance at the debt situation shows the trigger mechanism, which will initiate the currency adjustment process.Chinese companies are currently issuing debt to meet current interest and redemption payments.This refinancing process is not about locking in low financing costs; it is all about kicking the insolvency can of worms down the road.For the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the central government simply assumes the liabilities; however, the private sector must declare insolvency if it does not want to keep kicking the can down the road.With such a debt pyramid scheme in effect, the IMF will have no choice other than to recommend a currency devaluation.At the headline growth level, Japan is now technically back in recession after two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.Allegedly, this is thanks to Japan Inc. refusing to show faith in Abenomics I with capex.The pressure on Abe to deliver Abenomics II will now devolve into pressure on the BOJ to enable it with monetary expansion.To make Abe's job easier, at least on paper, the goalposts on national accounting will be moved to include R&D spending in the national accounts for GDP.This statistical tweak may not however move the needle sufficiently enough to avoid the necessity of another monetary and fiscal expansion.Abe is forced to respond to the headline numbers, but the BOJ has the luxury of being able to drill through the data to the core level.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At the core level a <b>surprisingly</b> robust picture is evident , which may not be something that Abe wants to hear .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Taking out inflation, the economy is growing at around the 3.1% annual rate - a figure which is healthy by any global yardstick.Japanese industry is thriving on lower cost inputs, and the Japanese consumer is buying more of the cheaper goods.Neoclassically speaking, low inflation is good for the Japanese economy, if not for Abe's image.Faced with this neoclassical truth, Governor Kuroda therefore has very little reason to expand QQE.When the GDP goalposts are moved to include R&D spending, he will have even less incentive to act.The latest survey of BOJ-watchers showed that conviction that the BOJ is finished with QQE is growing.This growing conviction was supported when the BOJ left its policy unchanged but affirmed its commitment to act if the expected rebound in capex does not occur.Kuroda appeared to close the door on QE expansion for now when he passed the buck to Japan Inc. and said that it was now time for companies to play their part by raising salaries.Kuroda is seemingly aware that his policy options are finite and therefore prefers to maximise their potential by keeping his powder dry until it is absolutely necessary to act.Kuroda has been a skilled operator of the QQE process thus far.He understands that the rise in inflation has been primarily driven by Yen weakness.Having weakened the Yen to date with QQE, he is running out of ammunition and is therefore waiting to see what the Fed can do to Dollar-Yen exchange rate before he thinks about acting again.A further weakening of the Yen, courtesy of the FOMC tightening, would be a free lunch for the BOJ, and would then leave Kuroda with more ammunition to unilaterally weaken the Yen further.The risk for him is that the Yen seems to have already discounted much of the Fed's increase in interest rates.If the process of interest rate increases is as gradual and stop-start, as Dennis Lockhart suggests, Kuroda may be forced to act faster than he had hoped for.If Mario Draghi delivers on his own QE promises, then the strength of the Yen versus the Euro will bring an even swifter response from the BOJ.Anticipating Kuroda's reticence, the Government seems to be forcing the BOJ to expand QE by fiat.Twisting the legal and political rules, the Post Bank is being forced to "post" its JGBs to the BOJ.Little was resolved at G20 this week, apart from a discernible creep towards military intervention in Syria.Despite the terrorism headlines, however, there was a remarkably upbeat tone in relation to policy maker fiscal spending.Central banks have been doing the heavy lifting with monetary policy, since the "Credit Crunch" enforced fiscal austerity onto governments.There are now some signs that some governments are starting to fiscally stimulate their economies again.This drift towards fiscal stimulus is not only limited to the developed economies.India is now considering a fiscal stimulus by increasing the pay of its government workers by more than twenty three per cent.Bloated public sectors in emerging nations are therefore the first places to look for signs of fiscal stimulus.Military adventure is also one of the oldest forms of fiscal stimulus known to mankind.Military adventures also involve big ticket items and expenditure on munitions which literally go up in smoke and need replacing, so the new phase of the global War on Terror promises to be a significant fiscal tailwind.Rising fiscal spending will balance the normalization in American interest rates and will also give the ECB the eligible collateral it needs to expand the QE programme.Whether this rise in fiscal spending moves the inflation needle remains to be seen though, so the rise in interest rates looks set to be tempered until elected policy makers get a serious military spending habit.It should be noted that the rise, in fiscal spending, is the corollary of the private sector and consumers' adaptation to life at the "Zero Bound".With low inflation and low interest rates, business is disinclined to expand and consumers live within their means and save.Central banks have engineered this status quo with QE and have thus far failed to create the strong rebound in economic activity that they intended.Neither can they exit from QE without risking killing off the meagre economic activity that they have enabled to subsist.They prefer to say that they have failed to create inflation however rather than admit that QE went to "Wall Street" rather than to "Main Street".QE can therefore be defended by central bankers because it has not created the inflation that the critics who said that it was money printing claimed.A central banker would prefer the lesser criticism of not creating inflation, rather than not creating employment because somewhere in the mists of time the creation of inflation was anathema to central bankers.This also gives them the scope to meddle further with unorthodox monetary policy because there is a lack of inflation which gives them the latitude to do so.Central bankers now need the big spenders in elected office to move the economic needle since they have been unable to do so.Given the partisan nature of politics, especially in the developed world, the only thing elected policy makers can currently agree upon is national security in times of threat.During times of peace, economic policy breaks down along politically ideological lines, which evaporate in the emotional times of war, when the budget for national security becomes a blank cheque.We only use your contact details to reply
