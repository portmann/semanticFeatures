gentlemen and welcome to the Cyberonics Q4 2015 Results conference call.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone.As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Moore, President and CEO.Please go ahead, sir.Thank you, Candace, and welcome to Cyberonics Fiscal 2015 Year-End conference call.Joining me today are Rohan Hoare, our Chief Operating Officer, and Greg Browne, our Chief Financial Officer.Greg will summarize the Safe Harbor statement and provide detailed financial information.I will review our results and also provide an update on the current status of our proposed merger with Sorin, and Rohan will cover additional details of our market and product development efforts and personnel changes.Thank you Dan, and good morning everyone.This presentation and conference call includes forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including may, believe, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, plan, intend and forecast, or other similar words.Statements in this presentation are based on the information presently available to us and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.Investors are cautioned that all such statements involve risks and uncertainties.Forward-looking statements in this presentation include statements concerning completing our proposed merger transactions with Sorin SPA, achieving consistent sales and profitability targets and growth worldwide, and achieving clinical regulatory product development and market development projects and goals.Our actual results may differ materially.For a detailed discussion of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ, please refer to our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 25, 2014, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended July 25, 2014, October 24, 2014, and January 23, 2015.Thanks Greg, and good morning to all joining the call.The worldwide Cyberonics team has again achieved strong financial results during fiscal 2015.This year, the team has also met important milestones for several major projects, including commercialization for two key products, and of course another major highlight during the year was the February announcement of our planned merger with Sorin.First, the financial highlights for fiscal 2015.Our team produced record worldwide sales of $292 million, record worldwide unit sales of 14,515 units, record adjusted income from operations of $99.5 million, and record adjusted income from operations margin of 34.1%.As a reminder and as reflected in the PowerPoint document provided on our website today, fiscal 2014 included more than $6.2 million in non-recurring revenue from our single country order and licensing revenue.Also, our fiscal 2015 was significantly impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar.The Q4 revenue was negatively impacted by $1.8 million versus the same quarter prior year, and the full year was lower by approximately $3 million due to currency changes.Financial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 also include a number of important achievements: worldwide product net sales of $74.1 million, record worldwide unit sales of 3,753 units, international net sales of $14.7 million, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis.Adjusted income from operations increased to a record $26.5 million for the quarter.Other recent and fiscal 2015 operational highlights include a very successful staged launch of the AspireSR generator in Europe and EMEA; CE Mark approval of the Vitaria generator which provides autonomic regulation therapy - ART - for chronic heart failure; the first commercial implant of the Vitaria generator; the commencement of the early use program for our ProGuardian REST system; and first shipments from the new international manufacturing facility in Costa Rica.And there is one more that we announced Tuesday of this week - the Food and Drug Administration has now approved the AspireSR generator for commercial sales in the U.S. Before turning the call over to Rohan and Greg, and I would like to cover three items.First, our international team achieved a highly successful launch of the AspireSR generator in Europe led by Jason Richey, our then-VP and International General Manager.Jason and his team planned and executed a limited commercial launch in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and significantly expanded this launch in fiscal 2015.In each country where the product has been launched, sales have increased each quarter.This is both a testament to the technology and the unmet needs of people with epilepsy who are looking for better ways to manage their disease.Second, we recently made a number of management changes which Rohan will cover in more detail.Our objectives were to prepare for the launch of the AspireSR generator in the U.S. by bringing Jason’s European experience to the U.S. and to facilitate our planning for the proposed integration with Sorin.Third, the merger update - there’s been significant effort and progress on the part of both organizations and our respective advisors with respect to the regulatory filings and integration planning.The announcement on May 12 of the senior management team for the new company is evidence of the progress.I am pleased to report that both planning and filing activities are proceeding along expected paths.In April, we announced that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act had expired.Last week, Sorin’s shareholders approved the proposed merger.We are advancing toward our special stockholder meeting soon to be scheduled, and closing of the merger is still expected to take place before the end of September.On the topic of guidance, although we are not providing fiscal 2016 guidance, our expectation includes a resumption of more robust U.S. growth with the AspireSR launch, ongoing international growth, and some revenue from initial commercial activity around Vitaria for CHF in certain European markets.Overall, the Cyberonics team is making good progress on all key fronts - commercial, product development, and merger preparation.Thanks Dan.First, epilepsy market development.As Dan outlined, the AspireSR generator has now been successfully launched in Europe during the last year or so, and with the recently received FDA regulatory approval, we began selling this important product in the U.S. immediately.The rapid and increasing adoption of the AspireSR generator in key markets, along with encouraging although early improvement in patient condition, gives us confidence for our plans in the U.S. market.Using experienced employees from our European commercial operations, we undertook extensive of our U.S. sales team and we began shipments of AspireSR Tuesday of this week and implant as of Wednesday.Our international business has continued to expand in all markets and we have achieved double digit adjusted revenue growth for 16 quarters.In the most recent quarter, international markets accounted for over 35% of all units sold and approximately 45% of all new patients implanted.The whole international team can be proud of this achievement.In fiscal 2015, we did not achieve our U.S. business growth objectives to the level expected.While replacement activity is in line with our expectations, new patient implants have been below the levels outlined at the beginning of the year.We have recently made changes to the U.S. commercial management team in order to reposition the company for growth, and we firmly believe that more significant growth is achievable.The number of drug resistant epilepsy patients remains substantial and the need for VNS therapy remains as large as ever.Jason Richey is now leading the U.S. sales and marketing team.Based upon his experience with the AspireSR generator in Europe, Jason is well positioned to help us restore higher growth.Under Mark Verratti’s leadership, we will continue the epilepsy growth trajectory in our international markets, commercialize the Vitaria system for chronic heart failure, and plan for integration with Sorin.Sherry Perkins, who was leading Global Marketing, has taken on an important role with the integration team in addition to her new business development activities.Turning to CHF, we have established a small sales and marketing team in Europe to begin the initial introduction of this important therapy to the large potential market for CHF patients.Our first commercial implant has recently taken place and the pace of activity is expected to increase as the year progresses.Now let me cover the product development update.ProGuardian REST system - we are excited to report that we recently commenced an early use program in the United Kingdom.This involves places the first ProGuardian systems with approximately 30 families for three months, with the objective of exercising a new sales and distribution model and validating the market for this seizure detection device.We expect to report on our progress with this program later in the year.Centro generator - wireless IPG capabilities represent an important addition to our product portfolio.While our engineering team has made progress on development of the wireless enabled VNS therapy generator, we conducted an extensive review of the project over the last few months.Following this review, we concluded that certain aspects of the wireless generator would benefit from redesign and we will commence planning for new product.In conjunction with this re-scoping of the project, we wrote down some of the related project assets.Consistent with the cardiac rhythm management market, we expect wireless communication will be a desire feature going forward.John Murphy joined Cyberonics at the beginning of the fiscal year as our new Vice President of Research and Development.John has extensive development experience with major medical device manufacturers as well as in the defense and telecommunications industries.We are pleased to have someone with John’s experience heading the most important projects we have ongoing, including the redesign discussed above.Thank you, Rohan.Product sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were $74.1 million, representing growth of 2.6% over the fourth quarter of the prior year on an adjusted basis.This growth was 5% on a constant currency basis.U.S. unit sales decreased by 2% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Generator ASP grew by 4.1% this quarter and resulted in an overall increase in U.S. product revenue of 2% for the fourth quarter.Excluding the 126 units delivered as the second part of a single contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, international unit sales increased by 18.4% this quarter to a record 1,320 units, and constant currency revenue increased by 17.5% to $16.5 million.For the fiscal year 2015 as a whole, worldwide sales as adjusted increased by 5.7% to $292 million, and unit volume by 5.5% to 14,515 generators.Again excluding the net sales as part of the single country order and the license fee revenue from the fiscal 2014 totals, both non-recurring, sales in fiscal 2015 increased by 6.8% on a constant currency basis.As Dan mentioned, foreign currency movements when compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year had a significant negative impact on international revenue for this quarter of approximately $1.8 million, and for fiscal year 2015 as a whole it was a negative impact of approximately $3 million.With respect to U.S. lead sales, quarter-to-quarter variations will occur for a variety of reasons and may not be indicative of underlying activity; for example, physicians replace some leads each quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, U.S. lead sales were 1,142 compared with 1,173 in the previous year, a decrease of 2.6%.The trailing four quarter rate of decline in U.S. leads was 3.5%.For fiscal year 2015, we guided growth for U.S. replacements in the mid single digit range, and our estimate for the growth rate of replacements for the fiscal year is consistent with the rate that’s in our original guidance.The AspireHC generator accounted for approximately 45% of U.S. unit sales in the most recent quarter and exceeded for the first time the number of Demipulse generators, which accounted for 44%.Internationally, AspireHC generators accounted for 11% of unit sales and the AspireSR generator unit sales accounted for approximately 23% of all international sales.The reported gross profit of 89.8% in the fourth quarter was marginally lower than the previous quarter.For the full year, gross profit was 90.6% and consistent with our original guidance.The lower number this quarter reflected some early inefficiencies from the opening of our Costa Rican facility and a higher percentage of international sales.With the roll-out of the AspireSR generator in the U.S., associated royalties, and the tablet programmer required for this product, we expect a lower gross margin in fiscal 2016.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, adjusted operating income was a record $26.5 million or 35.8% of sales, an increase of 13.1% when compared to the $23.4 million or 32.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.For the full year, adjusted operating income was $99.5 million, an increase of 15.7% over the adjusted $86 million in the prior year.Adjusted operating expenses were lower than the third quarter’s expenses primarily due to lower selling and compensation expenses as well as lower research and development expenses, due to the pause while the internal review was undertaken.Reported expense numbers include the write-downs for the Centro generator reflected in our press release, although these have been excluded for non-GAAP comparisons.In line with our expectations for fiscal 2015, adjusted research and development spending was 14.1% of revenue for the full year.Generating operating leverage continues to be a key objective, and we are pleased that adjusted operating income represented 35.8% of sales during the quarter, and as adjusted, 34.1% for the fiscal year as a whole.Earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, equity compensation expense, transaction expenses and other adjustments totaled $118.7 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of 15.4% over fiscal 2014.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we had an adjusted effective tax rate of 36.4%, and our adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2015 as a whole was 35.2%.Again, this was in line with our expectations set at the beginning of the fiscal year.Stock repurchases in the quarter reduced the number of shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation to 23.6 million, approximately 3% lower than in the fourth quarter of the prior year.We repurchased 129,000 shares in the fourth quarter, and as stated in our press release, 875,000 for the full year.As advised, this program ceased with the merger announcement.Adjusted income per diluted share of $0.64 increased by 16% when compared to an adjusted $0.55 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.For fiscal 2015 as a whole, adjusted income per diluted share was $2.44, an increase of 21% over the adjusted $2.01 in the prior year.Our balance sheet remains strong.After spending $49 million repurchasing shares on the open market during the fiscal year, stockholders equity is approximately $277 million.We have over $151 million in cash and short term investments and no interest bearing debt.Fiscal 2016 guidance - we’re not providing revenue or operating income guidance for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the potential disclosure obligations imposed by the U.K. listing authority and arising from our proposed merger with Sorin SPA, as well as a planned change in our fiscal year-end following the closing of the proposed merger.With the launch of the Vitaria generator in Europe and the launch of the AspireSR generator in the U.S. market, we have confidence that on a constant currency basis, sales growth rates will be higher in fiscal 2016 than in the recently completed fiscal year, and more in line with our historical averages.Hey, good morning.Thank you very much for taking my question.I wanted to first ask about the U.S. epilepsy business and the outlook for 2016.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I just <b>wonder</b> , you talked about the <i>better</i> sales performance with the launch of SR. .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Is that primarily a function of the ASP uplift, or do you expect unit growth to accelerate as well in fiscal ’16?Good morning, this is Rohan.For fiscal ’16, we really see a number of factors playing into this.Clearly the AspireSR launch, and we have seen AspireSR perform very well in the markets we’ve introduced this in, in the international arena, so we anticipate that it will take market share in terms of our mix, but also we do believe that there has been some incremental growth in utilization.That will be coupled with our organizational changes we have also described in terms of further alignment of our commercial organization and really a more interactive goal-setting approach to driving our sales force, so we feel comfortable and confident that we will be increasing our growth rate in fiscal ’16 over ’15, relative to the U.S. epilepsy business.Okay.Then my second question on CHF, how much revenue contribution should we assume for fiscal ’16, just given the lack of reimbursement in Europe, and then also if you could just talk about what the U.S. clinical pathway is for that.Thank you very much.This is Dan.I’ll take the second part first.The U.S. clinical pathway will be an IDE and a PMA with a large study in the numbers, 500 to 600 patients in all likelihood.So that actual clinical pathway has not been established yet beyond what the regulatory pathway would be, consisting of the IDE and the PMA.The second part of the question, as far as CHF specific numbers for Europe, I don’t think we’re going to break out specific numbers for Europe.It’s very early in the launch of the product and we’re going forward like we do with all of our other products [indiscernible].Hey guys, this is Kaila for Margaret.Just to follow up on the prior question, trying to get a sense for your expectations as far as the core epilepsy business going forward, just augmented by AspireSR.So first, curious primarily about the competitive dynamics within epilepsy and whether or not you’re seeing those persist, and then can you give us a sense for what sort of incremental sales AspireSR might contribute longer term, five or 10 years out?Absolutely.So with regards to the marketplace, we have talked over the last four quarters or so with regards to factors that have provided some degree of headwind to our business and our growth, and while they have persisted, they have abated to a certain degree.With the introduction of AspireSR, we feel quite confident that we will be reinvigorated and also be able to engage our physician community in this new and very innovative product.With regards to your secondary question about 10-year outlook, I think that is--the fact that we’re not giving guidance for fiscal ’16 is one where we certainly wouldn’t want to be providing much longer range outlooks, and we’d be doing that more at the investor day presentation level.But as you look at what each of our products has done as new products, when we brought Demipulse to the market, it became a majority of the Pulse versus Demipulse business, upwards of 70 and 80%.You can see with HC for the first time this quarter, the sales of HC at 45% versus Demi at 44%, and Pulse way back there at 11%.To get to your question, I think eventually AspireSR will become a majority of the mix, but we will also be expecting to introduce new products into that mix as well, which may change the overall distribution of the various product lines of the various generators.Okay, that’s helpful.Then understanding you don’t want to give formal guidance, but just trying to get a sense for what gives you confidence in that growth acceleration for this fiscal year, understanding you have Vitaria and AspireSR and both are going to be drivers, can you just help us parse out how the core business is going to contribute on top of those new products?Kaila, this is Greg.I think what we’re going to see is a continuation of the very strong international growth that we’ve seen over the last few years.That impetus should be maintained, and of course I’m talking on a constant currency basis but from a unit perspective, we’re very encouraged with the trajectory that’s going on there.Second of all on the U.S. side, we think that reenergized, if you will, market from the introduction of AspireSR is going to be--there’s going to be a lot of excitement around that.We’ll continue with our core replacement business, and of course we will continue to take prices as Rohan indicated earlier.This is Dan.I just want to follow up on that chronic heart failure question, because there was noise in the background or a voice in the background - I’m not sure that I answered the question about specific numbers and what we’re looking at for Europe.The point I was making is that like we do with any epilepsy product, we’re very careful in how we launch a product.We go actually market by market, but at a level even below that where we go account by account and we’re learning along the way.So we would tend to be very conservative in our estimates, in our forecasts.We’re not going to give specific guidance for a specific product line, but the way we will approach chronic heart failure in Europe and what’s underway, it’s to start out in a country in specific accounts, build our business in that account, learn as we go, and over time hope to grow that into a very meaningful business.But we won’t be breaking out specific numbers for fiscal ’16.Hi, good morning.Thanks for taking the questions.Greg, for you, a few housekeeping questions to start.I’m sorry if I missed this, but could you give us the OUS leads number as well as depression, the quarterly depression sales for the fourth quarter?Perfect, thank you.Then just a few more general overreaching questions about clinical studies.First with respect to the epilepsy market, and also CHF, with AspireSR and what it brings to the table, what are your thoughts about a randomized clinical trial at this point in time to establish that definitively and perhaps drive penetration over the longer term?And then on the CHF side, appreciating that it’s early days, I’d be interested in at this point in time what you’re contemplating with respect to not necessarily trial size - you gave that, but the control group, the inclusion/exclusion criteria, really the target patient population you’ll be going after at least initially with a PMA trial.Thank you very much.Jason, it’s Rohan here.I wouldn’t want to speculate about additional large scale clinical trials for AspireSR.We’re very pleased to have been able to work with FDA to get the AspireSR product approved and going through the regulatory path.We’ve already done two clinical trials - the E36 and the E37 trial for AspireSR, and they will be published in the prospective time period.So as far as we see, I think the market adoption in Europe and the international markets has been growing quarter by quarter.We’ve been seeing sequential growth in penetration.We’ve seen very good anecdotal conversations with regards to its efficacy and performance, and at this stage I wouldn’t think we need to step into a randomized clinical trial, but obviously we would monitor this throughout the ongoing process.If I can add to that for the SR specifically or VNS therapy, this product, or VNS overall has been in markets for more than 15 years.We have literally over 1,000 papers, and the thought of maybe doing a randomized control trial when we know in some of those studies when we looked at magnet mode, the effects of magnet mode and how that magnet mode can either stop or dampen, lessen the effects of the seizure, and we know that every seizure matters, the more you can decrease the number of seizures, the more you can decrease the impact of those seizures.All of that matters, so we know when we’re automating a feature here and not taking away the magnet, it is important that we continue to study the product but we don’t see any need for a randomized control trial with SR.We know the product works, and we’re very excited about the results to date in both Europe and we think we’ll see the same thing in the U.S. Moving over to chronic heart failure, I think it’s very early to be thinking about designing a trial for the U.S. and giving endpoints.As we all know, mortality with chronic heart failure has 50% mortality at five years, so it’s not one where we’re going to get into actually designing a trial now.You can see another trial that’s out there, and that’s why I mentioned the kind of numbers.Also, another consideration here is by the time we’re conducting any U.S. trial, if all goes according to plan, we would expected to be in a merged organization.So it’s a bit early to be designing a trial.Hi, thanks for taking my questions.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>wonder</b> if you could talk about your SR experience in Europe a little bit and what your learnings have been over there that you think will increase your chances of success in the U.S. Certainly , Charles .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As we always do, we enter into a limited commercial release with our new product, and we actually did learn a lot with regards to AspireSR.One of the things that we are seeing is that really this is a product which is for everybody in the treatment-resistant epilepsy population, that it has broad applicability both for new implanted patients and also for patients who are at end of service.We see just anecdotally differential improvements between the first implant and AspireSR with the additional automation of tachycardia-based seizure detection.So we’re very excited by it and we certainly have been honing our marketing messages, our selling messages, and we feel very good about that.We took those learnings and we incorporated them into our U.S. commercial launch activities, bringing our European sales force, some of the key folks from the sales force over to train our U.S. team on those lessons learned, and we feel that we have incorporated them effectively in terms of our U.S. launch preparations.I’d also mention the market reaction to that in Europe and our first and largest countries, it’s already become a majority of the business in Q4, or nearly half of the business in the other case.So we’re very optimistic because accounts are buying it, reusing it, reordering it, reusing, and overall we think SR has a very bright future in each of the markets that we take it to.Okay.In following your stock for the last five years, some things I’ve heard from clinicians have been that VNS therapy works well in about a third of the patients.It works okay in catching the seizures in the other third, and doesn’t work great in the last third.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm <b>wondering</b> specifically on sales tactics , for that middle third where it works okay , sometimes it catches the seizure , sometimes it does n't , has there been any sales tactical kind of changes in Europe to grab that second third ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And I’m not sure if you agree with my assessment or not, but maybe if you could just kind of help me understand that a little bit.Yes, I would start with the refractory epilepsy piece.We know that fortunately drugs work in two-thirds of patients, and unfortunately in one-third they don’t.We don’t replace drugs, but we’re adjunctive to drug therapy, and if you start with that--you know, I’ve never had a seizure, I don’t ever want to have a seizure.Every seizure matters.I was at a recent meeting around SUDEP and they talked about four things that as clinicians they believe we needed to do to try to dampen or lessen the effects of SUDEP overall and lower the mortality rates associated with that, and one was to take your meds, number two was get enough sleep, number three was stay away from alcohol, and number four was every seizure matters - try to stop seizures overall.So we know that VNS therapy stops seizures, but we know very few people - less than 10% - who get VNS therapy are actually seizure-free.But another key fact, and to me the ultimate in efficacy is once we get a patient implanted and their battery is depleted, what percent of them come back for a re-implant?Because the physician has to be willing to prescribe it again, a surgeon has to be willing to implant it again.There’s usually co-pays and costs, and it is still an outpatient surgical procedure so it still requires a real commitment to the therapy.We find that in over 90% of cases, patients come back for a re-implant.So to me, when we think about the third, the third and the third, we first think about any patient with refractory epilepsy should be doing everything they can - numerous drugs, whatever they can do, VNS therapy - to reduce their number of seizures, and it all starts there.And then once implanted, although we are less than 20% penetrated like we were eight years ago, but we’ve more than doubled the business in that process, once they’re implanted, we know that the battle has largely been won because when that battery is depleted, we’ve got a captive audience and a re-implant, and that to me is the ultimate in efficacy, not the third, the third and the third.Okay, thank you.That dovetails nicely into my last question.We have an approval now from GW Pharma for Dravet syndrome.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm <b>wondering</b> if you feel like there 's been any impact to your base epilepsy business from that drug .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Thank you.Charles, I think what we hear from the sales team here in the U.S. in particular is that some of the activity around the alternative treatments has slowed down our pipeline, and some people are trialing various alternative treatments.We don’t think those patients are lost.We think they’re probably delayed, but it’s had some impact over the last year.As you know, there’s been a lot of publicity around the alternative treatments.We feel that with the AspireSR now launched, we have increased excitement around VNS, and we’ll be able to accelerate the pipeline again.And you know, you focused on Dravet where there is some activity, and important activity.Again, any patient we can collectively help, as an industry, who has epilepsy and dampen the effects of their seizures or stop their seizures, we’re all in this together.But I think you’ve just identified a very small segment of the overall epilepsy population with Dravet, an important one but a small one as well, small enough that people are considering HDEs, which are less than 4,000 patients per year.Thank you.As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question at this time, please press star followed by the number one key.Our next question comes from Steve Brozak of WBB.Your line is now open.Yes, hi.Good morning gentlemen.Most of the questions I had have been asked and answered, and my voice is going, so I’ll just have one question.Going into the future, obviously you’re making a lot of progress in terms of the Sorin merger integration as far as all the regulatory steps.Looking into the future is pretty much what I’m interested in.I know you can’t give any guidance, but what would be your [indiscernible] in terms of how to start thinking about modeling, because obviously there is reimbursement issues quarter to quarter with different year-end deductibles and such.What should we start to think and how should we start to think about the new Cyberonics, because obviously September is right around the corner, and that’s obviously one of the most critical junctures for future expectations of Cyberonics shareholders.Thanks for that question.As we announced the merger, the proposed merger with Sorin just over three months ago, the time we talked about the integration work that would be done, we talked about a change in fiscal year-end, and at the same time we talked about synergies that would take place over the years to 2018.We also talked about guidance, so at the time we said that the combined company, the new company would be issuing guidance around probably shortly after the merger is completed.I think that’s still the current plan at that time, and so that would be the appropriate time.There have been some regulatory filings which provide some pro forma financial results on a common fiscal period, or almost common fiscal period, and in common currency and with common accounting standards.I think that could be used as a basis for this and apply what assumptions you think are appropriate to growth.But of course, you would have to take into account the various synergies that have been outlined.Thanks for taking my follow-up questions.A question for you on SR.What I’m trying to understand is have you found that the SR product in Europe has truly expanded the market for the patients that would not consider VNS in the past, or do you feel that you have basically cannibalized your existing business in Europe?Thank you.Charles, I think it’s important to take the view on SR that it has been on the market just a little over a year, and certainly in its initial limited launch we were careful in terms of how broadly we expanded it to ensure that we had continued and repeated business and sales at the facilities we were at before we expanded it.But as we have expanded it and we’ve seen penetration increase, we certainly feel comfortable that the device is doing very well in the marketplace, but being able to parse exactly between explicit new patient growth and conversion from our previous generation, we certainly are recognizing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace for this device and there are cases that we can certainly point to relative to new patients having access to this device.But I think the specifics relative to this really in terms of the market expansion has yet to be able to be quantified.But I would say SR really has allowed us to sort of re-engage with all of our physician base and it really is like a re-launch of VNS therapy, so we would anticipate that we would be seeing the benefits you described over the course of time.Great, thank you for the detail, Rohan.Another international question on Japan - you haven’t really discussed that much on this call.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm <b>wondering</b> if you could give us an update on Japan and how things are going over there .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Charles, let me just comment on that.We have continued to grow in the Japanese market.We saw what I would call solid growth in fiscal ’15 over the prior year.I think we are encouraged for the market there.We obviously haven’t achieved the objectives we set out for ourselves five years ago in Japan, but we are making progress and I think the first employee, direct employee of Cyberonics has been in Japan now and engaged for about two months.We’re excited by that.I think we’re also already seeing some tangible results from a better interaction with our distributor in that market, so we have high expectations on a go-forward basis.Great.My last question is on Vitaria reimbursement in Europe.So you have reimbursement in Germany.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm <b>wondering</b> if you can give us any updates on other countries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This is Dan.Right now, we are definitely focused on Germany, and we’ll continue to go country by country to work on reimbursement through our market access team, but that is part of the strategy with the commercial launch, is to make sure when we go into a center, that not only are they excited about what this can do for patients, they can make sure they get reimbursed for it and we in turn get paid for it, so that will evolve market by market.I think at this point if all the questions have been answered, I want to just recap on a few things here.First of all, we’ve grown by double digits traditionally, and we fully expect with the launch of SR to get back to those kind of growth numbers pretty quickly here.The clinicians I’ve talked to so far are very excited about the product because you know how responsive they are or how they excited they are about responsive therapy, and this is an opportunity for them to have a stimulator that does respond, although to heart rate that can be indicative of a seizure, and to do that with a product that’s less invasive.So we have a lot of confidence based on what we’ve already seen in Europe with SR market by market, and what we expect to happen in the U.S. at even a faster rate to get us back to those double digit numbers.So as we look at the year and as I just close this out at this point, units at 6% on an adjusted basis, dollars--revenue growth of nearly 7%.Not where we want to be - we think we can and will do better, but we continue to leverage as well.Adjusted operating income, 16% growth; a margin of 34% growth, EBITDA of 15% growth, almost $119 million and 25% compound annual growth on EBITDA since 2009.Net income growth of 18% on an adjusted basis, earnings per share 21%, stockholder equity $277 million and cash of $151 million, and nearly triple the market cap of the company over time.As we go forward now with an AspireSR product that we can launch not only in Europe and continue with the success there and other international regions, but bring to our market that represents 80% of our market today, so we’re very excited about that, very excited about launching a new platform with Vitaria, having ProGuardian in an evaluation here, and let’s not forget about having sold devices for 14,515 implants in the last year.We believe going forward we can have an impact on mortality, which is important, and we know whether we’re talking chronic heart failure or if we’re talking about VNS therapy for epilepsy, we definitely contribute to quality of life for patients.As we go forward into this merger, we’re very excited about what can happen with the combined company.So as we close 2015 and in our early days of 2016, I want to thank the entire Cyberonics team for their efforts.I’m extremely proud of the accomplishments of this team, not only last year but over the last several years.As I often say to our team, I believe our best days are ahead of us.So I want to thank you for listening today and for your interest in Cyberonics, and we’ll talk to you again in August.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference.This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect.Have a great day, everyone.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Cyberonics, Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on June 04, 2015.</div></body></html>
