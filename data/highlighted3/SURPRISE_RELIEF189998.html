(NASDAQ:BEBE) | Seeking Alpha BEBE reported a nice improvement for fiscal 2015 but guidance was dour.The stock was hammered as the founder announced he was selling his 59% stake but that has since been rescinded, removing a huge overhang.Women's apparel retailer bebe (NASDAQ: BEBE ) has had a tough time in the last few years.The stock has plummeted from $7 to $1 in just 18 months as the company's operating losses continue to pile up.Much progress was made in fiscal 2015 but guidance for fiscal 2016 was very weak.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We also received a <b>surprise</b> share repurchase announcement from bebe yesterday , something you do n't expect to see from a company with shares trading under a dollar .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In light of all the conflicting evidence we've received, I'll take a look at bebe's valuation to see if it is worth a speculative look here.BEBE has struggled in recent years with its product assortment.That has led to declining sales and operating losses that go back several years.Some bright spots have been seen from time to time, including the just-concluded fiscal year that saw comp sales increase and margins rise.In fact, the 3.1% increase in comp sales for fiscal 2015 was enough to show a total sales increase - albeit very marginal - for the year and for the company's operating loss to be cut in half from fiscal 2014.That's tremendous progress and it has come through prudent expense management and a reshuffling of the company's merchandise strategy.These are things a struggling retailer should do and bebe deserves some credit for taking on that challenge.Unfortunately, it appears bebe is reverting back to its old ways with guidance issued for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.The company guided for a sizable loss as gross margins fall and comp sales come in decidedly negative.We've seen stops and starts with bebe in the past and perhaps this is another one of those but for me, to see all the progress of 2015 evaporate and the company slide backwards once more is disheartening and really damages the bull case.I think the company's eventual profitability is too difficult to call at this point.I would have been a lot more optimistic coming out of fiscal 2015 if the company hadn't issued such dour guidance.But it did, so I'm not sure what to think.Apart from the company's operations, there has been lots of other noise with the stock in recent months.The company's founder originally registered to sell about 47 million shares of stock back in June that would have put a whopping 59% of the company's shares on the market.This block of shares the founder owns has served as a way for the stock to maintain its value over time because so few of the company's shares are actually traded on a daily basis.In other words, supply was restricted for bebe shares so whatever demand existed was spread over a smaller share base.The stock reacted - understandably - extremely negatively to this news.On the bright side, part of the company's Q4 press release was a withdrawal of that registration and that means Mr. Mashouf will be keeping his shares for at least the foreseeable future.That is unequivocally good news and should remove an enormous overhang of supply that would have otherwise existed.Still, if Mr. Mashouf re-registers to sell his shares, we could see bebe lose half its value in a hurry once more.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The biggest <b>surprise</b> for me in the past couple of months was bebe 's announcement that it is buying back $ 5 million in shares .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For a stock that is trading below a dollar, that is a huge deal because you expect companies with share prices that low to be experiencing liquidity issues.And even though bebe's balance sheet condition has deteriorated significantly in the past year, I believe it is in good enough shape that it can last indefinitely.There are other retail stocks trading for a dollar or less that I do not believe can last indefinitely so I don't say that about bebe in a flippant manner; bebe has the liquidity to weather the storm.BEBE has about $65 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and about $41 million in trade payables.It also has $31 million in inventories that should be worth roughly $40 to $45 million at sales prices.I feel pretty good about bebe's liquidity position because it has enough inventory to match its payables and plenty of liquidity on top of that to finance anything it likes, such as a repurchase program.That being said, at some point, bebe needs to turn the ship around.As I said I was disheartened to see the company's fiscal 2016 guidance because it is very weak.It is possible management is under promising so it can over deliver but only time will tell.I do love the share repurchase program but the irony in it is that if the company continues to make losses, those losses will be magnified as they are spread over fewer shares.The benefit of a lower share count is a curse when the company is losing money.It will be interesting to see how investors take higher EPS losses.BEBE is still very speculative at this point but it has the liquidity to exist indefinitely.We saw some glimmers of hope during fiscal 2015 and if bebe can build on that momentum, we could see the stock move higher.With the overhang of Mashouf's sales now gone, the massive amount of overhead supply that used to exist no longer does.And with the company looking to buy back ~7% of the current float, that should provide some much needed buying pressure.I'm bullish here on bebe's liquidity situation because of its cash and equivalents balance as well as its lack of huge long term debt means it can finance itself for a very long time.I have confidence the green shoots of fiscal 2015 can return but this is a very speculative play and also hinges upon a lack of re-registration by the founder to sell his shares.But for a retail stock under a dollar, you can do much worse.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
