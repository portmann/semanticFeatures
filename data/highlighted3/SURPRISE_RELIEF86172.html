(NASDAQ:NATH) | Seeking Alpha On the surface, the results look good.Speculation, even mathematically-sounding speculation, can be very convincing but nothing is more reassuring than hard numbers.I've been a bear on Nathan's Famous (NASDAQ: NATH ) for a little while now and following Q4 results it has become official: Run, don't walk, away from this stock.On June 8, NATH reported fiscal Q4 results.Revenue increased by 17.9%.Net income jumped by 26.2% while EPS spiked 25.9% to $0.34 per share.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Included in the full year results , license royalties jumped an <b>amazing</b> 112 % due to a new license agreement with a new licensee that commenced March 1 , 2014 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By all obvious metrics , it was an <b>amazing</b> quarter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Here's where it gets really bad.Forget for a moment that the year-over-year comp starting with fiscal Q1 will start to get far more difficult.That's only icing on a very stomach-upsetting cake.Forget that same-store sales were apparently negative, again, since almost all of the chain is franchised anyway which simply provides a highly profitable royalty stream.The problem is the exploding interest expense.Recall NATH took out $135 million in debt at 10.0% interest back on March 10.The company did this primarily to pay a $25 per share dividend.The dividend has been paid but the debt and interest expenses now remain and are substantial.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I had <b>wondered</b> at the time if I was missing something but unfortunately it does n't appear to be the case .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For the first time in years, NATH reported an interest expense and it was for $816,000.This expense was for only 20 days of the quarter.The annual report now warns (my emphasis added), "Moreover, because of the interest payments we are required to make in future periods, our net income will be significantly negatively impacted compared to our reported net income in the fiscal 2015 period and prior periods.As we entered into the indenture on March 10, 2015 we were only required to accrue interest expense for 20 days during the fiscal 2015 period but for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2016 and in future fiscal years we will be required to accrue interest expense for the entire fiscal year.The impact of interest expense on net income will first be significantly reflected in our quarterly results for the period ended June 28, 2015."At the rate of fiscal Q4, that $816,000 would be $3.7 million in interest for fiscal Q1.Put another way, if that $3.7 million in interest expense had been in place for fiscal Q4, it would have entirely wiped out all of the net income and then some.Last year's fiscal Q1 , a seasonally strong quarter, showed pretax net income of about $6.9 million.I would expect this year's pretax and pre-interest net income to be somewhere in that ballpark but with the added deficit of $3.7 million in interest expense stripped out of it.In short, the market is going to be looking at a report with easily 50% give or take a few points down in net income and EPS.If the whole fiscal year is like that, and I don't see why it won't be, you'll be looking at an EPS of $1.30 or so this time next year.With a $40.68 stock price it comes to a P/E of 31 with little to no or even negative growth.I see much downside ahead.Source: Nathan's Famous: It's Officially Time To Get Out And Fast Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
