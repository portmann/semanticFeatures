year-over-year and branded revenue up 20%.Growth was driven by scale-out storage and related service revenue up more than 115% and DXi and related service revenue up 30%.We also reported non-GAAP net income of 18 million up significantly from the comparable period last year.Linda will walk through the details of our Q4 results but first I want to highlight several key points from our strong financial and operational execution in fiscal 2015.Throughout the year we continued to build on our momentum and achieved our best year-over-year total revenue performance in eight years.From a financial standpoint, our total annual revenue of 553 million came within 70,000 that is $70,000 of surpassing fiscal 2014 despite a nearly 20% year-over-year decline in OEM revenue and the fact that the prior year included $15 million in revenue from a one-time royalty payment.Excluding that payment we grew total revenues 3% at year-over-year.Looking at branded revenue it was up 7% over fiscal 2014 as we drove year-over-year branded revenue growth each of the quarters of the fiscal year.A key driver of our branded growth was our scale-out storage portfolio where product and related service revenue grew nearly 75% year-over-year in fiscal 2015 to a record 102 million.The tremendous momentum we are seeing in this product line is reflected in the increased year-over-year growth rates we experienced each quarter.We grew approximately 40% in Q1, 60% in Q2, 80% in Q3 and more than 115% in Q4.Another driver of our revenue growth was DXi product and related service sales which were up 10% over fiscal 2014 to 88 million.I'll go into more detail of our success, in executing on the scale-out and DXi growth objectives shortly.Moving beyond revenue to other non-GAAP financial metrics for fiscal 2015, our gross margin rate of 44.7% was the highest in more than five years.Our operating margin of 6.2% was the highest in three years and we generated more than 38 million in net income or $0.14 per diluted share, our best performance in four years.In short, we executed very well this past year both in terms of growth and profit objectives and our results reflect the strength of our business model and the leverage it provides.At the same time, these results further validate the multiyear business strategy we've been pursuing which I will address now.Several years ago we made the decision to expand StorNext beyond just a software-only offering, as we recognized the unique value it was providing in larger solution deals and the opportunity for us to capture more of the spend in these deals.Since, then we have moved from StorNext being just a standalone software product to serving as a foundation for ServerPoint initially and then starting just over year ago for a complete family of solutions.These StorNext Pro solutions which have continued to build out over the past year include specialized offering for meeting today’s most demanding workflow challenges such as managing 4K video.They are also based on our next-generation StorNext 5 platform which we launched at the start of fiscal 2015 and represented another strategic milestone.StorNext 5 provides a unique combination of the highest file streaming performance in the industry, the lowest cost of storage through the ability to move data to different storage tiers and the ability to seamlessly bridge applications and workflows from corporate datacenters to public clouds.These tiers include our Lattus extended online storage and object storage based solution that we added to our portfolio a few years ago, as well as Q-Cloud Archive which was just launched in Q4.Q-Cloud Archive enables StorNext users to realize the full benefits of the public cloud as another storage tier without having to make any change to their existing applications or processors.By moving to StorNext cloud-based solutions model and integrating Lattus and the cloud, we have been able to build on our leaderships in media and entertainment market and extend our reach to other verticals and used cases where we are uniquely positioned to address their workflow needs.In the media and entertainment space our product revenue including corporate video revenue grew 155% year-over-year in fiscal 2015 and nearly 190% in Q4.In addition some of our largest deals this past year including our largest deal of more than $4 million were for corporate video used cases involving both StorNext and Lattus.Finally outside of media and entertainment scale-out storage product revenue increased 13% over fiscal 2014 and more than 70% year-over-year in Q4.As I'll discuss later in Q4 we also laid the foundation for a significant push into the videos surveillance market in fiscal 2016 and intend to capitalize on StorNext’s unique value in other verticals and used cases as well.Another area where we have benefitted from strategic actions we’ve taken is our data protection product line.In the last 18 months, we simplified our DXi portfolio by centering on two new platforms, DXi6900 and DXi4700 which offer best-in-class performance and scalability.We have leveraged this streamline portfolio, our industry leading deduplication technology, our market share leadership in tape automation and a more cost effective solution level approach in our sales and marketing efforts to capitalize on customers’ evolving data protection needs.This has enabled us to return to a growth path with DXi, which as I mentioned had a year-over-year revenue growth of 10% for fiscal 2015 and 30% in Q4.In addition, we believe our DXi momentum and our ability to offer customers a combination of best-in-class tightly integrated disk and tape system enabled us to maintain our market share leadership in tape automation.The final point on strategic execution I want to highlight relates to our expanded market reach through channel and technology partnerships.This has been a key priority over the past year and we’ve made significant progress.In fiscal 2015, we increased the number of scale-out storage resellers by 38%.In addition, we established new technology partnerships in forensics for cyber security with FireEye, video surveillance with Milestone and 3VR, oil and gas with Avira, and cloud services with Amazon.We also announced two new initiatives with NetApp, a joint sales effort in Europe around a cobranded DXi incorporating their E-Series disk and a more focused go-to market initiative in North America in which we began selling their E-Series disk as a part of larger StorNext workflow solution through select media and entertainment and federal government resellers.Beyond this, we expanded our partnership with Fujitsu offering North America customers a joint solution for enterprise and mainframe back-up and achieve storage that encompasses Fujitsu disk and Quantum tape technologies.Most recently we announced a new partnership with Dot Hill in which we’re integrating its full line of enterprise-class disk systems into our tiered storage offerings.Lastly, we have a new technology partner program called Quantum Advantage that will reinforce the strength of our ecosystem relationships across all the markets that we serve.To sum-up fiscal 2015 was a key turning point for Quantum, with strong revenue and profit results that reflect the strategic actions we’ve taken to improve our financial and operational performance, deliver greater value to customers and to position the Company for the future.I’ll talk more about how we plan to build on this momentum in fiscal 2016 and provide Q1 and full year guidance after Linda discusses last quarter’s results in more detail.Thanks Shawn.Before I walk through our results I would like to refer everyone to the financial statements and supporting schedules included in the Press Release and on our Web site.It will be helpful to reference those documents as I comment.Total revenue for our fourth quarter ended March 31st, was 147.8 million, compared to 128 million a year-ago, an increase of 15%.As Jon indicated, branded revenue grew year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row, up 20% to 122.1 million.Scale-out storage and related service revenue was up 116% year-over-year, to an all-time high driven by revenue growth across all geos and revenue from big deals nearly tripling.Disk backup systems and related service revenue was up 30% year-over-year, driven by revenue growth in all geos and an increase in big deals.Branded tape automation was up 5% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in our mid-range offering.Slightly offsetting these increases was a decrease in OEM tape automation of 10%.We are pleased with the continued growth in our branded business, which more than offset the decline in our overall OEM business.In total, our OEM business contributed 14.8 million of revenue in the quarter.And for the quarter, non-royalty revenue totaled 136.8 million, of which 89% was branded and 11% was OEM, compared to 87% branded and 13% OEM a year ago.Total revenue for fiscal ’15 was 553.1 million this was an increase of 3% over this 538.2 million in fiscal ’14 which excluded the 15 million one-time payment we received from Microsoft in Q1 of fiscal ’14.Fiscal ’15’s scale-out storage and related service revenue was up 74% to 102.4 million and disk backup systems and related service revenue increased 10% to 88.2 million.These increases were offset by year-over-year revenue declines of 22% and 7% in OEM and branded tape automation systems respectively and an 11% decline in devices and media.Our fiscal ’15 branded business grew 29.8 million an increase of 7% year-over-year.Non-royalty revenue totaled 511.3 million of which 88% was branded and 12% was OEM, compared to 84% branded and 16% OEM a year ago.I’ll now walk through our revenue results starting with our data protection products.Tape automation systems revenue was 35.9 million compared to 36.2 million in Q4 of fiscal 2014.Branded tape automation revenue increased 1.1 million or 5% year-over-year, due to increases in midrange and entry level revenue, which were partially offset by a decline in enterprise sales.Revenue from large deals, those over 200,000, was down 32% from the same period in the prior year.Our win rate increased to78% and we acquired more than 100 new branded mid-range and enterprise customers for a total of approximately 405 new customers in fiscal ’15.From an OEM perspective, tape automation revenue was down 1.3 million or 10% from Q4 of fiscal ’14.The decline in OEM tape automation revenue was driven by reductions in sales of entry level and enterprise categories partially offset by an increase mid-range products.Moving to DXi and related service revenue, it was 25.2 million, up 5.8 million or 30%.Increased revenue in all geos drove the year-over-year growth.We saw strong revenue growth in systems over 80 terabytes with revenue more than doubling over the same period last year.We had a 77% increase in revenue from big deals, and our overall DXi win rates increased significantly a mid 15% higher.We also added approximately 85 new customers in Q4 for a total of approximately 325 in fiscal ’15.Finally, as it relates to data protection revenue, devices and media totaled 18.5 million in Q4, compared to 18.7 million in the prior year.Lower revenue from devices was almost fully offset by increased media revenue.Turning to scale-out storage solutions, as I mentioned our product and related service revenue increased 116% year-over-year to an all time quarterly record of 31.7 million.We have grown quarterly revenue from our scale-out storage solutions on a year-over-year basis for 15 consecutive quarters.In Q4 we delivered strong year-over-year growth across StorNext, Lattus and related scale-out storage service offerings.We were particularly pleased with the interesting adoption of our StorNext appliances and product solutions and Lattus momentum.We delivered revenue growth in all geos over the same period in the prior year and the number of worldwide partners selling our StorNext products increasing nearly 40%.Overall scale-out storage win rates increased significantly for the quarter to the mid 80th percentile.From a customer acquisition standpoint we added approximately 70 new scale-out storage customers in Q4 and approximately 315 new customers in fiscal ’15.Scale-out storage and related service revenue for the full year was 102.4 million an increase of 74% from fiscal 2014.Well over the 50% growth rate we were targeting last year.Moving to service revenue it was 38.8 million in Q4 up 3% from 37.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year.The increase was primarily driven by growth in branded contracts related to our StorNext appliance strategy.Royalty revenue was 11 million which was flat with the year ago.LTO 6 royalties more than doubled offset by a decrease in royalties to LTO generations 1 through 5.Turning to gross margins non-GAAP gross margin was 42.4% in Q4 up 50 basis points compared to 41.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ’14.The improvement reflects the positive impact of the changes we have driven in our operations, repair and service business models.Offsetting this was a decline in material margin related to changes in our overall revenue mix for the quarter.Looking at expanses non-GAAP operating expenses were at 2.5 million or approximately 5% totaling 56.5 million in Q4 compared to 54 million in the prior year.Year-over-year our sales and marketing cost increased 3.1 million, primarily due to an increase in sales commissions related to the growth in branded revenue and higher marketing expense.Research and development expenses and general and administrative costs each declined by approximately 300,000.Q4 non-GAAP operating income was 6.3 million compared to an operating loss of 159,000 in the same quarter a year earlier.This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 4.2% a year-over-year improvement of 430 basis points, which was driven by the changes we have made in our business model.Interest expense for the quarter was 2.1 million which included cash interest expense of 1.7 million and amortization of debt issue cost of 400,000.Interest expense decreased 300,000 from a year ago as we repaid 50 million of our convertible debt in January 2015.The average interest rate for our 153.7 million of convertible debt is slightly less than 4%.In Q4 we had other income of 13.6 million primarily related to a gain on sale of an investment in a privately held company.We also recognized a net tax benefit of 200,000 primarily related to monetization of certain tax credits which offset our foreign and state taxes.Summing up Q4 we had non-GAAP net income of 18 million or $0.06 per share compared to non-GAAP net loss of 2.1 million or $0.01 per share in the same quarter a year earlier.Given that our non-GAAP net income level this quarter requires the inclusion of shares for both our convertible debt in the EPS denominator we have included approximately 66 million additional shares related to the convert and the denominator and added 2 million of related interest expense back to the numerator.Focusing on cash flow for the quarter and the balance sheet at March 31, I would like to highlight several key points.Cash flows used in operations for the quarter were 5.1 million.On a sequential basis accounts receivable increased 13.5 million and manufacturing inventories increased 12 million.EBITDA for the last 12 months was 43.3 million CapEx was 400,000 we repaid 50 million of convertible debt during the quarter and at March 31 our debt consisted of 153.7 million of convertible debt with no covenants and no early call provision.There were no amounts drawn on our revolver at quarter end therefore we had no financial covenant compliance requirement.In closing I wanted to summarize our results for fiscal ’15 compared to fiscal ’14 excluding the one-time payment from Microsoft we received in Q1 of last year and the gain on the sale of investment in Q4 of fiscal ’15.Overall revenue was up 3% branded revenue was up 7% non-GAAP gross margins increased 190 basis points to 44.7%, non-GAAP OpEx was down to 213 million compared to 222 million.We generated 34 million of non-GAAP operating income and 24 million of non-GAAP net income in the fiscal year.This was $26 million above both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net loss for fiscal ’14.From a balance sheet perspective we ended the fiscal year with over 70 million in cash and cash equivalent.In addition, we have an unused revolver at 75 million and we expect to generate free cash flow in fiscal ’16.With our cash on-hand, the available revolver and the generation of free cash flow we have the ability to pay out the 84 million in convertible notes when they come due in November 2015.Thanks, Linda.As we begin our new fiscal year there are a number of important trends driving the storage market.These include the continued growth in unstructured data such as video, audio and images, the increasing business value of data overtime and the pressure to monetize it, the importance of being able to collaborate across geographies and the desire or even the mandate to leverage the cloud.We believe these trends have implications for the kind of storage solutions that will increasingly prevail in the market.First all data must be treated as having value.Second performance is essential.Third being able to share and access data is core.Fourth storage platforms must accommodate that has no boundaries.And fifth TCO is critical.All of this plays to Quantum’s strengths and makes us well positioned to build on the momentum we've established over the past year in both scale-out storage and data protection to deliver additional growth and profit.In terms of our scale-out storage plans for 2016, we will further expand our portfolio of full StorNext solutions with a goal of enhancing the customer experience, significantly growing our addressable market and benefiting from higher ASPs.We will also continue to focus on increasing our StorNext 5 appliance footprint with large install base customers particularly by employing more disk, object, tape and cloud storage.In doing so we will leverage our Q-Cloud service offerings announced last quarter both Q-Cloud Archive which is already available and Q-Cloud Vault which will be available late this year.Q-Cloud Vault provides cold storage in a public cloud for long-term data retention and disaster recovery, but fully managed by StorNext.We're also excited about our recently introduced Artico intelligent NAS archive appliance which serves both our scale-out storage and data protection customers.Artico offers those using scale-out NAS system a flexible low cost entry point for establishing archives outside of a StorNext environment with the ability to hold -- to scale to hold petabytes of content across our Lattus, tape and cloud storage tiers.Powered by StorNext 5 software, it incorporates StorNext storage manager policies to put the right content in the right place at the right time for maximizing storage efficiency and reducing total cost.Another scale-out storage priority is to build on our leadership in media and entertainment in both large broadcast and postproduction facilities and the midmarket with particular focus on 4K workflows and Apple Xsan environments.At the same time, we will leverage our broadcast and postproduction expertise into related areas such as corporate video, call stations and ad agencies.Beyond media and entertainment, we will make a major push into video surveillance as I mentioned earlier.This is a rapidly growing market with more and more cameras operating at higher resolutions being deployed.In fact nearly an Exabyte of total data is captured each day and the data must be retained for increasingly longer periods of time.All of this means the underlying storage infrastructure is critically important.Performance is essential to ensure that no video frames are dropped during the ingest of the footage as dropped frames result in incomplete or degraded images that undermine analysis.Because budgets are not unlimited the footage must also be retained at cost effectively as possible.These are exactly the types of storage challenges StorNext has long addressed elsewhere, so video surveillance offers us significant opportunity for Quantum and it also includes tape.Given the retention requirements and the fact that much of the footage captured in surveillance can be put into cold storage, tape has a clear role to play in the video surveillance storage strategy in today's world.We think our unique value of performance, storage sharing and seamlessly integrating with the public cloud are a great fit for this market.In addition to surveillance, other key verticals we will target include network forensics for cyber security, government intelligence and high performance computing.In all of these markets, the ability to ingest data extremely fast, retain it indefinitely and access it whenever and wherever needed all as cost effectively as possible is critical.Our scale-out storage solutions are specifically designed to deliver this and as we've seen in the case of 4K media workflows, the general purpose IT centric solutions offered by so many of our competitors simply can't meet these needs.Given this and all the opportunities we see in scale-out storage, we expect to grow revenue in this area 50% year-over-year in fiscal 2016.Turning to data protection plans turning our data protection plans for 2016, our best-in-class technology in both disk and tape and the tight integration of our two production lines are key strengths and we will continue to focus on increasing our combined tape disk market share to drive more profit and cash as well growth.In addition, this year we have more to offer datacenter customers in terms of achieve as already reflected by the introduction of Artico and a new DXi archive solution a few weeks ago.Having set new standards for high performance back up and overall value, our DXi6900 and DXi4700 appliances are now available with our TVO archiving software providing both backup and archive functionality in the same multipurpose appliance and significantly improving the ROI of a DXi investment.On a similar note, we will also increase the value DXi can bring to customers through our Q-Cloud Protect for AWS service.Announced in January and available later this year Q-Cloud Protect for AWS is a subscription service through Amazon marketplace which enables customers to replicate from either a physical or virtual DXi appliance on premise to a virtual DXi in the Amazon Web Service cloud.Another key priority in 2016 that cuts across both scale-out storage and data protection is capitalizing on our go-to market partnership with Dot Hill that I mentioned earlier.We already use Dot Hill storage in the form of the StorNext QXS disk systems including the StorNext QXS-5600 which has been extremely well received by customers.As we continue to build on our scale-out storage leadership in select vertical markets and used cases we will leverage Dot Hill’s technology to address customers specialize storage requirements.On the data protection side we have a large install base of customers that have long relied on us to meet their data protection needs and to help them adapt to an ever changing storage demands.By incorporating Dot Hill disk into our portfolio we will now be able to offer these customers an even broader range of solutions for storing and protecting data including tiering data within and across primary storage, backup and achieve.With that background for fiscal 2016, let me turn to guidance.For Q1 we expect total revenue of 125 million to 130 million with scale-out storage revenue projected to grow 50% over Q1 of last year.In addition to typical seasonality our revenue estimate reflects the fact that last quarter was very strong and a lot of significant deals closed towards the end of the quarter as well as our caution regarding OEM revenue based upon the performance last year.Beyond revenue we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 45% to 46%, non-GAAP operating expenses of 54 million and non-GAAP operating income of 3 million to 5 million.We also expect interest expense of 1.9 million taxes of 400,000 and non-GAAP net income of 1 million to 3 million or breakeven to $0.01 per diluted share.For the fiscal year we’re not providing specific guidance ranges in dollars but we are targeting total revenue to grow 4% to 5% year-over-year with scale-out storage growth of 15% over fiscal 2015.In addition we’re targeting operating income to increase 8% to 10% year-over-year.Given our focus on growth and a significant market opportunity we see, to the extent we have seen the total revenue targets we expect to reinvest into the company to deliver further differentiated solutions, pursue additional go-to market initiatives and improve long-term growth for the business overall.So nice job on the quarter, the StorNext growth was great and it sounds like obviously we’re expecting good growth this year.Just on the fiscal ’16 guide if we kind of back out the scale-out growth of 50% that implies I think a pretty -- it depends on how you mix it up but a pretty big deceleration in DXi growth and/or kind of take declines that are at or kind of above historical norms, are we just being conservative or could you provide any other color into the other segments of the business and how you’re thinking about them next year?Well I’m assuming it’s going to grow 30% again this year which wouldn’t mean the guidance doesn’t make sense.Yes, I know.We’re really targeting the market around on that piece.Basically one of the things we decided to do is we have so many really strong moving parts for the year that we wanted to get Q1 under our belt and we’ll provide more guidance as we get along here.We think there is a huge opportunity for us in video surveillance.And we want to see how that materializes I think from a plan perspective we expect DXi to grow next year.We expect tape to kind of be down in the 5% to 7% range and I think if you do all that math that should be pretty close to reconciling.And OEM piece I commented on that for the quarter, that’s down it’s half the size of scale-out, now less than half the size.It’s still about $60 million.It bid by far is the piece that we have the least control over and the lowest expectations for, for next year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Having said that it 's getting to be a fairly nominal amount compared to the other growth pieces so it depends I think Chad on what you pick for all those pieces I think for the royalty it 's been a great royalty year for tape <i>better</i> than we anticipated at the start of the year it 's hard to forecast it that way but tape 's increasing role in Archive might <b>surprise</b> us so I think the second thing that is down in that analysis is royalty .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would probably make it a little or we’re probably 10% for the royalty and probably 7% for tape.That's what we're starting with and as you know and you've asked this question before because tape is such an important part of the company both in terms of install base and profitability we’re trying to not we’re going to drive to get every tape dollar we can but from a modeling standpoint if we miss it on the revenue it hurts us from a profitability standpoint.So we’re trying to be conscious about that.Yes and then a couple of things more.On the scale-out growth that you are talking about 50% I know you are definitely investing and penetrating into to new verticals there, but can we get to the 50% growth just I don’t know if you call it blocking and tackling in media and entertainment market and just kind of rolling within that vertical or do we need these each other verticals to really kick in to achieve that 50% growth rate?I would say we feel really good about the 50% growth rate in the terms of what we know what we see I think it's -- so these other verticals take off in anyway shape of formula we see a lot of upside.Okay and then maybe last one from me and this might be more for Linda.Linda is there any kind of ballpark you can give us over the next couple of quarters of what you can generate from working capital on a cash flow basis I know December quarters are pretty good use and March quarters are pretty use of working capital how much can we expect to kind of realize in the next couple of quarters?Yes, let me -- as you know we ended the year with as we ended the year with 50 million in inventory which is higher than we have outsourced for 35 million and we kind of expect being lower with the outsource model so there is definitely cash that will come off the balance sheet with those AR and inventory over the next couple of quarters.Yes.And I think if you look Chad we got to get used to this growth company thing for sure we don’t want to leave revenue in the docks as you might say but the balance sheet definitely has I don’t know Linda had talked about maybe $20 million of improvement and maybe even a little more than that.My first question is how should we think about balancing out DXi and tape they are sold sort of into the same customer base should we sort of blend those two products together with the idea that DXi just maybe grabbing some share from tape overtime or maybe you can help me frame up how we should think about that?Yes.We are talking about the datacenter products together I think the way you just worded it is right on a combined basis we would expect those to be flattish to a little bit of growth we've added some new partnerships on DXi we've had a new partnership in tape with Teradata for a couple of years but with the salesforce really looks at them together in terms of their part of a workflow of backup or data protection and so if we can sell tape great if we can sell both grade if we need to sell DXi great so we're not doing anything unnatural to just drive one over the other we’re trying to leverage them together and that's really helped in terms of both focus but also our cost model.So we’re going to keep reporting on that way because some of your peers are used to that but with the way we think about it and the way we operate it for sure we think about those as part of a data protection and backup workflow.And then a scale-out you hit a little bit on it that security is picking up but if you look at your pipeline on the scale-out how much of it is media and entertainment and how much of it is outside of that?Media and entertainment for sure is the majority I mean it's more than half it's probably less than 75% though and when we talk about media and entertainment we’re including corporate video which candidly has a similar used case but a different kind of go to market cadence inside of Quantum so we think the M&E we think we're just getting started on 4K and high performance and all the attributes that are driving that so far extend replacement we think the new Artico product actually is a very interesting addition to the rapid wire to be able to do just archive on some of the workflows where performance isn’t as critical so it's a nice compliment to StorNext default system so we see plenty of opportunity in M&E we thought we would grow 50% and last year we ended up 74% if some of these other vertical market or opportunities take off that's just going to be supplemental to what we’re already doing.I want to dive into the international mix here, can you give me where do we finish up 2015 could you go over there again percent international versus domestic?Yes so we're probably Eric I would say in the 50% to 60% North America and then around 30% EMEA and the rest is APAC.Okay and then the reason I ask as I am just curious to know if you guys saw any pressure in that roughly 50% of the business that was international I have been hearing some out there global storage datacenter focused companies and again this is I guess kind of data at rest as opposed to revenue generating on workflow data but issues with CapEx budgets not just with international buyers and FX related issues, but multinational, domestic multinational that have seen maybe CapEx budgets turn back because of international demand, and have you seen anything there either in the fourth quarter or early here in Q1?Last quarter for us I mean all the three geos did great and it was really across portfolio.I think if there was a segmentation where we were saw the least amount of traction on a international even global basis was on enterprise back up for tape, but for us the DXi stuff and focus the scale-out, we sell a lot paper scale-out too.So it kind of balanced it out.We definitely got impacted by currency these last two quarters and that was like 4 million or 5 million.We don't usually break it out over two quarters of 4 million or 5 million the top-line and I don't know probably a couple of million on profits.But we had such strong performance everywhere else that we kind of blew through that.I noticed a lot of announcements the last week and it feels to me that the enterprise storage market does have some challenges for some people.We are cautious about the overall market.Having said that we love where we are vis-à-vis our piece of it around the opportunities with scale-out and leveraging our install base and data protection, so we're trying to be cautious about the world around us but be super energized by what we have accomplished this year and how we're positioned for the future.Okay and then a question on the guidance, you gave an outlook for non-GAAP operating income growth of 8% to 10% so starting with the FY15 base of 34.4 I am coming up with roughly a 37.5 million at the midpoint which is a little bit below for average thinking.I know we had some interest expense to go it against that and some taxes that go against that but I am looking at roughly $0.10 is what I am coming up with for our FY16, is there anything there I know you're focused on growing the top-line you've got growth opportunities the market share land graph, but is there anything else in there either products, product extensions, partnerships, go to market strategies, channel incentive why the not a bigger step up from the successful year you just had?Yes, I think we're in -- we kind shifted the -- I think your land graph statement is what I want to comment on.I think we feel like we've got a unique opportunity here, but for instance we're going to invest in surveillance.We've hired a VP that works for Geoff Stedman, we're hiring dedicated sales people those guys won't be productive right away.And I think we have a fairly modest expectation for first year revenue, but it could be binaurally a lot bigger and so we've got really not a lot of the upside and all the cost into the plan.I think we feel like we've hit on something with where the market is headed that it's going to run for awhile.And I think we had some very specific goals this fiscal year that we more than achieved and we're paying a bonus for the first time and I think we've done a good job of operating both growth and profit.We're going to lean a little bit more setting ourselves up for growth and making some investments where we think it makes sense and so I think you get a little bit of little sense of that.And the tape business is historically profitable, the royalty is profitable and we're replacing 100% royalty revenue with 50 percent-ish scale-out revenues so you're getting some of that masked up too all that looks great when you grow revenue like we did this last quarter.So we're trying to -- we think we're on a sport to really grow our way through into places where we can earn a lot of money but also grow revenue a lot.Okay you did have a gain on sale in fiscal ’15, was that part of the 34.4 or was that… So the 34.4 the 8% to 10% reflects the actual number that we reported not the gain on sale down below.But I don’t know where your $0.10 came from, when I’m looking at it, it looks higher than that to me.Okay.I do know your interest expense is going to change here, given the amount that you paid down on the part of the conversion as well as the clearing out of the covert, so [Multiple Speakers].That mean you are in the neighborhood right -- I mean I think the message that we’re trying to make sure that it’s a different time for us.We have grown – for in a fiscal year we’ve grown every quarter this year.We have a lot of momentum in the markets that we are in.I think this year in particular we’re going to lean a little bit more towards being a growth company and we have a unique position we’ve got a unique marketplace.If the stuff with surveillance takes off we’re going to I think it has the potential to be M&E like for sure.So the attributes are very-very similar and that’s a huge market shift.There is a lot of display on mass sold in surveillance when they were standard definition is cameras and the retention periods were 30 days or less.Now we are in a world where it’s all HD.There is analytics on top of it and they want to retain the data for a year or forever and it just fits right into our sweet spot.So we want to see surveillance deals already we have won a couple of this at least one I know a major one this quarter.So that plus continuing to outperform on M&E is going to be the big drivers.It was actually very impressive there in Q4.I was curious maybe I’m not trying to poke at you but you give your Q4 preliminary numbers that are on April 9th, of 145 million and you reported 147.8 so where did you find an extra $2.8 million ladder on I love the revenue upside but where… Actually to be clear we said it was at least 145.You go back and check that’s the account that got you there but we said at least 145.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's always hard on your fiscal year-end when you launch it out you do n't want to put out of a <b>surprise</b> , but we felt we were so far over the range we gave that we needed to give pre-release pretty quickly because there was a lot of buzz inside the company .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We still have to get through the order process which we’re still in the midst of now actually.And so as the orders would say the numbers aren’t done until the 10-K is out but we want to give ourselves a little room.So we didn’t find it so to speak.And with no questions remaining I’d like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing comments.Great.Well, thank you for dialing in today.I hope you can tell we’re pleased with the year but not satisfied about with all the opportunities that are lined in front of us.We think we have a lot.And it has been a great year and kind of positioned the company differently and we think it’s going to be a very interesting next 12 months and beyond and look forward to talking about that progress over the next fiscal year and we’ll be having our Q1 call in July.So we’ll look forward to talking to you then.Thanks very much.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference and we thank you for your participation.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.All other use is prohibited.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Quantum Corporation released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on May 06, 2015.</div></body></html>
