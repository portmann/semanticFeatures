Bove.It is said that without Prometheus, mankind would have never had fire.Without Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Americans would have never had thirty year fixed rate mortgages.Zeus punished Prometheus for giving fire to humanity by chaining Prometheus to a rock and having a eagle swoop down and eat out his liver every day which regenerated at night.The government punished Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for providing thirty year fixed rate mortgages supporting equal opportunity affordable housing by forcing them into conservatorship and having their worth stripped of them quarterly which regenerates quarterly.After all, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the most predictably profitable companies in America and this fact was not lost on the government who had to run a public smear campaign and write down all of their assets to justify taking them.GSE securities used to be recommended to those looking for reliable income in retirement.Having been two Fortune 50 companies, they were predictably two of the largest and most profitable companies in the United States and had their highest capital levels in history when they were forced into conservatorship in 2008.Accounting arrangements were made to make it look like the GSEs were hemorrhaging cash to the government.The largest tax collector anointed all of its tax collecting actions in the name of taxpayers.All of these events were unforeseen by the investing public.No one could have imagined that the government would negotiate with itself to take everything for nothing.That's why for decades GSE paper was considered to be a safehaven for investors.In fact, it wasn't the lack of operating cash flow that has destroyed the capital base that has powered the GSEs for decades.The capital base was depleted by the government deciding to take the net worth.In advance of this decision the government wrote down the assets of the GSEs as a means of justifying the conservatorship and then subsequently the net worth sweep.The exchange of optional cash dividends for the net worth of the company is unprecedented in history and flies in the face of established insolvency law.As recently as 2008 , investors have looked on the GSEs as worthy of investing billions of private dollars into.At that point in time, it would have sounded illegal if one was to propose the government come in and take everything forever.Nevertheless, that's what's been happening.Investments in these securities would have, without the government intervention, performed much better.After all, government intervention in this case was unnecessary since there was no liquidity crisis .The government merely took control of everything and those that opposed orders risked getting fired.As such, the culture of the GSEs shifted from being for profit companies to being run more like government agencies.It all begs the question, "Should the government be able to force companies into conservatorship where it takes control and everything forever?"According to the government's legal defense, 4617(f) and 4623(d) bar shareholders from questioning what the government has been doing.The beauty of the Senior Preferred Securities Purchase Agreement is that it allowed the issuance of over $100B of securities to two companies that were able to meet their obligations as they came due.Issuing unnecessary dividend bearing securities as conservator illuminated the true intent of conservatorship run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.Declaring cash dividends during conservatorship driving the net capital of the GSEs lower than liquidation preference of preferred securities outstanding was another action that demonstrated intent to a casual investor.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With these sorts of actions taken by FHFA the Third Amendment Net Worth Sweep should n't have been a <b>surprise</b> to any GSE equity investor .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Lawsuits began piling up in the middle of 2013.Here's how life works.It was the reversal of the temporary writedowns driven by accounting misrepresentations triggering an unprecedented in history discretionary dividend backdoor liquidation of the net worth of the GSEs that drew attention to the brazen scheme.Since then, the some of the lawsuits have been rolling for three years time and that's where the dynamics of procedural law have so far prevented relief of any sort to non-government investors.In 2014, Lamberth dismissed one of the leading lawsuits based on an incomplete and misleading administrative record.I can affirmatively say that now because evidence has been produced by discovery in another court that has been used to expose the lies employed in the government's original defense filings.The Perry Capital lawsuits is now up for appeal and will be fully briefed by the end of the month, I am expecting a ruling in late August in that case.I've had conversations with people who think that there will be a reversal, a remand and an affirmation.My own personal bias is that the law requires a reversal in this case because the net worth sweep which guarantees insolvency is the antithesis of an action taken to promote soundness and solvency, which is the legalese behind conservatorship.One of the biggest problems investors face with this slow rolling nationalization is statutes of limitations.In light of all of the actions taken against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, looking to the legal system to provide complete justice has its own bag of worms.What we know now is that FHFA committed accounting fraud and entered into illegal agreements and the irony is that the bulk of the lawsuits simply challenge the point in time when FHFA amended what was already an illegal agreement illegally after a period in time when the agreement was used to break the law in at least two ways.The implication is that investors believe the probability that the legal system offers relief is tied less to the fact that the law is or was broken and more to their ability to prove it.After all, the government's net worth sweep was the point in time when the government publicly declared wind down and was the culmination of all of FHFA's hard work up to that point in time and is probably the easiest action to prove illegal in court.Further, it was at that point in time that the cash flows to the government demonstrated that the enormity of value in GSE equities.Just like companies hemorrhaging money can't produce income statements using accounting tricks demonstrating profitability forever, FHFA was only incentived to mask the true profitability of the GSEs with fictitious accounting losses before the imposition of the net worth sweep.The fact that Deloitte and PwC signed off on these financial statements has led to lawsuits against those accounting firms.Lawsuits have been filed against the net worth sweep for violating state and federal law.Lawsuits have been filed to inspect the books.The craziest piece of this is that the government tried to step in front of and protect the audit firms by rolling up lawsuits against private audit firms for permitting the falsification of private company financial statements into the MDL which was dismissed for lack of merit.The great news is now we have Hulk Hogan's lawyers on board in the accounting fraud lawsuits: The craziest part of this to me that still doesn't make any sense is the motion from the defendant (NYSEARCA: PWC ) to reopen the case against itself : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been treated like government agencies since the imposition of conservatorship that's sole purpose appears to be to separate them from their shareholders.Shareholders have filed lawsuits in many courts for many reasons, none of which have gotten past the government's motions to dismiss.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As a shareholder at the time , the Lamberth dismissal was shocking and <b>surprising</b> and demonstrates the uphill nature of any litigation against the government .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'm not a lawyer.I'm not an accountant.I got my MBA from Purdue University.I'll be the first to admit that I'm not that smart.That being said, I have read the applicable law.I have also read all of the relevant legal briefs for all of the case.I have also studied what has actually transpired.This is not rocket science.This has been a deliberate transfer of dollars from the GSEs to Treasury by enacting a series of agreements and forcing accounting statements out of them to Treasury's benefit.As such, I've taken it upon myself to raise awareness to these activities that the director of FHFA Melvin Watt himself consents to the law being trumped before he got there.This apparently is not the sort of thing that can be changed without the help of a court.It has taken years to uncover evidence and get the government to produce incriminating documents undermining its earlier legal arguments.The argument that the government can effectively do whatever they want is undermined by the fact that its been proven to lie about why it was doing what it was doing.The only logical alternative is that the government can do whatever it wants and that includes lying and I simply don't buy it.Taking actions outside the scope of the law is still illegal regardless of whether the government says that what it was doing was inside the law or not.The point is that this is the job of plaintiff lawyers to prove and the mounting evidence is on their side even though the more than $100B and counting of GSE money continues to flow through to the government.I am betting on a reversal of the third amendment followed by an accounting restatement across the next 18 months.It would be great to get the warrants canceled but I simply do not understand how something like that would happen because courts seem to do things in piecemeal fashion and this has so many moving parts some of which may have escaped the statutes of limitations.I'm betting everything I have on this.Disclosure: I am/we are long FMCCH,FMCCP,FMCCT,FMCKO,FMCKP,FNMA,FNMFN,FNMFO.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Financial , Savings & Loans</div></body></html>
