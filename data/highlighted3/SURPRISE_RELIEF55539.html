Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call.At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.[Operator instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.I’d now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Robert Breuil, Chief Financial Officer.Sir, you may begin.Thanks, Mitchell and good afternoon everybody.Today after the market closed, we announced financial results for our second quarter of fiscal 2015, which ended on March 31.The press release is available on the Investor Page of our website at www.coriumgroup.com.Joining me today is Peter Staple, our President and Chief Executive Officer.In today's call Peter will review key aspects of our business and product development programs.I’ll then discuss our financial results for the quarter and for the first six months of our fiscal year which will then be followed by a Q&A session.During the course of today's call we may make a number of forward-looking statements including comments on our business strategy, debt financing, clinical trial timing and plans, the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones, the advancement of our technologies, our partnered and self-funded product development programs and candidates, the competitive landscape for our products, trends in our revenues, our ability to generate revenue growth and our ability to manage costs and other matters.These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those suggested by these statements.Given these risk and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.We also discuss non-GAAP net loss during this call in addition to and not substitute for or superior to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP.We believe that the presentation of net loss that excludes the non-cash, non-recurring gain from the change in fair value of an embedded derivative provide useful supplemental information to investors and facilitate the analysis of the company's core operating results and comparison of net losses across reporting period.Please refer to our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2015, for some of the important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations including any forward-looking statements made on this call.Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to account for or reflect events or circumstances that occur after this call.Thank you, Bubba.I’d like to welcome everyone to Corium's second quarter earnings call for fiscal 2015.The second has been a very active one for us and we’ve advanced our product pipeline programs and continue to grow our development pipeline.At the same time we have been advancing our partner funded activities and expanding our reach to create new revenue potential and build strategic value.In a moment Breuil will discuss our financial results in greater detail.I would like to just our with a few general comments on our current transdermal development and commercial manufacturing business.This business provides a strong foundation and supports our strategic capabilities and product development scale up and manufacturing.While the nature of the business means we will see some fluctuation in revenues and expenses while at quarterly basis.We have seen a recent shift toward higher R&D revenues as compare to relatively flat commercial product sales.Growth in R&D revenues is a leading indicator of new products to come.And as we move interstate of development requiring increased R&D investment.Our manufacturing and partner R&D businesses provide a stable platform that we are using to create increasing levels of value with new proprietary and co-developed products.Moving on to advance in our proprietary pipeline we initiated Phase IIa clinical study in our MicroCor or PTH program.This product is design to operate and innovative easy-to-use transdermal treatment for osteoporosis parathyroid hormone works by promoting bone growth which is a unique and desirable mechanism of action.Especially compare to other medications that act by interfering with a bone resorption.The only currently marketed PTH product in the United States which is sold by Lilly's FORTEO requires a daily subcutaneous injection and also requires refrigeration to maintain its stability and efficacy.FORTEO sells over $1 billion globally despite a relatively difficult to use dosage form and significant challenges that I have seen with patient compliance and adherence between them.As we discussed at our last earnings call, our Phase IIa clinical study has a two-part design.The first is a four-way crossover pharmacokinetic study conducted in postmenopausal women.I can share you with you today that the first part is now completed and we will be seeing preliminary results soon.The second part is a 28-day study in which subjects take the MicroCor PTH product home for self administration.This part was a Phase IIa study started in April and we anticipate at housing full clinical data from the trial this summer.In addition to this Phase IIa study we are actively preparing our three CNS programs for entry into Phase I pharmacokinetic clinical studies this year.Our first program to enter the clinic will be donepezil patch which is designed for once weekly delivery of the most widely prescribed treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease.Donepezil is the active ingredient in Aricept and the current oral dose response of this product present compliance challenges for family members and for caregivers who cannot rely on patients to consistently take their daily pills.They also have significant gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss.Our objective is to develop the patch that’s worn for full week and that offers the advantages of ease of compliance, sustained efficacy and potential to reduced G.I. side effects.Today, our transdermal and transmucosal product candidate has demonstrated sustained and controlled delivery and predictive animal models and we are on track to initiate clinical testing soon with results by the end of this year.We are preparing to initiate global testing of our Memantine product candidate later this year also for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Memantine is the active ingredient in Namenda and Namenda XR.Donepezil and Memantine are the most prescribed treatment for Alzheimer's disease uses separately and in combination.The third most prescribed treatment for Alzheimer's is Rivastigmine sold under the brand name Exelon despite established generic competition in its oral dosage forms the Exelon patch which is a daily patch achieved worldwide sales in excess of $1 billion.We believe once weekly transdermal product delivering each of the top two treatments would be very well positioned for commercial success.Our third CNS program which is a transdermal dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is progressing preclinical evaluation, we are planning to be ready for Phase I trials by year-end.Dopamine agonists work by directly stimulating nerve receptors in the brain.Typically dopamine agonists are used in patients who have been newly diagnosed or in earlier stages of Parkinson's disease to reduce symptoms.Dopamine therapy can delay the need for levodopa and the associated motor fluctuations that may occur with long-term levodopa therapy.In each of our Phase I studies we will assess the transdermal delivery and the PK profile of our proprietary transdermal patch compared with the PK profile of the oral dosage form.In certain programs we will also evaluate the effects of the product candidate on various excepted biomarkers that measure the activity of the drug being delivered.These data will provide us with a strong indicator or indicators of the product's performance in large-scale clinical trials before we have to make the investment in those trials.The data will also facilitate our discussions with regulatory agencies to define the clinical and regulatory path forward on each of these products.All of our product candidates deliver drugs that have been established as safe and effective.For this reason PK profiles that are comparable to those oral dosage forms in a steady-state as well as biomarkers for certain products that signal desired efficacy and significantly de-risk product candidates at an early-stage of clinical development.Each of our proprietary programs will be eligible for approval via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.In short we are preparing for clinical trial a four Corium owned products this year and are well on the way to completing the Phase IIa study with MicroCor PTH.We expect to announce data for the PTH program this summer and data from the donepezil program towards the end of the year.We also anticipate readouts from other two Phase I PK studies in the first half of 2016.As I mentioned earlier we are also expanding our proprietary pipeline on selective basis through strategic collaborations.We see these relationships as opportunities to add new product candidates, leverage our capabilities and expertise in certain areas of product development such as CNS and to provide access to potentially non-dilutive financing.Last week we announced the expansion of our product feasibility and development relationship with Aequus pharmaceuticals.Aequus is a Vancouver-based company that is developing improved dosage forms of CNS therapeutics.As you may recall we started working with Aequus on their lead program last year a transdermal form of aripiprazole the active ingredient in Abilify.We have now incorporated Corium Technology into the development of the candidate which we are targeting as a weekly patch.This transdermal program is designed to improve medication adherence and to reduce the frequency of relapse of symptoms for patient suffering from autistic disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.Other product development programs under this collaboration will primarily focus on neurological disorders in which current treatments are limited by high-frequency dosing, side effects or painful injections and non-compliance.The new agreement includes mechanisms for co-development of this product as well as other agreed-upon CNS programs that would benefit from our technology collaborative development efforts and co-funding.We see this as an approach that can provide additional product opportunities focused on significantly improved therapies for CNS conditions, while leveraging our technologies and resources.As an update on our partnership with Agile Therapeutics, we continue to supply the core product for their confirmatory Phase III clinical trial.Agile has taken great care in the planning and execution of the study and has indicated that they expect to complete enrollment next quarter.I would like to turn now to new applications of our MicroCor technology.As a reminder the MicroCor system is based on a patch that's about the size of - that has thousands of microstructures that are so small that are not visible to the naked eye.These proprietary microstructures are composed of the drug combined with polymers.After wearing the patch for just a few minutes the microstructures dissolve and disperse into the interstitial fluid just beneath the surface of the skin and/or absorbed into pulse stream as a solid from of drug without any moisture MicroCor is thermally stable and does not require refrigeration.As we've seen with our PTH product this small patch has the potential to liver drugs that otherwise need be injected.The design of our MicroCor technology carries an additional advantage as a needle-free system we avoid the risk of needle-stick injury to healthcare professionals and caregivers and also we avoid biohazard waste management.Because of avoiding the risk of needle-stick injury in MicroCor’s needle-free system, we developed a proprietary approach to combining polymers with an activation that fully dissolve the administration therefore avoiding the risk of injury and these features have helped us to deliver molecules including vaccines and that is the basis or another program to help fund MicroCor applications for the delivery of vaccines.We have submitted a proposal for a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or BARDA with an initial focus on flu vaccine.The objective is to advance a vaccine delivery system that can be delivered administered by patients or family members were a not trained healthcare providers and can reduce the economic and operational burdens of distribution and storage by avoiding the need for refrigeration.These are benefits that are well-suited to the features of MicroCor technologies that I have mentioned.We anticipate working with BARDA in the coming months to further define the scope and the terms of this potential arrangement.We recently completed a preclinical study evaluating the MicroCor system for the delivery of novel GLP-1 peptides for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.We've demonstrated and established animal models that we can deliver these peptides in a MicroCor GLP-1 system and obtained rapid absorption of the molecule with high bioavailability and long duration of affect.This opens up the possibility of delivering advanced generations of drugs like Byetta and Victoza that are more potent and long-acting without requiring injection.With this progress in Corium’s portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs, we also continue to add to the breadth of our board and management team.Recently, Eric Bjerkholt joined as a member of our Board of Directors and as Chair of our Audit Committee.Joe Sarret joining Corium management team in the newly created role of Chief Business Officer.We forward to the contributions of each of these accomplished individuals in helping us advance our business.At this point I'll turn it over to our CFO, Rob Breuil to provide comments on financial results and outlook.Robert?Thanks Peter.As a reminder our fiscal year ends on September 30, so today I’ll be discussing the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 which is the quarter that ended March 31, 2013 as well as the six months also ended on March 31.For the quarter we reported total revenues of $11.3 million compared with $10.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Product revenues for the quarter were $7.6 million compared with $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.This increase in product revenue was primarily due to a strong quarter for Crest White Strips partially offset by the anticipated decline in revenues from our Fentanyl product.As we have indicated previously revenues for Clonidine have generally been declining due to increased price erosion following the launch of a competitive product in May 2014.This has continued to adversely impact the amount of profit-sharing that we received from our partner Teva.This quarter we saw stronger sales of Clonidine, but that was due a timing catch up from last quarter's lower sales.Other than these occasional timing issues, we would not anticipate further growth in our Clonidine.While quarterly Fentanyl sales have been fairly stable following the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and even up a bit this quarter.The current market pricing and trends persist, we see the potential for declines in our revenues from this product in the fourth fiscal quarter.As a reminder we have limited visibility and how our partners will market and price our products in the future.So our expectation as the trends in our product revenues and especially our profit-sharing are all based on current and historical trend which may not sustained.As Peter mentioned earlier, we see more growth potential in our R&D revenues then in our established products business in this quarter with no exception.Contract, research and development revenues for the quarter were $3.6 million compared with $3.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Our R&D revenues from Agile and from two other partners including a co-development partner were hired during the quarter largely due to the advancing stages of the underlying development programs.Even though total revenues for the second quarter were significantly higher than the first quarter, we continue to believe that the total revenues for fiscal 2015 will be fairly consistent with total revenues from fiscal 2014.Turning to R&D expense, I would like to discuss our results in terms of total R&D expense which is the sum of the R&D expenses for our proprietary program as well as the cost of contract R&D revenues from our partnered program.As we have begin to engage in co-funding opportunities with certain development programs, we think it makes more sense to look at our total R&D investment.Total research and development expense for the quarter was $8.5 million up from $5.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.This increase was driven by the planned investment in clinical trials for our own pipeline of products comprising PTH and multiple CNS product candidates as well as the advancement of our co-development programs in which we share the development cost equally with a partner.General and administrative expense for the quarter was $2.7 million compared with $1.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.This increase was driven by the addition of staff, professional fees and outside services commensurate with the increased regulatory and reporting requirements of becoming a public company as well as the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted after the IPO which occurred in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.Net loss for the quarter was $7.1 million or $0.40 per share based on $18.1 million weighted average common shares outstanding during the quarter.This compares to net income of $3.5 million or $0.33 per share which was based on only $2.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.The difference in weighted average number of shares between the quarters arises from our IPO in April 2014, which also involved a significant recapitalization.As a result, direct comparisons to net losses per share in periods prior to April 2014 may not be useful to investors.As of March 31, 2014, we had 18.1 million shares outstanding.The IPO also resulted in a non-cash non-recurring gain of $6.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 arising from the elimination of a liability from an embedded derivative in a subordinated note.Without this gain we would have added non-GAAP net loss of $2.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $33.7 million compared to $39.9 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015.Looking at the first six months of fiscal 2015 we reported total revenues of $21.1 million compared with $21.2 million in the same period in 2014.Products revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2015 were $14.2 million compared with $15.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2014.This decrease in product revenue was primarily due to the anticipated declines in revenues from our Clonidine and Fentanyl products and we expect that trend to continue.Contract research and development revenues for the six month of fiscal 2015 were $6.3 million compared with $5.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2014.Our R&D revenues from Agile and two other partners including a co-development partner were hired during the quarter largely due to the advancing stages of the underlying development program.Total research and development expense for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was $16.4 million up significantly from $9.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2014.This increase was primarily driven by the entry of our MicroCor PTH anticipates to a clinical trials in February 2015 as well as the advancing preclinical work on our three CNS program.General and administrative expense for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was $5.4 million compared with $3 million in the same period of fiscal 2014.This increase was driven by the higher expenses associated with becoming a public company as well as the stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted after the IPO.Net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was $13.9 million or $0.77 per share again based on $18.1 million weighted average common shares outstanding during the six-month period.This compares to net income of $1.4 million or $0.02 per share which was based only on $2.2 million weighted common average shares outstanding in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.The increasing likelihood of an IPO in fiscal 2014 also resulted in quarterly non-cash non-recurring gains totaling $7.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2014 arising from quarterly decreases in the value of the liability arising from the embedded derivative in the subordinated note.Without these gains we would have had a non-GAAP net loss of $5.9 million for the first six months of fiscal 2014.Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Hey, thanks guys.This is actually Derek on for Jason.First, can you provide any color around the increase in sales of white strips to P&G should we view this is kind of a more of a one-time increase or do you see growth accelerating for the rest of the year?We don't really talk about quarter-over-quarter variations for our products as we kind of addressed and I even touched on earlier in the call there are some differences in timing and in particular with our generic products that would give away what our partners are doing.We do report on an annual basis and we do report the material changes between, but we don’t break it out certainly not on our prospective basis.Okay, and then second.I guess as far as your discussion with Teva regarding the Clonidine market I mean have you guys discussed what might be kind of a sustainable market share for their products in the market or is that some details that you don't really get into with them?Their market share which we can get the same way you can it seems to be fairly consistent.What happened is the price erosion had stabilized at a level where all the entrants are comfortable with their share.And just I guess, one like a modeling question as far as R&D and G&A as far as what you did in this quarter is that kind of a good run rate for kind of the rest of the year?Yeah, I think we previously talked about being between 10 and 11 and obviously we are getting closer to 11 and I think 11 is probably a good number.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Serge Belanger with Needham.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Hi, this is actually Nicole calling in for Serge.Could you actually give more color on how I guess sorry collaboration to enhance the R&D capabilities and does Equis offer technology that Corium doesn’t have and back to the transdermal del.Does Corium have any active role in developing this product?And are there any plans to enter additional similar collaborations and what’s the strategy and any thoughts and expansion beyond CNS?Yes.This is Peter Nicole, thanks for the question.I’ll take that one.Equis, I think will bring whatever technology they feel is appropriate to bear for product opportunities and they identify the product opportunity and called on us because of our transdermal technology and yes we are involved in the development program the collaboration started last year with a feasibility evaluation around the [delfi] patch and even we announced last week is an extension of that, so we expect to be involved in a co-development program with them.We expect to - we have the potential to expect to be able to add additional programs to that collaboration.The initial focus will be in the CNS area it doesn't preclude necessarily others, but CNS is an area that’s of interest to both companies.Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Jefferies.Your line is open.Please go ahead.Yes, thanks very much.Just a follow up on white strips it seems like it's your major source of revenue growth has there been some line extensions launched in new territories, can you speak to some of the strength in that business and where it's coming from?We do continue to work with P&G on new product lines, we have watched for them so for.P&G is interested in introducing the product into other geographies, ex-U.S. is an area for significant growth so that the growth will come from expansion of the product pipeline, the product offering as well as growth outside the United States.Great.And then you touched on vaccines and biologics little bit, what are – to add some sort of partnership with a large Pharma company, biotech company working on some of these and then you mentioned the Agile patch, can you just update us on when you believe the Phase III data will be - will readout?On the question about vaccines we believe that there are significant advantages of MicroCor with vaccines.There have been a lot of changes in the vaccine industry I believe, but we are in touch with the major vaccine players.So I think that's a possibility.We are focused initially on BARDA activity which we think is a way for us to scale up that technology in a non-diluted basis without offering rights.And in terms of Agile I would suggest that they do have better answers than I do they have said that they intend to complete enrollment during the third calendar quarter or the upcoming quarter and they anticipate they will complete the study in 2016 timing is really going to be up to there enrollment process.Thank you, and I am showing no further questions in the queue and I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Peter Staple for any closing remarks.Thank you all for joining us this afternoon.In summary, we generated a lot momentum in our clinical stage proprietary pipeline with the Phase II study ongoing and three products lining up for Phase I PK studies as well as our partnered programs at our new business activities.We look forward to building on these developments and milestones and keep you updated our on progress.I'd like to acknowledge the members of the Corium team for their dedication and advancing both the field of transdermal patch technology and especially our pipeline of first and patch products that are now in development.And most of all I would like thank our investors for their support as we continue to advance our programs which can provide significant benefits to patients as well as create value for the company and for our shareholders.Operator, could you please conclude the conference call.Thank you, sir.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.<span
