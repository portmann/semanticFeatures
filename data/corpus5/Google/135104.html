Why Twitter? - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitter's growth isn't the problem, expectations are the issue. Twitter's competitive advantage needs a few tweaks. Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) Interim CEO Jack Dorsey said it best , "An answer to why Twitter must be articulated clearly and felt everyone throughout the service." The company seems to be at a crossroads. It's not a question of will the service continue to grow, but at what pace? Clearly investors were not pleased with Twitter's recent results, as the stock plunged roughly 15% on the news. With a significant decline in the stock price comes the question Jack Dorsey wants to answer … why Twitter? In the world of social media and connecting individuals there are essentially two big dogs that Twitter must contend with. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is the 800 lb. gorilla, and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) specifically through YouTube, is the 799 lb. cousin. When it comes to monthly active users, Facebook grew this number by 13% annually , and Twitter reported an increase of 15% . Of course, when Facebook gains 13% with a monthly audience of nearly 1.5 billion, it means a lot more than Twitter at around 300 million. On the advertising front, mobile is the watchword of the day. Google said its results were driven by two things… mobile and YouTube . Facebook reported that 76% of its advertising revenue was generated from mobile. Twitter actually gets more advertising dollars from mobile at 88%. In fact, this partially explains why Twitter's revenue isn't growing faster. Mobile ads simply don't command the same type of pricing that desktop advertising does. Facebook's advertising revenue grew by 55% annually excluding currency, while Twitter grew this same number by 71%. Google's paid clicks are probably the closest comparable number to these advertising figures. Google's paid clicks grew by 18% overall versus last year. The point is, Twitter isn't doing terrible. The company is growing its user base, revenue, and advertising clients. The problem isn't growth, it's a problem of expectations. Real-time news with a more personalization = the future of Twitter Years ago when Facebook was far smaller, and YouTube wasn't the dominant video platform, these two services had very simple missions. When people signed into Facebook for the first time, the service immediately suggested friends they could connect to. YouTube was and is a video sharing service. You can send a link to people, and share the video on Facebook or other sites. These two simple services, garner on average about 40 to 50 minutes of usage per average day at this point. Twitter wants to articulate what it is used for…real-time news is the service's competitive edge. Project Lightning that comes this fall is part of that vision, but much more is needed. To convince the mass market to tap into this real-time new service, a few changes are clearly needed. First, users need to be able to select which people to see first in their timeline. Facebook recently implemented favorites in its Newsfeed, and YouTube subscriptions serve the same purpose. Second, Twitter needs to make individual's pages more Facebook-like. Expanding profile information, and adding a photos section with albums, are two obvious missing pieces. Expanded profile information would help Twitter gain more information about its user base. Users love to share photos, and Twitter's lack of organization in this area limits its mass appeal. For existing users of Facebook or YouTube, they may be asking…why can't I do more with Twitter? Twitter's CFO Anthony Noto gave voice to one of the biggest perceived issues about Twitter, it seems challenging to use. This isn't a criticism that Facebook or YouTube face. YouTube's watch time grew by 60% year-over-year , and Facebook's daily active users, are 64% of monthly active users. Active daily users, and increased usage, suggests usability isn't an issue for either of these services. If Twitter seems difficult to use, there are two primary changes that would resolve a lot of confusion for new users. Whether it's the use of the @ symbol, user names, or the 140 character post limit, these issues create a learning curve that drives potential users away. The best answer for Twitter…change them. Users don't need to be told how to communicate, they need a platform that lets them do so. Moving to real names would greatly simplify the use of the service. Moving the character limit up to maybe 500, would keep the conversation flowing, without making users feel limited. If the CEO and CFO both know the service seems difficult to use, investors should be asking, what are you waiting for? There is a lack of a sense of urgency to make dramatic changes to the core of the service. As long as the service's usability is limited, non-users will continue to ask…why Twitter? The bottom line is, Twitter has a treasure trove of power users that generate great content every hour of the day. The service is growing, but if it wants to move into the mainstream, some of the core functions need to change. Twitter also must realize that the mainstream won't use the service if they can't do on Twitter what they can do elsewhere. Expanding the profile section, and adding photo albums, would increase the usefulness of the service. Until Twitter is willing to make big changes, it will likely stay a limited audience service. Investors have one simple mission, look for these core changes to occur, and then consider investing. If the company continues on its current path, potential investors will be the ones asking…why buy Twitter? Unfortunately, at this moment, there isn't a good answer.
