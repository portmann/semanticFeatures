Ad Blocking: Facebook Investors Actually Benefit - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Some investors and readers look at Facebook and say that its ad revenue is easily combated by ad-blocking software. Users that deploy ad-blocking software are the best target for advertising actually. Contrary to the point of ad-blocking, these users are doing Facebook a favor and are saying "Hey look at me, I'm engaged in my online browsing!" That's exactly why you should invest in Facebook - this software brings about a counter-intuitive demographic of internet users who tell advertisers they are living breathing, tech-savvy human beings. See those ads on the side of this page you're reading? If you do I have some news for you. If you don't I have even more enticing news for you. We all know Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) main business is advertising and that means putting ads in front of users. The hope is that you then click on an ad. The advertiser gets your traffic and potential sale but Facebook will sell more of that ad, thus generating revenue. Today, I want to talk to the ad-blocking readers primarily. They are enjoying a nice, clean, white page while reading this article and without distraction from the neon lights of the internet. I want you to continue to do that because my Facebook investment benefits. "Joe, are you out of your mind? I'm hurting your Facebook investment!" Are you sure about that? Walk with me for a minute. You're likely a tech-savvy user, much like myself. You're also likely a millennial, or if you're not, you're someone who works with technology for a living. How am I doing? It means Facebook and other advertisers want to target you. You prove to them you are not a lifeless bot. You also prove that you aren't being inundated with ads. Using ad-blocking software while you surf the web doesn't make you invisible, it makes you stand out. I can prove it to you: I'm using AdBlock Plus, arguably one of the best free ad-blocking extensions you can use. Forbes knows I'm using it and won't let me enter their site until I turn it off. Of course in exchange I get an "ad-light experience," but that strays from my point. If Forbes knows I'm using this ad-blocking software then so does Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL )(NASDAQ: GOOG ). They're not blind to it, they know it's there and being used on my machine. But if they know I'm using it and can display a message saying I'm using it then what stops the best minds in advertising from making that message an ad itself? I've got one better for you. What if they used the information that you block ads to confirm you are a real person and are tech-savvy in order to target you more so than any other demographic? Facebook has for some time focused less on side bar banner-ads that we once contributed to the 90's AOL days. The reason is because mobile interaction is where the world is and there is limited real estate on your mobile device. This is apparent by Facebook mobile usage and mobile revenue being the highest they have ever been with 900 million mobile-only monthly users and 82% of ad revenue coming from mobile. Instead they have used the Newsfeed to their utmost advantage. The great thing about these ads is they are native to the platform. They look just like your friends' posts but they are from a company or organization you may be interested in. From there you may simply like the page and that's the extent of your interaction - for now. Now, I went on Facebook for a first hand test and I was able to use AdBlock Plus to some advantage, blocking the "sponsored" posts I saw (as an aside I had to re-login into my deleted account to do this - so before you call me out on the fact I've admitted I don't have a Facebook account I did this in the name of research). "Aha! Game over, Joe, you just proved your own argument wrong." I'm not done, yet. I went to Facebook on my desktop to perform that test. I also realized some of the sponsored posts are things I actually wanted to click on because I didn't know about a product a company I liked was selling. These are called "respectful ads." They aren't ads that are annoying or subverting my intelligence. A problem is it also blocked the "trending now" area as well as messed with the "people you may know" section. In other words I was missing some of the Facebook experience by blocking ads. To gather better research I went mobile. I looked for some ad-blockers for my phone and found some highly rated ones. Digging a little deeper, though, I found that it, too, messed with some of the Facebook experience and realized the same disappointment as the desktop experience. I also read some user reviews and found that it's far from a perfect system: "It blocks group information as if it was an ad which is a real problem for group administration when you do not see requests to join the group through the group page." That won't fly for me and surely not for other users. But, because the ads are neat, tidy and respectful I'm okay with them being there if it means not losing out on functionality. But even this imperfect blocking system that works moderately OK is not the point - yet. The first point is that advertising platforms - and apparently financial websites - can still easily say "Hi there, we see you." So how effective is ad-blocking software if they can still communicate with you by subverting the exact medium you wish to block? But let's say you still use it to block the annoying Flash ads on other websites which are less respectful. If they can target and communicate with you as an ad-blocking user they will want to advertise to you all the more. This is because you're more likely to see the few ads that do get in front of you than a user who becomes numb after seeing hundreds a day. Facebook is a company much larger than any ad-blocking software and that means they have the resources to stay ahead of an ad-blocking experience by developing their own tools. Forbes completely shut me out from the website - and while this is an opposite strategy Facebook should use - it means there are methods to take advantage of your large blip on the radar. The Internation News Media Association agrees with this thinking because in their report they issued this thought provoking statement: "And those brands that are seen - with low volume, respectful ads - receive more attention than the most garish and brazen formats have been able to achieve when competing in the world before ad blocking. For publishers, this presents a counter-intuitive opportunity: ad blockers can be leveraged as a high-value segment that can be presented to premium brands with premium advertising." Putting the effectiveness of the ad-blocking software aside, sites like Facebook and Google, as I mentioned earlier, are able to target you as a living, breathing human being. If that wasn't enough they are able to still get messages in front of you as Forbes so eloquently made me aware. This ability to know you are using it tells advertising websites "yup, I'm a human and I'm actively engaged in my online browsing experience." I'm not sure what a Facebook sized company looks like when it licks its chops but I'd imagine there's a certain kind of excitement from the exec team all the way to the development team. You pretty much have done their heavy lifting for them. All in all, ad-blocking software actually makes you more prone to the exact social media ads you wish not to see. Not only that but the ads served to you are worth more to advertisers, which are worth more to Facebook, which are worth more to my investment. Instead of hurting Facebook's massive advertising model, you not only present no danger but instead are a friend. A friend to them, which is a friend to me. See, we can all get along - right?
