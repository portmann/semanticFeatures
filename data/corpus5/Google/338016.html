Will Alibaba Or Microsoft Buy Yahoo's Search Business? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Trying to turn Yahoo around was a gargantuan task from the very start. The company should have been sold much sooner. Yahoo and especially its search business offers excellent synergies for Alibabaâ€™s attempts to enter the U.S. search market. Microsoft or Google may purchase Yahoo's search business just to keep their search income if the price is right. Microsoft or Google also may consider a strategic purchase just to deny Alibaba an easy entry point to the U.S. search market. The thought-provoking challenge initiated by SA editor Michael Hopkins inspired me to write this article. There has been a great deal of debate about the future fate of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and the options it has to unlock value for shareholders. I really like the balanced and pragmatic comments of Aswath Damodaran. In a nutshell he says that tech companies have a short shelf life, high fail rate and when they reach their peak their decline is usually very fast. I believe this is what happened to Yahoo and I doubt any other CEO would have been able to magically and sustainably turn Yahoo around. Perhaps the correct decision would have been to start to unlock value (sell) Yahoo much, much sooner. Mr. Damodaran also suggested that Yahoo should find a buyer who would be willing to overpay for Yahoo in order to buy sales even without the profits. I believe this is what Yahoo is finally starting to do by reportedly auctioning off specific pieces of its assets, specifically their search business now. There is one buyer for whom Yahoo would be a very suitable fit, especially the search business, but not just the Yahoo core but the entire company. It is Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), which will be the focus of this article. However, Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also have their reasons to acquire the Yahoo search business at the right price. However, regulatory hurdles would probably be a major issue for Google but also for Microsoft to a lesser extent. The companies may decide it's not worth the hassle and negative PR if it risks being labeled a "monopoly." For similar regulatory and PR reasons, Google gave up on a Yahoo search deal in 2008. Interestingly, and unsurprisingly, Microsoft lobbied hard against the deal. My take is that both Google and Microsoft have been pretty easy targets of antitrust campaigns. Microsoft paid more than $1B in 2012/2013 alone in antitrust fines, yet Google is now more at risk of being labeled a monopoly, in my opinion. Alibaba also may run into regulatory hurdles, not for monopoly reasons but due to security issues. The M&A landscape has been cautious toward China-led acquisitions recently, such as in the case of Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) and Fairchild (NASDAQ: FCS ), for example. But given Yahoo's ownership of the Alibaba stake, this case may be very different. Outside of the search engine landscape, there are several other suitors that are or should be interested in some of Yahoo's core assets, especially companies in telco and media industries. Private equity firms have shown some interest as well. Alibaba created a search engine in 2012/2013 in order to compete in the very long run with Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Alphabet's Google on the local Chinese market but also symbolically with Google globally. Interestingly, Yahoo once used to be a pretty solid search engine. A long time ago, Yahoo even had the best text ads (PPC) system after it acquired Overture (former GoTo.com) and totally wasted its potential. But the word Yahoo still has a strong brand, lots of free, automatic traffic from users of its email and portals such as Yahoo Finance. I'm convinced that Yahoo would fit very well into Alibaba's long-term vision of trying to build and promote a global search engine. How better to start this international search engine expansion than by buying a strong legacy search engine name "Yahoo," virtually for free, and power the search by Alibaba's AliYun search engine? Alibaba recently announced an AI platform , arguably the first in China. This would be a perfect fit for the AliYun search engine in combination with Yahoo's strong U.S. Japanese and other international presence. The company also has been expanding its cloud computing internationally via Singapore as well as the U.S. Alibaba allocated $1B for the international expansion of its cloud services. Google and Microsoft, which currently have search deals with Yahoo, may eventually decide to buy Yahoo's search business just to secure the future income from providing search to Yahoo traffic. At the right price, this would certainly make sense if there is a lack of interest from other buyers. It also would make sense strategically to deny Alibaba's AliYun a strong foothold in the U.S. market. Some insiders, including Jack Ma, announced a large $500M purchase of Alibaba's shares using their own funds. If a half-a-billion insider purchase is not a bullish sign, I don't know what is. Alibaba has been borrowing recently perhaps to fund the recently announced buybacks but perhaps for something else? In any case, I believe these actions are strong tell-tale signs that Alibaba is preparing to buy something, either its own shares, or Yahoo or its parts, or another company. Buying Yahoo is essentially like buying Alibaba's own shares without raising the stock price, thus getting a large stake cheaply, without having to pay a strategic premium. These signs are clearly bullish for Alibaba's stock in any case. And if you buy Yahoo, you will benefit from Alibaba's stock rise whether the future actions are just that Alibaba repurchases its own shares or whether they increase sales and profits by acquiring another company, or whether they end up buying Yahoo. The current value of the spread under various scenarios My net cash estimate uses Dec. 31 balance sheet data of $1,631.91M in cash plus $4,225.11 in short-term investments minus total debt $1,352.17, which equals $4,504.85M net cash. I've attempted to make a scenario where Yahoo's assets excluding cash, Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes are sold or valued at $4B. under these assumptions, the current spread seems to be roughly 1%, but that includes the worst possible tax scenario of 35% for the Alibaba stake as well as the Yahoo Japan stake. This is not a version considered at the moment, fortunately. So if you believe the outcome will be anything better than this, either lower tax hit or even higher core Yahoo value, the spread will be profitable. How profitable will depend on the timing of the transactions of course. Under the worst tax consequences but with Yahoo's core valued at $2B, the spread would be roughly minus 5% at the moment and with the core valued at zero the spread would be minus 12% assuming the worst theoretical tax consequences. On the other hand, if there is no tax hit at all, and the core is valued at zero, the spread seems to be a very nice 27%. This is my base case scenario. I believe the core will be sold off for some positive value and some taxes will be paid on this amount, but the value will still be positive. If you add some more value for the core, it gets even better. Depending on the timing, this is a very lucrative deal to be in and it is well worth the risk, in my opinion. As you can see from the chart, the spread widened from 5% all the way to 42% at one point. Since the beginning of February, however, the spread has been shrinking fast, tightening by some 13%. With specific steps to unlock value now in motion and Marissa Mayer allowing all options on the table (although some grudgingly), I believe the spread will tighten again as the positive news of value unlocking gradually keeps coming in. I'm always curious to know how other investors approach this special situation, what their estimate for the value of the core is and how they assess the tax risk under the current most likely scenario of the piece-by-piece breakup of the core business. To conclude my article, I'm bullish on Alibaba and bullish on Yahoo. I'm also bullish on Yahoo's core assets to have positive net value and this clearly is not reflected in Yahoo's stock price. Yes, they are a zero-margin business but the brand and data obtainable through large user traffic can be invaluable for the right buyer such as Alibaba (search engine), Google or Microsoft, among others, and one other company which I will cover in my next article, so please make sure you are receiving alerts when my articles are published by clicking on the "Follow" link next to my name and avatar at the top of this article.
