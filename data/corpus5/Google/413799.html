Facebook: Contraction Ahead - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is a great business with terrific competitive advantages. I love it is controlled by an owner operator. Without any doubt it will show strong growth in earnings and revenue. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is a great business, including significant competitive advantages, controlled by an owner/operator and with undeniable healthy growth prospects. Having said that, I'm hard pressed to imagine it at $118 in 2018 and don't like it as an investment. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), over the years, has returned roughly 10% on an annual basis. For Facebook to equal that, the minimum market cap it needs to hit by 2018 is about $400 billion or $140 per share (if no shares are given out, which is not the case). As companies grow their market caps they are increasingly likely to grow at a slower pace. Companies like Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are somewhat less likely to slow down early as they don't require as many employees per million of revenue. With fewer employees the companies don't institutionalize as fast and growth doesn't get impeded as much. It may help to look at the earnings multiples of the other companies in the top 10 by market cap: Google has a P/E of 28x, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) a P/E of 10x, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) a P/E of 38x, Berkshire (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) a P/E of 14x, Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) a P/E of 28x, JNJ (NYSE: JNJ ) a P/E of 20x, GE (NYSE: GE ) a P/E of 40x, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) a P/E of 287x and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) a P/E of 12x Facebook would be very fortunate to hold an earnings multiple of 40x, which would still signify tremendous growth expectations. With a multiple like that it needs to make $3.50 per share, based on the unrealistic assumption no shares are given out, in 2018 to get to its $400 billion market cap. That's an increase in EPS of 113% in two years. Can the company increase the numbers of ads in users' stream much further? Can it add users in developed countries that are responsible for the majority of its revenues? Even if the company continued its extraordinary success and kept adding users and monetizing them more effectively, the ad market isn't growing fast enough for Facebook to grow its earnings at that pace: It would need to take a lot of share from other media companies, especially Google. As you control an ever greater portion of the ad inventory, it becomes that much harder to further increase your market share. Loving the company's business model, loving its owner/operator structure and loving the growth story, I have to say the numbers don't make sense to me. At some point the market is going to get disappointed with earnings growth and we will see a contraction of the multiple the company is awarded. If Facebook manages to hold onto $119 per share until 2018 it will be an accomplishment. At today's valuation, the downside risk outweighs any potential upside potential to me.
