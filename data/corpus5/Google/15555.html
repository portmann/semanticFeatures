Double Or Triple Top, Slowing Adds, Increasing Content Costs Spell Doom For Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Net adds appear to be weakening, or at least stagnating. Free cash flow has gone negative; and it is trending more negative. Content costs are rising roughly an order of magnitude faster than revenues; and NFLX is still losing lots of good titles. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) provides internet television/movie streaming services to subscribers. These consist of movies, TV shows, etc. They can be displayed on TVs, computers, and mobile devices in the US and internationally. Netflix offers domestic streaming, international streaming, and domestic DVD delivery. It is thought of as the pioneer in its space; but it has more recently been facing a lot of large and tough competition. For a company that trades at a PE of 96.82 and an FPE of 76.60, new, strong competition is a big concern. A "growth/momentum" stock needs only to show flat results for a little while before the market destroys its inflated stock price. Amazon Prime (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is now showing some HBO; and HULU is now showing some STARZ and many of the major television networks latest offerings. Apple TV is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Chromecast is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ); and there is YouTube, which is also a part of Google. The major television networks are now broadcasting their own shows over the internet for a fee (or delayed a week without the fee, but with commercials). All of the cable or satellite TV broadcasters of wide variety television such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), DirectTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) all seem to provide access to a variety of extra content such as STARZ (NASDAQ: STRZA ), HBO, Cinemax, etc. for a fee. There is really have a large and growing number of suppliers of rich content, especially when you consider that Canada is going to individually selectable channel content for cable. The numbers simply don't add up for Netflix to be able to continue to grow at the rate it did early on. For anyone who wants to save money on their TV costs, they can get virtually all of the great new shows on a one week delayed basis for free, as long as they have a high speed internet connection. AT&T (NYSE: T ) among many others will provide you with this at a reasonable cost. Even Netflix own fiscal results show this disturbing trend (see the excerpt from NFLX's Q4 2014 Lettter to Shareholders . Investors should notice the disturbing overall downward trend in Operating Income. They should notice the disturbing downward trend in Net Income. Some might point to the blip up to $83 million in Net Income in Q4 2014. However, if investors look more closely, they will see that this was due to a tax accrual release after an audit resolution. Analysts usually subtract out such one time events for adjusted net income. On that basis the Net Income was only $44 million in Q4 2014. The downtrend is intact. The downtrend in Free Cash Flow is just as clear. The net adds appear to be weakening or at least stagnating (see table below). The net additions were weak in Q2 and Q3 2014. They may have gone up for Christmas; but NFLX's adds appear to be overall leveling out or weakening as its number of subscribers increases. Plus Europe, a major growth opportunity, is in terrible economic shape currently. It seems unlikely to provide huge growth in the near future. Even if the number of adds stays at a 4+ million number each quarter, the percentage growth is decreasing as the number of subscribers increases. That virtually ensures that NFLX cannot continue much longer as a high growth stock. The analysts are sure to turn on it soon; and it is sure to crash when they do. Investors should note the uptrend in Streaming Content Obligations (the topmost table above), which are in billions of dollars in contrast to the rest of the data which is in millions of dollars. From Q1 2014 to Q4E 2014 the cost of content rose from $7.1B to $9.5B (+$2.4B or almost +34%). Meanwhile Operating Income and Net Income (after the adjustment mentioned above) fell. OUCH! The total revenue rose from $1.066B in Q1 2014 to $1.305B in Q4 2014 (+$0.261B). This revenue increase is less than 11% of the increase in the content costs. DOUBLE OUCH!! No healthy company can sustain this kind of behavior for long; and this DOES appear to be a longer term trend. On top of that Netflix appears to be trying to disguise this trend by stating all of the data in millions of dollars except the increasing content costs, which it states in billions of dollars. Reed Hastings is a salesman as many CEO's are. For instance, in the conference call on Q4 2014 earnings, he claimed 5+ million adds each quarter . This is deliberately misleading when the average number of "Net Adds" per quarter for FY2014 posted in the "Letter to shareholders" released by Netflix with Q4 2014 earnings was 3.26 million . You need to look very closely at anything Reed Hastings says (or puts out). The truth is more likely to be in the fine print. When you add the terrible fundamentals discussed at the beginning of this article to the FY2014 results, you have an ugly outlook for NFLX. NFLX stock price at the close on March 26, 2015 was $421.75 per share. The Book Value Per Share was $30.75. Admittedly NFLX is a mostly software company; but the share price is still hugely inflated. With so many of Neflix's trends pointing downward, fewer and fewer people will claim that NFLX should go up. On March 26, 2015 NFLX was started at HOLD by Argus . The firm said it would look for a more appropriate entry point in the low $300's as an opportunity to raise its rating to BUY. On March 16, 2015 NFLX was downgraded to SELL from HOLD by Evercore ISI. Evercore cut its price target from $450 to $380 per share. This last downgrade is particularly important because Evercore is an HFT trader; and it knows the likely behavior of the other HFT traders. When even momentum traders like Evercore start to downgrade a momentum stock, watch out below! The bottom could be about to fall out; and when the bottom does fall out of a momentum stock, it will often lose 75% or more of its stock price. Due to increases in content expenses NFLX also has a trend of losing content. It lost STARZ (over 1000 movies and STARZ TV shows) in 2012, when STARZ raised the asking price for its content. It lost its about 2000 movies from Warner Bros., MGM, and Universal in 2013, when those companies decided to market themselves under Warner Active Instant service. NFLX lost another 90 movie titles at the end of 2013 due to licensing issues. These includes such favorites as Top Gun and Titanic. It lost a slew of titles in September 2014 . NFLX lost more movie titles in February 2015 such as Apocalypse Now, Batman & Robin, some James Bond movies, etc. I am sure I have left a lot of things out. I have also left out the content that NFLX has added such as that it is producing itself. However, that is small compared to its losses. Are subscribers really going to be content with getting less and less as content costs go up? It seems doubtful; and content costs for NFLX are rising despite the losses to the NFLX library. TRIPLE OUCH!!! The above chart shows a huge amount of upward resistance with the almost quadruple top technical structure. Certainly there is at least a double top technical formation; and that appears to presage a trip down to below $320 per share before the stock will possibly be able to rise again appreciably. If Murphy's Law holds, the momentum traders will prove me wrong. However, I would point out that Evercore ISI is one of those momentum traders; and it has recently downgraded the stock. Therefore the chances of momentum swinging against me on this call are much reduced. Further the fundamentals are getting harder and harder to deny. Net adds were weak in both Q2 and Q3 2014. Plus even with a maintenance of the 4 million per quarter approximate Net Add average for good quarters, the Net Add average is becoming a lower percentage growth factor as the number of subscribers grows. As the total number of paid subscribers grows (54.48 million total subscribers in Q4 2014), the turnover number (losses of subscribers) is likely to grow with that number. That means the cost to acquire and keep subscribers will inevitably go up. When you add this to the increases in the content costs, NFLX has an even more difficult task in front of it. When the average analysts' EPS growth estimate for FY2015 is -8.90%, you have to think that a momentum stock with negative EPS growth in 2015 will fall from its current heights. Admittedly the FY2016 EPS growth estimate is for +62.50% EPS growth, but that may be a "pie in the sky" estimate. The US could easily be in recession by then; and NFLX earnings would likely shrink instead of gain in that case. The February Durable Goods Orders were -1.4% . The Core Capital Goods Orders were also -1.4%. The article, " 12 Reasons U.S. Q1 GDP Growth May Be Much More Negative Than Some Are Thinking", outlines more of the recent US economic weaknesses. It is worth a read, if you want to understand better where the US economy may go (and why). In a weakening US economy more US customers may decide that "free content" with commercials available from the networks, HULU, youtube, etc. is a better option than paying for NFLX. HULU and the networks really have a lot of great content available for free to those willing to watch advertisements and/or willing to wait up to one week after a live air date to see a TV show. NFLX is currently a SELL under these circumstances. Down to around $320 per share, it is probably a short, especially if the market is about to sell off. Remember we may be close to seeing Greece leave the Euro Zone. That by itself might cause a sell off in equities. Add that equities are generally over priced at this time, and you have a situation fraught with peril. NFLX is among the riskiest of all equities with its "nose bleed" valuation. Take your profits while you can. This stock is a long term SELL far lower than the likely $320 per share near term bottom. The fundamentals have caught up with it; and I can see no end game that will allow it to rescue itself. SELL. Conversely a resolution of Greece's problems might cause markets to rise on that news. NFLX would likely rise with an overall market rising tide because that is what highly shorted, "momentum stocks" do. NFLX is short 9.4% of its float as of March 13, 2015. It would most likely get short squeezed upward in a Greece problem resolution scenario. Longer term I still believe NFLX will fall. Of course, there are those that tout international growth. The facts back great international growth only to a slight degree. International NFLX streaming is not showing profit now, even if Reed Hastings says or implies it is. The loss on international streaming was -$79 million for Q4 2014. This was over twice the -$31 million NFLX lost on international streaming in Q3 2014. It is possible NFLX could turn this around in time; and some analysts agree with that thesis. However, that seems extremely unlikely to happen in the next 1-2 years. The world economy seems to be worsening rather than improving. Therefore an explosion in NFLX profits within that timeframe seems unlikely. Of course, it is within the realm of possibility; and thus it may provide some fodder for momentum traders to push the stock upward. However, NFLX investors would have to ignore a lot of hard cold facts in order for momentum traders to be successful in that. It could still happen; but it is unlikely. Therefore don't bet the farm on a Netflix short; but a Netflix short is a worthy investment. If I owned the stock now, I would certainly at least take profits (SELL IT).
