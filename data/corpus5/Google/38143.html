Apple Earnings Preview: It's All About iPhone Sales Momentum - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Fiscal Q2 earnings will be driven by continued strong sales of iPhone. Apple will blow past its guidance for revenue and income. Following Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) spectacular December quarter, the refrain of the Apple naysayers became "It won't last". However, the sales momentum of iPhone this quarter seems to be driving Apple revenue and earnings well past Apple's January guidance. Will Apple's earnings report on Monday change the minds of the naysayers? Probably not. I never bought the argument of the bears that after iPhone 6, that Apple no longer had any way to stimulate sales. The novelty of the larger screen iPhones would quickly wear off, so it was argued, leaving iPhone sales in the doldrums. Once again, this is the Apple bears viewing Apple as superficially chasing fads rather than innovating at a deep level. The idea that the larger screen would have a transitory effect on iPhone 6/Plus sales ignores the fundamental value proposition of iPhone 6. Many consumers recognized the advantages offered by iPhone, but just didn't want to squint at a tiny screen. iPhone 6 removed reservations about screen size and unleashed a huge wave of demand in the December quarter. The value proposition of iPhone 6 didn't change significantly at the beginning of the new year. iPhone 6 still offered the best mobile OS ecosystem, the fastest smart phone processor and a roomy screen size. This is reflected in the current crop of analyst's sales estimates for iPhone this quarter. Most estimates are in the mid-fifty million range, which is a huge year over year gain and really great performance coming off the December quarter. iPhone sales will pretty much dominate the revenue picture this quarter, generating roughly 69% of revenue. In the table below I summarize my predictions for the March quarter. Although I'm fairly bullish about iPhone sales, I'm trying to restrain my optimism for iPad. Last quarter I was surprised to the downside. If sales exceed my expectations, I'll be delighted. As for Macs, the overall drop in PC sales in the quarter reported by IDC suggests that Mac sales could be a little weak, although still outgrowing the PC market. My revenue model predicts total revenue of $58.2 billion, which blows well past Apple's January guidance of $52 - 55 billion. I also expect gross margin to improve to 40% based on the high percentage of total revenue generated by iPhone. Operating income will also grow by more than 30% y/y despite what I expect to be slightly higher than guidance ($5.4 - 5.5 billion) operating costs of $5.6 billion. I expect Apple to continue to ramp R&D spending aggressively and there may some unexpected additional costs associated with preparations for the Apple Watch launch. Speaking of Apple Watch, I expect we'll hear a little about it at the earnings conference call. The crystal ball is a little cloudy about whether we'll get specific numbers. Part of the reason we didn't hear anything about the pre-orders is that Apple typically books sales when customers receive product. Apple is working very hard to deliver ahead of schedule, and customers appear to be starting to receive their Watch orders as I write. Analysts seem to be warming up to Apple Watch. FBR Capital now estimates 20 million Watch sales in calendar 2015. I still believe this is too low and expect sales in the range of 30-40 million this year . I had estimated that pre-orders totaled about 3 million in the first weekend, so we'll see what Apple has to say. Overall, Apple's performance this quarter is nothing short of spectacular, especially when you compare it to Apple's chief rivals in mobile operating systems Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Microsoft eked out a slight y/y revenue gain of 6% to $21.7 billion, while suffering an operating income decline of 5%. Revenue from Surface tablets was a miniscule $713 million, compared to what I estimate for iPad revenue of $5.45 billion. Meanwhile Microsoft sold 8.6 million Lumia phones for a y/y growth rate of 18%. Microsoft is growing its mobile device business, but it's still very small and the phone hardware business MS got from Nokia is showing negative gross margin. Under Nadella, MS seems to be increasingly focused on its enterprise and cloud businesses, where it has considerable strength. In short, MS is no threat to Apple in the mobile space. Google is doing a little better than Microsoft, with a 12% y/y gain in revenue to $17.258 billion. Operating income grew 8% y/y to $4.447 billion. In the mobile space, it's very hard to tell how well Google is doing, since Google provides very little transparency: no Google device sales information, no cost accounting for Android development. It's not even possible to tell exactly how much Google is profiting from Android, but it's clearly a lot less than Apple. Of the three mobile operating systems companies, Apple is profiting the most from the mobile device revolution. For the investor who wants to profit from the explosion in mobile device usage, there simply is no better place to put your money than Apple.
