ETF Hub Jan  5 2016, 12:32 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Japan's Nikkei reports Apple ( AAPL -2.1%) is "expected to reduce output of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus by around 30% in the January-March quarter compared with its original plans." The paper adds Apple initially told component suppliers to keep production even with that seen for the iPhone 6/6+ a year ago, but has seen 6S/6S+ inventories pile up "at retailers in markets ranging from China and Japan to Europe and the U.S." In December, Apple sold off after long-time bull Morgan Stanley forecast (in response to checks) iPhone unit sales will drop 6% in FY16 (ends in September), and added to its losses after Dialog Semi (gets over half its sales from Apple) issued a Q4 warning . In November, Credit Suisse reported of component order cuts. Apple is trading near $103 following the Nikkei's report. Suppliers Cirrus Logic ( CRUS -4.6%), Skyworks ( SWKS -5.2%), Qorvo ( QRVO -4.8%), Avago ( AVGO -1.9%), and InvenSense ( INVN -2.7%) are also under pressure. Update: Morgan Stanley reacts to the Nikkei's report by noting a 30% production cut is more than the ~20% it was modeling. (source: Notable Calls ) For as long as Tim Cook stay silent. Repeat something often enough and it becomes the truth. He failed spectacularly in this regards. Brilliant manager otherwise. I think we are going to have this kind of "...AAPL reportedly cutting..." every other day until the 26th of this month. Which by then would put the stock around 80 USD. Brace yourself as it is going to be an epic ride. Unfortunately, my predictions back last summer were right and AAPL will touch its low early spring 2016. Who needs a new phone? All anybody needs now is the watch and the iPad Pro. The phone is just a "Server" now. Umm, me, my wife, and my kid. Don't know about you, but 2 years of lugging around a phone leaves it pretty damaged. Last time, we heard Apple ordered 90 million iPhones 6S and 6S Plus. How come the numbers changing overnight?. Who to believe?. iPhone 6S is great but the design is so boring now.  (And 3D Touch is not yet a must have) Touch ID is definitely must have!   To be able to drive and turn on my iPhone with TouchID is pure genius!!  :) I'm an Apple fan, have used their products since the 80's, but I just don't believe in the company's future under Cook. Then if you dont beleieve in it and own shares, sell them and go buy something else much more exotic that will make you happy. But stop pointing fingers at someone who does a perfect job while no one knows what you have achieved in your life. Last I heard, AW (Apple Watch if I need to spell out that for you) is doing very very well. Their iPad pro & pencil is doing alright, tv doing well, music sub doing well. Pray tell where else Google make money other than ads, or Ford other than selling cars or Starbucks other than selling coffee. All Business follow the 80/20 rules: 80% of profit come from 20% of its available products. Tim Cook is a brilliant manager, more so that Steve Jobs ever was. His one mortal sin is to stay silent through times like this. I understand he's in black out period but something like "please read what I've said" or "we will find out come Jan 26th" is more than enough to calm the market. Of course he could be saving his sucker punch for the ER. I feel like he will drop some comments on these mon-stop rumors. FWIW, which is not much.  I bought a new 64gb iPhone 6s yesterday.  Sales rep at the Verizon store here in Nashville, TN said 9 out of 10 phones he sells are iPhone.   It was the Green Hills location so a more affluent part of town. Swks supplies all 4 major smart phone manufactures and has 25 per cent yoy growth non mobile , it seems this means very little and swks gets punished I think this is shaking the tree again and again to trim the weak holders. They know something about the ER..... @Thenorthchannel: Yes, just another rumors throwing out to bash Apple before the earning reports on the 26th, 2016. I wonder how much the author who from Japan get paid to write this article?. Dishonest journalists lost creditbility all together, the truth will prevail Getting tired of the same talk about Apple  There is no computer like the Mac and people concentrate only on phones how about the tablets and the good dividend they pay enjoying buying Apple at a cheap price and keeping some money for other bargains Have you all lost your minds, mortgage your house, raid your child's 519 account, buy as much stock as you can at 103 All I have to say is over 60% of their revenue comes from iPhone sales, they are not very diversified. Too many people think they know how Apple works and get proven wrong every time. My bet is that some new product is cannibalizing phone sales and that we'll discover what it is at the end of the month.
