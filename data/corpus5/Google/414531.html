Apple: Is iPhone 7 Enough? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Current data indicate the iPhone continues to have over 50% of the premium smartphone market. Initial surveys point to a reasonably strong launch of the iPhone 7. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) appears to have sold 100 million of its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones since they were introduced a little over a year ago. Fiksu.com data show the two devices now command 5.3% of all Android smartphones in use. Tomi Anohen estimates the Android installed base at 2.1 billion devices. Applying the 5.3% figure puts S6 series sales over 110 million. The Samsung S6 models were first sold in April 2015, suggesting average monthly sales of 8.5 million units. Applying that percentage to the estimated 517 million iPhones in use, I calculate about 217 million iPhone 6 series are active. The iPhone 6 models were launched 21 months ago, which suggests monthly sales have averaged over 10 million units. The data are rough, but consistent with folklore that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) outsells Samsung at the "flagship" end of the market. But does Apple outsell Android more broadly at the premium end? That questions requires a bit more digging. This chart from 2014 shows the price mix of each platform, with Android phones over $400 comprising a bit less than 20% of shipments, while iPhones at that price point make up 85% of sales. Applying the percentages for each platform to the installed base, we get a mix of premium-priced smartphones in use made up of 420 million Android devices, 437 million iPhones, and a few million Windows (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) units. The data again demonstrate that Apple has the edge in the premium segment, but by no means dominates. In fact, it looks like a dead heat. Apple has done a good job of retaking its lead in the premium phone market after losing the number one position to Samsung in 2013, but the days when it held over 70% of that segment are history. Tim Cook is pointing to India as an area for growth, and it is. But the premium end of the smartphone market in India is tiny, and Apple will have to share that segment with Samsung and others. India is unlikely to bail Apple out. The next few years will be interesting. Major competitors other than Samsung and Apple are struggling to survive and cognizant that they need a slice of the premium segment to make money. More and more high-end devices are being introduced by cutthroat competitors like Xiaomi (Private: XI ), Huawei and even Microsoft. The premium end is getting crowded. Apple is relying heavily on the forthcoming iPhone 7. Initial surveys suggest it will fare better than the iPhone 6S, but not as well as the iPhone 6. I think Apple will try to make the iPhone 7 best in class with up to 256GB storage, an AMOLED screen, and a faster processor. It has to do so. Apple's ecosystem download count has long since been passed by Google Play ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and the choice of an iPhone today is hardware-driven, in my view. Accordingly, Apple's new phone will have to have the best the company has to offer to have any real chance of success. In my view, the iPhone 7 will be very popular with existing iPhone users, but will have only marginal success in attracting new users. Apple will no doubt also introduce a super-premium flagship device and call it the iPhone Pro to further extend its line. Within a few months of its launch, I have little doubt that a more powerful and more fully-featured Android device will be offered by virtually all iPhone competitors, and the steady erosion of Apple market share will continue. The fact is Apple has become a bit player in the smartphone arena, with a paltry 15% share of market. The company's boring routine of offering incremental improvements to entice upgrades should lose its luster as users tire of spending premium dollars for new devices that look, feel and perform pretty well the same as their predecessors, and in key areas such as battery life, perform poorly as well. In the words of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) executive chairman Eric Schmidt : Loss of even a few percentage points of market share in the premium end is devastating for Apple. Each 5% share comprises 40 million units. In my view, the iPhone will find it difficult to maintain share against increasing competition and will have to yield share or substantially improve features (and costs) while lowering prices just to stand still. All of those steps will squeeze margins. Apple stock is getting a bid based on expectations that the iPhone 7 will markedly improve the company's fortunes. Smart money will sell into that strength.
