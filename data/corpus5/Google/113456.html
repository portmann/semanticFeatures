Apple: Lots Of Smoke (FUD), But What's On Fire Are Earnings And Growth Opportunities - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple stock has dropped steadily in the face of negative headlines. Yet earnings estimates continue to improve for both this fiscal year and next year. Apple continues to introduce useful products that will improve over time and that are strengthening its ecosystem from the start. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) looks unusually well positioned for new money investment given its current price. At any moment, AAPL could (and should) act the way Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) did a couple of months ago and start ramping upward, showing no mercy to the shorts or any late-to-the-party bargain-hunting bulls. The more people wring their hands about the Apple Watch launch or another Great Depression in China, the more investors should look past the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) throwers and re-examine the core of the long-AAPL thesis - this continues to improve even as the stock price droops. AAPL below 13X TTM EPS ex-net cash is truly cheap to the market (NYSEARCA: SPY ), just as GILD was in April (and remains, though its price is higher now). The recent lesson of GILD is that you have to be in it to win it. The reason to mention GILD with AAPL is that each is the stock of a dominant, innovative company that is being valued far below the P/E of the market. The reasons why each has a low P/E are different for each company. But in each case, that low P/E provides a margin of safety that most high P/E stocks lack. And each - especially Apple - has many strengths that few other companies, even other large- or mega-cap companies, have. For example, Apple's famous brand name is an asset that is so exceptional that it alone could be worth several P/E points. But Gilead markets products solely on their merits. Doctors and payors evaluate each drug on its merits. Since stocks represent a claim on current assets plus future EPS, the stock action of AAPL lately is perplexing. After all... Simply tracking the consensus for AAPL's EPS on Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) Finance has been a good way to track the real, underlying sentiment changes on AAPL shares. All year as well as in H2 last year, they have been improving. Here are the numbers from the most recent 90-day period: This trend is strong on its own merits. It is even stronger when compared with the same trends for close competitors Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The latter has seen estimates for the September quarter drop from 68 cents to 62 cents in the past 90 days. Just within the past seven days, estimates for the FY ending in June 2016 have dropped from $2.78 to $2.62. These numbers are before this week's announcement that Microsoft is writing off the rest of its Nokia acquisition cost plus a large "restructuring" charge. GOOGL, which emphasizes "non-GAAP" "earnings" is following the same trends down in its estimates for the current quarter, year and all of next year as MSFT. Yet AAPL is being valued as the value, relatively low P/E stock relative to MSFT and GOOGL. AAPL, which reports GAAP EPS, is trading at a notably lower P/E than GOOGL's heavily-massaged non-GAAP "earnings" per share. Using GAAP for each stock, AAPL is trading at about a 40% P/E discount to GOOGL. A Benzinga article recently reported: In the report Pacific Crest Securities noted, "We believe the majority of people earning $15,000 a year or more in the world will own an iPhone exiting F2015. There may be no way to verify this, but just the thought of it should send alpha-seeking investor hearts a-twitter. This is an extraordinarily valuable fact or near fact. And, given the momentum of the iPhone, it is likely that this trend is gathering force, not even topping and almost certainly not waning. If a company owns the high end, and its flagship product is seeing growing sales (and in the iPhone's case, old iPhones stay in use a long time), it usually receives a premium P/E, not a shrinking and discounted one. In the same vein, browser-based, i.e. iOS vs. Android, spending is overwhelmingly Apple : So, what's the takeaway here? Realistically it means that any ecommerce professional has to focus on Apple's platforms as first priority , because they will generate more business this way. This dominance did not happen by accident. It did not happen from faddish behavior. It occurs one user at a time. It happened, for example, because Apple out-competed numerous seemingly untouchable giants in various sectors. Apple, recovering from its near-death experience in the 1990s, had the vision to lash the iPod, iTunes and Mac into one coherent and exciting group of products. Added to that was the great risk of opening a chain of Apple retail stores, and the ecosystem was born. Takeaway point: The Apple ecosystem existed before the iPhone - which took the ecosystem to a new level. Now that the iPhone is the key, the fulcrum for the Apple ecosystem, accelerating or at least growing sales of the iPhone mean that the ecosystem is growing rapidly. When an existing iPhone owner trades in a 1-3 year old iPhone, that device goes to some other owner somewhere in the world, unlike some Android phones that get junked. So the Apple ecosystem keeps strengthening with a growing number of owners, and these owners continue to have unprecedented levels of user satisfaction. What that in turn means is that it does not matter all that much exactly what the pace of adoption of Apple Pay, Apple Music or Apple Watch is. Every iPhone owner is exposed to these options. Most evaluate these services or newer devices to see how they fit with their use of the iPhone and other parts of the Apple ecosystem. Sales of the Apple Watch are especially difficult to predict. It's a useful adjunct to the iPhone, but it's costly. We all know that a second-generation Apple Watch will arrive. Many iPhone owners are going to check out the Apple Watch now that it is in stock. I think that many are going to realize the convenience it provides and wait to buy next year if they feel they can wait or if finances indicate they really should wait. The Apple ecosystem increasingly is the dominant and stickiest one amongst its peers, as Microsoft is acknowledging. Microsoft compares ecosystems, and Apple is the winner From Geekwire on March 22 reporting on a Microsoft presentation: ...Apple and Google are doing a better job of connecting their respective products, with usage of one more naturally leading to usage of another. That's the key takeaway from this Microsoft chart, which was shown by the company's top marketing executive, Chris Capossela, during a presentation this week at the Microsoft Convergence conference in Atlanta. ...But it also shows you that we don't have nearly the connectivity between our products that Google has engineered and that Apple has engineered." This is giving Apple and Google a marketing advantage, he explained. (The size of the circles represents the numbers of users of that product or service.) Microsoft and Google have the larger volume assets. Apple has the largest profits - and is extending its lead. Over time, the iPhone may shrink or be replaced by some other device, but what counts is that the ecosystem as a whole becomes more profitable. The stronger the web of the ecosystem, the easier it is to find other nodes that bring in revenue. This is the core Apple advantage (pun intended). Beyond the above parts of the ecosystem, Apple is relentlessly squeezing Google Search out of iOS. Google has few growth drivers left, the European Union is angry at it, and Internet advertising is becoming mature. Microsoft, meanwhile, goes through rounds of employee layoffs. It is being forced to forgo income on Windows 10 by offering it as a free upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 users. AppleInsider has an article out that drives home the point of Apple's superior ecosystem development, saying: It has become cliche among Apple's critics to refer to iTunes as a terrible product, but the reality is that Apple has attracted 800 million users to sign up for iTunes Store accounts with their credit cards. Despite a series of flaws, false starts (like Ping) and growing pains, iTunes has become the world's favorite way to spend money on media. And the second place is quite a ways behind it. Apple makes the effort of building new things look really easy (think Apple Pay or Apple Watch), but to really appreciate the accomplishment involved in efforts like iTunes and Apple Music, take a brief look at its competitors... That means Google Music is a lot like Google Wallet: years ahead of Apple, but so poorly planned and implemented that it completely squandered its vast head start... Microsoft's very different approach to music and video also failed, for reasons that are useful to contrast against Apple Music and iTunes. When iTunes first appeared, Windows Media Player had been leveraging Microsoft's near monopoly market position for a decade... So while Microsoft was building solutions for its partners that didn't solve problems for consumers, Apple was building a product for its customers-end users who were premium hardware buyers - that attracted the support of media partners and content creators. In other words, Microsoft and Google had their chance to develop superior ecosystems. They did not, and Apple did, and now that Apple ecosystem means that AAPL deserves a higher relative P/E than MSFT or GOOGL than the market is giving it. Over time, AAPL may even receive a higher absolute P/E than those other stocks. That's good enough to make AAPL eminently investable, so long as one assumes that China is not going into permanent depression just because its stock market sold off after rising 150%. AAPL is even more enticing if it can grow beyond its current (large) niches, which will mature one day and are subject to unending deflationary pressures. Apple is poised to grow profitably and reasonably organically into even larger business segments, building on its current expertise. Apple - going beyond the current ecosystem to the next level? At this point, the stories about an Apple Car have become so routine that I believe we can assume that the company is making a serious effort to develop one. If so, that in turn could suggest that Apple believes it has made, or has licensed, improved battery technology. And if that's the case, it has yet another large business that it could enter. Continuing the chain of possibilities, improved battery technology could help power Apple's entry into one of the world's probably great secular growth industries, solar power generation - and storage. Other great companies have made leaps such as this. GE (NYSE: GE ) began corporate life impressively in electric power generation and light bulbs, but over time had numerous innovations in other fields. There are no guarantees, but Apple is doing the right thing in following the model of long-term successes such as GE in looking hard at how to grow into new large fields. An Apple Car effort is qualitatively different from Microsoft getting into the home electronics business with X-Box or Kinect, or Google getting into device development. It is much bigger. It is something that Apple should be doing for the long-term benefit of shareholders, even if as is reported, it is creating some personnel issues at Apple's existing divisions. One basis of the lower-P/E argument is that AAPL, a device manufacturer subject to unpredictable consumer whims and ongoing deflationary pressures, has a less stable and predictable earnings stream than software developers tied into business ( MSFT ) or advertising ( GOOG ). I've never thought that was correct. Apple after all does lots of software to go with its hardware. And it is not valid even if it was accurate. What counts is product quality and innovation, and Apple has that over its major competitors. To summarize the above, aided by a focus on a growing ecosystem and rapid sales growth from hardware (the iPod), software/services (iTunes) and retail stores, Apple cemented its ecosystem lead with the iPhone and iPad in 2007 and 2010. Now that Apple has gotten with the trend to do larger-screened iPhones, its ecosystem lead over its major competitors is re-accelerating. The EPS revision trends shown above are consistent with that premise being correct. Lower P/E stocks with rising EPS estimates tend to be outperformers, as GILD and many other stocks tend to show. All the concern about how the first iteration of the Apple Watch is doing and the fears that China will break badly amount to garbage in - garbage out so far as giving AAPL an ultra-low P/E. In fact, Apple Pay and Apple Watch are the immediate leaders in their fields and set the quality standard. Thus they strengthen the Apple ecosystem. Their day will come. To be clear, I'm not expressing a negative investment opinion on MSFT or GOOGL. They are financial powerhouses that have leadership positions in growth parts of the US and global economy. The key point relative to them is that AAPL appears to be seriously mispriced relative to them. The path of least resistance for AAPL is higher for this reason and for several other reasons.
