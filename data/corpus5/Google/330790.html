Facebook Has A Problem - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook's valuation does not align with what's happening on the ground. The most profitable core markets are already reaching saturation point in terms of user base growth. Secondary markets are great for increasing users, but not in terms of revenue generation. If someone told me ten years ago that someday Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) would be worth more than Walmart (NYSE: WMT ), I'd have thought they were just making a stop on the way to the loony bin. A social media company worth more than a retailer with revenues in the hundreds of billions? That's crazy, right? However, that day is soon coming: Facebook has been threatening to make its home in the rarer atmospheres of the $300 billion club. But we need to answer a key question here: Can a company that earned $3.6 billion in the last fiscal year actually be worth $300 billion? Is the 16 times sales valuation the company enjoys right now the result of current earnings or strength of their user base - and how can it be leveraged in the future? Facebook's valuation with respect to their current revenue earning power is more than twice that of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), nearly four times that of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and just short of eight times that of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). These are companies that have already proven their ability to earn over a period of time - and they all have shown resilience to competition. Facebook is a relative newbie, who disrupted the status quo and upended the social media circuit. Facebook was not the first company to think of connecting one internet user to another in a social context. There were many that came before, but the odds of Facebook becoming the last social media company with a global presence are, indeed, very high. It's one thing to be a awesome business with great prospects, it's another thing altogether to be valued based on unknowns. Facebook's current valuation demands the company to either keep growing its EPS in double digits for the next ten to twenty years, or keep increasing its user base year after year till it reaches the sun. Both of them are nigh impossible. Don't get me wrong - I may agree that Facebook will be the last social media company to dominate the world, but I still don't think they're worth $300 billion. Let us now get into the two biggest forces that affect the growth of a company this globally pervasive: growth prospects and growth limitations. As of September 2015, Facebook had over a billion users of their desktop application. Mobile users were slightly behind at around 900 million. One might assume that most mobile users use it as a secondary access point to their Facebook accounts, but that's not entirely true. If you look at the graph below, people who use Facebook exclusively as a mobile app number about 600 million or thereabouts. Essentially, that puts their total user base in the neighborhood of about 1.6 to 1.7 billion worldwide. That's about right. Now, at that point, they've already reached more than half of the world's three-plus billion internet users. You might say they were saturating, but it's too early to make that call, so let's dig a little deeper. As you can see, their 200+ million users in North America were growing by leaps and bounds until the beginning of this decade, but has slowed to low/mid single digits since. Look at the growth stats published by SmartInsights.com : With so many social sites vying for mindshare, a more mature platform must necessarily give way to user preferences. They're still the largest, but that means they can't grow as fast anymore ... at least, as we've seen, not in North America. So What's The Problem? There's Asia, Isn't There? As you can see from the charts above, North America - one of the most profitable geographies for any company - has seen Facebook's monthly active user base grow from 112 million at the end of December 2012 to 219 million at the end of 2015. The YoY growth rate has slowly come down from 37% in 2010 to near 5% last year. There is nothing wrong with user base growth rate slowing down for Facebook in the North America segment - it's just a natural process for a company. For any given market there is going to be only a select number of users, unless the country's population growth shows an anomalous high year-over-year, which is not the case in North America. It's clear from the graph above that North American and European growth have somehow settled down to levels we'll be seeing for a long time into the future. Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world are still growing at healthy two-digit rates, but what does that actually mean for the company in terms of revenue. After all, that's what it finally comes down to, isn't it - earnings? As of Q4 2015, $4.2 billion of a total of $5.6 billion in revenues came from North America and Europe - that's a clean 75% being generated by a little more than a third of the user base - and that user base is slowing down dramatically, as we've already seen. And if you look at the average revenue per user, it becomes even clearer - they need about nine users from APAC and RoW for every one user in North America to match per-user revenue. Investor-Speak: Again, Is Facebook Really Worth $300 Billion? So now we have a set of conditions that don't point to a valuation of $300 billion. Here they are, in summary: User growth in core profitable markets has slowed to the 5% level, and revenue increase will be in direct proportion to that. Secondary markets are growing user base aggressively, but they need to be nine times the size of core markets to be an equal contributor to the top line. And let's not forget - China is still out of bounds. The popularity of half a dozen other social sites is eating into their users' mindshare, which means people are using Facebook less exclusively and sharing their available time between multiple social applications. High-growth user base countries such as Brazil or India can't compete with North America or Europe in terms of revenue generation, which means they can only contribute a fraction of the latter's share to EPS growth. At this kind of valuation, it's clear the market expects miracles from Facebook - and Facebook itself must be hoping for a miracle at this point. I do see a way out of this situation for the company. Of their two key acquisitions in the social space, WhatsApp stands out as the more promising one. Even though they're pulling out their annual renewal fee of 99 cents and aren't certain of their forward monetization and revenues, as far as Facebook is concerned it's an untapped platinum mine. They just need to figure out how to dig in. If push came to shove, I'd say a doubling of revenues was certainly possible considering the number of loyal WhatsApp users, which would bring their P/S ratio down to a more acceptable level.
