Apple caves on music streaming royalties - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jun 22 2015, 04:23 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has reversed its policy and said it would now pay artists during the free three-month trial of its new streaming music service, after pop star Taylor Swift threatened to hold back her latest album "1989" from Apple Music. "When I woke up this morning and read Taylor’s note, it really solidified that we need to make a change," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview late Sunday. So APPL shareholders get to pay Taylor Swift and other music artists for their music streams for three months. Cool. Had the long term prospect of such a business been viable, it would not matter whether APPL pays the artists during the trial period. However, I think this whole music business is just nickels and dimes and spare change for APPL. Such a waste of time and effort. It is not a very profitable business. Besides, very few people are willing to pay for what you can get for free. It starts reminding me recent Google struggles with diversification, like YouTube. i think they only pay for the songs they sell.  why would they pay for artisits songs not selling?  and who is taylor swift?  i never heard of this man ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
