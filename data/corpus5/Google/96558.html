Microsoft: Attractive Investment Despite Richer Valuation - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is a ubiquitous tech firm with an impressive moat, strong margins and cloud potential. MSFT is hardly "cheap," trading at nearly 18x free cash flow. MSFT has a strong history of dividend growth (15% annualized over past nine years) and will likely continue this trend. MSFT's Office 365 and Windows 10 cloud initiatives are very promising and Azure is on a rapid growth pace. MSFT faces the challenge of playing perpetual defense, which may further erode margins. Nadella has yet to prove himself as a competent leader. MSFT has full fair value up to $52 per share, representing 13% of upside. I believe it should be considered a key component of a diversified blue-chip portfolio. This is another contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue chip holdings. I keep approximately 70%-80% of my assets indexed and in blue chips, so this is a very important field for me. As I've stated before, my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price, although I appreciate (and prefer) a strong bargain, quality companies rarely go on a fire sale. When they do, there's often deeper concerns. As Buffett and Munger best put it, "it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of these wonderful companies, trading in a fair price range, with potential upside of 13% to its "full fair value" of $52 per share. MSFT is certainly not cheap, currently trading at nearly 18x its three-year average free cash flow (FCF). Although MSFT isn't a bargain, I think it is fairly valued, and should be considered a key component in a diversified blue chip portfolio. MSFT has maintained a successful dividend strategy throughout its history, and payout amounts have been very impressive even throughout the last decade of weaker growth. The annual dividend payout has been raised an impressive 15.3% annualized over the past nine years with no clear signs of slowing down. Even with the strong dividend yield of approximately 2.7%, the dividend is covered more than 2x by current and average free cash flow. Even if growth slows over the next few years, MSFT still has ample runway to raise the dividend (albeit likely at the expense of repurchases). Strong but Inconsistent Share Repurchases While MSFT has boasted an overall strong repurchase program over the past decade, with shares reduced by 25% over the past decade, the momentum has noticeably slowed since 2010. MSFT missed key opportunities to repurchase shares in the $20s and $30s, and is now resuming share repurchases when the stock is more richly valued.(click to enlarge) Although MSFT has resumed share repurchases after a nearly three-year period of stagnation, MSFT cannot be depended upon to heavily reduce their share count, primarily due to the majority of their cash held overseas. With the currently high FCF multiples (close to 18x on average), MSFT is likely better off investing in growth opportunities or raising the dividend. Over the past 10 years, MSFT has spent $93B (net) to reduce the share count by approximately 2.68B shares, or approximately $34.70 per share. While this looks reasonable based on the current share pricing, the average cost per share has looked foolhardy in the past. With MSFT resuming repurchases near peak pricing, the average repurchase pricing might continue to appear questionable. Microsoft is ubiquitous worldwide for both its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite. Despite over two decades of assault from the likes of Linux, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Microsoft's margins have remained steady and its dominance of these two markets has continued. MSFT also has made key strides in the entertainment sector via its Xbox business, which has arguably replaced Sony (NYSE: SNE ) as the primary source of living room entertainment. Although the Nintendo consoles have higher total sales, Microsoft's platform offers a complete entertainment service whereas Nintendo's offerings are far inferior on a technological basis. Microsoft's gross and pretax profit margins remain at very high levels but have declined steadily over the past decade. Revenue growth has easily compensated for the decline in margins, but the margin trend is a bit worrisome. Microsoft has an enormous cash pile, which will enable them to pursue potential growth opportunities, but this is also a bit of a mixed-bag due to the amount of cash that remains outside of the US. Without some form of tax repatriation holiday, MSFT will be less likely to institute large repurchases or acquire significant US-based companies. The majority of tech firms are internationally based, for similar tax reasons, so despite the limitations MSFT should still be able to make good use of their cash hoard. As of the latest 10-Q quarterly filing (current to March, 31 2015), MSFT has over $50B in net cash and short-term investments vs. $48B in mid-2014 (June 30th). Despite an increasing dividend, over $10B in share repurchases, and $4.5B in capex during the past nine months, the cash pile continues to grow. Microsoft often takes a lot of flak from investors for not having more presence in the "cloud" computing environment. While it's true that the Microsoft Azure offering falls far behind Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS in terms of revenues (AWS has approximately 10x the revenue as of spring 2015), MSFT is gaining growth, averaging more than 10,000 new customers per week. The best chance, in my opinion, for Microsoft to truly capitalize on the Cloud is via its Office 365 offerings and a future potential for operating system subscription licenses. Office 365 essentially changes the Office revenue stream from one-time licensing fees with potential add-on service revenue fees to a recurrent annual or monthly service fee. This shift is critical since it will continue to squeeze money out of businesses that previously were slower on the upgrade cycles. Since Office 365 updates in real-time, companies will avoid painful lump-sum "upgrade costs" and instead will pay via a monthly, quarterly or annual licensing fee. Office 365 is sold to residential consumers for $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year. The business plans range from $5 to $12.50 per month based on storage needs and additional features (including tablet functionality and HD video conferencing). Enterprise plans range from $8 to $20 per user per month. I believe the real-time update capacity and cloud storage tie-in features of Office 365 will further cement their dominance in the workplace. I believe an enormous potential rests in offering operating systems via a similar subscription. Windows already offers live updates, but instead of relying on a "new version" every few years, or even the annual update style that Mac users are accustomed to, what if MSFT operating systems offered users real-time updates on a feature-by-feature basis? This is essentially what both Apple and Microsoft are already doing, but it could be sold as an annual license instead of a one-time sale. This could both increase the quantity and consistency of revenue flows, but would also cut down on piracy as the base Windows operating systems would be designed to require some form of subscription model and verification. Users who didn't renew would continue to have a functional operating system, but would lose access to live updates and all related cloud services. There's already been a lot of talk about this potential shift in the tech community, and I believe the "free" Windows 10 update is just the first step. This isn't really a new challenge for Microsoft, but competition is nibbling at all edges of Microsoft's dominance from Amazon, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) with cloud services to Google, Apple, and Amazon with personal devices and products. Microsoft's push into mobile phones and the Surface tablet have been decent endeavors, but like so many Microsoft initiatives in the 2000s (except for the wildly successful Xbox), both appear to simply be "mediocre-at-best defense." I believe MSFT is finally getting ahead of the curve with Office 365, Windows 10, Azure and the Xbox One integration, but we've seen these false starts before. The true risk to Microsoft investors isn't that they fail to recognize significant growth, as they haven't had significant growth since the late 1990s, but rather that their pseudo monopolies fall apart. Having sampled nearly all of the alternatives to Office I think Microsoft's grip on this market is as strong as ever, but nothing is ever for certain. I view the risk from continuing upstarts in a similar vein as the above discussion - nothing will fundamentally challenge MSFT's dominance, but many new products will eat away at the majority of future growth initiatives. My largest fear as an investor is that MSFT will get caught in a cycle of acquisitions which are necessary to maintain dominance. These acquisitions could result in expanding capex requirements that essentially "eat" all of the growth in operating cash flow from the aforementioned initiatives (Office 365, Azure, and Windows 10+). I believe it's very possible that MSFT's free cash flow could remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. Microsoft has approximately $82B in cash 'trapped' overseas, which has forced them to issue increasing amounts of debt to fund domestic acquisitions, repurchases and dividend payments. If a substantial "tax holiday" doesn't occur within the next few years, this could lead to further inefficient purchase decisions. President Obama has proposed a "compromise" of sorts that would levy a one-time tax of 14% on offshore profits while setting the future rate at 19%. I believe both of these tax rates are unrealistically high, and that this structure could lead to a massive exodus of US corporations. Assuming repatriation is offered at 15%, cash-rich firms are still incentivized to pursue foreign growth initiatives even if they are less attractive (up to 15%) than domestic alternatives. There's a risk that MSFT will unwisely allocate their non-domestic cash in attempts to avoid further taxation. Former CEO Steve Ballmer was (in my opinion) unfairly blamed for the performance of Microsoft stock, but he was infamous for presiding over an unfriendly corporate culture and for stifling innovation through his repeated restructuring attempts. New CEO, Satya Nadella, has promised to lead innovation in the Cloud and Enterprise sectors and he has a strong record of performance at Microsoft. Nadella has made some key decisions during his first year as CEO including opening up Office Apps to iDevices and Android platforms (note: I commonly use Excel on my iPhone and have been very pleased with its functionality - previously I had been looking into competing options). Microsoft and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) announced a landmark deal in 2014 to integrate several of their products. Microsoft also teamed up with Dropbox to enhance operability with Office (note: Dropbox is an essential part of my personal finance business, I have managed to keep my costs at $0, but I would be willing to pay for this quality in the future). Despite the many promising initiatives Nadella has brought to Microsoft, recent restructuring moves raise additional questions of leadership focus. Nadella has cut nearly 20k jobs (albeit mostly Nokia-related) and has lost seven key executives in the past few months. Overall reviews of Nadella's success remain mixed, and I'm not personally convinced yet. The majority of the stock performance over the past two years is due only to perceptions and not to any real fundamental improvements. As I've previously discussed in my other blue chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets. My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield). With a company like MSFT with a clear moat and global scale, and nearly unsurpassed quality and staying power in the tech sector, I am comfortable with a long-term (five-year) average multiple of 15-20x (5-6.7% yield). The three-year average captures some of their higher capex flows due to a few key acquisitions including Nokia's phone ops, Yammer and Skype, which keeps the cash flow picture more conservative. MSFT pays a healthy dividend, but FCF is the important metric to track. The averages are shown in the chart below. The five- and three-year averages are similar as higher recent operating cash flow has given way to higher capex, primarily in the form of acquisitions. Taking the more conservative three-year average and applying a 15x-20x range results in a "fair" market capitalization of $315B to $420B. With 8.09B shares outstanding as of 16 April 2015, the fair price range for MSFT is $38.94 to $51.92. I believe this range is fair, but it shows that Microsoft's current price of $46.10 is hardly a "bargain" at a relative FCF multiple of nearly 18x. MSFT has a history of questionable management decisions on the macro scale, primarily in terms of new product development and marketing, but it is a well-managed firm overall in terms of market domination, production efficiency and profitability. Choosing the mid-point of my valuation range (15-20x 3y average free cash flow) leads to a price target of $45.43, roughly in-line with the current market pricing. I believe shares of MSFT are fairly priced and should be included as a component of a diversified blue chip portfolio, but they are nothing to get excited about. I'm long MSFT at a basis in the mid-$20s I sold shares last year due to outsized portfolio exposure and cheaper alternatives, but would consider adding more shares if they dip closer to a 15x FCF range. I would be comfortable holding my current allocation of shares until the low/mid $50s. The only trade I've made in MSFT since 2011 is shown below.
