Can Yahoo's New Search Deal With Microsoft Help To Control Its Spiraling TAC? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo struck a new search deal with Microsoft. Under the new deal, Microsoft will get a much lower cut of Bing ad revenue than was previously the case. Most Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) investors have turned their focus on the company's planned spinoff of its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan assets due to the underlying implications on the valuation of Yahoo shares. Right now there's a lot of uncertainty regarding whether or not the company will pay taxes on the two deals which will weigh heavily on its valuation. But, investors, especially long-term ones, should not forget to continue examining the health of the company's business to check whether its ongoing turnaround bid is bearing fruit. Yahoo released its first quarter fiscal 2015 results about a week ago. Most investors were quick to notice that the company's net income had taken a long journey south. Not so many, however, noticed that Yahoo managed to report positive revenue growth for the first time in many, many quarters (I lost count of the precise number awhile ago). Yahoo reported consolidated GAAP revenue of $1,226 million, representing 8% year-over-year growth. The positive revenue growth would have had Yahoo investors cheering, was it not for the revelation that the company's GAAP EPS had tanked a jaw-dropping 93% to $0.02 compared with $0.21 recorded in the previous year's comparable quarter. Yahoo pinned the large drop in earnings to a massive increase in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. The company's TAC jumped 300% to $183.1 million, due to Yahoo's search deal with Mozilla that it struck last year, as well as its mobile syndication deal and BrightRoll investments. Without the massive increase in TAC, Yahoo's story would have been quite different. Unfortunately the huge bottom line contraction dulled the fact that Yahoo Mavens (mobile, video, native advertising and social) revenue was up a healthy 58% during the quarter to $363 million. Yahoo is banking on its mavens initiatives to provide a much-needed boost to its growth. Mavens now represent close to 30% of Yahoo's revenue. Despite the rather disappointing take that Yahoo's new-found top line growth had come at a huge cost to its bottom line, the company's shares remained relatively unaffected after CEO Marissa Mayer announced that the company was looking for ways to unlock value from its Yahoo Japan assets. Yahoo mentioned during the earnings call that it struck a new search deal with old partner Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to use Bing as the default search engine on Yahoo. Yahoo did not provide much details of the deal only mentioning that the company will continue to serve Bing ads for not less than 51% of its desktop search traffic. But, Yahoo provided more details about the deal in the 8-K document that it later filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of the details in the new Yahoo-Microsoft search deal include: Both companies are allowed to terminate the search deal by way of a 4-month written notice. The previous 2010 agreement only allowed Yahoo to walk away from the deal if certain revenue targets were not met. Yahoo can request Bing paid search results for 51% of searches. This gives Yahoo room to carve out space for itself to develop its own search capabilities if it so wishes. But, the most important part of the new deal is that Microsoft will now only be entitled to only 7% of the revenue generated from Bing ads on Yahoo properties, way below the 12% of revenue that the company enjoyed from the previous agreement. Yahoo has depended on Microsoft's Bing to power Yahoo searches since 2010. The partnership was, however, quite acrimonious and Yahoo started showing signs of discontent years ago. It's not 100% clear why Yahoo was not happy with the former deal, but I suspect that it felt that Microsoft's revenue cut was too big and also the fact that the earlier deal forced Yahoo to become 100% dependent on Bing for search. Both the old and the current deal involve revenue-sharing whereby each company gets a pre-agreed cut on Bing ad revenue. The new deal seems to heavily favor Yahoo. For one, the company's traffic acquisition costs by Bing will be lowered by a significant amount. This is especially important now that Yahoo has not only has to pay Microsoft but Mozilla as well. Yahoo struck a deal with Mozilla last year to become its default search engine in the U.S. for the next five years. The deal resulted in an immediate increase in Yahoo's search engine market share from 10%-13% at the expense of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Yahoo's larger search engine market share is definitely paying off. The company's number of paid clicks grew 21% during the last quarter compared to 10% growth average before the Mozilla deal. The company's search revenue grew by a similar margin. But, the growth has come at a cost. Yahoo now has to pay Mozilla an undisclosed amount as traffic acquisition costs to use Yahoo as its search engine. Judging by the massive increase in the Yahoo's TAC, the amount it will be forking over to Mozilla is substantial, and I estimate it to be in the region of $80-$100 million per quarter. But, the amount is likely to be largely offset by a 42% reduction in Bing revenue that Microsoft will be collecting as traffic acquisition costs from Yahoo. Even more importantly, Yahoo now has the freedom to develop its own internal search capabilities to lower its dependence on Bing. Yahoo is only bound to serve up Bing ads for 51% of desktop searches, leaving it with plenty of room to develop its own search resources. I project that Yahoo's traffic acquisition costs will stabilize over the next two quarters at a growth rate not far exceeding its 20% growth in paid clicks. As Mayer rightly pointed out, Yahoo's strong growth in its Mavens segment is poised to soon offset declines in its display segment as well as its higher traffic acquisition costs. I expect Yahoo's EBITDA margin, which fell 600 basis points during the last quarter to 22.6%, to grow incrementally to reach around 30% over the next 4-6 quarters.
