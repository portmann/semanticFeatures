Amazon: Finding A Fit In Hardware - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's hardware strategy is unclear, as it does not really drive Prime adoption. Pursuing high-end device and low-cost pricing may drive Amazon device penetration. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) announced a new line-up of Fire tablets and Fire TV devices. Although the success rate for its tablets and TV has been much better than the phone, the key question that investors should ask is how the hardware will tie into the overall Amazon ecosystem. So far, many investors that I spoke with appear to be confused at how hardware fits into Prime. While the idea of leveraging hardware to drive ecosystem penetration is well-understood by investors, Amazon failed to execute on this front, partially due to a combination of hardware quality and pricing. If Amazon mimics the strategies used by Xiaomi or LeTV in producing top-end hardware priced at cost, while bundling it with Amazon's Prime, the company may have a chance at driving penetration. Until then, Amazon's hardware strategy remains murky. Nonetheless, I continue to view Amazon to be one of best ecommerce/ecosystem stories in North America. Near-term growth is likely to be sustainable, but I caution that Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) eventual entry into the U.S., either via acquisition of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and/or investments in BestBuy (NYSE: BBY ) to roll out its O2O strategy, could be a long-term negative for the company. Amazon has shifted its hardware strategy, but it continues to operate in the space. Although no phones will be released in this year, AMZN is smart in leaving this option open because mobile devices, mobile commerce and mobile transactions will be a bigger driver of the company's future growth when we look at Alibaba's growth profile in China. Some investors argue that comparing growth prospects of Alibaba and Amazon is inaccurate due to differing geographies and business models, but I counter that Alibaba operates in the highest ecommerce penetrated country in the world with a leading market share, so Alibaba can be considered a bellwether for Amazon. Although Amazon was reported to have laid off Lab 126 that was responsible for the Fire Phone, its launch of the new TV and tablet suggests that the company remains interested in developing and selling hardware. The tablet's key selling point being low-cost, Prime content and kids, while the TV is marketed as a cost-effect alternative to Apple TV (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The devices do have notable features given the voice control and content integration, but it is questionable how many tablets can be sold for $50 being the starting price for the tablet. While price is attractive, it is far from being the high-end tablet from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) or Apple. On the TV side, it is perhaps Amazon's bestselling hardware product, but competition from Aaple and Google will present a challenging backdrop. One strategy Amazon could consider is mimicking Xiaomi and LeTV that sell top-end TV and mobile devices that are priced at cost. Essentially, these companies are selling hardware to drive their brand name and ecosystem/services. How successful will Amazon be? Judging by Xiaomi's projected 100m handset shipment for this year selling high-end smartphones that are priced at $350/unit, I would argue that Amazon could see some success. The downside will be ongoing losses attributed to the hardware strategy due to an increase in R&D and marketing costs. However, looking in the long term, it may just be the route Amazon should take in order to justify its hardware strategy.
