Streaming Music And Television Are The New Normal | Seeking Alpha Everyone from tech companies to telecom firms is moving into streaming music and television this year. The year is officially half over, and it's apparent that 2015 is a banner year for streaming media, specifically music and television. Within the realm of streaming music, there have been high-profile entrants - Tidal and Apple Music - as well as tweaks to existing services in an attempt to outshine the competition, e.g. Google Play's free radio and Spotify's expansion into podcasts and video. Streaming TV has also become a more crowded field, thanks to new standalone offerings from cable providers, television networks, and video game console makers. It's a new age out there. The streaming music industry is growing rapidly. By the end of 2014, 163.9 billion songs had been streamed - up 54.5 percent from the previous year - to the tune of $1.87 billion in revenue. CD revenue, on the other hand, totaled $1.85 billion, making last year the first year in history that streaming sales eclipsed CD sales. On Tuesday, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) became the latest company to hop on the streaming music bandwagon with the launch of Apple Music. The service, which costs $9.99 a month after a free three-month trial, received a lot of publicity in the weeks leading up to its debut, and not just because the world's most admired company is at the helm. Notorious Spotify defector Taylor Swift publicly criticized Apple for refusing to pay royalties during the free trial, which led Apple to change its mind and agree to pay royalties on all music streamed during the three-month period. After that, Swift decided to put her latest album 1989 on Apple Music, the only other streaming platform to receive the honor besides Google Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Google Play. Speaking of Google, the tech company has stepped up its streaming music offering in an effort to take on Apple Music and Spotify. On June 22, almost a week prior to the Apple Music launch, Google introduced a free, ad-supported radio tier to Google Play that features curated playlists. The company also has a $9.99 per month tier. By the end of the day, Apple's stock went up 0.1 percent, Google fell 0.3 percent and online radio pioneer Pandora Media, Inc. (NYSE: P ) slid 1.3 percent. Despite Pandora's underwhelming stock market performance - the stock is down 12.9 percent this year - CEO Brian McAndrews said the company held a 10 percent share of U.S. radio in March, up from 9.1 percent a year earlier. Pandora also has the second highest number of paying users among streaming music services: Spotify has over 20 million , Pandora has 3.8 million and Tidal has around 800,000 . Of course, consumers still enjoy listening to music for free: at least 50 million of Spotify's active users opt for the free tier, and over 70 million of Pandora's active users opt for the free version. However, paid subscriptions are on the rise, increasing by 26 percent between 2013 and 2014 to 7.7 million. Without a doubt, demand for streaming music is growing. According to music executive Tom Silverman, streaming revenue is expected to reach $3.96 billion in 2019, and its share of total music revenue would grow from 44.1 percent in 2015 to 71.6 percent in 2019. Like streaming music, the streaming TV field is exploding as well, and much of its growth can be attributed to the death of traditional pay-TV and the proliferation of television watching alternatives. During the first quarter of 2015, Variety reports that the US pay-TV business contracted for the first time ever with a net loss of 31,000 subscribers. Now, the pay-TV business is on track to shrink by 0.5 percent at an annualized rate. Furthermore, market research firm NPD Group predicts that 40 percent of US homes will have a streaming media device, like an Apple TV, Roku or Google Chromecast, by 2017, up from 16 percent in 2014. NPD Group even notes that while Apple and Roku were the first companies to drive growth among streaming media players, the market has since flourished with the release of devices from Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as well as smart TVs and wireless-equipped video game consoles. Which brings us to the companies that are trying to capitalize on consumers' changing viewing habits by offering streaming cable services. In January, Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) launched Sling TV, a $20-per-month live and on-demand television service that streams to Internet-connected devices. The following month, Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE ) debuted PlayStation Vue, a $50-a-month Internet TV service that is only available in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia and requires either a PlayStation 3 or 4 console. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) has said its streaming TV service will bow this summer . Aspiring streaming media titan Apple is also reportedly getting in on the action with its own streaming TV service this fall. According to Business Insider, the service has the potential to net $2.4 billion in revenue in 2016 so long as it costs $35 a month - the monthly fee is rumored to be between $30 and $40 - and has 7.4 million subscribers by the end of next year. And then there are the networks. HBO launched its standalone subscription HBO Now service in April, and Showtime's service is coming out in July . The PowerShares Dynamic Media ETF (NYSEARCA: PBS ) - which counts Showtime parent company CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS ), HBO parent company Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX ), Google and Dish among its holdings - is up 5.16% for the year. Streaming is becoming the preferred mode of consumption for millions of Americans, whether it's music or television. As more people seek out services that provide access to their favorite types of media, more companies are likely to branch out into these fields. And the moves make sense as shifting consumer habits present billion-dollar opportunities for companies that are able to establish a foothold.
