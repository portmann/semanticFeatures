Apple's China Problem - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Icahn sold out of Apple, highlighting its PRC relationship as a key concern. I suspect Icahn just came up with an excuse for making an 180 away from his Apple bullishness. After rereading the history of how Google ultimately chose to exit the PRC, I understand his position. At first I thought Carl Icahn's "China" excuse for selling out of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was kind of weak and insincere. However, as a Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) shareholder, I'm familiar with the story of how the company "decided" to get out of China in 2010. Rereading Steven Levy's In the Plex , specifically section six titled: GUGE, Google's Moral Dilemma in China, and looking at the iTunes Movies and iBooks shuttering, Icahn's worries start to make sense. In the Plex takes you chronologically through Google's difficulties with the Chinese government starting as early as 10 years before the company finally decided no longer to cooperate censoring its .cn operation, and I believe it's a bit of history that's extremely relevant to Apple today. The first time Google encountered real difficulties, the PRC, People's Republic of China, blocked its Chinese website from China. Co-founder Brin apparently believed the government did so in support of the emerging native search company Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ). Unfortunately, the government isn't necessarily forthcoming with information on why it chooses to shut down services of a company or what the rules are exactly. Google elegantly solved the problem of determining what the government expected it to censor through automated probing of competing services and determining what it had censored. This didn't prove to be enough as the government kept demanding more specific cases of censorship. Throughout the decade Google spent in China, its service to consumers was handicapped by the government intermittently pulling the plug or making it difficult for the company to operate a reliable service and one time even straight up redirecting its Google.cn traffic to Baidu.cn. Quoting directly from In the Plex: If you frame the issue from that perspective and examine the current market share, the odds Apple will conquer a lot of market share with its move downmarket through the SE model go down: You will find more statistics at Statista Until Icahn made this a top of mind issue, it didn't occur to me to heavily factor in government agendas while forecasting Apple's sales. Could there be an artificial market share cap? It seems naive to expect Apple to easily manage its relationship with the PRC better than Google did. After initially approaching it somewhat lightheartedly, Google did appoint a government relations official, the company set up a giant Beijing operation led by a highly respected Chinese leader. The company also cooperated with lots of requests by the government, but the PRC kept pushing on. Ultimately, the company decided to stop censoring its .cn website completely after suffering a successful attack by hackers for which the company deemed the Chinese government responsible. I'm not worried about Apple's lost revenue from iBooks or iTunes movie service for a second. I'm worried about the PRC consistently undermining Apple's competitive position. In the time it took me to research and write this article, a Chinese court ruled a small maker of "iPhone"-branded leather goods could continue to sell its goods. Source: Legal in China ( company website ) I understand a court ruling is different from a government decision, but with the PRC's checkered history of frustrating Western (U.S.) technology companies , these could be clues to what further awaits Apple. The recent shutting of iBooks and iTunes in China could be the first signs of the PRC-Apple relationship seriously souring. Perhaps Icahn's 180 on Apple compared to his previous bullishness isn't insincere? If we see more moves mirroring the way Google got pushed out over the next months, that's really something to worry about. iBooks and iTunes are not a big deal, but not selling any iPhones in China would be a disaster for Apple. Given the company recently published a public letter explaining it denied requests for access to iPhones by the FBI, it's difficult to see how the company will stay out of conflict with the Chinese government. Sure, you can argue Apple has some leverage through its suppliers like Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ). Indirectly, Apple's business supports a large amount of jobs. But even if the PRC were to ban iPhones, Apple wouldn't be able to retaliate by pulling its business. At least, not within a reasonable time frame. The supply chain is of such a vast size it would take a lot of time. Even if there is only a small probability of China kicking Apple out, the outcome is potentially devastating. Meanwhile, the risk of staying out of AAPL for a couple of months to observe the health of the Apple PRC relationship seems fairly limited.
