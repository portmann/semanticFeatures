Twitter: Another Chapter In The War Of New York And Silicon Valley - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitter illustrates dysfunction between Silicon Valley and New York markets. The resignation of Dick Costolo as CEO of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), after months of public table-pounding by New York investors, illustrates the ongoing struggle between New York and Silicon Valley. To Silicon Valley it's all illustrated by the story of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), which I witnessed first-hand as a reporter nearly 20 years ago. Yahoo began life as a directory that morphed into a search engine. Even before Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) was founded New York investors demanded Yahoo expand beyond its niche. Under the ironically-named Tim Koogle Yahoo complied, becoming a "portal" and buying everything in sight, including something called Broadcast.com that promised to put sports broadcasts on the Internet. The stock went up-and-up, but most of the acquisitions (including Broadcast.com, where founder Mark Cuban wisely sold out his Yahoo stock position) had no legitimate business model. It fell hard in the dot-com crash, and was never able to get up. This is why companies like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), which came to market with founders holding enormous power over them, went for two-tier ownership structures. They didn't mind taking Wall Street's money, but the founders were not willing to give Wall Street control over their companies in exchange. They wanted to stick to their knitting, trusting their original visions. Despite this, both Google and Facebook have now spent nearly a decade playing the "great game," buying up nearly any company that became interesting, in order to keep those companies from becoming threats. To Silicon Valley, the fall of Costolo indicates that Wall Street continues to know nothing but short-term profit, but that the pressure to surrender in that can now come from inside the Valley itself, from people like Chris Sacca who found companies, sell out their positions, and then go to the "dark side" to become traders and raiders For New York, on the other hand, Twitter is an example of a self-indulgent CEO ignoring the needs of the market and getting his come-uppance. The stock was bid up nearly 4% overnight as co-founder Jack Dorsey, who also runs Square, came on as "interim" CEO. Even before the ink was dry on Dorsey's palace coup, New York was getting some of what it wanted. The 140-character limit on "tweets" was being lifted. Never mind that the limit, a product of the old SMS days when users were charged for each block of text, was the only thing keeping tweets from turning into gibberish. Next up, for Wall Street, is an auction on the franchise, with Google and Facebook both expected to step into the frame. The problem is neither has a plan for Twitter, just an assumed desire for it, and plenty of high-priced stock with which to buy it, plus servers on which to host it. More telling was a wave of insider selling notifications issued yesterday, including co-founder Evan Williams, who offloaded 372,000 shares as the barbarians stormed the gates. What will it do with the prize? Dress it up, spit it out, and move on. What will Silicon Valley then do with the money? Complain, re-form, and come back to the market. Call it evolution in action, call it the circle of life, call it war if you like, but just don't call it a long-term buy signal.
