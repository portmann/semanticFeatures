ETF Hub Sep 21 2015, 03:54 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is cleaning up its iOS App Store to remove malicious iPhone and iPad programs following what is being described as the first large-scale attack on the mobile software outlet. The hackers took aim at popular Chinese apps by convincing developers of legitimate software to use a tainted, counterfeit version of source code known as XcodeGhost. According to cyber security firm Palo Alto Networks, "hundreds of millions" of users are at risk of having their personal data exposed due to the malware. Yeah, I guess everyone should switch to android where this sort of thing never happens. (Oh wait, no it happens ten times a day). Seems like the Apple App store is stagnating or fading in terms of quality, whereas the Google Play store is improving in terms of quality/security. As security is the main perceived advantage of AAPL, this is a very worrisome development for long shareholders of AAPL. Apple is hardly a joke... it works hard on security, including doing code reviews of apps in the store.  Nonetheless, it would be better off it worked with the rest of the world, instead of against its own roots: Read the facts! Just to quote "Apple hat been hacked" is simply to narrowly considered.
