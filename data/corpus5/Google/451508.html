Tesla Rolls Further Away From The Apple Tree: Part 2 - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha Tesla supporters claim Tesla Motors could be the next Apple. Elon Musk went so far as to claim Tesla could be the first $1 trillion company. Part One of this article dismissed this claim on the basis of the respective companies' approach to manufacturing and margins. Part Two goes further in explaining why Apple is Apple, Tesla is Tesla, and neâ€™er the twain shall meet. The first installment of this article, focused on the differences of manufacturing approach between Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), generated an interesting blend of commentary from readers. However, the differences between Tesla and Apple don't stop at approach to manufacturing. There are important differences between the cultures of the companies in two equally, if not more, important areas than simply their respective approaches to building their products. These areas include the companies' approaches to innovation and to synergistic alliances. Let's look at those two areas more closely. Approach to Innovation and Product Development Tesla's approach to innovation and product development could hardly be more different from that of Apple. Tesla's approach to innovation and product development is to be first to market at virtually any cost. Apple is also thought of as an innovative company, but for very different reasons. The Model S cemented Tesla's reputation for designing truly beautiful cars with exceptional performance specs. Tesla has, no doubt, pushed the EV adoption curve forward significantly by demonstrating electric vehicles can be more than glorified golf carts. In its rush to be seen as innovative, however, Tesla has also developed a reputation for being willing to put buggy and substandard products in the hands of consumers. Some industry observers regard Tesla as almost irresponsible in its release of alpha- and beta-level technology to consumers. Examples include Model S door handles, Model S drivetrains, Model S brake light covers, Model X front doors, Model X falcon wing doors, general fit and finish issues across the lineup, Autopilot, and the hyping of completely uneconomical and quickly discontinued Powerwall offerings. Apple is the polar opposite. In fact, Apple is rarely first-to-market with new technology. Apple isn't known as the company that does it first, they are known as the company that does it right. There are exceptions, of course. Apple was able to deliver high-quality fingerprint recognition technology to smartphones years ahead of Google, due in large part to its approach to developing hardware around its software requirements, rather than the other way around. However, for the most part, Apple isn't generally the first to the fest. Rather, it typically chooses to make a fashionably late entrance as the best-dressed partygoer. It takes time to properly vet and test a new product before unleashing it on the masses. What Apple has shown, however, is that doing it right is far more important than doing it fast. This is why Apple, despite selling far more expensive products than most of its commoditized competitors, maintains solid market share and a shockingly high 94% share of global smartphone profits. And why are Apple users so fanatical about their Apple products? The most commonly heard phrase is "they just work". And that's what mass-market products are all about. They have to "just work". It's why Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and VW (OTC: VLKAY ) lead the world in automotive sales. Their products are reliable, affordable, and widely known for being so. (Yes, I know all about the NOx controversy; it had zero effect on the cars' reliability, though.) By being first to market with high performance, high-priced electric vehicles, Tesla has earned (i) a reputation for innovation but below-average reliability, (ii) a minuscule market share, and (iii) a negative share of global automotive profits. Whether Tesla's move to a broader market will improve these dismal attributes remains to be seen. The Law of Diffusion of Innovation, however, may provide some clues. There is a group of approximately 2.5% of the population (Innovators) willing to buy something new and cool regardless of its level of refinement or cost. These are the folks who bought $10,000 HD plasma televisions before there was much, if any, HD content to watch on them. This group will tolerate defects and even make excuses for them because being first to have something makes them feel good. These have been Tesla's Model S and X customers. The Model 3 will put Tesla in a position to capitalize on a larger market, the Early Adopters (about 13.5% of the population). This group is still forgiving of defects, but less so than the Innovator crowd. The interesting thing here is that a failure with the Early Adopters is basically the death knell for a company. Tesla has one chance, and one chance only, to "cross the chasm" from Early Adopters to the world of the Early and Late Majorities. That chance is the Model 3. If Tesla wants to be around in five years, it had better take a page from Apple's book and realize that, with the Model 3, doing it fast is far less important than doing it right. Approach to Synergistic Relationships This is another area in which the differences between a successful company like Apple and a struggling one like Tesla become painfully obvious to anyone willing to see. I will begin with a brief recounting of the tale of GT Advanced Technologies ( OTCPK:GTATQ ). For those who follow AAPL, the story of GTAT was a compelling one. It is widely considered a misstep for Apple, an embarrassment even. A Brief History of Apple and GT Advanced Technologies Apple was one of the world's largest consumers of sapphire, used to protect camera lenses and fingerprint readers, requiring nearly 25% of the global sapphire supply. Apple had designs on increasing its use of sapphire to solve another major problem: scratching of iPhone touchscreens. GT Advanced Technologies made furnaces that produced synthetic sapphire. At one point, Apple considered purchasing a large number of furnaces from GTAT to secure an ongoing supply. However, as I discussed in my last article, Apple doesn't generally insert itself into the supply chain on the production side of things, preferring to outsource this to capable suppliers. After looking to other suppliers and not finding pricing consistent with its margin requirements (yes, successful companies have those), Apple turned to GTAT. GTAT agreed to begin using its own furnaces to produce sapphire for Apple. At the time, Apple had about $180 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and GTAT had a market cap of about $2.5-$3 billion. Apple could have purchased GTAT with pocket change, but didn't. Instead, Apple bought a facility in Arizona and leased it to GTAT. It also loaned GTAT a few hundred million bucks. Again, pocket change for the perpetual cash-generating machine that is Apple. Long story short, GTAT wasn't good at making sapphire. It ran into major financial difficulties (which it hid right up to its bankruptcy declaration), and eventually filed for bankruptcy. Apple picked up some assets in the bankruptcy to recoup part of its investment, and continued using glass in the iPhone. It also turned the former sapphire factory into a data center. What's the moral of the story? Successful companies manage risk by sticking to what they know. Had Apple acquired GTAT at some point, the financial downside would have been much greater for Apple. Now we turn our eye to the proposed acquisition of SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ) by Tesla Motors. SolarCity is an installer of rooftop solar panels. It also has designs on becoming a manufacturer of solar panels. In reality, its primary business is long-term lease financing. SolarCity has what many view to be a broken business model and some serious financial difficulties. Tesla Motors is also, to say the least, less than financially strong. There are alleged potential synergies to be realized by aligning the interests of these companies. While I don't necessarily agree, I'm willing to accept the idea at face value for the purpose of this comparison. Either way, rather than letting SolarCity be SolarCity, and Tesla be Tesla, and working together to do whatever it is they plan to do together, Elon decided Tesla should acquire SolarCity. The question Tesla investors should ask themselves is this: What value is derived from a merger that could not be derived from a joint venture? Selling solar panels is not Tesla's core competency. Nor is manufacturing solar panels (or cars, for that matter). While there are some potential sales overlaps between and among Tesla Energy, SolarCity, Tesla Motors, I fail to find any overlap so strong that this needs to be one company, rather than two cooperative ones. This is the type of risk Elon is all too willing to accept on behalf of shareholders. While I've made my feelings about this merger and Elon's motivations clear in the past, I won't dwell on that here. The point is, Tesla is taking an irresponsible approach to gaining alleged synergies with SolarCity. To stabilize SolarCity, Tesla will have to divert much of the cash it recently raised "to ramp Model 3 production" (ha ha). Here's a bold prediction: Tesla will be back feeding at the equity trough within 3 months of acquiring SolarCity. A comment on the first installment of this article provided an excuse I believe Tesla investors will buy. The excuse will be that the Tesla/SolarCity merger was consummated to assist both companies in going after large-scale state and municipal solar/battery storage projects. Some potential project, on which the new hybrid company is bidding, will require such enormous scale that Tesla will have no choice but to invest more heavily in its infrastructure. This, of course, will be little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to cover up the accelerating operating losses resulting from the merger, but the faithful will buy it anyway and their stake in Tesla will be further diluted. This is an area that is categorically unfair for the purpose of comparison, but it would be irresponsible not to mention it. The reason it is unfair to compare many numbers side-by-side is the sheer size difference. Apple's revenues are about 60x those of Tesla, and the rest of the key financial numbers are similarly skewed. Of course, AAPL is also profitable, something TSLA is still hoping to achieve for more than a single quarter. For me, the key comparison that is fair to draw is operating margins, and it highlights why Tesla is unlikely to become the next Apple. Remember, operating income has nothing to do with capital expenditures, a favorite excuse for TSLA supporters. Operating income is merely the costs to operate the business subtracted from revenues. Oddly enough, Tesla has shown negative scale in terms of its margins. It seems to become less efficient as its revenues grow. Here's the long and short of it. TSLA has upside because of the story, not because of any reality-based projections for the future. As a result, it is a terrible long-horizon bet. Over the next decade, its chances of seeing a share price drop of 75% are greater than its chances of growing from today's valuation. Tesla is as far from the model of the most successful business in the history of the world as it could possibly be. Its story is based on faith and faith alone, no more likely to win than a gambler doubling down on 15 with the dealer showing a face card. On the other hand, AAPL has a solid business model, an enviable company culture, a history of success, incredible financial strength, and an ability to buy growth with cash whenever it sees fit. It pays a solid dividend (particularly in light of its currently depressed share price) and is repurchasing shares at a rapid clip. As a result, it is a solid investment for anyone seeking medium-to-long-term ROI. I want to thank everyone who takes the time to read, share their thoughts, and engage in conversation and debate in the comment section of my articles. To those who say kind words and agree with my thoughts, I offer a sincere "thank you". I want to thank equally, or perhaps even more, those who read the article, disagree with my conclusions, and offer thoughtful and productive counterpoints. These individuals are an increasingly rare and valuable treasure in today's world. I don't pretend to know everything. I've been around the block a time or two, and my conclusions are based on my research and my experiences. I respect the fact that yours are as well. That said, the greatest value I get from Seeking Alpha, as a reader or contributor, comes from the rational and intelligent exchange of ideas and impressions among those with differing opinions. I learn more from you than anyone will ever learn from me. When I joined Seeking Alpha as a reader, I was bullish on TSLA. I was looking for a good entry point and reason to invest in the company. While my heart is still behind Tesla Motors, the bears made more compelling arguments that resonated with my intellectual self. As a result, I find the valuation of TSLA to be inflated and, frankly, absurd. To those who choose to leave respectful, thoughtful, and intelligent comments disagreeing with my conclusions, I offer a sincere "thank you". Special thanks are due to commenters Holidayday, GreenTECH Analysis, Randy Carlson, and Special Value. Although these commenters disagree with me almost without exception, they offer counterpoints that are generally reasoned and rational without being insulting or condescending. As a result, they have earned my respect and I consider their opinions closely when examining my own. I am always willing to look at my own views under a magnifying glass, because I know that I am far from perfect. I have found myself agreeing with at least part of many dissenting comments, even if that comes more from my heart than my head. To those who choose to leave insulting, unreasoned, or ill-conceived "hit and run" comments deriding the content of my submissions, I say the following: I, like many of you, live in the United States of America, and our founding fathers and brave service-men and -women have made sacrifices that allow you to be jackasses with little regard for the consequences. I hope that in celebrating Independence Day, you thanked them from the bottom of your hearts for granting you the right to do what you do and be who you are. That said, I'm currently accepting thoughts from dissenters and contrarians at the table of respect and rational debate. Feel free to leave your comments below.
