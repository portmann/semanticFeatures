Facebook Monetizing WhatsApp - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is working the slow-play on monetizing WhatsApp â€“ it was effective with Facebook after all. Inward monetization is already occurring as user agreements display. Facebook Messenger will not exactly cannibalize WhatsApp. Rather, it will buttress Facebookâ€™s now-mammoth chunk of the messenger arena. Facebook has the resources to emphasize, or amplify, the messenger services better than competitors - many of which are utilizing old-school monetization tactics. Zuckerberg himself said they are not rushing to monetize WhatsApp: "The right strategy is to focus on connecting the people before aggressively turning them into businesses. Once we get to that scale, then we think (the users) will start to become meaningful businesses in their own right." Pitching out another curveball, FB created Facebook Messenger, which is very similar to WhatsApp . Clearly the singular goal is to net as many users as possible. FB will then slowly adapt a monetization platform to let businesses slip into this stream. WhatsApp founders promised users no gimmicks or cheesy stuff to monetize at the cost of user experience - so if FB adds such bells and whistles directly to WhatsApp, it could erode the user base. While FB probably isn't afraid to change some things, they can always squeeze cheesy ad gimmicks into FB messenger, for those who don't mind such things. Either way, FB is already legendary for the slow-play technique of introducing features with low outward invasiveness to user experience, and remaining that way for great lengths of time. "Our explicit strategy is for the next several years to focus on growing and connecting everyone in the world," Zuckerberg said. Facebook's game involves gaining user dependence first. Introducing monetization slowly means people don't feel hard-pressed to pony up cash to participate. WhatsApp originally gave users a free year of use, followed by a $1 per year fee thereafter. Some say that it's easy to avoid paying that dollar anyways, and FB is clearly not looking to become a mere subscription service, which always comes with natural limits. Facebook wants a user pool that spans countries and continents. With WhatsApp, Facebook got exactly that in a rather expensive gift basket. With WhatsApp dialing in at 600+ million users, growing toward 1 billion - it's clear why FB paid up. The $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition has puzzled some investors - and it should - until recently. If monetization is introduced effectively, and the user-base remains, the high fee could be surmounted. A few of WhatsApp's competitors monetize with features that many consider cheesy, or simply nominal. Some rely on "ads, paid stickers, and freemium games to generate revenue. " Some messengers have taken furthers steps, for example: "WeChat also is integrated with e-commerce sites, including JD.com, which encourages customers to order products directly from the messaging app. Barclays estimates that WeChat revenue will rise 40% annually to 9.6 billion RMB ($1.53 billion) this year." From my view, Facebook's monetization strategy has evolved beyond gimmicks - they are looking for deep-rooted institutional-type moves. They will likely capitalize on WhatsApp differently than current messenger apps. That monteization will likely include the addition of services that will lasso WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Facebook together as much as possible, in terms of monetization and data collection. In fact, this lassoing appears to have already happened, as you can see from this specific section of the user agreement that details Facebook is data-sharing with WhatsApp. This translates to what Zuckerberg said regarding WhatsApp's future of "letting businesses in" - they have already been let in. WhatsApp data can simply fall within Facebook's data mining sales platform as it already exists. Apparently this is already happening as well, since both Facebook and WhatsApp squeeze users to submit their phone numbers as well - so monetization of WhatsApp in Facebook's traditional way is already occurring. As Zuckerberg said regarding WhatsApp, he thinks users will surface as businesses on their own, over time. Facebook sells advertising to Facebook users, bought by other users who happen to be businesses. This advertising platform relies on stalwart data collection and data linkage occurring during every second of Facebook user's time. Facebook showed the market that extremely targeted advertising carries a big relative premium. Selling the best of the best in targeted advertising attracts businesses - and that's something that WhatsApp's competitors might not have. Coupling that concept with the notion that Facebook has the time, talent and finances to enhance its own services in any direction needed means that they'll keep the edge in out-developing their competitors. With massive user bases, developing small features that just barely monetize translates to billions of dollars. Facebook is Already Looking Beyond Messengers Facebook wants to create enveloping user experiences, which means increasing the amount of times per day that people are willing to use Facebook's products - then expanding the amount of data people will share. For Facebook, creating or buying such a big foothold in the messenger market means taking hold of the next biggest platform in social media. After all, messenger services are used constantly throughout the day, seconded in number of visits to Facebook. The combo of messenger service and social media platform makes users of both services interact with Facebook possibly more than any other company in the world. So long as Facebook is monetizing user experiences, growth is imminent, until stopped by outside forces. While there is some talk about Facebook Messenger cannibalizing WhatsApp users, there's a hefty chunk of moot points buried in there. To quote one of the greatest movie lines of all time: "Why build one… when you can build two at twice the price?" (from the movie Contact via the 90s). For Facebook, by purchasing the biggest whale in messenger services, and then developing Facebook Messenger regardless, this remains a sign that Facebook intends to dominate the messenger market to the best of their abilities. FB could have simply developed their own messenger and let WhatsApp remain as competition. That's a big difference of outlook. However, Facebook didn't fork over $19 billion to buy a messenger app - they spent that money in the attempt to buy a whole market. By taking a chunk out of the messenger market, it allows FB to slow-play monetization to yield effectiveness. If FB tried to develop Messenger on its own, without stopping WhatsApp as a competitor, then FB Messenger could have fallen into the un-used app arena, like many of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) extraneous developments. Another few years would have passed, and perhaps WhatsApp users would tally 1.5 billion with a price tag insurmountable. In the messenger market, what Facebook did was the equivalent of 1990s Google buying Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) (or vice versa) - it's a move that leads to expediting domination of budding markets even further. If FB can get a few dollars in advertisement value, service upgrade or side-grade out of WhatsApp, the purchase fee will be swallowed rather quickly. Yes, loyal fans of Facebook, or fans of integration as a whole, will just use FB Messenger. Yet, many people will use both apps as needed… because why not? Facebook relies on creating a giant pool of users to sell to businesses. While this concept might undoubtedly face some legal fragility someday (as it should), FB has surpassed the $200 billion company status. FB's monetization pace was effective, and will likely translate to WhatsApp's future to some proportion. Small or large businesses that purchase advertising throw money in the direction of most effectiveness. If you are in that position, then the question is, who do you rely on: the FB Goliath who offers a slew of information about users, or FB's competitor with 60 million users and no depth of historic data on those users? Such businesses will go to FB, so long as they provide the best. If we look at the paid-per-click advertising market, for small websites trying to monetize through advertising, Google is still considered the absolute best. They pay out more, and offer more. Some competitors offer more convoluted programs and rack up a lot of controversy and criticism - often due to lack of payouts and other serious problems. In the Internet ad-sales world, actual corruption and gouging is a common fear among advertisers (not that Google is free from controversy ), but the problem is that it's too easy for companies to fake advertising results, lie, cheat and steal. Most ad potency data comes from internal documentation offered by the ad sales company themselves. Such complaints can be easily researched, and they deliver the idea that massive household names can become a more reliable go-to for advertisers. Reliability itself is a primary feature, and something Facebook probably offers ad-purchasing customers. The point is, where will advertisers go? Every penny they spend on advertising is another slew of profitless products they must sell to pay for that advertising. While I personally think the heavy monetization of users, in terms of spy-and-sell, is more than just a problem, as it stands today, I don't think FB will have a problem monetizing WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger collectively. It's pretty clear that Zuckerberg is after the entire social media puzzle. The interesting yet controversial purchase of Oculus has deep social media connotations. He knows that some company will push social media into a virtual reality experience. Virtual reality could put distant people directly into the illusion of direct physical presence, and then extend into the far reaches of fantasy. For Facebook to roll in simple messenger services remains a simple step toward that encompassing experience Zuckerberg is actually looking toward. Oculus is far from being a mainstream concept, but that's the endgame FB must be looking to. Today it seems that buying or developing messenger apps is a huge business maneuver, but with Facebook valued at hundreds of billions, WhatsApp is more of an intermediate money-making venture to provide monetary support for that virtual future of social media. Whether or not Facebook is capable of reaching that distant reality is a different matter altogether, but I believe this envelops the status of the WhatsApp purchase, and I think FB is more than capable of closing over the astronomical purchase price - if current trends continue.
