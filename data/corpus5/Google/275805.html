ETF Hub Dec 28 2015, 18:50 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor In a move that mirrors promos long offered by rivals , Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is now offering mobile users up to $650 per line to switch from another carrier. Consumers who trade in their current smartphone and buy one on a Verizon payment plan get up to $650 (through a prepaid card) to cover remaining installment plan balances with another carrier. Switchers signing up for Big Red's XL or XXL plan also get an extra 2GB/month of data for life. Verizon has long been more conservative with its promo activity than peers, relying on its coverage edge and network performance to maintain premium pricing. The company reported 1.3M retail postpaid net adds for Q3, including 430K postpaid phone net adds. We had two iPhones we owned outright, shared 3gb data, unlimited voice and text... $143 per month.  Switched to US Cellular, same plan, no promos in effect, now bill is $97 per month with better service where we live.  Just the facts. Don't think you were on the right plan....on Verizon 3GB plan ($45) my 2 lines own outright are $20 a piece, my monthly is $93 a month. Just the facts. I pay $60+ for Verizon unlimited voice & text & they are available 24/7 for every problem & question & unfailingly upbeat, sympathetic (& I am a raving Luddite!) and effective in helping me & resolving issues - as well as teaching me how to use my IPhone - whereas Apple is only available via appointment - & they don't have any available.  I don't know what I'd do w/o Verizon! Would be nice if Verizon offered some deals to keep existing customers. I have 6 phones on my plan and am looking at alternative carriers. Verizon can go to h3ll.  Google Fi is awesome and under $30.00 a month!! Smartphone price war accelerates.  My guess is somewhere between free and $99 with a two year contract some time soon.
