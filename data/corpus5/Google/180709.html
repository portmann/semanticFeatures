Buy The Volkswagen Contagion? - Volkswagen AG ADR (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) | Seeking Alpha U.S. car company stocks are down on the Volkswagen scandal. The sudden collapse of Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ), due to its cheating on emissions tests, has put pressure on auto stocks that were not involved in what happened. Yet this week Ford (NYSE: F ) is down 2.5% and GM (NYSE: GM ) is down almost 2%. Ford's market cap is less than six months' sales, which is worse than the level for retailer Target (NYSE: TGT ). Yet you would think that trouble at Volkswagen should be good news for rivals. People are still going to be buying cars. If they don't like VW, shouldn't they be looking more closely at Ford and GM? Shouldn't those stocks be heading higher? Margins remain wafer-thin, but steady. Ford brought barely 5% of its second quarter revenues to the net income line, but its 15% dividend represents a yield of 4.3%. GM brought less than 3% of sales to its bottom line during the June quarter, but its 36 cent dividend now yields 4.8%. One reason the shares haven't responded is an assumption, pushed by the Volkswagen whistle blowers, that if the German giant is doing something shady everyone else must be doing it too. But the VW scandal was a special case, involving diesel cars. Diesel cars don't go through the kind of annual emissions inspections that gasoline-powered cars go through. They go through a centralized test at a factory, before they go on the market. VW installed software that could detect the test and put urea into the exhaust mixture at those times - the cars don't produce enough to do this all the time. American and Asian car companies don't produce many diesel cars. Gasoline-powered cars often have their emissions inspected annually, in the field, and what's being tested is mainly the catalytic converter, which can be replaced. The fuels are quite different. Think of diesel as being like cooking oil, and gasoline as being more like whiskey. So if VW is due to lose sales, and if Ford or GM aren't subject to the same tests, why are these stocks getting hit? It's true that U.S. car stocks have never recovered from the last recession. The GM bailout still angers many, and Ford hasn't escaped stigma even though it didn't take the money. The Price/Earnings multiples on car companies are tiny - Ford's is 15, GM's 11, and Toyota's is 10. Tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) that have been talking up the idea of self-driving cars could buy these folks for pocket change. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), whose car production is measured in the thousands rather than the millions, is worth nearly as much as these guys. All of which tells me there are many, many reasons why a speculation on these auto stocks could prove profitable. A tie-up with a tech company, accelerating sales growth, and a purchase of VW assets are all possible. Even talking about it could get these stocks rolling forward again. The Volkswagen contagion story is overdone. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
