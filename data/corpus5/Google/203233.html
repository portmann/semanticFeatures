Why Facebook's 1 Billion Milestone Is A Big Deal - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha On August 24th, 2015, 1 in 7 people on earth used Facebook in a 24-hour period. A huge milestone for the company. Facebook successfully attempts to fill a human void created by technology's ability to connect people by disconnecting us. In the process, Facebook will become a platform of choice for advertisers. With a user base equivalent to approximately 21% of the global population, the social network is increasingly becoming a data analytics powerhouse. Yesterday (8/27/15), Mark Zuckerberg announced on his Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) page that the company had just connected a billion people in a single day. A tremendous milestone for the company that substantiates how it has become a powerful platform. We just passed an important milestone. For the first time ever, one billion people used Facebook in a single day. On Monday, 1 in 7 people on Earth used Facebook to connect with their friends and family. When we talk about our financials, we use average numbers, but this is different. This was the first time we reached this milestone, and it's just the beginning of connecting the whole world. I'm so proud of our community for the progress we've made. Our community stands for giving every person a voice, for promoting understanding and for including everyone in the opportunities of our modern world. A more open and connected world is a better world. It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities, and a stronger society that reflects all of our values. Thank you for being part of our community and for everything you've done to help us reach this milestone. I'm looking forward to seeing what we accomplish together." Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg . Technology has, is and will always be a paradox. It helps us save time and at the same time and makes us waste time. It enables us to stay more connected with people all over the world by making us more disconnected with our surroundings. You can have dinner with someone and yet spend more time chatting on the phone than with the person seated next to you. The vast array of ways we are able to stay connected with people has made us more disconnected today than ever. However, this disconnect has given birth to more powerful companies that attempt to fill that physical human void. Social networking sites like Facebook have dominated this space. This dominance is important in three ways: More advertisers: By having enough people use their platforms, social networks can attract more advertisers. Data analytics: They can make money from data analytics by leveraging big data to analyze human trends. Live news market: They can grab market share from traditional media by dominating the live news market. This is why Facebook's 1 billion milestone is very important. It positions Facebook as a platform of choice for advertisers. In addition, it gives the company the green light to attempt other revenue generating strategies such as the live news business. No social networking site comes close to Facebook's Daily Active Users (DAU). This is significant if put into context. It implies that Facebook has almost twice the traffic as Instagram, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Snapchat and Whatsapp combined and then multiplied by 2. Although these DAUs are averages for Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Whatsapp, they give an idea of the enormous user engagement Facebook offers relative to competitors. Furthermore, this increased user engagement is in addition to the data that Facebook accounts for 46.5% of all social media site visits. The 1 billion milestone reiterates Facebook's dominance to advertisers. Repeat traffic means repeat exposure for advertisers, and this increases the probability of a user clicking on their ads. Facebook has managed to make users visit the site again and again. By having a lot of new content generated every second, it makes the site less boring and it makes users stay longer on the site. Facebook owns some major players in the social networking space such as Instagram and Whatsapp. This is important because it enables the company to gain insight into different demographics. This is a value proposition that means everything to advertisers. For instance, retailers targeting teens, universities attempting to lure high school students to apply to them, a politician trying to appeal to youth, an advertiser with a specific demography targeting a person with specific interests, etc. The examples are endless. The opportunities are numerous. The company has access to data it can use to make advertising on its platform more efficient. Here's the list of the top eight most popular social networking sites as derived from an eBizMBA Rank which is a continually updated average of each website, Alexa Global Traffic Rank and U.S. Traffic Rank from both Compete and Quantcast . The image above shows that Facebook has almost the same unique monthly visitors as Twitter, Linkedln, Pinterest, Google Plus and Tumblr combined. Having an audience this large enables the company to become a powerful data analytics tool. Through big data, they can give advertisers specific information about their audience to enable them to effectively target the right groups of people. Facebook does not need to have "tweets" to compete with Twitter in live news. In a sense, Facebook has already began making steps into the "now" news space. One of the comments on Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that grabbed my attention was about the devastating 2011 Earthquake in Japan. Facebook does not need to buy Twitter to enter into live news. It can just compete with Twitter. With a 1 billion DAU milestone, increases in Facebook's user growth and engagement look promising. In addition, it's easier for anyone to post their thoughts on Facebook without the character restriction than it is on Twitter. Good writers who can succinctly express their views in 140 characters are more inclined to prefer Twitter for being concise but the majority would rather not have the restriction. "I would take it with a grain of salt," Chowdhry told Benzinga. "I don't think we are seeing the whole picture. I will not believe that (Facebook) had one billion on the same day. I think this statement is lacking some details." Chowdhry said if the announcement had specified that this includes Instagram and WhatsApp, he would have believed the reported milestone. "Engagement levels on Facebook, especially on desktop, (are) declining," said Chowdhry. "On mobile, Instagram and WhatsApp are growing at a faster rate and Facebook is declining. So I won't believe what he says at face value." Benzinga I think these are good points to consider. But I believe they are short sighted. If Facebook is even close to a 1 billion people on a single day, that's huge. However, more users do not mean increased revenues. How they leverage the user base is what matters. For instance, some people have more than one account. Others might be logged in but not actively using it. Nonetheless, the milestone is a significant one. It reiterates how popular Facebook is and gives a glimpse not only in what the company is but also what it could be. With 1.490 billion users as of August 2015 according to Statista , not of them are active but that is more than the population of China (1.357 billion) or about 21% of the world's population. Lastly, over the coming months, news like this will attract more advertisers. I would recommend getting into the stock before the October earnings report considering the recent correction dropped its stock price from its 52-week high of $99.24/share. Facebook is going to go above $100/share before the end of this year due to increased ad revenues and momentum driving news such as its drone program or its visual assistant. Advertisers who desire efficiency and better targeted marketing will start considering Facebook as a platform of choice. Advertisers get more bang for their buck on Facebook than any other site.
