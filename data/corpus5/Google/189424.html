Amazon enlists GE, Samsung, others for automatic-reordering service - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Oct  1 2015, 19:22 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor GE, Samsung, and Oster are among 11 new supporters of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Dash Replenishment Service (DRS), which allows Web-connected appliances and electronics to automatically reorder supplies when they run low. Existing supporters include Whirlpool, Brita, and Brother. Examples of DRS-enabled devices at work include printers automatically reordering ink, water pitchers automatically ordering filters, and washers ordering detergent. Amazon claims hardware makers can support the service by adding as few as 10 lines of code to a device's software. DRS complements Amazon's Dash Buttons (mocked by some, praised by others), which let Prime subs reorder a name-brand product simply by pressing a button on a small device that can be hung or stuck someplace within a home. Supported brands include Gillette, Tide, Gatorade, Clorox, and Ziploc. Each button costs $4.99, but comes with a $4.99 credit towards an initial purchase Both solutions are arguably part of a broader effort by Amazon to keep consumers (Prime subs especially) habitually ordering from the company, by offering a level of convenience and value-added services smaller online retailers can't provide. Separately, in an eyebrow-raising move, Amazon has told marketplace sellers it won't allow Apple TV set-tops and Google's Chromecast HDMI stick to be sold on its site as of Oct. 29, The Fire TV vendor claims the move is due to the fact Apple TV/Chromecast don't "interact well" with Prime Video. The ChromeCast banning is a bad joke. Less than a quarter of Amazon's customers are Prime subscribers anyway, so Amazon's excuse rings hollow.  For all the criticism Google's gotten lately, a move like this would definitely have violated its "don't be evil" motto, and I doubt the company would ever commit such a blatantly anticompetitive act.  Amazon should be getting more regulatory scrutiny than Google, but how much net capital does it actually have to take away.  That's what it still comes down to for all involved, including governments, and Amazon will clearly do whatever it takes, short of a customer backlash. The Dash buttons are actually an interesting technological example of some of the same sort of jockeying to work around Apple: That's still a heck of a lot better than using its retail clout in ways that should be garnering FTC attention. That is not very smart of Amazon. They do not want to remind people that they are a scary monopoly yet. It would have been better to wait until they are absolutely unavoidable, (like, say, a cable company) before they start with the scary monopolistic actions. And Google and Apple were absolutely the wrong companies to piss off. Especially if you piss them both off at the same time.
