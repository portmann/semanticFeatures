Apple Fell Below The 200-Day Moving Average, So What? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Everyone already knows that Apple's fundamentals are strong. Everyone also already knows, unless if they've been hiding under a rock, that the broader market hasn't generated strong returns. Even so, I wanted to write an article to remind everyone that short-term price action isn't always indicative of long-term returns. So before rushing over to your broker to sell Apple, also remember that momentum names fall bellow the 200-day moving average all the time. But, so as long as the fundamentals remain intact, momentum stocks also tend to recover and exhibit abnormal returns relative to the market. So, as many of you are well aware, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has declined from its all-time high of $135 down to the current level of $115.96. I wasn't anticipating this to occur, but given the weakening market sentiment in both international and domestic markets, I guess it was inevitable. For the most part, Apple's fundamentals remain strong. However, the stock will experience difficulty with pricing momentum as a result of broader technical factors. First, the Chinese Yuan needs to stabilize. The issues in China are broad as growth is relatively weak, which resulted in a sell-off of the Chinese Yuan-Dollar pair. Earnings in the United States are denominated by the dollar. When the dollar strengthens it becomes that much more difficult for companies to perform in line or better than analyst estimates. Apple's earnings growth is fueled by China. However, the PBOC issued a statement where they will step in if in the event the currency were to weaken even further. Second, the broader US market underperformed relative to what analysts were forecasting. Initially, the expected return for the S&P 500 was 11% to 12%. Unfortunately, the market performed much worse than that, as the year-to-date performance of the S&P 500 was 2.47%. At this point, the bond market had a much better year than what many were anticipating despite the impending rate hike by the Fed. This really messes with CAPM models, as the expected return across broad equities has declined, which correspondingly impacts the expected return of Apple. Despite this challenging environment, there's no denying that Apple grew earnings and revenue considerably. I think that the strength of the iPhone will continue and the valuation is relatively cheap. As you can tell Apple has declined below the 200-day moving average. Generally speaking, market participants perceive this negatively. However, I'm starting to see the volume stabilize and broader market sentiment improve, which is why I believe the stock will eventually recover in the next 12 months. In many cases, stocks move right back above the 200-day moving average, so as long as the fundamentals of the business remain sound. For example, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) was below the 200-day moving average between October 2014 and July 2015. I was covering the stock at the time, and for the most part, the advertising business was underperforming as analysts were having a hard time determining whether or not the company would generate meaningful growth in FY 2015. The company also was facing a potential fine worth $6 billion (which will likely be much less than that). The issue was very temporary as management was able to report sales growth that exceeded expectations and create efficiencies in which operating costs would ramp at a slower rate. The year-to-date performance of Google was 25.2% as a result of strengthening fundamentals. The stock performed a lot better than the S&P 500, which also proves that short-term price action isn't always indicative of long-term returns. Investors should take this into consideration when looking at the recent weakness in Apple's price action as it is somewhat indicative of what will likely happen over the next 12 months. Another chart that comes to mind is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). As you can tell, the stock fell below the 200-day moving average in January of 2015 before recovering later in the year. This action was mostly driven by weakness in PC sales, however, the PC market is expected to recover due to the relatively strong launch of Windows 10, which will correspondingly drive growth in the holiday quarter. Markets tend to be forward looking, so even though Microsoft reported a charge due to goodwill impairment, earnings are expected to recover, which is why the stock is trading back above the 200-day moving average. I illustrate these two prior examples to make a point. So what if Apple fell below the 200-day moving average? It doesn't change the fact that Apple operates a high margin cash cow business. Ongoing share repurchases will move the stock, along with better than expected growth in iPhones and iPads. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation and $136 price target.
