Can Yahoo Survive? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo's share price continues its downward trajectory, having lost nearly 43% of its share price over the course of this year. Bulls argue that now is a good time to buy Yahoo because of its stock buyback plan and potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba. In spite of these factors, Yahoo's share price will likely decline because of bad management, its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba, and lackluster growth in its core business. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is near a 52-week low and continues to trend lower. It started the year trading at $50.66 and is currently at $29.13, a decline of 42.5%. This decline has occurred in spite of the fact that last year it unloaded 140 million shares of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) for an after-tax gain of about $6.3 billion. Yahoo still owns about 384 million shares of Alibaba, or about 15% of it. After experiencing a lackluster year, bulls are now arguing that Yahoo looks attractive because of its stock buyback plan and potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba. Taking a closer look at each of these claims actually highlights the poor situation Yahoo is actually in. In fact, Yahoo's share price will continue to decline because of bad management, its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba, and lackluster growth in its core business. Although Yahoo has already experienced a significant decline, it has not bottomed out yet. The bull case for Yahoo is its stock buyback plan and the potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba. Looking carefully at each of these claims on an individual and collective level actually highlight the numerous problems Yahoo faces. In terms of its share buyback plan, it's important to look at the overall goal of this program and to evaluate how it has fared so far. But before we consider Yahoo's buyback plan, it's worth considering both the positives and negatives of share buyback plans in general. On the positive side, a share buyback plan can be a good way to give confidence to investors that the management team will help support a company's share price. A good buyback plan can be a signal of strength and recognition of the importance of providing shareholder value. On the negative side, a share buyback plan can be a costly endeavor depending on how it is deployed and whether or not it actually provides support for a company's share price. More problematically, it drains money that could otherwise be used to support growth. While many companies successfully employ share buyback plans, this does not appear to be the case with Yahoo. To support this claim, we have to take a look back at the history of Yahoo's share buyback plans. Yahoo has a long history of share repurchase plans . Back in 2001, Yahoo authorized a half-billion dollar share repurchase plan that was completed in March 2005. It then authorized a $3 billion repurchase plan to cover the subsequent five-years. In June 2010, it authorized an additional $3 billion repurchase plan . But here is where it gets interesting. Between June 2010 and December 2011, Yahoo repurchased $2.4 billion in shares. Between January 2012 until November 2013, Yahoo spent $5.3 billion on repurchasing shares and authorized an additional $5 billion to repurchase even more shares. From that point until March of this year, Yahoo repurchased about $4.6 billion in shares and then authorized an additional $2.0 billion buyback plan. This means that since around the end of March, Yahoo has about $2.73 billion to spend on share repurchasing until the end of December 2016. So that means from 2001 until early 2010, Yahoo had authorized $3.5 billion to repurchase shares, the vast majority of which it used. But then between June of 2010 and March 2015, it repurchased $12.3 billion in shares. Since it did not repurchase any shares in Q2 this year, this means that it still has $2.73 billion to spend until December 2016 to support its share price. Taking a broader look at the share repurchase plan, it appears that there are two different phases for Yahoo. The ten-year phase from 2001 - until the middle of 2010 saw $3.5 billion authorized to repurchase shares in a targeted manner with an aim to insure share holder value. But the five years from July 1, 2010 - July 1, 2015 saw $12.3 billion in shares repurchased that has done little to support Yahoo's long-term growth. These recent five-years are what is most relevant and looking at this highlights Yahoo's problems. Before examining this issue further, let us first visualize the numbers and look at a basic chart of its share price to get some idea about the effects of its share repurchase program. On a superficial level, it appears that things have gotten better for Yahoo. Market capitalization nearly doubled in 5-years while the number of shares on the market declined by almost a third. But of course, this is only a snapshot and doesn't tell the whole story. Broader context is also important. In 2010, the stock market was still oversold because of the 2008 financial crisis. Now we've been in a bull market now for the past six-years. In addition, back in 2010 Yahoo's stake in Alibaba was not a major component of its valuation the way it is now. Given this context, evaluating Yahoo's share buyback plan is considerably more complex. Yahoo's market capitalization peaked in November 2014 around $49 billion, being lifted alongside Alibaba. But just as it rose with Alibaba, so too has it fallen. At its current share price, Yahoo's market capitalization sits at around $27.4 billion. But given that Yahoo owns almost 384 million shares of Alibaba and those shares are currently valued at $22.7 billion since it is trading at $59.24, that means that the market currently values Yahoo at on $4.7 billion if we remove its Alibaba holdings. This brings us back to the repurchase plan and evaluating its overall efficacy. Given that most of Yahoo's current market capitalization is based on its holdings of Alibaba shares, this means that the repurchase plan has done little to bolster investor confidence in Yahoo's core holdings or earning potential. This then undercuts the overall value of its repurchase plan and thus supports the case that the last five-years of its repurchase plan have actually hurt the company. Yahoo should not have spent $12.3 billion to repurchase shares and should have instead been investing its resources into new avenues of growth. A more modest repurchase plan - something along what it had done from 2001 - the middle of 2010 - would have been far more appropriate. Since Yahoo has already spent that money, it is more important to evaluate its current share repurchase plan. It now has $2.73 billion available to repurchase shares. But this money will not provide much support to Yahoo's share price. It would be far more prudent to spend this money investing in growth rather than additional stock repurchasing. Looking now more closely at Alibaba, it is clear that the fate of Yahoo is deeply intertwined with Alibaba. However, other than Yahoo's intelligent $1 billion initial investment in Alibaba back in 2005 that gave it 40% control of the company, it has not really managed its holdings in the company all that well. In September 2012, Yahoo completed the sale of half of its holdings in Alibaba back to the company for $7.1 billion, and pocketed about $4.3 billion after taxes. If Yahoo had held onto these share longer, it would have reaped substantially more from the sale of these shares after its IPO. Regardless, if you combine the $4.3 billion it received in 2012 with the $6.3 billion it made on its IPO in 2014, that means Yahoo received a total of $10.6 billion after tax for the 25% of Alibaba that it owned. It received significantly less than it should have for its shares, but at least it still owns 15% of Alibaba. But what to do with the 15% it owns of Alibaba has been a contentious issue. Earlier this month, Yahoo's plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba in order to avoid taxes hit a bump in the road when the IRS said it would not offer tax guidance on its proposed spinoff. If Yahoo had to pay 39% taxes on its holdings of Alibaba, at its current price that would mean it would have to pay almost $8.9 billion in taxes alone. This would still mean that Yahoo would end up making $13.8 billion from selling its stake in Alibaba. Although there remains uncertainty about the possible tax implications from the sale of its holdings in Alibaba, it still has a few other options it could pursue to avoid getting a major tax hit. It could spin-off its core businesses and retain it's Alibaba stake under its main company. This would be cheaper and is estimated that a spin off of its core assets would only cost $1.5 billion. Alternatively, it could do nothing and wait to hear what the IRS ultimately decides. Regardless of what Yahoo decides, the future of the company is tied to Alibaba. While a nearly $14 billion dollar sale of Alibaba would help to recapitalize Yahoo, other longer term issues remain problematic. While the bull case for Yahoo has significant problems upon closer in inspection, the bear case against Yahoo looks stronger ever day. Yahoo's share price will face additional downward pressure because of bad management, its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba, and lackluster growth in its core business. Above all, Yahoo has poor leadership. Its CEO, Marissa Mayer, has done little to help the company and a lot to make things worse. A lengthy piece last year in the NY Times on Mayer's leadership highlights the problems with here leadership style. She is a micromanager who wanted to fundamentally reshape Yahoo along the lines of a start-up. As the article notes: Reared in Google's data-obsessed culture, Mayer tended to require countless tests about user preferences before making an important product decision... Mayer feels the need for her decisions to be supreme and to be data-driven in her leadership. While this has some merits and data awareness has helped Google reach amazing heights, it has been a tough sell given Yahoo's sclerotic organizational culture. Her constant attempts to upend Yahoo's entrenched systems have actually made things worse. As the article notes: Mayer also had a habit of operating on her own time. Every Monday at 3 p.m. Pacific, she asked her direct reports to gather for a three-hour meeting. Mayer demanded all of her staff across the world join the call, so executives from New York, where it was 6 p.m., and Europe, where it was 11 p.m. or later, would dial in, too. Invariably, Mayer herself would be at least 45 minutes late; some calls were so delayed that Yahoo executives in Europe couldn't hang up till after 3 a.m. In theory, Mayer kept up with her direct reports through weekly individual meetings. In practice, she often went weeks without seeing them... Mayer's largest management problem, however, related to the start-up culture she had tried to instill. Early on, she banned working from home...Mayer also favored a system of quarterly performance reviews, or Q.P.R.s, that required every Yahoo employee, on every team, be ranked from 1 to 5. The system was meant to encourage hard work and weed out underperformers, but it soon produced the exact opposite. Because only so many 4s and 5s could be allotted, talented people no longer wanted to work together; strategic goals were sacrificed, as employees did not want to change projects and leave themselves open to a lower score. What this demonstrates is a micromanager completely unaware of how to effectively run a large corporation. It is incredibly difficult to be an effective CEO if you are a micromanager who pushes radical change that ends up backfiring in the long run. This is what has happened with her in charge, as Yahoo's core businesses continue to face serious difficulties and growth remains nonexistent. All the while, Mayer has made working at Yahoo a terrible experience. Another problem with Yahoo is that its valuation is entirely contingent on Alibaba. Alibaba's $105 billion lock-up period has just ended and this means that a lot of shares could be on the open market very soon. Alibaba had a challenging first year and has faced a variety of problems , including lawsuits and broader problems in the Chinese economy. It remains to be seen where Alibaba's share price will go. While Alibaba faces serious challenges a potential downward pressure, it is dangerous for Yahoo's valuation to continue to be so closely tied to Alibaba. A significant sell-off in Alibaba will hurt Yahoo, as has been seen in the past few months. Until Yahoo figures out what to do with its holdings in Alibaba and its share price finally dissociates with Alibaba, investing in Yahoo will inextricably tied to the fate - for good or ill - of Alibaba. Finally, Yahoo's core business lacks growth. While its 35% share of Yahoo Japan is bringing in solid revenue , Yahoo has not seen significant growth in its US assets. In the last quarter, it only saw 5% Y/Y revenue growth, while overall revenue remained flat at $1.04 billion. It also had revenue of $1.04 billion in Q1, a decline of 4.6% Y/Y. In eight of the past ten quarters, net revenue has either declined or remained constant. This contradicts CEO Mayer's promises to get Yahoo growing again. If we look at how the market values Yahoo's core business today, it provides a pessimistic outlook for its future: What this demonstrates is that Yahoo's core U.S. assets are currently valued at $0.2 billion, hence indicating that investors remain pessimistic about Yahoo's long-term ability to grow. The bottom line is that without growth, Yahoo's core business will continue to struggle to compete against competitors like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and will hurt its share price. While Yahoo has the potential to turn thing around depending on how it deals with its remaining shares of Alibaba, its core business is flailing. In spite of a massive five-year share buyback plan, this has not significantly helped Yahoo's share price or jump start its business. Investors remain very skeptical about Yahoo's value and with good reason. Although Yahoo is cheaper than it has been in quite some time, it remains an unattractive company. It's very survival is at stake because of poor management, its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba, and lackluster growth in its core business. Without significant changes in the near future, Yahoo's long-term viability remains questionable at best. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
