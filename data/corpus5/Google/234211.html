Apple: Sifting iPhone Sales Data - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The limited data available for iPhone sales for the December quarter is mixed. I see reasons to be optimistic about iPhone in recent Fiksu data. As we proceed through the December quarter Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investors are understandably a little antsy about iPhone sales. So much depends on how well iPhone does, and the comps with last year could prove difficult. In this article, I give my assessment of the data currently available for this quarter. Originally I intended this article to be a straightforward rebuttal to SA contributor Michael Blair's most recent bearish take on Apple, focusing on iPhone sales for the December quarter. It turned out to be not quite so straightforward. In the article, Mr. Blair uses data from mobile marketing firm Fiksu to arrive at the conclusion that iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales are slower than last year's sales of the 6 and 6 Plus for the same amount of time after launch - 47 days. His data is based on a chart made available on an interesting Fiksu page that has a lot of information on iOS devices. The problem with trying to conclude anything from the Fiksu data is that it's all presented in terms of percentage of the active devices that are using Fiksu client apps. If we assume that's representative of the overall iPhone population (the number of iPhones in use), there's still the problem of figuring out what the current population is in order to arrive at a specific number for unit sales of the various iPhone models. Mr. Blair handles this by providing "guesstimates" of the iPhone populations as of the 2014 iPhone 6 launch (400 million) and iPhone 6s launch (500 million). I was immediately a little suspicious of Blair's population values since Apple sold a total of 231.2 million iPhones in the interval from the end of calendar 2014 Q3 to the end of calendar 2015 Q3. I therefore expected the y/y increase to be greater than 100 million. The problem of determining how many iPhones or Android phones are in actual use rather than just cumulative sales is very difficult. For instance, another chart that Blair shows from Statista almost certainly overstates the Android smartphone population as of the end of 2014. At Google's September event , CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the total number of Android device (including smartphones and tablets) "30 day active users" was 1.4 billion. So it seems unlikely that the total number of Android smartphones in use as of the end of 2014 could have been 200 million greater than the number Pichai quoted. This is just to show that this is a difficult question to answer accurately. I believe Google and Apple know with the greatest accuracy how many users they have (so I believe Pichai's statement), and I wish Apple would make a similar announcement. Lacking such guidance from Apple, any estimate of device population is necessarily a "guesstimate". But I decided to try to arrive at my own estimate. I have a spreadsheet that tabulates all iPhone sales from Apple's quarterly reports going back to the initial iPhone release. To arrive at a population estimate, I somewhat arbitrarily exclude iPhones too old to be compatible with the iOS version in use before the release of the newest iPhone. Up to the 2014 Q3 release of iPhone 6, iOS 7 was the most current version, and iPhone 4 was still compatible. So the estimate of current population, as of 2014 Q3, excludes iPhone models before the iP4. Applying a 20% attrition rate yields an iPhone population as of calendar 2014 Q3 of 424.8 million. Applying a similar logic for the 2014 Q3 release of the iPhone 6s excludes all iPhone models before the 4s, and yields a population estimate of 540.6 million. Applying the Fiksu percentages yields the following sales estimates summarized in the table below, which also shows Blair's estimates. Even though my numbers came out roughly the same as Michael Blair's, there's so much uncertainty in the estimation process that I don't think investors should be overly concerned. For one thing, the Fiksu data shown above only covers sales performance of new models from time of launch. It doesn't say anything about continuing sales of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. I expect the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales this season to be larger than for older generations in the past because they are larger screen iPhones that have most of the features of the latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but are heavily discounted. This may serve to explain the statement by Tim Cook during the September quarter conference call that iPhone 6 was the number one smartphone (by model) in Mainland China. Not the iPhone 6s, despite the fact that Mainland China was included in the initial iPhone 6s/6s Plus release. Fiksu has some data to support this, at least qualitatively, in another chart on the same page, the iPhone Usage Monitor, which shows the percent of the total population of iPhones for each model going back to iPhone 4. Note that the percentage of iPhone 6 devices in use stays almost constant from the time of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus release. This is probably an indicator of continuing strong sales of iPhone 6/6 Plus after being discounted. To maintain the constant usage percentage, sales of iP6/6 Plus actually need to accelerate in order to keep up with iPhone 6s/6s Plus sales. I believe that sales of iPhone 6/6 Plus will more than take up any slack in iP6s/6s Plus sales, especially among value-conscious consumers in China, where Apple saw nearly 100% y/y revenue growth in calendar Q3. There isn't much else for investors to base expectations on for iPhone sales in the December quarter. There's the rather pessimistic estimate of 70-75 million iPhone sales by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. And there's the Credit Suisse report of November 10 that iPhone component orders are down 10%. Down 10% compared to what, exactly? Last year, last quarter, last week? Who knows? But whatever the order decline, it doesn't even bear on sales for the December quarter, since the iPhones that will be sold this quarter have already been produced. But Credit Suisse saw fit to lower their EPS estimate for the entirety of fiscal 2016 by 6%, despite the fact that we don't even have results from fiscal Q1. Given how inaccurate and misleading supply chain reports have been in the past, this is not what I consider data-driven analysis. I commend Michael Blair for taking a data-driven approach in his analysis. It's the right way for the bears and bulls on any given stock to engage in constructive dialog. But certainly I don't agree with his fundamental outlook. I'm still long Apple, he's still short. And, I suspect, never the twain shall meet. I see reasons to be more optimistic about Apple's December results, despite Kuo's estimate and the Credit Suisse report. Based on the Fiksu data (all the data, not just what Blair focuses on), I'm confident that Apple will exceed last year's iPhone sales figures by at least a few percent. Combined with improving sales of Apple Watch and the newly released iPad Pro and Apple TV, I'm confident that overall revenue growth will exceed the top end of Apple's guidance. Under the circumstances, I now consider Apple a Buy. I believe investors will be pleasantly surprised when Apple reports the December quarter results, and investors should position themselves to take advantage of this.
