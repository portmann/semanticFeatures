Apple Needs To Bring Its Cash Home: The Sooner The Better - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha While there's no denying Apple sits on a lot of cash, the bulk of the cash isn't doing much for shareholders. The value of the cash will be mitigated by tax deferred liabilities, F/X impact, and operational dis-synergies. The cash needs to be brought home to sustain product development as evidenced by the divergence in headcount-to-free cash flow growth. Furthermore, a larger scale buyback, even with the U.S. tax penalty, is more accretive to the stock than leaving it overseas. In the past couple months, there's no denying that I've been a lot more bearish with regards to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Furthermore, the primary justification for buying Apple seems to be the valuation, which is a highly debatable topic. As many of you already know, valuation is all relative. The ex-cash P/E assumptions by many within the buy-side community seem inflated due to the deferred tax assumptions and the indefinite reinvestment of cash generated outside of the United States. This puts a ceiling on the cash usage for share buybacks and dividends, so while FCF metrics remain strong it's worth noting that a substantial chunk of that cash is inaccessible unless there's a substantial change in the regulatory framework of the U.S. tax code. Given the heightened competitive environment and currency dynamics, the management team needs to repatriate some of the cash due to the heightening cost of currency hedges and the lack of investment use in overseas markets. According to Apple's 2015 Annual Report: The Company's effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. The effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was relatively flat. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $7.8 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. Since 60%+ of Apple's cash generation comes from overseas, the long-term funding of buybacks and dividends will have a low ceiling and will come primarily from cash generation within the United States. In the next fiscal year, U.S. earnings will diverge from rest of world, which is why I'm dubious of a higher buyback authorization. While cash generation abroad will help to sustain the top line growth rate, the corporate level earnings are not equally distributed for shareholder use. The deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion will eventually take a sizable chunk out of the foreign cash position, and the indefinite classification of earnings set for permanent reinvestment outside of the United States limits the usefulness of cash. M&A opportunities outside of the United States are extremely limited as VC-backed firms are primarily located within the United States. Tim Cook doesn't routinely pursue acquisitions and likes to develop businesses organically. Therefore, immediate accretion to topline seems unlikely, which limits the value of cash sitting abroad. Not only are the investment use cases weaker, foreign tax rates will likely adjust higher. The best software and hardware engineers live within America along the western corridor of the United States. Gaining a greater foothold on qualified engineering talent should be given higher priority. The firms that can amass the highest amount of qualified talent can stay in the game longer due to the scale and creativity of the labor base. Firms within the tech space expend a lot of resources on hiring and retaining talent due to the high cost of turnover and the pressure to remain competitive. Apple is obviously competitive, but the incremental cash generation overseas doesn't really have a 1:1 impact on operational efficiency. Apple's FCF grew by 132% whereas the labor headcount increased by 73.78% over the past five years. Apple stressese efficiency, but as you all know, there's strength in numbers. Ask Germany how things went on the Russian front in World War 2. Russia had the bigger army and rolled over Germany in tank warfare once weather conditions changed circa 1942 to 1943. Likewise, I view Apple through that lens. Not enough manpower to sustain its own blitzkrieg offense through the tech vertical. Apple has developed large markets for itself across smartphone, tablet, PC, and software. However, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) are quick to copy and implement some of Apple's strategies whenever possible. If there's any tech story worth remembering, it's Apple's. With a unified coalition of tech giants forming along Apple's battle lines, the company needs to double down on investment. Bragging about efficiency and the value of its brand will only carry the company so far. It needs to find a productive use for all of its cash. Apple's response has been strong, but from where I stand, investment into its head count should have matched FCF growth. Microsoft is firing back with a unified OS ecosystem, Surface and 2-in-1s. Google owns five of the 10 most valuable mobile apps, and has the most mobile OS market share. Samsung can't develop its own mobile ecosystem unless Google decides to support that new platform (which they won't). So, it's Samsung and Google versus Apple, while Microsoft is building its own ecosystem away from the remaining two companies. In the case of Apple, there are threats everywhere. The tech space is dynamic with war being waged on three major fronts. It boils down to Apple versus Microsoft + Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) (Wintel alliance) versus Google + Samsung (Goog-Sung alliance). Apple is operating at less than half of its potential operating efficiency. The company will need to bring its cash home to leverage its assets abroad, and I'm not sure if Apple's CEO will eat the tax expense. The company should emphasize operational efficiency over corporate tax accounting. While I admire the CEO of Apple, I can imagine a repeat of board level thinking steering the Apple ship in the wrong direction. If anything, Tim will need to convince the board of directors to bring some of the cash back prematurely to sustain investment into new products. Holding out for a tax holiday is a passive strategy that relies on favorable externalities that may never materialize. According to Apple's 2015 annual report, Apple held $186.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents in foreign accounts. The vast majority of the cash and cash equivalents were dollar-denominated. I anticipate Apple will need to pay an incremental tax of 10% to 15% to bring the cash home. The $18.69 billion to $28 billion tax expense leaves $163.5 billion or so (when averaging for both scenarios). This leaves Apple in a position to acquire 16 mid cap companies (at an average valuation of $10 billion) or 82 small cap companies (at an average valuation of $2 billion). Alternatively, Apple could use the cash to buy back 1.5 billion shares which would lower the total share outstanding to 4 billion to 4.1 billion assuming a cost basis of $108 per share. At this point, Apple might as well increase its R&D to $15 billion from the current $8 billion, which will mitigate some profitability. However, nearly doubling R&D and returning the cash in the form of buybacks or expanding the business through acquisitions will address bottom line growth substantially better. There's $56.5 billion left on the current share buyback authorization, so if I were to combine that with $163.5 billion (from foreign assets), Apple could pursue an accelerated buyback program of $220 billion. The $220 billion would reduce share count by 2.037 billion shares if the share price were to remain stagnant. The company could then use next year earnings to double the size of its R&D team. This would result in earnings growth for next year despite heightened OpEX. It would also reassert Apple's competitive strength in consumer electronics. Assuming Apple were to execute on an accelerated buyback that reduces share count by 2 billion shares and increases OpEx by $7 billion, I model EPS of $12.06 and a $157.40 price target. The company would experience immediate shareholder accretion despite the heightened tax expense. In other words, Apple looks penny wise but pound foolish. With higher foreign taxes a guaranteed certainty, better use cases for the cash materializing, and F/X volatility mitigating foreign asset values; Apple might as well bring the cash home. I continue to reiterate my sell rating and $103.50 price target. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
