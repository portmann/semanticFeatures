Verizon And AT&T: Big Dividends, New Risks And Yahoo - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha Verizon and AT&T are big dividend telecom stocks with a reputation for safety, but they are exposing themselves to new risks as their business models evolve. If Verizon or AT&T were to acquire Yahoo, they would cut its costs to the bone, and use its future free cash flows to feed their big dividends. Verizon and AT&T shareholders should be aware of potential dividend policy changes and price return differences as the companies take on new risks. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) are big dividend telecom stocks with a reputation for safety. Many investors own them specifically for their high dividend yields (4.4% and 5.2%, respectively) and their low betas (0.2 and 0.3, respectively, according to Google Finance ). However, both companies are being forced to deal with the same fundamental challenge: declining wireline business and dwindling wireless growth. The companies are dealing with the challenge differently, but the result is the same: more long-term risk. We consider whether a Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) acquisition makes sense for either company, and also address two big questions for shareholders: 1) How will "more long-term risk" impact price appreciation for Verizon and AT&T, and 2) how will it impact the dividends? It is increasingly challenging for Verizon and AT&T to generate profits in traditional telecom businesses (e.g. wireline and wireless). For example, according to Verizon's most recent annual report (p.3): New entrants are disrupting the wireless and broadband space. Competition is putting pressure on prices and margins... this suggests to investors that growth will be more challenging going forward. And according to AT&T's most recent annual report (p.24): Wireline… will face continued competitive pressure… from multiple providers, including wireless, cable and other VoIP providers, interexchange carriers and resellers. In addition, the desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, and lingering economic pressures are continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional local wireline service and use our or competitors' wireless and Internet-based services. Despite the growing telecom industry challenges, both companies are determined to maintain their big dividend payments. And as a result, they're adopting less traditional strategies. For example, Verizon recently ventured outside its traditional telecom business to acquire global mass media company, AOL for $4.4 billion. Similarly, AT&T ventured outside traditional telecom to acquire satellite service provider DirecTV for $48.5 billion (you can read more on our views of this acquisition here ). Additionally, AT&T recently acquired two cell companies outside of the US (in Mexico). We believe all of these acquisitions will help Verizon and AT&T generate more free cash flow from which to pay their dividends. However, they also introduce new risks that shareholders should be aware of (more on the risks later). In addition to the acquisitions described above, Verizon and AT&T may also be interested in acquiring Yahoo. The main reason for the potential acquisition would be to help Verizon or AT&T feed their big dividend payments. To do that, Yahoo's spending would immediately be cut to the bone if acquired by Verizon or AT&T. Specifically, the cultures are very different at these organizations, and both Verizon and AT&T would quickly change Yahoo's growth-oriented strategy to a value-oriented strategy. For example, this means far less spending on research and development and cutting out every unnecessary cost possible. Instead of focusing on big future growth, Verizon and AT&T would look to use the majority of Yahoo's future free cash flows to fund the big dividend payments that their shareholders love. Verizon and AT&T would likely avoid using cash to acquire Yahoo (because they want to preserve cash for dividend payments) and instead use debt and equity (much like the deal AT&T did for DirecTV). This type of deal (debt and equity instead of cash) is easier (cheaper) when the company being acquired has very low debt, like Yahoo (Yahoo's debt to assets ratio is only around 3%). Also important, Yahoo does not currently pay a dividend. This makes the company even more attractive to high-dividend payers like Verizon and AT&T because it will reduce the aggregate dividend payout ratio (as a percent of free cash flows) for the new combined company. This is important to Verizon and AT&T because their dividend payout ratios are already fairly high (as the following charts show) and they'll likely get even higher as traditional wireline and wireless businesses continue to face challenges. Worth noting, AT&T's dividend payout ratio was approaching 100% in 2014 before the company made its big DirecTV acquisition. The DirecTV acquisition caused AT&T's ratio to drop in 2015 for the same reason a Yahoo acquisition would cause the ratio to drop, as described previously. And based on Verizon's steadily climbing payout ratio (see chart above), we believe Yahoo would be a more valuable acquisition to Verizon than it would be to AT&T (i.e. Verizon more urgently needs to address its payout ratio than does AT&T). Also worth noting, Verizon and AT&T are not the only companies interested in Yahoo. For example, the Wall Street Journal reports that private equity firm TPG has expressed an interest in Yahoo over the last few months. A private equity acquisition would probably be a better deal for Yahoo shareholders (than a Verizon or AT&T acquisition) because the private equity firm would likely have a more optimistic vision for Yahoo's future whereby they'd cut costs and then try to resurrect growth. Verizon and AT&T, on the other hand, would likely just cut Yahoo's costs to the bone and turn it into a value company instead of focusing on a return to big growth. The fundamental risk profiles of both AT&T and Verizon are changing as the companies are forced to take on new risks just to maintain their high dividends. For example, the companies they are acquiring (e.g. AOL, DirecTV) are more volatile and have higher betas than the traditional telecom businesses of AT&T and Verizon. Further, AT&T's acquisition of Mexican cell companies increases foreign currency risk and volatility. And if one of the companies purchases Yahoo, then that too will increase volatility and risk (Yahoo is much more volatile than Verizon and AT&T). Another risk that Verizon and AT&T face as they continue to invest in new types of businesses, is that they may end up losing their status as a "fixed income proxy." Specifically, many investors have flocked to AT&T and Verizon over the last decade as interest rates have fallen so low. The historical low volatility and high dividend payments of telecom companies have been particularly attractive to income-oriented investors that might have previously purchased bonds. However, AT&T and Verizon are likely increasing their future volatility by investing in riskier businesses. The good news is that they still have a lot of low volatility telecom (wireless/wireline) revenues, and interest rates are likely to continue to stay low for quite some time. In a related point, Verizon and AT&T may eventually lose their status as a "safe haven" investment if they continue to pursue new strategies. Just as many investors pile into US treasuries when volatility picks up, so too do they pile into AT&T and Verizon. For example, as volatility has increased and the market has declined so far in 2016, AT&T and Verizon have performed well because many investors purchased them as a risk-off safety play. However, if the companies continue to purchase higher-risk, non-telecom companies then they may eventually lose their status as a safe-haven investment. As the following chart shows, Verizon and AT&T have a history of healthy dividends and dividend increases. They understand that investors invest for the dividends, and the companies won't ever cut unless there is truly no other option because they don't want to violate shareholder trust. However, the evolving business strategies have increased risk. We believe the chance of a dividend cut for either company within the next few years is still remote, but it has increased. For example, if DirecTV turns out to be a flop then AT&T will be back in the same predicament it was in 2014 (i.e. running out of free cash flows from which to pay dividends). Similarly, if Verizon's dividend payout ratio (as a percent of free cash flow) continues to increase then so too does the risk of a cut. Much more likely than a dividend cut is the possibility of smaller (or nonexistent) dividend increases in the future. If the companies' new business strategies demand more cash or involve more volatility then management will be hesitant to increase the dividend meaningfully because they'll want to play it safe and preserve cash simply to maintain the dividend payment. We believe this is a real risk that investors should consider as the companies' business strategies continue to evolve. We believe Verizon and AT&T's new inorganic growth acquisitions (e.g. DirecTV, AOL, possibly Yahoo) run the risk of being simply a "kick the can down the road" strategy whereby they purchase a business with un-compelling long-term prospects because they provide a short-term bump to free cash flows and help maintain the dividend payments. The jury is still out with the DirecTV acquisition (because it is still relatively recent), and the success of a potential Yahoo acquisition by either company depends on whether the purchase can be made at a cheap enough discount price. Remember, if Yahoo had such great future prospects then it wouldn't be up for sale in the first place. The dividends at Verizon and AT&T are still safe for the time being, but the total risk-to-return profiles are evolving. Specifically, future stock price volatility may be higher (and dividend increases lower) than shareholders are used to because the business strategies are increasingly risky. Further, both companies run the risk of overpaying for acquisitions because they're pressured to focus on shorter-term free cash flow needs (i.e. maintaining the big dividends) instead of long-term value. And if Verizon and AT&T want to maintain their long-term reputation for being big safe dividend growers, they may eventually need to find a better strategy than simply acquiring and managing businesses with shrinking growth.
