Apple's Search Opportunity - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has developed a critical element of a full fledged web search engine. Apple may gradually develop a search capability to rival Google. Recent reports that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is expanding its web search capability point to a significant opportunity for Apple to reinvent the search experience for its customers. Not needing the revenue stream, Apple could provide ad free searches. This would deny competitors such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) a significant revenue stream that draws on the wealth of the iOS ecosystem. Lately we've been hearing more details about Applebot , Apple's in-house web crawler. Bots such as Googlebot and Applebot play a crucial role in search engines. Bots "crawl" or visit numerous web pages, cataloging their contents into the search engine's database. When you submit a search term to Google or Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Bing, what is actually searched is the database constructed by the bots, rather than the web itself. This is the trick behind fast web searches. That Apple even had its own bot was only discovered last November . Since then, more pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place. Apple's purchase of Topsy, the social media analytics firm, in 2013 now appears to have been geared towards bolstering Apple's search capability . Apple currently offers limited web search capability through Spotlight in OS X and iOS, but Spotlight is mainly geared towards helping users find files on their devices. With the latest version, Spotlight now offers "suggestions" that can include web pages. This doesn't make Spotlight in any way a viable competitor to Google or even Bing, but it does indicate that this is an active area of interest. Google is currently the default search engine for Apple's Safari in both the Mac OS and iOS versions. This is due to expire this year, leaving the door open for an Apple solution. Apple also appears to be on something of a hiring binge for software engineers to work on search. But if Apple is still trying to fill positions for its search team, this suggests that the work isn't far enough along to slam the door on Google. I would not expect Apple's search capability to be the equal of Google's any time soon, so Google's contract will probably be renewed in some form. This is not about kicking Google to the curb this year, or even the next. This would be a long-term strategic move by Apple that might take something like five years to pay off. Doing search well is a huge undertaking requiring massive resources and manpower. After all, Microsoft has been at it for years, and what do they have to show for it? A 20% search share in the U.S. and a search engine that is still inferior to Google's. The very magnitude of the undertaking makes it appropriate for Apple. Apple has the cash to add server infrastructure as needed, and with the recent announcements of new data centers in Europe , can take advantage of some of its off-shore cash. Apple also has a motivation that goes beyond the revenue stream. For years, Google's search and advertising empire has profited from the iOS ecosystem, perhaps even more than from Android. Google recently revealed that in the U.S., Japan and in 8 other countries, mobile devices account for more than half of all searches. Google has never specified how much revenue was derived from the respective mobile device ecosystems, but for Google it's all good. It all gets thrown onto the cash pile that Google then uses for things like the Motorola purchase and Android development. That Apple is in effect subsidizing Google's competitive ventures must rankle just a little. With search, Apple has the opportunity to do something that is often the focus of its product development: fundamentally improve the user experience. What better way to improve the search experience than to ditch advertising? I'm sure there are some who will claim that paid product placement in search results enhances the search experience. Perhaps, but my view is that advertising is just one of the aspects of our mobile life that we've become so desensitized to, that we don't realize how obnoxious it is. At least, we don't realize it until it's absent. Apple is in a position that it doesn't need the advertising revenue. Search can become just another value added service of the Apple ecosystems, helping to improve user experience and user retention. Apple has for some time adopted the model that ecosystem support costs in terms of services and software upgrades are paid up front in the purchase price of Apple's hardware products. Search fits right into this. At Apple's World Wide Developer Conference in June, Apple has promised many exciting new iOS and Mac OS technologies. Okay, it always promises that. But one of those could very well be an enhanced Spotlight search capability. One of the important ways Spotlight could be enhanced is if Spotlight APIs are made available to iOS developers. Spotlight APIs allow Mac OS X apps to access spotlight search, and to make the app's files searchable from Spotlight. No equivalent APIs exist for iOS apps. Partly this is because Apple has deliberately discouraged app developers from involving users in file management. With iOS 8 that started to change, and Spotlight search is a feature of iOS 8. It's starting to look likely that Apple will roll out a new enhanced Spotlight, with a suite of APIs for iOS at WWDC. If Apple does that at WWDC, it means it really is going after search. And if Apple goes after search, it will do it in a way that makes it fundamentally better. I look for Bing, which has always been the weak sister of search, to be the first major casualty. But even Google could see its growth eventually curbed. Disclosure: The author is long AAPL. (More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.
