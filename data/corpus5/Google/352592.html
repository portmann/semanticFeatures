The Fitbit Sell-Off Is A Great Buying Opportunity - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha We bought in after the recent sell-off that sent shares down 7%. Millennials' dedication to fitness and technology is the perfect mix for the company to profit from. With no new Apple Watch announced last week, we feel consumers which were holding out with head to Fitbit now. The companyâ€™s diverse product assortment gives it an edge and we expect to see strong sales figures this year. We expect Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) sales to pick up in the next couple of quarters making the recent sell-off that dragged the share price down 7% an incredible buying opportunity in our opinion. We expect a health and wellness boom, rises in disposable income, and millennial dedication to technology to be the catalysts for this. We have been holding off buying a Fitbit for a little while now because we were hopeful of a new Apple Watch being released by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The Apple Watch is a great piece of technology that we are really fond of, and superior to anything in the market in our opinion, but having not bought one on release we are somewhat reluctant to buy one now lest it become outdated by a new release later this year or next. We fall in the camp of consumers that don't need all its many features and are mainly interested in fitness and health tracking. When Apple announced a drop in the price of the Apple Watch it wasn't what we were hoping for, so we headed out to the shops to get a Fitbit. We're just not that interested in buying the latest Apple Watch model, but will gladly look at buying the new version when it does eventually get released. We don't think we are alone in this. Health and wellness has been on an incredible rise around the world as people begin to really take care of themselves. You only need to look at the success of companies such as Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ), Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) to see how those in the space are benefiting. We expect many of those who wish to track their health and fitness will opt for one of Fitbit's many offerings from now on until the new Apple Watch arrives. Analysts are expecting revenue to come in at $432.34 million for the current quarter which ends in a couple of days. While we feel there could be a surprise in this quarter, we are more bullish on the next quarter. We think this would be the quarter where the company can start to win those consumers, like ourselves, which have been sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what is going to be released. The key here is the weather. The spring equinox has just been and this now means we are heading toward the warmer months in the northern hemisphere. In our experience it is about this time of the year when people start thinking about losing those extra holiday pounds and getting in shape for summer. We believe that consumers are very interested in tracking their fitness. When you see the progress you are making it can be a real encouragement. As Fitbit covers price points from entry-level all the way up to premium, we feel they are positioned well to benefit. The Fitbit Alta is a great starting point for consumers looking at getting started. This new release is priced at $129, is aesthetically pleasing, tracks fitness and sleep, and even gives you text and call alerts. We purchased a Fitbit Alta, and have been very pleased with it. We think that with disposable income levels rising this sort of purchase is an easy one to make. The much-documented love of fitness and technology that millennials have could prove to be massive boost to the future prospects of Fitbit. When the new Apple Watch does come out, it could cause a drop in sales for a little while. Thankfully, though, we see the varied price points as a great tool to potentially combat this. What we might find is that sales drop off at the premium end of Fitbit's range for a little while, but the entry-level should hopefully remain strong. As you can see above, Google Trends shows an increase in search for Fitbit since the back end of 2015. It has trended down recently, but if March bounces up (partial data shown) then it could be a sign that there is still strong demand from consumers. As you can see on the chart above the company has lost over half of its market value year-to-date. We believe that the most recent sell-off has created a great buying opportunity that investors should snap up. We value the stock at 1.5 times sales. This is a much lower level that the 1.75 times sales that the stock has traded at on average in the past, but we feel it is best to be conservative with Fitbit considering the negative market sentiment that seems to envelop the company. For fiscal 2016 we forecast Fitbit to produce revenue of $2.51 billion. At 1.5 times sales and with an estimated 245 million shares outstanding, this gives us a target price of $15.37. The stock last traded at $13.55, which means this is upside of 13.4%. Overall, we are confident that the company is positioned well to benefit from the factors mentioned above. Times may have been hard for shareholders recently, but we feel the sell-off was overdone and there should be plenty of upside up ahead for investors.
