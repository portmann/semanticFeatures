I'm Doubling Down On Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha I polled the SA audience on why they're long in FB and got an exceptional number of positive responses. User growth, a vibrant ad platform, and future ancillary revenue streams led the conversation. The remaining concerns are relevancy and a high valuation relative to competitors. I polled the Seeking Alpha comment board last time around on why individuals chose to be long in Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and one thing became blatantly clear: there is no alternative to Facebook. No tech company has the user base, the expansion potential, or the profitability that Facebook has and that's where the relevancy concerns get diminished rather quickly. Now, I was itching to pick up more shares of this company earlier last week, but was waiting for just the right time. Today (Tuesday) is perhaps the best day in a long-time, considering the stock's retraction Monday, and I'm buying in because I believe in their expansion potential, multiple ancillary streams, and I even believe their high valuation is justified. Since I last wrote about the company on September 13, I've seen a lot of unwanted volatility. I saw a brief rise in my shares before the plummet yesterday, but this is a stock I'm about to have for the long-term. I'd honestly argue that selling now is a horrible mistake. Below, you can see the YTD performance of Facebook, and notice the difficult trading that August and September have given us. Before fully delving into my opinion on the significance behind their growth catalysts, it's worth noting that 52% of total revenue now comes from outside the United States, making these markets ever so crucial. For example, the initial statistics reported out of Africa were quite good, but also leaves a lot of room to run. The keys for Africa right now are Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. If Facebook can start expanding to a fourth and fifth country by the end of Q4 2015, I'd say they're moving at an incredibly quick pace. The stats, as of now: I'd say growth targets would be to push Kenya to 5 million, push Nigeria to 10, and South Africa to 15. Again, if we can see that by Q4, then the stock should adjust nicely. Some very notable catalysts are beckoning me to invest more: Autoplay video in the News Feed now with the personalization key: Suggested Videos 360 video is a huge catalyst, especially when we think about VR as a new market; I played with the Star Wars video that was on my timeline and I actually felt it had a value-added component. The Oculus Rift will soon be priced and available to consumers (est. Spring 2016) and will add a nice boost to the top-line (estimates vary widely and are highly dependent upon the price point; however, I'm led to believe that this could potentially be a multi-billion dollar annual revenue stream). Instagram just passed the 400 million MAU mark, which is better than Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) 316 million altogether. The app is expected to generate over $2 billion in revenue in the next year alone; furthermore, the ad revenue is extending to thirty new countries, several of which are emerging markets. The Gear VR was just priced at $99 in partnership with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ); this is an excellent transition for Facebook into the VR market When WhatsApp gets monetized, 900 million users will now become profitable for Facebook; the user base has increased 11% since September. Understand that this is billions in potential revenue in future years. In the same scenario, when Messenger becomes monetized, capturing profitability from its incredibly high MAUs is going to be quite simple - this is arguably a very undervalued area of Facebook to the investing community Facebook also threw a large majority of investors for a twist yesterday with new tools for advertisers to use on mobile devices, rather than on televisions. The reality is that the 2.5 million (and growing) active advertisers on Facebook can have their ads specifically tailored to suit the individual user's interest better than a generic television ad can - I personally believe the shift is already underway and that large TV advertisers are going to need to have a fully mobile ad platform to capture larger amounts of consumers Now, m-commerce is going to grow at a rate of 32% by the end of this year, and if we take this to be the case, all we can realistically think about for Facebook is potential - potential to capture a large piece of this market now that instant buying is a reality on the network. Even if MAUs and DAUs grow at a slower rate for the social network, this opens up an entirely new area to surge into. Another kicker? China accounts for 15.9% of all m-commerce transactions, so furthering the push into this demographic is vital for Facebook. This is excellent considering Facebook reported 496 MAUs from the Asia-Pacific segment in Q2. Granted, pushing into China means heavier competition from players like Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ), as well as dealing with the various restriction currently placed on the site in China. Yet, advertising revenue in the Asia-Pacific segment for Q2 stood at $605 million and ARPU was at an all-time high at $1.29. There's been concerns about the relatively high P/E of the company. Resting at ~90, with a PEG of 1.54, investors have every right to be scared. Below is the comparison to competitors: OCF: $89.98 million in Q2, FCF: -$2.63 million in Q2 *It's worth noting that OCF and FCF for Twitter have experienced wide fluctuations in the last several quarters and are not stable We've yet to see positive EPS from Twitter, giving them an unavailable P/E. That company is also lagging on its MAU targets, as noted earlier. Transitioning, Google is about to have its mobile ad revenue succeeded by Instagram, and while Microsoft looks like the most attractive out of their group, their LT debt is up nearly $9 billion in the last six months and is creating a heavy burden on the company. Microsoft, to me, is synonymous with maturity and while their company has provided an excellent history of good returns, Facebook is the cataclysmic brainchild of the Silicon Valley that is going to outpace Microsoft's first decade of returns on a comparable basis. Facebook has had increasing OCF the last four quarters, up from $1.25 billion to now $1.88 billion. In the same time frame, the company has gone from $766 million in FCF to now $1.33 billion. Nearly doubling FCF in just four quarters is quite impressive and is really going to enable them to continue making acquisitions and fund a growing Capex to support expansion. Why is this so important? Think about the end game - adding more revenue streams, i.e. WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus. Capex has increased roughly $67 million since end of Q3 last year, and they're on track to remain within the $2.5-3 billion budget. I've heard a few minor concerns with the company's ability to grow EPS, as well as revenue per user. Last Q3, the company posted EPS of $0.31, with Q4 and Q1 being notably lower at $0.25 and $0.18, respectively; however, last quarter they recovered to $0.26. Now, estimates are varying widely on what next quarter EPS will look like, but in my research and understanding, I fully believe an EPS above $0.30 is likely. There are very few reasons, in my opinion, not to double down on Facebook. I don't believe there is an alternative to being long in Facebook and I don't believe this is a short-term position. I'll pose a different question this time around to the comment board - if you're short in the stock, why are you betting against Facebook?
