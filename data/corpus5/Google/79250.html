Apple: Is The WWDC The Catalyst To Break The Stock Above $133? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Since last year's WWDC, Apple stock has soared 50% from a split-adjusted price of around $90 to its recent 52-week high of $134.54. After the WWDC, will AAPL stock finally break above its resistance level at $133, which has served like a fortress for the past three months? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference Monday in San Francisco. And aside from rumors related to possible hardware and software unveiling, the question I'm most interested in is, "Will AAPL stock finally break above its resistance level at $133 which has served like a fortress for the past three months?" Note, I own AAPL stock and I trade a block of shares whenever it suits me. Can AAPL stock finally break free ? Yes, it can. Note, I'm not saying it will. After getting my butt kicked by the market last month, I'm done making predictions - for now. I'm not expecting any new hardware announcements Monday. Software - particularly iOS 9 - is where the action will be. There will likely be a revamped OS X operating system for the new line of Macs. But the real star of the show will be what Apple finally unveils for its move into on-demand music and the realm of radio streaming. To what extent can Apple, which picked off Beats last year, take share from Spotify and put the proverbial nail in Pandora's (NYSE: P ) coffin? Will just announcing an updated Beats platform be enough? I don't think so - not unless Apple (at the same time) figures out a way to include video into the platform, allowing it to (at the same time) take a bite out of YouTube. Not to mention, that's the direction Spotify is heading in. And here's the thing, with iPhones and iPads accounting for 82% of mobile video views, it makes sense for Apple to want to distribute that content, right? Apple is already leading the race for digital supremacy. Avoiding it any further doesn't make sense. So take that as my only prediction for Monday. Aside from music and radio, I'm expecting a mix of video in the new Beats package - whatever it's going to be called. Next, if you've read the news blogs, Apple has likely scratched any mention of the television service. "It's not ready for prime time," says the headlines. Forever the perfectionist, I don't have a problem with Apple's decision; assuming the reports are credible. But any news regarding the Apple Watch, especially year-to-date sales figures (or projections) will send AAPL stock materially higher. AAPL stock closed Friday at $128.65, down 0.55%, translating to a down week of 1.25%. But the market is all relative. The shares are still up 16.55% on the year, dominating the broader averages. And you would think AAPL stock was the worst performer of the Dow, given how gloomy many Apple shareholders have been recently. Read the comments on my articles here , here and here . Granted, AAPL stock has been a relative disappointment - that's if you've 'only' watched it for the past three months. But expand that horizon by one year and the shares are up some 40%, crushing the major indexes. Why is that important? It's been a year since Apple's last Worldwide Developers Conference, three months prior to Apple launching the best-selling smartphones of all time in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. My point is, it was precisely at last June's Worldwide Developers Conference when the narrative about Apple changed. Innovation was back. Growth had returned, facilitating the commensurate demise of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and the recent struggles seen in Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ); and neither company has yet to fully recover. What has AAPL stock done during the span? How about soaring 50% from a split-adjusted price of around $90 to its recent 52-week high of $134.54. And there is evidence to suggest that Apple - following its WWDC event - will heighten the pressure on its competitors, while at the same time sending its shares towards new heights. Just don't ask me for a target. Source: Apple: Is The WWDC The Catalyst To Break The Stock Above $133? Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
