Yahoo May Be Next In Line For CEO Change - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Shares trading at a 2015 low as Alibaba spin-off unclear. The tech world received some interesting news last week when Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) CEO Dick Costolo announced he was stepping down from his position. Twitter has struggled to grow its user base compared to expectations, and the company took down its yearly guidance at its Q1 report. In this article, I discuss another tech company that could see a CEO shakeup in the next year, and that's Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Shares are at their lowest point this year, and if the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) spin-off gets knocked down by the IRS, I believe a continuation of poor results will send Marissa Mayer packing. In the past, I've discussed Yahoo's search gains thanks to its Firefox deal. However, those gains have turned out to be short-lived, with Yahoo in a comparable position now as compared to a year ago. I looked at data from StatCounter regarding Yahoo's monthly search share for desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms. The chart below shows monthly figures going back to June 2014. Yahoo's share topped out at 10.23% in January of this year, but it has been all downhill since. So far this month, Yahoo's share stands at 8.62%, which is only just above the value from June 2014. Despite the Firefox deal, things really are not improving. Yahoo has made some questionable moves lately, the latest of which was reportedly giving a huge raise to Katie Couric. I'm not convinced in the company's strategy going forward, especially considering the NFL deal that I believe is a mistake . Yahoo's core business is struggling right now, with revenues expected to decline by 2.5% this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be cut in half, and estimates continue to drop, as seen below. About a year ago, analysts were looking for almost $2 in non-GAAP EPS this year. Marissa Mayer has been one of the main beneficiaries of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba. Yahoo's stake in the Chinese giant is a main reason for the explosive gains in shares of Yahoo since Mayer took over, and also for a chunk of the buyback program. The key to the Alibaba holding is disposing of it in the most tax efficient manner, and Yahoo has proposed a tax-free spin-off for later this year. Unfortunately, there are some doubts that the IRS will approve Yahoo's proposed transaction. This could be a disaster for Yahoo, because a tax-free spinoff could save about $10 billion. One analyst from Capstone states that a tax code change could hurt Yahoo by $11 a share, more than a quarter of the stock's current value. If the Alibaba spinoff does not go through as planned (tax-free), you can bet the pressure on Marissa Mayer will ratchet up tremendously. Yahoo shares have not done well in 2015. In fact, they are 23% off their 52-week high, and they closed Friday at their lowest point since October 21, 2014. Part of the stock's fall is due to Alibaba coming down from its $120 high, but the rest is because of the items I've detailed above. Yahoo's market cap is down to $38 billion, so a further decline could make it enticing for a large activist investor to come in and shake things up. Investors are obviously getting more worried about Yahoo at this point. As you will see in the chart below, short interest in the name is up more than 55% in the past month and a half. On the flip side, Alibaba short interest is decreasing at this point, showing which name investors have more faith in going forward. Yahoo short interest is currently at its highest point since November 2014. Mayer took over Yahoo during the summer of 2012. That year, the company reported revenues ex-TAC of $4.468 billion. We've seen two straight years where the top-line number declined, with last year coming in at $4.401 billion. This year, analysts believe the company will struggle to bring in $4.3 billion in ex-TAC revenues. In a time when Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and others are showing strong revenue growth, Yahoo can't even report flat revenues. That's a problem, and this year, non-GAAP EPS are also expected to plunge. If Twitter's CEO can't satisfy when he basically doubled revenue growth in a year and a half, why should Mayer get a pass when revenues are going the wrong way? Next month, Mayer will hit her 3-year anniversary as CEO of Yahoo. Is the company in a better place now than it was when she took over? I would argue no. Sure, shares have jumped during her time at the top, but that is basically due to the success of Alibaba. A failed tax-free spinoff of Yahoo's Alibaba stake may be the last straw. If Yahoo's core business continues to stagnate, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more calls for Mayer's departure as 2015 progresses.
