Apple's Savvy Tidal Acquisition - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Reports broke last night that Apple is considering buying music service Tidal. Tidal, part owned by Jay-Z, has over 3 million members that pay up to $20/month. Initial reaction on social media was outrage, but we think it's ridiculous to be outraged without deal details and we think an acquisition makes perfect sense. Investor sentiment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) this morning has been that they have made or are making a poor move in shooting to acquire the Tidal streaming music service. This acquisition would come after Apple acquired Beats by Dre just a year and a half ago and would help Apple round out its media offerings. The Wall Street Journal reported , Apple Inc. is in talks to acquire Tidal, a streaming-music service run by rap mogul Jay Z , according to people familiar with the matter. Apple is exploring the idea of bringing on Tidal to bolster its Apple Music service because of Tidal's strong ties to popular artists such as Kanye West and Madonna. The talks are ongoing and may not result in a deal, these people said. Terms of the potential deal aren't known. Jay Z bought the service in March 2015 for $56 million from Swedish company Aspiro, which had created the brand Tidal. He has given 19 famous artists and bands small stakes in Tidal and promised each millions of dollars worth of marketing, according to people familiar with the matter. Already, Apple is being berated on social media by those who are critical of this potential acquisition. People are trying to make the point that Apple should be "spending this cash on buybacks" or other shareholder friendly initiatives instead of bothering with making these types of piecemeal acquisitions. While at first, we were also in the critical camp about this potential acquisition, we did a small bit of research and realize that a couple of factors are in play here and that this may not be the worst idea the company has ever had. Most importantly, we're baffled at how people think this can be a "terrible idea" without knowing how much Apple is willing pay and without clarity on what they are getting for their investment. We know that Apple Music is one of the company's biggest initiatives right now, with 15 million members now subscribed as it moves to take over the streaming audio sector, dealing with competitors like Spotify and Pandora (NYSE: P ). Growth in media will wind up being a huge recurrent cash cow for Apple, as subscribing members of Apple Music are forced to essentially buy what is about 10 songs worth of media every month for the $9.99 average sign up cost. The very first thing that has yet to be determined is exactly how much Apple is definitely going to pay for this acquisition. Jay-Z bought it 2 years ago for $56 million and then invested in endorsements and an image change. Doubling that price would put it at $112 million, which is as close to nothing as you can get for a company that is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. Outrage about $112 million would seem absurdly foolish for a company that does near $50 billion in revenue per quarter. The price they pay for the service may only wind up being a drop in the bucket in terms of the company's cash. For that, let's look at what they are getting, More than 3 million subscribers, about 1/5 of Apple Music's subscriber base Exclusive access to Prince's music library during the year of his death Subscribers pay up to $19.99 a month, in which is about double the average streaming music service. This is an easy segue into Apple offering a "hi-def" version of its service Endorsements from all of the celebrities that have rallied behind title to get it to where it is today We're not M&A or music industry experts, but $112 million doesn't seem unreasonable for these perks (if the company even goes that high). In fact, $200 million doesn't seem like too much either. Perhaps most importantly, Apple can use Tidal to tap into a base of consumers that may not be your traditional, high income, Apple customers. It allows them access to a pool of individuals that they may not have had prior access to. Again, we are not sure how anyone can judge this deal extensively without knowing the valuation that they placed on the company definitively. That will matter immensely as to whether or not it was a "good value" for Apple. When the numbers are released definitively (assuming a deal gets done, which is not a definitive), they may wind up surprising critics. iTunes and the iTunes store has been one of the hidden gems for Apple over the last 10 years. It has grown immensely and it has helped the company transform not only into a computer/smart phone company, but a Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) like media company as well. Taking out smaller competitors is simply the name of the game when you are trying to compete against companies like Pandora, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Spotify. We think that a small acquisition like this that has obvious synergies with Apple's intended game plan in streaming media makes a lot more sense for the company then most people seem to think. While it is easy to be critical that the company is buying "just another product from another rapper", the truth is that Tidal didn't begin with Jay Z, and it was rebranded over the course of the last two years as Jay Z stepped in as owner. The notion that these products are sub-par because there are famous rappers that invest in them is ludicrous. We want to be first on record to say that we think such an acquisition can wind up being immensely beneficial to the company (at the right price) and that outrage over "Apple buying a rapper's streaming music service" is misguided and led by those who lack clarity and color on the terms of what a potential deal would look like.
