3 Risks To Facebook's Dominance - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook investors need to think about one number - 46 minutes. If Facebook's future is in search, Zuckerberg seems to have popped this speculation bubble. One thing the last few days in the stock market has taught investors is, even great companies can lose their value quickly. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) along with many other tech stocks, lost more than 10% of its value in a very short time. Many shareholders likely believe this is a temporary setback. However, there are some challenges that Facebook shareholders need to be aware of. Unless the company can give investors convincing answers to these questions, the stock's short-term decline, could turn into a bigger problem. Facebook's dominance is difficult to question. In the company's last earnings report, it reported daily active users were approaching 1 billion . To put this into perspective, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) reports that its core services like Gmail and YouTube have over a billion users . Think about those numbers for a minute. Each day Facebook gets almost as many users as are registered with Gmail and YouTube. Everyone knows that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is struggling to meet investors' expectations. Twitter grew monthly users by 15% , to just over 300 million, but this wasn't enough and the stock got crushed. Think about this, Facebook has three times the users each day as Twitter gets in a month. On the one hand, investors might believe this dominant user base gives Facebook a competitive advantage. More users means more data, and more data means better advertising. However, there is a key number that shareholders need to think hard about. Mark Zuckerberg CEO said that, "people are spending more than 46 minutes per day on average," between Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. This sounds like great news, but the first problem facing Facebook's dominance is, how much more can the services really be used? The average user spends many hours a day between sleeping and working. Those same users have to eat, spend time with friends, pay bills, commute, and more. Given that Facebook's three main services are taking up just under an hour of each day, can users realistically commit to much more? Though Facebook can continue growing its user base, growing its time with users will be a difficult task. The second risk to Facebook's dominance is, the company must find a way to diversify itself. Bullish investors might suggest Facebook's future is in search. Three months ago, Facebook said it was handling about 1 billion searches a day. In the company's recent earnings call, this number jumped to 1.5 billion per day. Google's search business seems to be holding up well, but at the expense of cost per click. In the company's recent results, paid clicks increased by 18% annually , but cost per click fell by 11%. In a similar manner, Twitter's data capabilities are growing. The company's ability to catalog, and provide informative data to businesses, can be seen in its data licensing results. Twitter's ability to sell its data stream helped the company to increase its licensing revenue by 44% year-over-year. Now there is just one big problem. According to Zuckerberg, the majority of Facebook's 1.5 billion daily searches are focused on people. If search isn't the future of Facebook, then what is? Some investors might suggest Facebook can become a payments platform. The simple problem with that idea is, Facebook itself doesn't seem to believe the thesis. In the last quarter, payments represented just over 5% of revenue, and declined by 8% annually. The company dismissed short-term growth, by saying it expects payments to decline further. In addition, the payments space is very crowded. Whether it's the newly independent PayPal, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay, Facebook isn't even an afterthought in this industry. Great businesses, if you don't want to advertise Many investors, would probably scoff at the idea that Facebook has to do anything outside of social networking. However, this brings us to the third issue facing Facebook's dominance. The company owns multiple services like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Unfortunately, none of these businesses is particularly suited to selling advertising space. Google gets the majority of its revenue from advertising, and Twitter gets more than 90%. Facebook generated almost 95% of its revenue from advertising last quarter. The point is, if the company can't sell more ads, or more expensive ads, growth will be challenging. To be fair, Instagram seems the easiest business to transition to an advertising base. However, Facebook said with 300 million users, it didn't seem like it was the right time to push advertising. This is particularly ironic considering Instagram and Twitter have almost the same size user base. When it comes to Messenger and WhatsApp, the future for advertising looks much worse. Both services have hundreds of millions of users. However, consumers don't expect advertising in their messaging app. To make the point even more clear, WhatsApp's homepage actually says, "Why we don't sell ads." If Facebook has any inkling that it will use this app for advertising, the core message of the brand will have to change. The bottom line is, Facebook is the dominant social media company. Users are on the service for nearly an hour a day already. However, users don't seem to use the service for searches that can be served up at a cost to advertisers. In addition, users don't seem to use Facebook for payments. Where Facebook's other properties are concerned, they don't seem like hotbeds for increased advertising growth. How does Facebook expand beyond being the dominant social network? Unfortunately for investors there doesn't seem to be a good answer. As Facebook's user growth continues to slow as it reaches larger scale, shareholders need to start asking the hard questions. Assuming that Facebook will "figure it out" could be a dangerous route to losses. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
