Facebook: Breaking News Mobile App Is A Great Expansion Product - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is allegedly working on a Twitter-like mobile app that delivers personalized breaking news alerts to people. I smell a revenue sharing deal between Facebook and content publishers over this breaking news app project. Business Insider reported last week that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is working on a new breaking news mobile app. It is allegedly a separate app much like Facebook Messenger. The project is still in alpha stage of testing but Business Insider claimed users will be able to customize the breaking news alerts by letting them only subscribe from news publishers they like. Some publishers have allegedly signed up for this new breaking news app. They will be able to mass broadcast breaking news notifications to Facebook users who signed up for their respective news alerts services. Facebook's new app supposedly only has a 100-character limit that publishers must abide. Partner publishers must write their news alerts (and the link to their websites) within the 100-character limit. This is shorter than Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) 140-character limit, but it will still work. There are dozens of URL link shortening services online. Even Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has a free URL shortener that doesn't require you to login with a Gmail or Google+ account to use. The benefit of having a having a stand-alone breaking news mobile app is that Facebook will be fulfilling its role as a growing portal for news dissemination. As per the recent report of Pew Research Center, Facebook and Twitter are now bastions for news consumption in America. Almost two-thirds (63%) of active users on Facebook and Twitter get their news inside the websites or mobile apps from these two leading social networking companies. Twitter users (59%) are more engaged (or make follow-up views) with breaking news events, versus Facebook users (only 31%). On the other hand, the much larger monthly active users of Facebook means more adult Americans use Facebook than Twitter to get their daily news fix. In the U.S., 66% of adults use Facebook. Four out of ten Americans now enjoy reading news inside Facebook's core web and mobile apps. As you can notice in the chart above, eight percent of Americans also use a combination of Twitter and Facebook to get news. Zuckerberg could probably lessen this two-timing habit of some Americans once Facebook releases a dedicated mobile app for breaking news. The addiction to news extends across America's different sectors. Regardless of age, race, gender, or economic status, more people now prefer to use Facebook and/or Twitter for imbibing the latest news/information. Global Web Index agrees with Pew Research's findings that Facebook users are truly voracious newsreaders. Fifty percent of Facebook users read news last month. They also spent an average of 43 minutes per day to read digital news. Revenue Sharing From Traffic Referral News publishers will benefit from the increased traffic from Facebook's upcoming breaking news app. The more people who visit articles, the more chances that the advertisements on news-centric sites like CNN will be clicked. Facebook now provides 38.2% of traffic referral to the web's biggest news websites. This is 3% higher than what Google provides. The social site has outpaced search last year as the biggest source for traffic referrals for web content. Content publishers who want to increase their ad income will have to follow where the most readers will likely come from, Facebook. Consequently, FB investors expect publishers to also throw some money to Facebook in exchange. Facebook can negotiate a fair deal with publishers thanks to its globalwide popularity. Facebook, not Twitter, is the biggest opportunity for content publishers to better monetize the news hunger of mobile device users. Facebook has 1.49 billion monthly active users while Twitter only has 304 million . It's a no-brainer decision for content publishers to really prioritize Facebook. Aside from the 1.31 billion people who access Facebook through their mobile devices, WhatsApp and Instagram users are also potential clients for a breaking news mobile app. The 2014 Digital News Report of Reuters Institute also confirms the dominant presence of Facebook among mobile device owners. Reuters' chart below also says publishers will have to fully embrace phones/tablets to maximize the monetization of their digital content. I look forward to the official launch of a stand-alone Facebook breaking news mobile app. I see it as a potential revenue generator from revenue sharing with content publishers. Facebook is no longer a mere mobile advertising company. It is now a multi-tentacled colossus with access to digital wallets , virtual reality, e-commerce , and soon, digital content distribution. FB is a Buy for brave investors who understand the long-term intrinsic value calculation used in the Chepakovich Valuation Model. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.
