Apple: 13 Million iPhone Sales In Launch Weekend Is Nothing To Fear - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple bears are pointing to the 13 million first weekend sales of the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus as an indicator of Apple's decline. Sales were probably limited by sheer availability, and don't indicate supply/demand balance. If anything, the sales number indicates that the primary thesis of Apple bears of a sales slowdown in China is unsubstantiated. SA contributor Michael Blair has asserted that the iPhone 6s/6s Plus launch weekend sales of 13 million should frighten investors. I disagree. His case is based on many flawed assumptions including assumptions about a slowdown in China impacting Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) growth. The lynchpin of Blair's negative take on iPhone 6s first weekend sales is that 40% of those sales supposedly went to China. He bases that assertion on another assertion that "Apple reports [China] contributes more than 40% of iPhone revenue". These assertions are not supported by the facts that Apple has disclosed regarding China revenue. In the June quarter, Apple reported total revenue (not just iPhone, but everything) for Greater China (which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan) of $13.23 billion which was just 26.7% of Apple's total revenue of $49.6 billion. Apple doesn't disclose a geographic breakdown of iPhone sales, but this percentage correlates reasonably well with Gartner's recent estimate of 11.9 million unit sales for iPhone in China (Greater China assumed) for the June quarter. That would put the unit sale percentage at about 25% of total iPhone unit sales for the quarter of 47.534 million. How does one go from roughly 25% of sales to 40% of launch weekend sales? It simply isn't reasonable. Especially because China, as accounted for in the weekend sales figure does not include Hong Kong. Hong Kong was part of the launch last year, and is accounted separately as part of the rest of the world. So the percentage of opening weekend sales for China should be lower than the Greater China percentage by virtue of not including Hong Kong. When we make these numerical adjustments, the more reasonable estimate for China is about 2.7 million for China, (21% of the total) and about 10.3 million for the rest of the world including Hong Kong. So the rest of the world posts roughly flat y/y results for the first weekend. I doubt that the rest of the world sales really mean anything, other than an indication of how Apple chose to allocate initial iP6s/6s Plus production geographically. Recent data about the split between Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) for production of the A9 processor in the new iPhones is revealing. TSMC is estimated to have received 60% of the iP6s/6sPlus business, much higher than the 30% I initially thought . The important takeaway here is that Apple had to hire both foundries in order to make the 13 million units sold on launch weekend. This indicates that the number of units sold was limited by availability, and not by demand. Lack of supply/demand balance is typical for initial iPhone launches, and if that's the case here, there's really no conclusion to be drawn about rest of the world sales. Apple had to include China in the first weekend launch. As an important and rapidly growing area for Apple, not including China would have been interpreted as an insult. There's a deeper problem embedded in Blair's assertion about China sales. It entails an intellectual trap of sorts that I was fairly sure the Apple bears would walk into regarding the first weekend sales figures. Mr. Blair has echoed the widely held sentiment that China's assumed economic downturn would be the downfall of Apple. He makes the case for this scenario in a previous article, Will Competition In China Upset The Apple Cart . Blair appears to see no contradiction between his bearish view of the Chinese market and his assumption of a disproportionate 40% of first weekend sales in China. But I do. I submit that if the bears have been correct about China, then first weekend sales in China should have been weak, and the percent contribution much less than last quarter's 25% of global iPhone sales. If that's the case, then the rest of the world outperformed last year's sales. I've prepared a chart below that shows relative contributions of Rest of the World compared to China for a wide range of scenarios characterized by the per cent sales contribution of China. There's only a small region, between the two vertical dashed lines, where either the rest of the world or China doesn't outperform. Blair's assumption of 40% sales contribution for China on launch weekend amounts to trying to have his cake and eat it too. He can't do both, but he tries nevertheless. In addition to China, Blair offers other information to bolster the bear case. One of them is the Statista chart reproduced below. The chart is as of the end of calendar 2014, so it excludes much of the sales expansion iPhone has enjoyed due to the iPhone 6/6 Plus in the past year. But I believe that the number for iPhone installed base is about right. The number for Android, however, appears to be an overstatement. As of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) recent September Event , Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the number of 30 day active Android devices (smartphones and tablets) was 1.4 billion, up from the 1 billion he stated at the Google IO developer's conference in June 2014. How does Statista get to an "installed base" of 1.6 billion Android smartphones by the end of 2014? I guess it depends on what you consider to be the installed base. This goes back to the longstanding controversy regarding "white box" Android sales in China. Many of these phones are little better than feature phones that never get registered with Google and don't participate in the Android ecosystem or generate revenue for Google. Should they be considered part of the "installed base". I don't think so. So I think the number for the Android smartphone installed base was about 1 billion as of the end of 2014. Another piece of data that Blair shows is the relative performance of the iPhone 6s compared to the Samsung Galaxy S6, using Geekbench. I've discussed the widening performance gap between Apple's SOC's and commodity processors such as the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 810, so I'll simply refer readers to Anandtech's preliminary results for the iPhone 6s. When you look at the big performance picture, Apple comes out ahead in almost every category. The only processor that really can be said to be close is the Samsung Exynos 7420 in the Galaxy S6. That is testimony in my view to the power of the custom SOC paradigm that both Apple and Samsung have embraced. The rest of the commodity Android phones are a year or more behind Apple and no threat to its premium position. And this leads us to the important takeaway. Apple's latest iPhones cement its position as the premium smartphone brand. Apple bears never seem to understand why Apple is earning 92% of the profits of the smartphone industry. There's a good reason for this, and it's not savvy marketing fueling the "next iFad". That explanation is so worn out. The simplest explanation, the one that doesn't require the convoluted rationalizations of the Apple bears, is that iPhones command a higher price because they're better. That's an assertion that is open to reasonable disagreement, of course, but I consider it well substantiated by the facts. Benchmarks substantiate the superiority (in terms of processing speed) of Apple's custom SOCs. The high adoption rate of iOS 9, now over 50% of all iOS users , substantiates the superiority of iOS compared to Android, in which the latest 5.0 release has a very low adoption rate of 15.9%. Based on what I see in the quality of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus hardware and software, I'm very bullish for the December quarter. I expect that as consumers realize how strong the product is this year, demand will build. I still expect iPhone sales to top last year's very impressive December record, for y/y unit sales growth in the mid teens. The first weekend sales, if anything, are encouraging, not frightening, since they indicate that demand in China remains strong.
