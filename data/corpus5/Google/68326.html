Microsoft Continues To Exploit Android's Dominance In Mobile - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha LG Electronics and Sony join Samsung, Dell, and Pegatron as Microsoftâ€™s major partners who will pre-install Office, Skype, and OneDrive apps on Android devices. There are now 31 Android device manufacturers who are helping Microsoft increase the total number of users of its mobile apps. The offer of lower Android licensing fees is definitely helping Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) attract more original equipment manufacturers to pre-install Office, Skype, OneDrive, and OneNote mobile apps on Android products. In addition to the initial 11 partners (which includes Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Dell, and Pegatron) Android devices last March, Microsoft announced that 20 more manufacturers will also pre-install its mobile apps on Android tablets. LG Electronics ( OTC:LGEAF ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) are among the new 20 OEMs backing Nadella's cross-platform strategy to increase the number of users of Microsoft mobile apps. The list also includes top-selling popular Chinese Android vendors Teclast and Cube . Samsung, LG, Dell, and Sony are taking advantage of the discounted Android royalty licensing offer from Microsoft. Android device manufacturers allegedly pay $5-to-$15 per device as royalty fees over Microsoft's Android-related patents. There's substantial benefit to Samsung because pre-installing Microsoft mobile apps might help save $2-to-$5 (my own estimate) on each Samsung Android device. Samsung shipped out 317 million smartphones last year. If it can save $1 or $2 on every Android handset, Samsung could save as much as $600 million annually. LG is also a major phone vendor that could save a lot of money by pre-installing Office and Skype on its Android phones. Microsoft could recover the lost money over the Android licensing discounts through mobile advertisements and premium subscriptions of Office 365 from Android device users. Android remains the dominant OS in mobile devices. IDC says Android has 78%s share in smartphones. Windows Phone still has less than 3% share. Compelling Android OEMs to pre-install Microsoft apps is therefore an easy to way to increase the potential number of people who will pay for Office 365 subscriptions. The more Android device users who get access to Skype, the better it is for Microsoft's mobile advertising efforts . The reason why Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) leads the global mobile advertising business is due to the billion-plus number of Android devices being used around the globe. Microsoft is not among the top ten players in mobile ads most probably because of the low 2.7% market share of Windows phones. Pre-installing Skype on new Android tablets and smartphones could help Microsoft benefit more from the $100 billion mobile ad spending that will happen next year. Android enjoys a bigger presence than Windows mobile gadgets in the U.S. and China. These two countries are the top markets for mobile advertisements. Persuading Cube, Haier, and Teclast to pre-install Skype on Android tablets/phones gives Microsoft a better access to China's $14 billion mobile advertising industry. Pre-installing Skype Translator on Android device users might also make it more useful to Chinese people than the Google Translate app. Unlike Google Translate, Skype Translator can do real-time English to Mandarin Chinese (and vice-versa) voice translation. Samsung, LG, Sony, and Dell could offer cheaper Android devices (or improve their gross margins) thanks to the discounted licensing fees from Microsoft. The cutthroat pricing on some Android phones makes it difficult for manufacturers to make a decent margin. Microsoft could persuade more OEMs to pre-install its apps on Android devices if it implements a revenue sharing deal. Google still does not practice any revenue sharing on Android. European wireless carriers are already threatening a ban on Google's mobile ads allegedly to force the internet search giant to share revenue . Microsoft could easily win the backing of European carriers for Windows 10 phones and tablets if Nadella offers them a revenue sharing deal. Nadella could also persuade major wireless carriers to pre-install Office 365 and Skype on Android devices if he offers them the same $3 or $4 dollar subsidy per device that Microsoft allegedly gives to Chinese white-box tablet manufacturers. MSFT is a Buy . Exploiting the dominant position of Android is just standard operating procedures. Microsoft is cash rich and ruthless enough to do an aggressive contra revenue tactic toward increasing the total addressable market of its Office 365 and Skype business.
