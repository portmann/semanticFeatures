Facebook: The Quarter-Trillion Monster - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Market cap could soon top $250 billion. Growth trajectory mirrors Apple's fiscal 2003 to 2007 period. New revenue streams work with billion plus users. There's been a lot of talk recently regarding technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its roughly three quarters of a trillion dollar market cap. This is a truly remarkable number, and many think that Apple could become the first to hit the trillion level. In a similar respect, investors may not realize that social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is about to reach the quarter trillion mark. Today, I'll detail why this could be just the beginning as this monster continues to grow. The ways that these two companies generate their revenues are completely different, although you could argue that Apple is an enabler for Facebook. Apple makes a physical product such as an iPhone or iPad and its devices go for several hundred or even a few thousand dollars per unit. On the other hand, Facebook's billion plus users don't pay the company in a traditional sense. The social media name generates most of its revenues from advertising, which accounted for $3.59 billion of the company's $3.85 billion total in the fourth quarter of 2014. In about a month, Apple will launch a new product, the Apple Watch, which will help the company on its next leg of growth. Facebook also is looking at new ways to generate revenues, especially when it comes to its popular messenger service . Facebook is following in the footsteps of names like Line, which had revenues of nearly $200 million in Q4 2014 on just 181 million monthly active users. Facebook has more than 700 million Messenger users, so there is a tremendous opportunity here. Delivering new experiences and finding new revenue streams are a way for Facebook to sustain high revenue growth rates, which analysts currently expect. Interestingly enough, Facebook's revenue growth nearly mirrors that of Apple, albeit on a different timeline. In the chart below, you can see Apple's revenues from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007 against Facebook's last three years and analyst projections for 2015 and 2016. Dollar values are in millions. Facebook's last two years above are current projections , but that also means that there's the chance to beat these numbers. Just remember, in the last 13 months the average 2015 analyst revenue estimate has risen from $14.74 billion to $17.12 billion. It is certainly possible that if the company continues to beat, we could see revenues get close to $25 billion in 2016. Due to the nature of the business, Facebook also is more profitable at this point. In 2014, Facebook had a GAAP profit of $2.925 billion versus Apple's $1.328 billion in its middle year (fiscal 2005) of the five above. If Facebook is able to improve its GAAP net margin by the end of next year, we could be looking at around $6 billion in net income or so. That's a tremendous amount of profits in a space many don't judge as a money maker. I don't think this train is slowing down anytime soon. According to research from Forrester, smartphone users spend the most time on the Facebook app, and in that linked article comScore details that Facebook has the largest reach. This is one reason why the social media giant has the number two spot in market share for net mobile US ad revenues, only behind search giant Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ). In the chart below, you can see where mobile ad revenues go and where they are expected to head this year and next. While most of the data in the chart and linked article above may not be surprising, it does help to detail why I like Facebook. From 2013 to 2016, Facebook is expected to mostly maintain its share of the US mobile ad space while Google is expected to lose a few hundred basis points of its share. From 2013 to 2016 based on the numbers above, Facebook's ad revenue growth is slated to be 281%, while Google comes in at just 231%. Overall, we know that Facebook is growing at rates much higher than Google currently, and I don't see that changing in the next couple of years. While everyone seems to be focused on the massive market cap of Apple, Facebook is quietly nearing the quarter trillion-dollar point. The social media giant is poised to continue its tremendous growth in the next couple of years and that trajectory is very similar to what we saw from Apple roughly a decade ago. Everyone knows about the billion plus Facebook user number, a tremendous user base that the company is just starting to monetize. Mobile ad dollars are flowing toward Facebook and I believe the company will continue to steal away some of Google's pie in the next few years. At about 32.5 times expected 2016 non-GAAP EPS, Facebook is much cheaper than its social media peers Twitter ( TWTR ) and LinkedIn ( LNKD ). The future of Facebook is definitely bright, and I'm looking forward to discussing the next milestone that this company hits.
