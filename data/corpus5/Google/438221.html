Apple Should Starve The iLoyalists By Increasing The iPhone's Refresh Cycle - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iLoyalists are the dedicated group of people who keep buying Apple's pricey iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. I disagree with Mark Hibben's view that Apple might shorten the iPhone's redesign cycle to one year. In fact, I want the company to increase the iPhone's redesign/replacement cycle. Increasing the iPhone's redesign cycle will starve and whet the appetite of the iLoyalists. Making the world iPhone-hungry is worth a try. A longer iPhone refresh cycle will allow Apple's retail and carrier partners more time to unload their inventories without them resorting to deep discounts. I respect the writing prowess of Mark Hibben. However, I politely disagree with his view that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) might adopt a one-year redesign cycle for the iPhone. After the larger screen display implemented in the iPhone 6 design, there really is no compelling new feature that could be added to the iPhone 7s/iPhone 8. Making minor improvements under an annual redesign cycle could only worsen the perceived sales decline of the iPhone. Worse yet, having a one-year refresh cycle for the iPhone could further expose AAPL's stock price to negative stock market sentiment. It's sad but true, Apple's stock performance is now dependent on iPhone sales reports. The company should instead increase the redesign cycle of the iPhone. This will allow it to really come up with major compelling updates. Prolonging the replacement cycle will make the world iPhone-hungry. Instead of burdening the world with a one-year iPhone redesign cycle, Apple should try starving the iLoyalists for 2 or 3 years. This will whet their appetite for the next iPhone. A deprived iLoyalist will be very eager to buy the next new iPhone at any price tag. My rejection of a shorter, one-year replacement cycle is also from the point of an Apple customer. The high price tags of iPhones makes replacing it yearly an expensive proposition even for business users. I even prefer that the company gets rid of the S-suffixed phone models that are usually released a year after a major iPhone model is launched. The less-than-expected iPhone 6s sales performance is a strong clue that the world is iPhone-weary. The one-year gap between the release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s has already proved that a yearly refresh cycle is not effective for the device sales. Bloomberg's chart below revealed that even affluent Chinese and Taiwanese people have gone iPhone-weary. A longer refresh cycle will also help carriers incur less subsidies on iPhones. People in America will find it harder to get new iPhones through carrier-subsidized Apple smatphones. "Free iPhones" with two-year contracts from carriers are now getting extinct . While some Americans can get new iPhones with low initial cash outlay of $199 under two-year contracts, firms like AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) are not happy shelling out subsides for the phones. Getting on the good side of wireless carriers is still important to Apple's future. Dumping new iPhones on global carriers every year can worsen the subsidy issue. American or Philippine telcos do not have a 100% guarantee that people who sign up for two-year contracts will finish their installment payments for iPhones. Let The World Satiate Itself on the iPhone 7 For Three Years Apple cannot keep selling the iPhone at its current price tags of $650+++ under a one-year refresh cycle. People will eventually get fatigued and resentful. Resentful because I, for one, was irritated that my wife's pricey 2014 iPhone 6 Plus got superseded by the iPhone 6s Plus, which was released last year. My starve-the-iLoyalists suggestion is similar to my recommendation that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) should skip or cancel its 14 nm Kaby Lake processors. After Skylake, Intel should wait 1-2 years before releasing the 10nm CannonLake processors. Canceling or delaying new processors will help Intel's partners unload their unsold inventories. In the case of Apple, purposely delaying new phone models might help its wireless carrier and retail partners find more buyers for their unsold inventories of iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus. Releasing no new iPhone models will compel customers to just buy the models that are currently available. My idea also exploits a basic psychological truth - people's predictable behavior is that when starved enough, they will eat anything. Apple can simply release new iPhones every 2 or 3 years. The deprived iLoyalists will queue for them again like how ants often line up towards a sweet candy dropped from heaven. After the release of the iPhone 7, Apple should try and wait three years before releasing the iPhone 8. This will give enough time to its partners to sell all of their inventories of the iPhone 7. Three years will also let people maximize their usage of the expensive iPhone 7. Plus, waiting three years will allow the company to research and develop new features that add compelling value to the iPhone. A three-year refresh cycle will permit Apple to create real innovations or major improvements on its A-series processors, camera, screen display, and artificial intelligence solutions for smartphones. The focus of this article is to create a prolonged pent-up demand among Apple's loyal customers. Yes, there is the risk that some of the iLoyalist crowd could defect to Android phones if there's no new iPhone design for three years. However, a true-blooded fan of the iPhone is more likely to just wait for a new model from Apple. Yes, a new Android phone could have a faster processor and better GPU than a two-year old iPhone 6s. However, the overall user experience of my old iPhone 5s is still satisfactory enough for me to not buy the Xiaomi Mi 4 (Private: XI ). Apple inspires loyalty because it makes quality phones that are usable for more than three years. Its pool of customers can wait for new iPhones because they know it will be worth it. Divorcing Itself From Being Too iPhone-Focused A long gap between new iPhone releases also allows Apple to develop its other hardware products. The MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro need updated versions. The Mac Mini needs an update. The Apple TV needs an update - it still has no 4K support. The Project Titan project needs to be accelerated. Apple is also allegedly interested in coming up with a Siri Speaker to compete with Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Echo smart home assistant. The Mac App Store needs serious repair . A longer refresh cycle for iPhones will give Tim Cook enough time to notice that Macs are getting outsold by Chromebooks in the K-12 education market. The future of Apple's new macOS is endangered if most school kids today (who will become the world's next batch of corporate employees) are getting indoctrinated with Chrome OS, Google Apps , and Android apps . Apple really needs to increase its refresh cycle for the iPhone so it can allocate more manpower and resources toward improving its other hardware/services products. The company's future growth prospects are in big trouble if iPhone sales continue to contribute more than 65% of Apple's annual revenue. Let us never forget the lessons learned from the iPad and iPod Touch's decline in sales . The iPhone, like any other electronic product, will eventually fade away into a niche gadget. I am strongly in favor of Apple increasing the iPhone refresh cycle. The company has no urgent need to match the one-year refresh cycle of sub-$400 Android phones made by Huawei, Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ), or Xiaomi. Unlike the solid iLoyalist following of the pricey iPhone, Android phones are in a race-to-the-bottom dilemma. Android OEMs need to release minor revisions of their flagship phones every year for publicity's sake. They do this to retain consumer interest. On the other hand, releasing a new variation of a $700 iPhone every year might only result in the iOS phone market getting oversaturated and overbearing. Long-term Apple investors will appreciate it if Tim Cook can diversify the company's revenue stream. Bringing down the iPhone's contribution to less than 50% of annual revenue will likely reduce AAPL's stock market vulnerability to lower-than-expected iPhone sales reports. I am now underwater on AAPL. I went long the stock when it was trading above $98. I will only dump AAPL again if Tim Cook decides to go for a one-year iPhone redesign cycle.
