Ford (F) Presents at Deutsche Bank Global Industrials and Basic Materials Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Okay. Next up I’m very pleased to introduce representatives of Ford’s management team. As all of you know, Ford’s execution over the past several years has been very impressive. The company’s transformed its product portfolio. They’ve achieved impressive growth in new markets, very strong financial performance. And over the next year, the company should continue to benefit from one of the newest product portfolios in the industry, significantly refreshed and redesigned products including the new Mustang, Transit, Focus, Edge and of course the F-150, and we’re expecting very strong financial performance as a result of that. Representing Ford, we’re very pleased to welcome Bernard Silverstone, Chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Credit Company and Group Vice President of Ford Motor Company. Bernard has a lot of experience having had different roles at Ford including a stint as Chief Operating Officer of Ford Credit with responsibility for all of Ford Credit’s businesses, operations globally. Before that, he was President of Global Marketing and Sales. He also had senior management responsibility for international operations. He’s also served as Chairman of Ford Credit Europe. Also in attendance is George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations and Mark Turner, Director of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, everybody. What I’d like to do, as you’ll understand, Ford Motor Credit is wholly integrated into the value creation at Ford Motor Company, so I’m going to spend quite a bit of the presentation on Ford Credit and how we contribute to value creation. But before I do that, perhaps just to reaffirm, this is our One Ford plan, the same plan you’ve seen many times before, but with our 23 plus new products significant refreshed or its brand new products that we’ve introduced over the last year, as you know this is the year when we are looking to accelerate our plan and as Rod touched on our projections, our significant uplift in profits as a result this year over last. And we’ll do that by accelerating the plan and that means looking at both delivering our new products with both excellence and passion but also a new feature I’ll talk about is recognizing the evolving and accelerating evolution of the need to look at innovation both from a consumer perspective and also from a competitive perspective. So our One Ford plan remains and continues to be the foundation that we can do, so in many ways it hasn’t changed and the proof of that I guess is deliveries. Last quarter we produced again the 23rd consecutive quarterly profit for Ford Motor Company. These are our long-term objectives. So from that plan, we believe to deliver profitable growth for all, we need to aim to be top five in sales, which will mean delivering 10% plus global share over time and progressively increasing that share of the market. And more balanced both regional and by segment profits in each of the small, medium and large cars, utilities and trucks. And through all of that delivering operating margins of 8% plus and delivering top quartile amongst our peers total shareholder returns. And of course being highly regarded by all of our stakeholders, hopefully including all of you here in the room. And that should deliver our aspirations of profitable growth for all. We’ve added this framework by which we operate and I’ve touched on a couple of them already but strong brands, clearly the heart of delivering products that customers really want and value, serving all markets both geographically when I mentioned that balance that we want to strive to achieve the profit contributions more balanced across the regions of the world but also across the segments as you can see in the third Chiclets as we call them. And those three are really the focus of growth from my core existing business and adding in as we added this other Chiclets last year of Ford smart mobility and that really expresses where we see the new developments of end consumer interest and when we talk about innovation in the areas of transportation, connectivity and general mobility and that’s certainly an area we see growth for the future. And doing all of that through operational excellence, operational execution should deliver, as we said, the profit that we’re looking for and the profitable growth. So talking of the innovation focus, this is what we have used with our employees to really help them think about how we want innovation at all levels of the business, which can either deliver completing new products, new services or just efficiencies in everything we do. So it really is meant and is deployed across our organization at all levels of the business. Everybody in our organization can understand this and can contribute to innovating and supporting our progress. So at Ford Credit and how we contribute to it all, so I’m going to take you through – this is our product set as we think of it, products and services and I’d like to start in the top left and give you a very quick overview of our products and services. But collectively just like the rest of the industry when I said we’re wholly integrated, you’d expect to see as the industry grows, as Ford has grown, so as we’ve grown in all of these aspects of products and services. So starting up there in the top left, we provide facility and capital loans to our dealerships and our Ford dealers in the U.S. have just had again another record year in 2014, record year of profits that is, and they are reinvesting with our own – as you know, these are private companies; either small private companies or larger private companies but they are investing their money which is a great side of their faith in the Ford franchise and we’re supporting them with the type of facilities they need to support those investments. You might notice actually it was difficult for us when we looked at the floor court there to capture an F-Series on the floor court. They’re going out of stock so quickly. So next time around, hopefully I’ll have an F-Series in that picture. We actually do have one in the inventory financing and that’s what ties us to the dealership. Just like Ford delivers its products through dealerships, we distribute our financing products through our dealers and inventory financing is a key tie with our dealers. You’ll hear me mention a couple of times later on how we work with our dealers to create value for their consumers and for them directly, and that relationship is really key but also the start of what we call our virtuous circle of working together to deliver value for our customers. We also provided many markets, not all markets but where we can, we provide inventory insurance and the focus of that apart from a profit center for us is really to make sure we keep dealers in business if disaster does strike. So our emphasis is much on running a solid insurance business but it’s as much on the service of being that first on-site when there is a disaster, and we get great kudos back from our dealers when we do that, because they’re in the middle of a disaster and they’re often the center of a community effort to get everything back up and running, service the local vehicles and that’s just helping them do that is another little attribute that helps them see the value in Ford Credit. We support them through what we call our consulting and that’s consulting around both the products but of course as a lender, we’re interested in also helping them thinking about their asset utilization, how to run an efficient business, using composites, et cetera, and benchmarks to help them just continuously improve the Ford franchise. Along the bottom there, you can see our financing products; retail financing, lease financing and growing commercial financing as the economy continues its steady recovery, we’re seeing more and more commercial customers come back and of course great timing to launch our extended range new to the U.S. but very seasoned and very successful product from Europe, the Transit, but we’re now extending that range from the small Transit Connect to the medium and eventually to the jumbo size Transit, so we keep adding products in that segment as it grows and as the economy recovers. I will come back a little bit later on to some of the aspects of retail and lease financing that might be on your mind, so hopefully we’ll have time for questions, one might anticipate a couple of them around these subjects around higher risk credits, extended terms and leasing. So let me come back to that. And then finally, as I complete that tour of our products and services, we work with our customer service divisions to help them distribute their extended service plans and other vehicle ownership protection programs and plans. So that’s our product set and this is how we distribute it. So our goal is to support Ford everywhere that we sell vehicles around the world. That doesn’t always mean we deploy all of our capital all around the world. There are reasons why there may be other better models in places as you can colored in orange there. So if you can see the legend, blue is where we have a wholly owned subsidiary, yellow is a joint venture where we work with a partner and again we work to what’s the best fit to optimize our support for Ford in those markets as well as optimize our own deployment of capital. And then where we work with third party either on a private label or white label basis, those are colored in orange. And then in green you can see markets that are really at this stage export markets. Importantly, you can see that mostly in the center there in Africa, so we see Africa and we established our new region there last year in Middle East and Africa. We see it as the next emerging opportunity in years to come. So this gives us a foothold. Right now it’s export funding for distributors in those markets but obviously it gives us a chance to work with them, understand how their market is working and over time we’ll increase our involvement and that will give us an insight into those markets when they evolve out of emerging markets into mature markets, and hopefully they’ll provide that opportunity in the future. This is what we call our virtuous circle. But I’ve mentioned it starts with that relation with the dealer because that’s how we distribute our products. We are solely focused on automotive financing both for the dealer to make sure they are in business, and if you look back '08, '09 and when I talk about our capital plans and funding plans later on, very dear to us is making sure we have a sustainable presence in the marketplace. Our funding is set up in such a way diversified access to funding, so we’re there through all part of the cycle. And we’ve proved that of course in '07, '08 when credit was available and that was a great asset and a strategic advantage for Ford Motor Company. So our relationship with the dealers is key. It enables us then to offer joint integrated marketing offers and you see those often for customers, whether it be retail financing offers or leasing offers. But importantly what the dealers know is when the customer is then financed by Ford Credit, as it comes down this virtuous circle, through that relationship we can then not only focus on service from an efficiency point of view but service from an effectiveness point of view and that means taking care of customers’ needs, highly satisfied customers we know empirically are more loyal to the brand, and I’ll show you that in just a moment. So that’s our investment in customer satisfaction. But what it means when I mention both efficiency and effectiveness there of course, it means that not only are we a very profitable business on a very sustained and consistent basis, but the added dividend so to speak is the higher loyalty in shares. So that contributes to sales. And third party reports have estimated that value to an effective captive such as Ford Credit to be worth as much as 2 percentage points at market share. So I mentioned earlier, our growth aspirations over time to get to 10% plus is going to be at our aspirational level and you can imagine how 2% if we can materialize how critical that is to the overall plan. So we are totally integrated into Ford’s total plans. So this is how we think of our business as we deploy it and it starts pretty simply with buying it right or originate in the business, making the right credit decisions, I’ll come back on that in a moment. Servicing, as I just touched on, and then funding it efficiently. So originations, probably a good time to talk about our origination thoughts apart from – because we have great volume, it’s very streamlined, it’s very mechanized, so it’s very efficient from a vital time, if you like, of actually managing the contract originations. But if you look at some of the origination statistics, I’ll guess you’ll be seeing a lot of that higher risk and also extended terms. So higher risk, what we see in our portfolio is a very stable and consistent level. Now I have to qualify that a lot of the reports you see with quote different levels at FICA and that does give you a good comparison point, but we actually don’t buy business based on FICA. It’s an input, it’s an important input and we like to use it not just at a high level of the number but to delve into what’s behind it of a credit information around housing credits, small loans balances, healthcares and other issues that has gotten into FICA and I think we sorted that one out. But we then put it into our proprietary scoring model and we believe it can beat, if you like, the external model, the generic model because of our specialization on just Ford and automotive customers. As a consequence, we have a very stable level of what we call higher risk. When we measure that, we run it about 5% to 6%. Now that’s at the input level and you might ask well, how do you know that works and you’ll see it in a moment. You can see it in the output level and you can look back at our long-tail history of successfully liquidating our business, managing those contracts and portfolios through to final payoff with very tight range of credit results. So our credit results are presently at historical lows but you’ll see in a moment just how consistent they’ve been, and that’s a key to us. To buy it right, manage the portfolio and liquidate it right, so it has a good sustainable and predictable outcome. So the other aspect – that’s high risk. The other aspect is longer terms and certainly we’re seeing that. We have a preference for shorter terms being wholly under a Ford plan. We’d like to see the customer more often buy more products, but we recognize those trends. We’ve stayed out. We’ve not been a market leader there but we have offered 75-month terms in the last four to five – about six months now. And we have a pilot running. We’re looking at 84 months. Frankly, the take rate is not that great for our type of customers, which are predominately new customers. A lot of the data you see of course is both new and used. So right now for extended terms beyond 72, we’re only 4% or 5% of our originations. So it is a factor of the marketplace. We’re supporting it to make sure, as I said earlier, we rather service the customer and get that loyalty effect than having somebody else service the customer. But equally we’d rather put marketing offers in place to allow customers to come back more often, enjoy new Ford vehicle more often and plus we also know they’re going to be more satisfied longer term. I think we’ve all been through those cycles that customers forget who created the situation when six years down the track they’ve got negative equity. So it’s not ideal, it’s something we’ll support, manage it diligently and track it and do it in our own normal way. Same with leasing, leasing is important. We do get higher loyalty from leasing because of the nature of seeing a customer either every two or three years, so we have a more regular contact, more frequent contact and the actual loyalty tends to be higher. However, we also manage our lease on the basis that it’s sustainable. So we’re not going to run away with leasing and you would have seen maybe that we run five or six points below the industry average. So we’ve grown leasing as the industry have from – certainly from those days in '08, '09. Frankly, it’s more of a funding issue and availability of leasing from that perspective than a desirability from the customer. So we’ve grown back to about – round about 20% and we’re comfortable with that, but we actually manage it at a much more granular level. We’ve looked at segments. We manage our concentration. We don’t have over concentration either in any particular car segment, truck segment or utility segment. So we manage that within those parameters. And again, the goal is to have a sustainable offering so that when those customers come back, I mentioned the loyalty advantage and that’s one of the real payoffs apart from profit from the product itself in Ford Credit.\ When they come back we want to make sure that that was a constant supplier available but probably going to be leasing customers again, so we want to be in the marketplace with leasing. So we don’t want to grow it beyond the ability to sustain it over a long period of time. So you won’t see us growing leasing just for the sake of growing leasing. Again, it’s at that detail segment level and right now, we’re very comfortable. It’s exactly where we want it. In fact, this first quarter, our number showed that leasing was actually a little lower than last year. So we’re about the point where we want to be. Servicing; so when I think of servicing, I mentioned satisfaction and I’ll show you some stats in a moment that bear out that higher satisfied customers are more loyal back to Ford Motor Company in repurchased, not just in attitudinal but in actual repurchase activity. But servicing goes beyond that for us again because our whole team, our 6,500 employees all around the world have got Ford overall in their paycheck every month. So it’s not just about a relationship but a financing contract. If we can find a way to go further with a customer if they have a bump in the road, we know that a, we’ve got the skills and the analytics capability and we see that frontline service agents, real time dynamic behavioral scoring on how customer situations have changed. So we use analytics at a pretty extensive level so we could manage each account appropriately, but it really works. And we find we can then keep customers who have got a chance of working through a difficult time in their vehicle and then, as you could imagine, they’re going to be more loyal longer term and we get them through that period. A, we don’t get a loss and b, we’re down with the loyal customer at the end of it, so we get a double payback from that. And again, it really works. So servicing isn’t just the promptness and the politeness of answering queries, having real time balance available, it’s really about also when the customer gets into any difficultly; listening, working with them. Yes, we have to make tough calls. We do repossess vehicles and we have to – we manage that credit losses appropriately but we also try and work with the customer, listen to them properly and we’ll spend that extra time to go further with them. I’ll come back to funding, got a whole section on that, but we need to fund efficiently clearly with all of that. So here’s the data I’ve been talking about and you can go back even further, but you can see the top line is loyalty to Ford by repurchased data. This is actual repurchase not attitudinal. And you can see the other two lines are around either dealer arranged with third party banks or customer self arranged. In either event, the loyalty is consistently lower. Their repurchase activity is consistently lower. Some of it is because we worked [indiscernible] relationship, it’s not by accident. It’s the good service but also we’re very active in CRM, we’re very active using touch points to make the customer aware of what relevant offers are available in the marketplace. We think it’s an area we can get even better in as we further invest in our analytics capabilities, but we’d start with this great advantage. And until you can go back to almost as long as we’ve had that data and it’s always had this kind of level of gap, and yes it increased last year but it’s always been around those teens; 15%, 16% loyalty, then you can monetize that obviously. And here’s what I mentioned earlier also on a long view of what our credit losses have been and you would have seen – I’ll touch on our first quarter results. You may have already read them. We’re still right around that area, just – last year of 0.19% first quarter. You’ll see later we were 0.22%, so very low, historical low level with credit losses and yet we still buy a full spread of business. If I go back to kind of a consistent measure that the industry uses, if you measure high risk as below 620, some people will use 650 or 680, we tend to use 620 as high risk from a FICA point of view and we look at the customers who buy Ford and have that level of FICA that’s not necessarily the risk that we see, because we’ll look at the whole contract, all the characteristics. But we refinance over two-thirds of those customers, so not many of them are escaping to others. So we’re buying business at each segment; high risk, medium risk as well as obviously the very low risk. We get all of that better business and can still manage that relationship through to credit losses that are at the highest peak. So when you look at the amplitude, if you like, ranged from only 20 basis points up 21%, and I know across the industry you’ve seen the numbers much higher than that. So again it’s about predicable outcomes, sustainable performance and then from a profit point of view a consistent flow of profits and dividends back to Ford Motor Company. So balance sheet wise, so talk about funding inefficiently. Here’s our balance sheet and this is a view of – a couple of different views, one where our regional geographic concentration. From a credit perspective, it reflects that map that I showed you earlier but from an asset ownership point of view, not support of Ford point of view, we’re very concentrated in North America. International, again, would be at the moment very concentrated in Europe and our growing business in China and India. So that explains why we’ve got that distribution today. That will change over time. But we also support many of the other emerging markets with those other arrangements I showed you such as joint ventures and private label and white label. From a product point of view, and I’ve emphasized I know how important our dealer inventory financing is but think how quickly that turns particularly with the fresh products we’ve got such as Mustang and Edge and F-Series which are hardly staying in the dealer stocks. So don’t think of that as a quarter of our business, it’s actually very important, as I said, it’s equally important to our retail leasing but because of the fast turn of inventory financing, it only represents about a quarter of our balance sheet. And then you can see the rest supported by our equity in the business, which is mostly out of our retained earnings over the years as well as the dividends we pay. So we make enough. Our goal is to make adequate returns to fund our growth and pay the dividend stream that’s desired that we want to pay to our parent. So hopefully that makes sense. Here’s a snapshot of our overall strategies on funding. I’ve mentioned already that it is to have a very diversified base of funding and that’s to be sustainable, not dependent on one source through all of the cycles. So we stress test it and we use a stress based on '07, '08, plus a little bit of steroid injections, so we’re really anticipating not expecting the worse but planning for the worse, so we can be there sustainable. We understand the value of that and that’s why we talked about Ford Credit being a strategic asset to Ford Motor Company. So one thing we’ve been doing certainly since we retained our investment grade is to increase our mix of term debt, and there’s a couple of virtues for that. One, as we term out of the debt our refinancing burden comes down. So in 2013, for example, we refinanced about 50% of the balance sheet. As we move out to the end of this 2019, 2020, we’ll be down around 40%. So our refinancing in the marketplace becomes less of a burden and obviously we should therefore be able to get better pricing as well as just manage that better. The glory of that is it reduces the dependence on securitization, which is also desirable for those unsecured creditors and this year first quarter, we were about 40% and we projected we’ll end up somewhere between 37% to 39% depending on market appetites exactly. And of course we trade some of this off to look at pricing and look at what’s going on in the marketplace. But we’re between 37% and 39% of assets securitized by the end of this year is our outlook. And we continue to evolve the opportunities. So in China, for example, we were the first wholly owned captive finance company to issue a public ABS. We did that in the pilot program last year and had our second issuance under the new program base issuance this year and we issued 3 billion Yuan under that program, so we’re getting a much better diversification on our funding in China. And behind all of that, again, it comes back from when I mentioned that stress testing, very detailed stressing of what our liquidity means. Again, liquidity is really the killer in the stress to know how much liquidity to hold should we see another event such as '07, '08 and we’re holding presently in excess of $25 billion in liquidity in a combination of cash, committed lines, et cetera. So here is that very tangible contribution to Ford. As I’ve mentioned throughout, this isn’t the only way we think of the strategic value of Ford Credit. It really is also being totally integrated in the sales process, the value for customers, create value everywhere we can. But clearly the more tangible is this long tail of sustainable profits and dividend returns, and you can see that over the last 20 years, for example, we’ve returned $42 billion of pre-tax – sorry contributed 42 billion of pre-tax profits but also returned $28 billion of distributions back to our parent. But again validates our investment in the captive finance company. Here’s in case you missed it, a quick summary of the first quarter results and although the profits in the first quarter on the comps to last year were down a little – actually exchange accounted for $25 million of that, so you could argue on a constant dollar basis, we were actually a little bit up but exchange is real, so that’s what it is. And you can see there also, as I mentioned, our liquidity was a little above our long-term planning level, so we’re in a strong position on liquidity. And again, as I mentioned, our credit losses continue to be very much under control, very much at the low end of the long cycle. Here again is coming back to the group, reaffirming this is our outlook, so no change actually from the end of the first quarter. This is our outlook and of course within that, Ford Credit’s outlook is to deliver profits equal to or in fact a little higher than last year and those first quarter results continue to show that we’re on track to deliver our outlook. So that’s all I wanted to cover. I think Rod are you going to be the master of ceremonies for the questions. If you – Ford Credit related questions but more from your lens at Ford Credit looking broadly at the industry [indiscernible]. I guess just broadly in the industry, you addressed how Ford Credit manages its business, but there are plenty of stories out there about imprudent practices in the industry today that Credit is maybe a little bit more – too much available or however you want to characterize it not for Ford Credit commentary but just broadly there’s that sort of – these anecdotal stories that are out there in subprime or whatever, and I was wondering if you can sort of give us your perspective on that? How do you measure when you’re starting to see the market broadly stepping a little bit above where it should be? So we do watch it clearly. It’s not obviously [indiscernible] your own portfolio, but watch the market as much as anything because if there is a shakedown, it’s going to be disruptive and we get affected even as [indiscernible] so to speak potentially. So we watch it not that we can tell other people how to behave. Frankly, a lot of the articles, if you like anecdotal, take your broadsheet but some of them have picked some very [indiscernible] and they’re usually difficult situations and they’re not well defended but they’re in isolation. If you look at the Experian report or the Moody’s report, they validate that actually if you refer just to subprime rather than high risk using this consistent FICA measure. But it’s grown with the industry, risk grown in proportion. So as the industry is coming back, then so has the subprime. And those customers, of course, are coming from a perspective when things were really tough and credit was rationed, those customers weren’t getting access to credit at all. So they’ve only grown back to pre-'07 levels. They haven’t grown back in excess of that. There are going to be individual examples. I mean I think there is some relatively new start businesses that need to get seasoned. I can’t comment on how they’re going to perform in the future. So yes, there may be some individuals that when you look at the macro numbers, it’s not going in any way that we would be concerned about. Other just kind of high level questions from your lens in Credit, at some point rates are going to start going up and we can debate the trajectory, but clearly falling rates and also extended terms have been very beneficial for the industry. I think Experian says that the average amount borrowed on an auto loan is up by $3,800 since 2005 and monthly payments, they’ll only be up by about $9 a month or a very modest amount. As that starts to happen, what are your expectations vis-à-vis the amount borrowed from consumers? How do you think the industry broadly manages that transition to a rising rate environment? So clearly we are in a – I think one of the things we’re seeing, so if you look at – if I just talk to Ford Credit a moment, we’re seeing a very high share of financing when we make these offers. And as you’ve seen, the credit quality even though we buy a broad spectrum and buy a more than fair share of the higher risk credit, it’s a relatively low part of our portfolio. So for us I would say what’s happening is even customers who might normally pay cash are taking advantage of the very low rate environment. It’s hard to predict the future but I expect when rates go up, maybe some of those customers might revert to cash, for example. If you ask me to predict behavior, that’s very hard to do, but I think there’s a logic to that and that is they may well be doing that. As we manage through that cycle, you’ll also hope that – I’m not saying that – I don’t want to get into anybody’s alternative religions, but in the Fed we trust. We hope that rates only go up when the economy is strengthened and that should be the quid pro quo in simple terms. So you like to think we’re seeing both strength of the economy and therefore maybe some wage growth that means people will be able to afford some high payments that’s clearly with extended terms. There’s isn’t much further they can go. I imagine even further extended terms, but ask me five years ago whether they could have imagined 84 months, they would have said not that. So I think for them to be able to afford vehicles in the future particularly with all the technology going in that’s mandated in many cases because of zero emission rules, et cetera, then I think yes we’re going to have to hope that rates only go up if the economy can bear it. And I think that’s broadly the case. And lastly and I’ll just pass the mic back, but can you talk a little bit more about the China business which has historically been more of a cash-oriented purchase for automobiles. Obviously, you guys are entering this market – Ford just broadly is entering the market in a much bigger way at this point, a significant amount of capacity expansion. So where is Ford Credit currently within China? What are you seeing in terms of the dynamics and growth of that market? Is that something that you feel is going to help propel demand further even in a more moderating or moderating GDP growth environment there? Yes. That’s a really good question as well. So Ford Credit specifically has been in China. We’ll actually celebrate with our team there our 10th anniversary next month in July. So we’ve been growing this steadily but at a steady pace as we learn the attributes. So as you indicate I think in the nature of the question, Credit at that time when we first go into the market was certainly not a well understood or well used product and it’s a quite conservative society, if you like. I would say that what we are seeing is it’s growing. It’s about from our numbers about 20%, 22% of retail sales is financed. There are reports – I think IHS is projected that it could go to around 30% by the end of this decade. And I certainly see enough evidence to suggest that could be a reasonable estimate. And so we kind rally around that point for reasons to just try to think through what the future holds. Certainly the conservative nature of – approach to credit showed some of the results we see relatively stable and low credit losses, so consumers are pro credit and very prudent in a responsible fashion. That’s again not something we’ll take for granted. We’ve got behind it our global analytics capabilities, so it’s one of our strengths that we want to continue to leverage as a global player against local players how do we leverage all that global capabilities. So we have a global platform going in there, we use global analytics techniques, so it can really bring the strength of Ford Credit to bear. So there could be change that we don’t anticipate, generational for example. And I think there’s evidence in other credit markets that suggest that the younger generation, Millennials if you like, have now got a very different approach to credit than perhaps the older generation who may have grown up in the prior regimes where credit clearly just wasn’t frankly available other than to nonofficial means. So that’s the change and we’ll be ready for it and we should be in a strong position because of our strength of what we touched on today behind our performance is really the depth of consistent performance and the analytics behind it that enables us to be very systematic in our approach. Companies like DealerTrack, dealer management software systems, they have credit parts of their whole process. Are they a competitor or a partner for you guys? Yes, DealerTrack provides like a management system that actually participate in the credit themselves to the best of my understanding. So we have our own supplier, which we have an invested interest called RouteOne and they are a competitor, but we’re not the only owners of the consortium of owners in that business. So yes, they compete which I think is healthy. It means their products are kept fresh and appropriate from the point of view of functionality and scope and things like speeds, and particularly in the future if you think about new accesses that customers might want more and more online, more and more of the transaction. We know customers research more and more before they even go to a dealership, so visits to dealerships are down to – I think I saw a stat independently was about 1.5x before they buy versus three to four visits historically. So certainly as that comes on, all of these firms I think are going to keep pushing the envelope on technology. So we have our chosen supplier. Dealers have of course many dealerships and dealership groups that we have an adequate source in the same field. I was thinking more from the same point of they get paid when they direct an application one place to another, so --? Maybe you’re thinking of some of the online brokerage firms. DealerTrack to my knowledge at least again doesn’t pull the customers, they just act as a pipeline between the financing source and the dealership, people like TrueCar for example or AutoTrader or companies like that will try and pull customers and they’ll work in the space you just talked about. And certainly that’s emerging I guess with the online access to information and it’s more prevalent. But again providing that fast services, attractive efficient services, good value in our services still keeps up competitive for wherever that business is going to go. But that is an emerging trend, yes, of intermediaries if you like online. Is that kind of the heart of the question here? But they will have like 120 banks on their system, the same as RouteOne does and their agnostic in a way to who it goes unless there’s somebody not on their system of course. But they’re not trying to manage the lead. So it’s differentiated between those two business models if that makes sense. Happy to further chat offline maybe, you might have some other ideas. Thank you. Are there questions? Last one, I don’t know if this is a fair question for this discussion but just outside of just your role at Ford Credit, you’ve been an executive at Ford for many years and has had many different roles in the organization. And you put up a slide earlier just at the beginning that talked about, it’s the one where you referred to the Chiclets that you were adding technology, connectivity, all these different things. Just from your perspective just given all the things that Ford will need to focus on in the future years, are you seeing any kind of a change in focus on what Ford says is core and internal and needs to be managed internally versus things that you might say, look, we need to really redeploy resources to some new areas here with software and all those kinds of things and get out other things that other companies can do? What we’re very attuned to is the fact that the marketplace is changing, consumer preference are changing and you’ve got new disruptors that we wouldn’t have thought of talking about for – just need to pickup any automotive press and those names associated with the future of autonomous vehicles we would have historically not associated with automotive at all; Apple, Google, et cetera. So it’s clear that we need to be equipped to be very nimble, which is why we put the focus of our employees that it’s innovation at all levels. But I think that needs to merge before we make decisions around make-buy for example. Those really are decisions you make when you really understand what it is you’re going to kind of deliver. The important thing is first to understand what technologies are going to be winning, what customer deliverables will be like, products, services, combinations are really going to be winning. And once you understand that, then I think we can decide how we play in those different areas. We do accept it’s going to change. I think Ford wants to be – change should be our ally, should be our part of our winning formula. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
