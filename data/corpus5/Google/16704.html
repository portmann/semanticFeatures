Don't Over Think It: Buy Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Last week I initiated a position in MSFT at $41.46. The stock is trading at recent support and offering investors a 3% dividend yield. I discuss the pros and cons of a Microsoft investment and describe my personal journey that led me to my stake. Enjoy. If you follow my articles here you've probably noticed a bit of weariness, a tinge of anxiety associated with my short-term market outlook in some of my most recent pieces. This slightly bearish stance isn't because I'm questioning the quality of the businesses that I own. It isn't really about the valuation of the broader market either, though I do see certain areas that I consider to be overpriced. I worry about currency headwinds that many of the multinationals I hold are facing heading into this upcoming earnings season. I wouldn't be surprised to see unexpected misses in Q1 because of the strength of the dollar and related forex issues. But, I can deal with earnings misses. Actually, I rather enjoy them when they're based upon isolated events/short-term macro environment issues. The dips that oftentimes ensue from these short-term situations tend to create valuable buying opportunities for long-term shareholders. It is the irrational swings that I'm seeing, especially in traditionally stable dividend growth names, based not on business results, but on what has become known as "Fed speak" related to interest rates, that has begun to bother me. This unpredictability is worrisome and has caused me to consider taking some profits off of the table. That said, when managing a dividend growth portfolio, the idea of selling shares, even after they've appreciated nicely, is a daunting thought because it disrupts one's income stream. When making management decisions I have to weigh my top priority, protecting the capital, with my very close second priority, fostering an environment conducive to healthy compounding via the regular re-investment of reliable increasing dividends. When I start feeling a little antsy I have to remind myself that by owning the very high quality companies with predictable earnings and strong commitments towards directly rewarding shareholders with cash, I am protecting my capital about as well as one possibly can in an unpredictable market. Knowing this allows for me to remain calm and ignore the anxious voices that creep into my head from time to time. Although I sometimes question the validity of my holdings and strongly consider taking profits and/or liquidating positions who've out performed my expectations, for the most part, I always sided with the part of me focused on maintaining my income stream rather than the part that's attempting to time the market. One of the oldest sayings in the book of successful investment strategies is "buy low, sell high." However, this sentiment becomes problematic when you realize that only through hindsight are you able to know whether or not you truly bought low or sold high. I'm not saying that one should never pull the trigger and sell. But, what I am saying, is that if history is to be used as a guide, in the majority of situations, the "top" when it comes to very high quality companies is always in the future. It is important to remember this when considering the sale of quality winners. Excelsior! It is also important to be able to understand the difference between a very high quality company and a very high quality stock. For me, the first of those two things is absolutely necessary for stock ownership. The latter is nearly as important though; over the long-term I believe holding high quality companies, even if they were bought at somewhat overpriced valuations, will end in success. This is the nature of very high quality companies: in the marketplace, they find a way to come out on top. That said, when an investor is able to find high quality, dividend paying companies trading at, or even better, below their fair values, this is the sweet spot for fostering long-term compounding. So, this run up brings me to a recent trade I made: the liquidation of my stake in Conagra (NYSE: CAG ). I initiated my CAG position on February 12th, 2014 at $29.00. At the time the stock was yielding 3.45%. The stock had paid out a $0.25 quarterly dividend for 6 straight quarters, needing to increase its dividend soon to continue its current streak of increase annual dividends for 6 consecutive years. Unfortunately for shareholders, it didn't. CAG has now paid a $0.25 quarterly dividend for 10 consecutive quarters, ending its annualized streak, and removing itself from the "Challengers" section of David Fish's U.S. Dividend Champions list. When I bought shares, I was hoping to see the dividend increase. I was happy with the high yield and willing to wait and see. I was also happy to have picked up shares after a sharp sell-off; the stock was trading at $34 in mid-January of 2014, a month later the stock was down 15% after cutting its FY14 guidance by 5%. The extent of this sell-off seemed overdone. Even with the lowered guidance the stock was trading at 13x forward earnings at my $29 entry point. This was below historical levels for this company and also lower than its peers at the time. I felt like this dip was irrational and the stock was due to recover with time, because of multiple expansion back to normal levels, if nothing else. Another thing you've probably noticed if you follow my articles is my passion for responsible food production and healthy eating/living. I believe that the health food trend that has been going on in America over the last several years is not a flash in the pan, but is here to stay. There is too much scientific data related to the rise of chronic disease being associated with highly processed and unnatural edibles for me to think otherwise. Needless to say, Conagra isn't the sort of food company that I am overly bullish on moving forward. I think CAG and its peers will continue to face growth headwinds and as a long-term investor, this segment of the market is not a place I like having my money parked. Here is a list of the brands owned by CAG. As an investor I like it when I use the products and/or services that the companies I own offer in my day to day life, it makes the investment seem more personal (it also helps me to justify spending money sometimes, knowing that I'm doing my tiny-weeny part to support earnings growth). Looking at the brands CAG has to offer I realized that I don't really use any of them. I eat a Bertolli's frozen dinner from time to time, and my absolute favorite, nostalgic guilty pleasure is a Chef-Boyardee pizza with that wonderful sauce with little pepperonis in it (if you've never experienced the joy of Chef-Boyardee pizza do yourself a favor and try one, make sure to buy extra cheese and toppings because what comes in the box isn't enough). I can't tell you how many of these pizza's my parents made for my brother and I growing up. It was always a good night in the Ward household on those nights for sure. That said, boyhood memories aside, I typically steer clear of CAG's brands when browsing the grocery store isles. So, when looking over my holdings considering positions to sell in an attempt to raise cash, Conagra stood out. The lack of dividend growth was a red flag. When a company I own cuts its dividend, that's a sure-fire way to trigger a sell; a frozen dividend doesn't make it a foregone conclusion, however it doesn't bode well in that company's favor. The fact that I was up 21% on my original investment (plus the $1.00/share worth of dividends I have collected from CAG over the previous year) also aided me in my sell-side thought process. Because of the lack of dividend growth and the appreciation in share price, the yield had become less attractive as well. I would much rather sell a winner than a loser. I know others disagree and think its best to let winners run, but I'd rather lock is profits and lock in losses. I sold my shares on March 20th, at $35.09. CAG was guiding for negative growth again with regard to FY15 EPS and was trading at 16x forward estimates. I felt like my margin of safety from a fundamental standpoint was diminished and I was happy to exit my stake having executed my original plan. With cash in hand I was confident that I would be able to find another undervalued opportunity with better dividend growth prospects. It was bound to happen this way, I have a history of selling stock at the precisely wrong time. This is why I don't do it much (I once sold ZipCar shares the day before it was announced they were being acquired by Avis, at a hefty premium). It just so happens that not one week after I was happily skipping away from my CAG stake, money in hand, the 3G/Berkshire (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) acquisition of Kraft (NASDAQ: KRFT ) was announced, fueling a rally across the packaged food industry. Conagra took part in this rally and is now worth almost 5% more than it was not long ago when I sold it. That skipping was short lived. Now obviously, I had no way of knowing that this deal was in the works. Since Berkshire's acquisition of Heinz a few years back, I sort of always expected it to continue to add to its food industry exposure. These businesses scale well and what better management system and guidance could a company have in place than Berkshire's? I was selfishly hoping that Buffett's next target would be the J.M. Smucker Co (NYSE: SJM ). I am long SJM and thought that this iconic American company with an $11.8B market cap would fit nicely into the cross hairs of Buffett's elephant gun. I knew that the unexpected run up that SJM experienced after its Big Heart Pet Brands acquisition earlier in the year hurt these imaginary prospects; Buffett likes to buy low, not high. That said, the Kraft news was still a big surprise and I would like to wish a hearty congratulations to all those who were long KRFT, 45% later (obviously the market didn't foresee this deal happening either), I'm sure you all are grinning ear to ear. Although I was a bit disappointed with the timing of the deal and the extra 5% I missed out on with regard to my CAG sale, I was still pleased when reading between the lines of the press release to see evidence that leads me to believe that I am correct about the general direction that this industry is heading, especially domestically. Kraft Chairman and CEO, John Kahill, had this to say about the merger, "This combination offers significant cash value to our shareholders and the opportunity to be investors in a company very well positioned for growth, especially outside the United States, as we bring Kraft's iconic brands to international market." Benardo Hees, Heinz CEO had this to say: "We are thrilled about the unique opportunities this merger will create for our consumers worldwide, as well as our employees and business partners. Together, Heinz and Kraft will be able to achieve rapid expansion while delivering the quality, brands and products that our consumers love." The trend here is the focus on international growth. Managing partner at 3G and Chairman of Heinz, Alex Behring mentioned both domestic and international growth when he spoke of the deal but I think it is clear that the major reason this merger makes so much sense is the fact that these companies need less saturated markets for their products. Rather than fighting against the headwinds domestically they are taking the path of lease resistance, finding growth elsewhere. There is speculation that further consolidation will occur (and this consolidation will involve premiums paid by the purchaser). That said, I can't help but wonder if the Kraft deal means that there is one less major buyer in the market now for a large packaged food company. Moving On...There Is No Use Crying Over Spilled Milk Will CAG continue to rally, further teaching me a lesson about trying time the market and selling stock? Maybe. That said, even though I would have loved to make that trade this week rather than last, I don't regret liquidating a position that wasn't helping me achieve my goal of a reliably increase income stream, especially not after a 20% gain. When I sold those shares, I didn't have a plan for the cash I raised. Honestly, (I'm not just saying this because of the KRFT deal) I was considering taking the CAG money and moving it directly into KRFT, a similar company that offers better dividend growth prospects. I like Kraft's brand portfolio a bit more than CAG's. I've got a bad habit of eating Kraft Velveeta Mac and Cheese. But, I wasn't going to sell one company trading at 16x forward earnings and buy a similar one trading at 19x forward earnings, even if I liked the dividend better. No, I decided to pass on KRFT and stick with cash...another reason I'm a bit sour about this whole deal. There is a silver lining though. As the packaged foods space rallied, the NASDAQ sold off. I wasn't necessarily thinking that I would put this cash to work so soon, but like I said before, I'm always happy to buy value when I see it, especially when a healthy dividend is involved. I've you've been thinking, "I clicked on this article to read about Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), what gives?", you're about to get your wish. Microsoft has always been on the periphery of my radar. Although this is a company that many love to hate because of its (perceived) under performance in terms of growth, especially after it essentially missed the bus when it came to mobile, I still believe that MSFT is an American icon worth owning. This is the sort of company, especially from a dividend growth investing standpoint, that I feel comfortable making a core level position in my portfolio. This is why, after MSFT sold off 5% in just a few days, taking it down to the 3% yield threshold, I decided to put my CAG cash back to work, initiating a position in the company at $41.46. This purchase equates to roughly half of a full position in my portfolio. In a risk-off market environment, as an income oriented investor I have three basic options available to me. One, ignore the perceived risk, admit that I have no business attempting to time the market, and only make changes to my portfolio when dividends are cut (which is essentially an automatic sell trigger), two, trust my gut and reduce equity exposure, moving select positions to cash until valuations drop towards acceptable levels, acknowledging that income will be less, or three, re-balance my holdings, moving out of select positions that are deemed lesser quality, from either a business or dividend growth standpoint, and re-allocate those funds towards companies of a higher quality, effectively maintaining, if not increasing, my portfolio's ability to generate income while bolstering my defenses. I decided to go with the prize behind door number 3. This Microsoft' purchase was about improving the quality of my portfolio. I believe I have done so from both an overall company quality and dividend growth standpoint. This is what the "don't over think it" series of articles I've written lately is about: understanding, and more importantly, accepting, that for the long-term investor, buying and holding high quality companies (the other two companies covered in this series were Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T )) when they become available for fair value is in one's best interests. Sure, it is great to buy these sorts of companies when they are on fire sales. This is why I always maintain a cash balance, so that I am able to capitalize on the market's folly. That said, success in the markets doesn't require this sort of perfect timing. Investors don't need to stress over squeezing every last drop out of their investment decisions. This is what I have to force myself to remember when scanning the market for deals, when fair value appears in a company like Microsoft, don't over think it, add exposure and let the company work for you. MSFT's 2.99% yield at my purchase price was higher than CAG's 2.85% yield at my time of sale. This is a bonus, albeit a small one. What really attracts me to MSFT is its fortress-like balance sheet and the dividend growth prospects that this enables it to have. In the company's recent Q2 report MSFT showed $90.25B in cash and short term securities on the balance sheet. This is up from the $83.95B reported one year ago. Now, most of this money is currently trapped overseas. But, I'm not going to fault the company for that. When it comes down to it, I feel comfortable owning shares of such a wonderful company. I'm happy to have bought them on weakness and expect to hold them for a long while. Morningstar gives the company a AAA credit rating. I consider this to be a defensive holding. The company is in the midst of a 12 year annual dividend increase streak and MSFT's 3% yield will be a welcome component of my income stream moving forward. MSFT is currently trading slightly below my recent purchase price. Shares closed last week at $40.97. The company is trading 18.13% down from its recent 52 week high of $50.04 achieved in November of last year. This sell-off is based off of a disappointing Q2 where the company came in-line on the top line and beat on the bottom with an EPS of $0.71 and $26.47B in revenues. This revenue figure was up almost 8% y/y, but EPS was down from $0.78 in Q2 FY14. The company claimed a $0.02 restructuring charge related to Nokia, meaning that MSFT management might argue that they did indeed beat on both the top and bottom lines. Either way, the EPS growth y/y was negative and this doesn't bode well for full year EPS growth after the company's negative growth posted in Q1 last October. Yahoo Finance tracks 29 analysts that follow MSFT stock and the average FY15 EPS estimate is $2.39. This average estimate is 9% lower than the $2.63 EPS that MSFT posted for FY14. That said, from a dividend standpoint I don't worry about coverage or growth potential. The company's current payout ratio using the forward EPS estimates is 51%. MSFT's ttm free cash flow/share is $3.24, meaning that the current $1.24 annual dividend payment is safety covered. MSFT's 5 year dividend growth rate is 16.59%. The most recent dividend increase was 10.7%, from $0.28/share to $0.31/share. MSFT typically declares its dividend increases in June and I expect another increase in the 10% range; another $0.03 increase to $0.34/share would represent a 9.68% increase, anything above that would exceed short term expectations for me. But, before we get ahead of ourselves, back to the disappointing Q2 earnings report. One major concern for investors was the 2% drop to $10.7B in commercial licensing revenue. This segment of the company makes up roughly 40% of total revenue. Its never a good thing when such an important segment posts negative growth. The company attempts to gloss over this revenue drop by focusing on the overall commercial revenue which came in at $13.3B for the quarter, which represents 5% growth y/y. This growth was aided by Microsoft's successful ventures into the cloud space. Commercial cloud revenue increased 114%, driven by Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online. This is an area where the company expects to see continued growth; cloud revenue now equates to a $5.5B annual run rate. This focus on cloud growth is especially positive in my eyes in light of recent news with regard to lower PC demand across the business sector. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has withdrawn its forward guidance because of the apparent severity of this issue. Shares of Intel are down sharply on the news and Microsoft will likely be effected negatively as well. It is important that MSFT continues to re-invent itself and I think its success in the cloud space is one of, if not the greatest achievement, of Satya Nadella's short stint as CEO. Investors must decided whether or not they think the continued rise of cloud related revenues will be enough to off set the potential for this negative PC demand to become a long-term trend, meaning that this drop in traditional commercial licensing revenue for MSFT would become an ongoing issue, rather than an isolated event. I've decided to side with the company's management in this regard. Their excitement about the cloud potential and its continued growth has me convinced that for the long-term, this is the space to be excelling in. MSFT will still rely on commercial licensing for a large portion of its revenue base for some times; however, I am happy with a more diversified revenue stream and you won't hear me complaining about triple digit growth. Another Q2 negative was MSFT's lowered guidance for Q3. As quoted by Seeking Alpha's market current , Microsoft guides: "for its reporting units to collectively have FQ3 revenue of $20.6B-$21.4B, below a $23.8B total revenue consensus. Corporate/other revenue, which totaled $314M in FQ2, isn't included in the guidance. Forex is expected to hurt revenue growth by ~4%." Although this lowered guidance is disappointing I see two potential silver linings. One being the potential for exceeding low expectations set by conservative guidance. And two, even in the event that revenue comes in on the low side of this disappointing guidance, it will still represent y/y growth; MSFT's Q3 revenue in 2014 was $20.4B. To me, some growth is better than no growth at all. The forex piece isn't surprising to me. I think the first half of this year will be tough for all multinational companies. I believe that with time these forex issues will sort themselves out with time. I don't think that such a strong dollar is the new normal. I will continue to monitor MSFT's response to a changing forex environment; however my primary focus is on the performance of its business segments and some of the upcoming catalysts I see for the stock. Also, before I move on, I should mention that it wasn't all bad during Q2. The MSFT's devices and consumer segment posted solid growth: 8% to $12.9B. This performance was lead by Office 365 subscriber growth, up 30%. Surface revenue came in at $1.1B, up 24% y/y, driven by the Surface Pro 3. And lastly, and probably most unexpectedly for me, search revenue grew 23% with Bing capturing a 19.7% market share (up 150 basis points y/y). If I'm being honest, I don't even remember the last time I considered using Bing. My mind it hard wired to type in "Google". I am excited about the upcoming Windows 10 launch. This could be a pivotal moment in MSFT's history, especially coming off of a disappointing Windows 8 OS. It seems to me that Windows 10 will be revolutionary in its ability to mesh well with consumers lives. This OS is slated to span across all Microsoft devices that one might use on a day to day basis. To me, this is why iOS has been so effective over the years, the inter-connectivity is available within the ecosystem on Apple products. This is the way of the world. This is what the market expects these days, for their devices to seam flawlessly together, improving the efficiency of their lives. This is MSFT's plan. Their slogan for the new OS is, "Windows 10 isn't for all of us, but for each of us." I am also intrigued by the company's aggressive stance on implementing this new OS in the market. Microsoft is giving consumers a free upgrade offer for qualifying Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 devices that upgrade in the first year of the new system. This upgrade will be supported for the life of the current device. The fact that the company is willing to give the new system away to the majority of the current MSFT devices out there means that the company is confident about consumer acceptance. There is massive turnover with technological devices. I like the idea of getting the market hooked on Windows 10 immediately, growing and securing market share, and then (theoretically) these consumers will continue to buy MSFT devices or at least Windows 10 packages when they upgrade their personal devices. Windows 10 really seems to have the consumer in mind. It will work with the Xbox system, on mobile phones, offering a universal app marketplace (direct competition with Google Play Store on Android devices), and even with the new age Microsoft HoloLens (MSFT claims to be ushering in the new era of holographic computing into our practical, everyday lives). I like the universal app idea. I think this too could potential help MSFT's market share on the hardware side of things if done well. I don't know if I'm totally sold on the HoloLens idea yet; however, I am happy to see their foresight and the wide range of capabilities offered by Windows 10. Other geniuses in the tech space, namely Mark Zuckerberg, seem to believe that alternate reality will be one of the next revolutionary changes that the digital power of the "internet of things" will bring to our lives. It seems far fetched to me, but who knows? I'm just happy to see MSFT on board with their holographic computing technology, if Zuckerberg is right, I don't want to see Microsoft miss this boat like they did with mobile. With all of this said, I do worry a bit that the company is focusing a bit too much on the consumer, rather than on the commercial side of things (which has historically been this company's bread and butter). However, this new model seems resemble Apple's, and who can argue with that company's success and near cult status in the eyes of the consumer? Nadella and crew aren't only being aggressive with the release of their newest OS; MSFT's current buyback program is also a positive in my eyes. At the end of the company's fiscal year last June it was announced that there was $35.1B left of the current $40B buyback authorization. It has also been announced that the company expects to complete with $40B buyback buy December, 31, 2016. This equates to sizable shareholder returns and the reduction of share count over the next two years. As you can see on the graph below, MSFT has reduced its outstanding shares by 23% over the last 10 years. Before I mentioned Microsoft's AAA credit rating. Well, the company recently put that reputation to work with a bond offering in February, selling almost $11B in debt. The cash raised from this sale will be used for general corporate purposes, one of which being, buybacks. I like the company leveraging debt with rates so low (and seemingly ready to rise). This $10.75B long-term debt sale in 2015 comes after a year where the company did sold zero debt. It seems as though MSFT management is striking while the iron is hot in terms of low interest rates; I think this is sound financial practice and I'm happy to see the company willing to take on what seems to be very cost effective risk. Conclusion: Don't Take My Word For it So, lets do a quick recap here. We have a $336B market cap company offering investors a 3% yield with strong dividend growth prospects trading down nearly 20% from its 52 week highs, right around support in the $40 range. MSFT's ttm P/E ratio is 16.5x at the current stock price. EPS is 2015 is expected to slump a bit, but 2016 estimates are overly bullish with a $2.90 consensus estimate (the expected range is $2.51-$3.51). This $2.90 estimate means that the company is trading at 14x 2016 earnings. The stock faces near-term headwinds in its industry and in a more macro sense, with foreign exchange issues. That said, this company has been a solid performer for decades and remains one of the strongest players in the tech space. I believe the stock is trading right around fair value in this $40 area. Some believe it will trade lower, into the mid 30's. If it does so, I will buy the other half of my position at those levels and be a happy camper collecting a yield on cost above 3%. But, like I said, you don't have to take my word for it. I think its important to consider all of the other opinions on the matter, especially those by the professionals in the analyst industry. According to Yahoo Finance , the majority of the 31 analysts covering the stock are overly bullish with an average price target of 47.06, which represents nearly 15% upside from here. The low end of the estimate range is $38.00 and the high end is $55.00, meaning that downside risk is seemingly low at this point in time. This bullish sentiment is shared by the 22 analysts tracked by TipRanks whose average price target is $48.50 (over 18% upside). And, it isn't just the professionals who are bullish on Microsoft after its Q2 sell-off. The bloggers tracked by TipRanks generally have positive opinions on the stock as well with 109 out of 127 coming down on the bullish side of the fence. And finally, the apparent undervalued nature of MSFT stock is solidified by the fair value calculations made by Morningstar and S&P Capital IQ, coming in at $46 and $49 respectively.
