Facebook: Hyper-Targeted Ads Are Very Effective - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Instagram is still banned in China but the photo sharing app is now emerging as a potent medium for video ads. The Instagram platform just received its first 3-D video ad from Jameson Irish Whiskey. Hyper-targeted ads help Facebookâ€™s deliver more relevant and actionable ads. Jameson Irish Whiskey introduced the first 3-D video ad on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Even though Instagram, like Facebook, is still banned in China , the photo-sharing app's global popularity is now evolving into a potential strong revenue stream for Facebook. Video ads were live last October on Instagram. The groundbreaking 3-D video ad from Jameson reeks of genuine interest from an advertiser looking to stand out in the Instagram ecosystem. The creative Jameson ad was made possible by close collaboration between Jameson's ad agency, 360i, and Facebook's advertising group. The more important thing is that the Jameson whiskey ad was also an example of Facebook's ability to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements down to the local neighborhood level. The 360i team leveraged the Location Awareness feature of Facebook's advertising platform so that the Jameson ad got delivered to users near New York local drinking bars. The location tool was only available to the Facebook version of the 3-D video ad but I look forward to it being enabled on Instagram soon. Letting advertisers target local neighborhoods with creative video ads should please shareholders of Facebook. The user base of Instagram is composed of office workers, kids, housewives, students and small shop owners located in different areas. However, hyper-targeting ads to inundate a specific area is one way for advertisers to promote their products where they are consumed. Location-based mobile advertising was proven to influence the offline shopping behavior of people. Jameson delivered its ads to people near New York City bars precisely because it wants those people to act and go to the said bars and buy some shots of Jameson Irish whiskey. Facebook's mobile advertising platform needs these hyper-targeted local-centric ads to keep the loyalty of ad agencies and advertisers. Product advertising is more effective when target users can immediately act or buy the marketed product easily from a nearby retail shop. Since Facebook cannot compete with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) on web/search advertising, fortifying its mobile advertising business is the only way for the company to continue its momentum. More than 1 billion users will access their Facebook accounts through a mobile device this year. The chart from eMarketer below illustrates that Facebook needs to expand its location awareness tool for advertisers to other countries. The gold mine in mobile advertising is not limited to the U.S.A. India will have more mobile Facebook users than America by 2018. Instagram advertising is also not yet available in Asia, Latin America, Africa and most of Europe. This is a weakness on the part of Facebook. Instagram and Facebook's core apps are still banned in China, but the Asia Pacific and Latin American markets are strong growth drivers for mobile ad spending. ZenithOptiMedia's chart below ranks the top non-U.S. growth regions for advertising until the end of 2017. ZenithOptimedia reveals that foreign markets are already multi-billion opportunities for mobile advertising players like Facebook. Kindly study the charts below to appreciate my hypothesis that Facebook could really benefit if its accelerates implementation of its local awareness advertising program to more countries. Facebook is not yet the leader in global mobile advertising. Google is still the king of mobile advertising. Google is also aggressively expanding its Android One project to gain the next billion pair of mobile advertising eyeballs from emerging markets. Tardiness on the part of Facebook (when it comes to emerging markets) could mean it will remain second-best in mobile advertising. Google's mobile advertising efforts now also include deep linking between mobile apps. This is the same technology that Facebook uses in App Links . Facebook's recent acquisition of TheFind's search engine already eliminates the annoyance of redundant mobile ads. Adding 3-D video advertising and hyper-targeted ad delivery are another two solid tailwinds for Facebook. Catching up with Google in the mobile advertising business requires Facebook to accelerate expansion of its advertising services to include emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Facebook's management should also take into account that Google is very much aware that 50% of mobile search queries are for local information. It will be hard for global advertisers to abandon Google if Facebook continues to limit its advertising location tool inside the U.S. In spite of the ban in China, Instagram still managed to get 300 million users by end of 2014. Instagram is a great vehicle for Facebook's hyper-targeted ads, not only through videos but also via web-linked images. Instagram is emerging as a top advertising medium. Brands are now finding Instagram a better venue to connect with their fans and customers. Three million U.S. teens quit Facebook from 2011 to 2014. However, that teen demographic now rates Instagram 'the most important social network'. Marketers and advertising campaign planners will love Statista s report that impulsive buyers like the teen demographic is big on Instagram. Sixteen percent of total global internet users aged 16-24 used Instagram. Instagram penetration is also higher in the Middle East/Africa than in America. Facebook really needs to expand Instagram ads to include more countries. Source: Facebook: Hyper-Targeted Ads Are Very Effective Disclosure: The author is long FB.
