Intel And Google Sticks Unlikely To Revolutionize Computing | Seeking Alpha Intel and Google are looking to shake up the market with USB stick computers. However, due to the limited number of applications in which the concept is actually useful, the products are unlikely to cause much of a revolution in mobile computing. Fortunately, neither company actually needs the product to be a huge success, as their respective core businesses continue to perform adequately. It's been a while since there has been a true innovation in computing. Arguably, the last time the industry was really shaken up was the rise of the smartphone, which led to a steady decrease in PC sales. Now, there seems to be something new: a computer on a stick. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are both offering a USB stick that can turn any display device into a computer. Although it is an interesting idea, it is likely to remain more of a novelty than an actual game-changer. Both Intel and Google, the latter in partnership with Asus, will soon start selling computers on a USB stick. Intel's product is rather unimaginatively dubbed the Compute Stick, and Google's offering has been christened the Chromebit. Both are meant to do roughly the same thing, although there is a bit of a difference in specs and price tag. Intel's Compute Stick seems to be the technologically superior offering. It rocks a quad-core Atom processor based on the Z3735F Bay Trail chip, clocking in at 1.33 Ghz, as well as 2 gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of flash storage, Bluetooth connectivity and 802.11b/g/n Wifi. With Windows 8.1, the stick will cost around $149, while the less powerful Linux version costs $89. The Chromebit has roughly the same specs as the new Chromebook Flip, featuring a quad-core Rockchip 3288 processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM, and 16 gigabytes of storage. It has an edge over the Compute Stick in terms of Wi-Fi, with 802.11ac connectivity, but the Compute Stick has more storage space. In any case, the Chromebit is considerably cheaper at around $100. It is no great surprise that the major players in computing want to get in on small-form. Especially the living room media space is becoming a battleground for computer companies who want to get their products and operating systems into people's homes. There are also other potential markets, such as schools and corporations, as the system is easy to set up on any HDMI-enabled display device. Users expecting a high-powered USB stick PC will be disappointed. Intel has suggested the stick be used for "light productivity, social networking, Web browsing, and streaming media or games." Also, it could provide a low-cost solution for business computing. However, there doesn't seem to be a specific niche that the product is filling. The fact that it still needs a screen and a range of peripherals to operate means that it takes up roughly as much space as a small notebook. If you add up the price of all these components, it isn't actually much cheaper than a small notebook. Also, it is not actually much more portable than a laptop, considering that one is reliant on the availability of a display device, unless you fancy taking one with you. Although being able to turn a TV into a computer is convenient, especially for living room purposes, the ubiquity of mobile computing devices such as tablets and smartphones suggests that demand may be limited. USB stick computing is for now likely to remain more of a novelty than an actual alternative to other mobile computing solutions. Fortunately for these two heavyweights, they don't really need these new products to be much of a success, as their core businesses are still chugging along. While Intel is still losing money on its mobile division, losses totaling over $4 billion last year largely due to incentives paid to tablet manufacturers to use Intel chips, this was more than offset by the $14 billion in profits recorded by its PC division for the year. For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 39% jump in profit. Google is also not exactly dependent on the success of the Chromebit, reliant as it is on advertising revenue. However, many commentators worry about its struggles in the mobile ad space . While Google still has a dominant market share, Facebook is increasingly making headway while Google's share of the pie is shrinking. Nevertheless, Google is still not exactly facing bankruptcy any time soon, full-year 2014 revenue up 19% to $66 billion. Recently, Intel and Google announced a new type of gizmo: a computer on a USB stick. The ability to turn any display device into a full-fledged PC is compelling. However, the fact that one still needs a display device as well as a range of peripherals means that in terms of price and portability, there is not actually much of a revolution going on here. As such, it is likely that these products will remain more of a novelty item than an actual replace for notebooks and tablets. However, neither of these tech giants really need the product to be a great success, and continued growth in their respective core businesses means they are still attractive investments.
