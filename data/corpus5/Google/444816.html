Everybody Already Hates iPhone 7, So Prepare To Buy Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IPhone 7 has already been cast by the media as a failure. Meanwhile, Apple has been knocked down by the Brexit sell off as well. We think peak iPhone hatred will happen upon iPhone 7 release and that long term oriented investors should wait for Apple to trade with an $80 handle and then buy. We think the iPhone 7 is going to flop with sales and in the media, and we think peak hatred for this phone is going to create an extraordinary buying opportunity in the high $80's, prior to the iPhone 8 narrative beginning. Expectations for the iPhone 7 have been extraordinarily low, and likely for good reason. The announcement that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was not going to be making any mass of upgrades to the phone has already turned off consumers, us included, to the concept of upgrading. The 7, while not branded a "flop" yet because we don't yet have sales data, is certainly being questioned by the media more than any other model we've seen. Here's a taste of what Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has offered on the iPhone 7. Querying the phone on its own shows many articles calling it into question. Querying the phone with the word "flop" or asking whether its worth the upgrade from the iPhone 6 produces a litany of results. Most are murky sounding, at best. Throughout the iPhone 7 news cycle so far, all we have been hearing about is the iPhone 8. We have heard about how much better it is going to be and we have heard that it will be the upgrade worth waiting for. We look forward to fantastic sales and an upgrade worth getting excited about from Apple with the iPhone 8, but what does that mean for us now? To quickly lay out some of the "improvements" Apple is offering with the iPhone 7, it is rumored to have, 32GB as the base option and a 256GB maximum option But it really looks as thought the iPhone 8 is the model that both consumers and (more importantly) the media is going to be looking for. People are looking for that stunning design upgrade, perhaps incorporating a curved screen or a front phone face where almost all of the surface area is display. Those seekers will have to wait for the next iteration of the iPhone. In many ways, the coming of the iPhone 7 at this point in time is a perfect union with how the market is acting overall. People generally just seem bemused, and are waiting for something big to come along to shake them out of their seats. We don't think this is going to happen for the market, and we don't think the iPhone 7 is going to be that product that does this for Apple. So, the release of the iPhone 7 and this period in time may just be a match made in heaven. But with mire and muck can sometimes come opportunity for those looking to stake their claim in a rock solid company for the long term. We have no doubt, especially backed by Mac and iPad, that Apple will be a great investment over the course of the long term, for years to come. The iPhone 7 may give those who missed the last upchurn cycle in AAPL stock their chance to enter. We believe both media sentiment and Apple stock will both wax and wane, with the release of the iPhone 7 likely coming at a nice pullback for the markets (we predict the markets will sell off another 10% for sure at least), and it will definitely come during a lull in excitement for Apple. This sets up a period where the stock could keep falling as Apple churns ready to head into the iPhone 8 media cycle, which will probably start 6 months to a year prior to its release. We also predict the phone will be a smash hit. We believe this is going to set up for an nadir of sorts when the iPhone 7 could drag Apple to multiyear lows at the very same time that the market is also putting pressure on the company stock. It is at this point that we believe the very beginning of sentiment change will happen moving into the iPhone 8, and we believe this will be the point to go in and buy Apple. Apple doesn't need a lot of pressure to create a buying opportunity because it's P/E is already constantly too low. The ability to buy this company with a forward P/E at, near, or under 9x would be an absolute gift. We think the iPhone 7 could make that happen. We know that Apple is already suffering slightly due to the volatility coming from the United Kingdom exiting Europe. There has been a small pullback in shares that we think is worth taking a small nibble at. However, we think that investors are going to get an opportunity to buy Apple in the high $80 range once we hit an area called "peak iPhone seven hatred". We wouldn't be surprised if Buffett adds to his shares at this point, as well. We don't think actual hatred of the iPhone 7 is going to be enormous, but we do think it is going to get a serious play in the upcoming news cycle that accompanies the release. The media has already branded the iPhone 7 to be a failure before it has even launched, and we think the media is going to pound this narrative mercilessly after the 7 is released and moving forward from that point. Catching Apple stock at peak iPhone 7 hatred prior to the iPhone 8 narrative starting is going to be the key, we think. Similar to the way people sell the news, we think that there will be a peak moment of hatred right after the phones release that is going to drive Apple stock lower similar to the way the stock always winds up turning lower during the middle of product release events. We'll be watching for our opportunity. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
