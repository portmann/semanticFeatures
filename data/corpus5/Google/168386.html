Straight Path Communications Update: First The FCC And Now Verizon's News - Straight Path Communications Inc. (NYSEMKT:STRP) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 10, 2015 12:50 PM ET  |  About: Straight Path Communications Inc. (STRP) , Includes: ALU , ERIC , NOK , QCOM , SSNLF , VZ by: Ryan Crane Verizonâ€™s announcement both validates Straight Path's M&A thesis and accelerates the timeline. Verizonâ€™s chosen partners are very publicly huge proponents for using Straight Pathâ€™s LMDS and 39 GHz spectrum for 5G. Straight Path is the largest holder of 39 GHz spectrum, with over 95% of the active licenses. On August 6, I posted on SA Straight Path (NYSEMKT: STRP ): FCC Move Bullish for the Stock ." I posted this article following FCC Chairman Wheeler's favorable comments regarding the potential inclusion of millimeter wave spectrum for use in 5G wireless networks. I further wrote in August: "New spectrum requires years of network planning construction to deploy, and carriers typically buy spectrum 2-5 years before actually deploying it. With the commercial rollout of 5G slated for 2020 , I would anticipate Straight Path will have M&A options by 4Q 2018 at the latest. The big four carriers (Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Sprint (NYE:S S )) would certainly be potential buyers. Internet companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are already actively investigating millimeter wave mobile wireless, and could also be interested in acquiring an immediately available national footprint of millimeter wave spectrum licenses." I believe yesterday's Verizon announcement both increases the likelihood and accelerates the timing of my conclusions in my August 6th article. This week, Verizon announced that it will be testing 5G wireless services next year (2016) and anticipates commercial deployment of 5G by 2017. Now, the largest wireless carrier in the US has publicly stated their intention of going full force into the development and deployment of a 5G network. While multiple bands are most likely going to be part of any 5G network, given comments from FCC Chairman Wheeler and Verizon's technology partners' public comments, I believe that millimeter wave bands will have an important function within the next generation 5G network. With an increased likelihood of inclusion into the 5G framework, and STRP's portfolio of millimeter wave spectrum currently trading at a valuation of less than 0.1% of the most recent auction prices for mobile spectrum, I believe STRP is an attractive risk/reward proposition. I believe this is a very bullish development as it relates to STRP for two reasons: 1) timing and 2) the technology partners selected. I had originally projected a 2020 timeframe which was consistent with South Korean and Japanese carrier's targets of 2018 for a limited release of 5G and a full deployment scheduled for 2020. Verizon stated that they intend to target initial commercial deployment in 2017, several years ahead of my original expectation. In their announcement, Verizon indicated that their 5G wireless service will offer "single millisecond" latency and "50 times the throughput of current 4G LTE." Verizon's partners that are developing the equipment have publicly stated their preferences for 28 and 39GHz spectrum to achieve these goals. To develop the technology, Verizon has partnered with Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU ), Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ), Nokia (NYSE: NOK ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). All have been extremely vocal about the need for 5G. Incidentally, all also have focused on achieving 5G performance by accessing the enormous bandwidth of millimeter wave spectrum. Indeed, Verizon's Roger Gurnani told CNET in an interview last week that "5G will require big bands of spectrum," a clear parallel with what Verizon's new partners have been saying about 5G for over a year now. Verizon's chosen partners have publicly stated that they are proponents for using Straight Path's LMDS and 39 GHz spectrum for 5G: Samsung: "Participants in this proceeding, including existing licensees in the bands under consideration, have echoed Samsung's support for a licensed 5G regime in the 28 and 39 GHz bands." Qualcomm: "Qualcomm encourages the FCC to promptly issue band-specific Notices of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to exclusively license for mobile broadband services large blocks of spectrum currently assigned to the LMDS, 39 GHz and 37/42 GHz services." Ericsson : "The LMDS bands at 28GHz will be of particular interest to the mobile industry for systems that may follow 4G into higher frequency bands... over time the 38.6-40 GHz band could likely be harnessed in a way that is useful to industry. The operational characteristics that would be needed are similar to what has been detailed for the LMDS band.." All of this bodes very well for Straight Path. I believe that the equipment makers are going to drive the ultimate framework for 5G network development. From the quotes above it's apparent that there is a focus on millimeter wave bandwidths. Straight Path is the largest holder of 39 GHz spectrum, with over 95% of the active licenses. Straight Path is a clear winner from Verizon's push into 5G as it is currently trading at less than 0.1% of the most recent auction prices for mobile spectrum. "5G is no longer a dream of the distant future," said Roger Gurnani , executive vice president and chief information and technology architect for Verizon. "We feel a tremendous sense of urgency to push forward on 5G and mobilize the ecosystem by collaborating with industry leaders and developers to usher in a new generation of innovation."
