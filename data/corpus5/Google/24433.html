ETF Hub Apr  9 2015, 21:08 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Don't let recent merger challenges and failures fool you, Michael Wolff argues: "M&A mania" is coming to a media conglomerate near you amid pressure for a new wave of consolidation. "Perhaps never before has consolidation been so much the flavor of the month, nor has it seemed so difficult to get a taste," he writes. "The table is set, but nobody's sitting down to eat." If Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) fails in its bid for Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ), he notes, it just means other cablers will step up to match Comcast's ambition, and Comcast will still look for a way to stay dominant. He points to a number of mergers he thinks are easily imaginable: Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) and FOX ? Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX )? TWC and Charter (NASDAQ: CHTR )? Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA ) and, well, most anyone (Disney, Fox, CBS )? Factors encouraging the wave: Media's all about video now, and the pure-play aspect makes merger logic cleaner; distribution and content are separate and now even antagonistic businesses; the growth of over-the-top means not unbundling but re-bundling; and everyone needs scale for negotiation strength in content and ad deals. Other key players: John Malone ( LMCA , LBTYA , STRZA ); Verizon (NYSE: VZ ); Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ); Scripps Networks (NYSE: SNI ); Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ); DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ); Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ). Toll Brothers, Joy Global, Manitowoc, Comcast and General Electric highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day  - Press Releases Disney and Time Warner inc? (laugh) that not going to happen,especially when the latter is still healibg from the AoL merger and slimming-downs,once the largest media conglomerate it now trailing behind Disney (in terms of subsidiaries and brands) and 3rd in terms of revenue-from 6 businesses to 3-Mega businesses.However i can imagine Disney and Time Warner snatching one of Redstone's companies,especially Time Warner buying CBS.With that said,after all the slim-downs Time Warner are now acquiring companys from completing the 100% ownership of Shed Media to buy the 15-companies' Eyeworks Group,and soon maybe even buying Dreamworks Animation.Meanwhile Disney doesnt really need to do any M&A now except for their least profitable business-Disney Interactive.Comcast arent that big in terms of brands/subsidiaries like Disney and Time Warner inc so more M&A is needed same with Fox (which have weak assets-excluding the Fox tv network and the film studio). I think you can add (DWA) DreamWorks to your list. Recent attempts to merge with Softbank and Hasbro failed. The current success of the movie "Home" may have put off an M&A attempt or perhaps made (DWA) more attractive. According to Google Fiance, the market cap of TWC is 44.42B;  the market cap of  VZ is 200.32B. So maybe the other way around? Mike DWA is the best canidate on the entire list. Good call. I might roll the dice and park some money there. Mike DWA is the best canidate on the entire list. Good call. I might roll the dice and park some money there. Time Warner has antiquated system and hardware. All they have is captive viewers who will go over to Apple TV when the time is right. Who would acquire them?
