Facebook And Shareholders Face An Oculus Rift - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha A funny thing happened to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) on the way to $100. The company reported a beat on earnings last week that should have guaranteed it. Experts raised their price targets in anticipation. Facebook opened for trading on Monday at $93.50, $3.50 below where it ended just before the earnings were announced. The numbers themselves were good - earnings of $715 million, 25 cents per share, on revenues of $4 billion. Operating income of $1.27 billion represented over 30% of revenue - those are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) numbers. The experts, of course, had their excuses. Valuation is always a good one. Facebook is still trading at over 17 times its revenue, almost 100 times its earnings. And even if the top line is up over 25% from a year ago, there's a limit. Where that limit lies is always the question. Investors are still pushing Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) up past those limits, and they're still pushing Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) up past those limits. Notice a pattern here? That's right, video. But Facebook says they're all over video, that it's their video ad numbers, especially on mobile devices, that are really taking off. Sure, say the bears. But Facebook is showing numbers on ad-based video. Since earnings, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has also been hugging the flat line - down almost $40/share from the pop it got right after announcing its own results. It is ads that are the problem, add the bears. Facebook and Google are advertising companies. Amazon and Netflix get people to pay for what they offer. Maybe. But there's something else, I think, that is keeping Mr. & Mrs. Investor from going all-in on Facebook. That is, its future growth catalyst, Oculus Rift. Oculus has been at the heart of bearish Facebook speculation ever since it was acquired for $2 billion a year ago. Facebook is not the only company with 3-D technology - Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Google are all showing various versions of the technology. But we've been hearing about 3-D, in various forms, since a quarter century ago. I am old enough to remember when a young Jaron Lanier began pushing a "virtual reality" language based on 3-D, 30 years ago. I was even at the launch of the ill-fated Nimslo 3-D camera i n 1982 . It hasn't been worth the price, or the hassle of wearing special glasses meant that business models were hard to come by. The problem of the business model is helping keep the Oculus Rift down. Facebook has released a virtual reality cartoon that is seen with the glasses, and it is cool , but how much money do you get from a cartoon? Most people who have considered the headset think it to be best-suited for use by video gamers, but Facebook is not a video game company. Thus, investors wonder about the there, there. Yes, Instagram and WhatsApp are interesting, and yes, they feed the existing Facebook business model, but that model is fully-valued at the pre-earnings price of the stock. With companies like this, the lesson is, it's not just what have you done for me lately, it's what are you going to do for me next. Maybe the pros will turn out to be right, but when faced with a choice between the wisdom of experts and the wisdom of crowds, I usually follow the crowd.
