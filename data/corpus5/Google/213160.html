How Facebook Breaks $100 And Doesn't Look Back - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with a new Instant Article-like premium content program for advertisers and marketers. I believe this new program will see immediate and wide-ranging traction. Expect this offering to allow FB to prove out, via data, several market cap-adding outcomes of its platform as a result. As Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) nears the psychological and algorithmic barrier of $100, it's important to put into context what is likely the most important near-term driver of shares. For me, and apparently for Josh Constine who does a really good job breaking out the more colorful details in a recent TechCrunch article , this has to be Facebook's embedding of high-quality, rich content advertisements. For clarity, FB has been proactively covert about the development and roll-out of the optimized ads. Very similar to Instant Articles , Facebook is deploying differentiated advertisement offerings within the News Feed. That should be good enough to take shares a leg into the $100 mark. These News Feed-positioned, optimized ads are quite literally replications of the well-received and sought-after Instant Article publications that have become Facebook's "premium content" offering for publishers. The new ads give Facebook a chance to prove out several data points that could lead to it being incredibly lucrative. This will matter to investors. The big "must have" driver behind Instant Articles and the new ads are that, after a user clicks on them, the article or ad loads inside the Facebook app, not on a mobile web browser. They are what can most easily be described as "pre-loaded" for near instant loading (this is huge for keeping viewers interested) and that the articles provide significantly more ways to customize and engage. This includes features like more engaging content structuring (call to actions for engaging the user as well as for capturing the user's information), more options when it comes to device-led engagement (allowing the user to engage with the content by shifting their device, etc.) and unique placement (the News Feed "posts" are differentiated in presentation). All tools that advertisers and marketers love to have access to. Facebook, with all its new advertiser and marketer accountability (via its new reporting systems and data/analytics features), will work to prove several outcomes to advertisers and marketers. That advertising to the user within the News Feed is more lucrative to the paying party as opposed to sending the user off to the paying parties' website or app. That its new, premium ad platform (economics have not been released, but my guess is that these are charging a premium price) is worth the rates charged. That producing content exclusive to the ads is worth the manpower and risk of failure (no other publishing platform that I'm aware of has the ability to advertise so vibrantly within its own service, at least not yet as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) work on this ability in a joint venture ). Finally, that its premium offering can bring ancillary benefits (like increased visibility) to its non-premium offering. But that's not it. Facebook will bring itself more offensive and more defensive capacity simply by proving out the above, something that will make it more money (in volume and likely in average revenue per advertiser/marketer). That's right. By refining the way it makes money to be more geared towards a system that keep users on Facebook or within the Facebook app in effect makes FB as a whole equally more "sticky". By giving users fewer exit opportunities, say by following a user to the advertiser/marketer linked page, Facebook stands to make money at a higher frequency. Higher-frequency monetization means higher-volume payments. The company's key metrics should improve by keeping users on the website or app. While not a groundbreaking concept, the dynamic does need pointed out. Facebook's user time on website/app, engagements per user, ad impressions, abandonment rates (for CTR eligible events), etc. presumably all improve under the new scenario. I've been a long-time Facebook bull and I'm tethered to the long-term outlook of the company being long FB Jan. 20, 2017 $87.50 calls (which I purchased at $9.60). That said, I'm extremely bullish the immediate-term pricing prospects of the company even approaching all-time highs. I believe the official announcement of the embedded ad launch, coupled with what I believe will be a marketing campaign by the company, should do well to put the shares over $100 and have them never look back. My recommendation continues to be for investors to get levered-long Facebook via long-date call options. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
