How HoloLens Puts Microsoft Back On The Attack, Stock Heading To $55 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha HoloLens is gaining various project-related interest from the likes of Walt Disney, architecture software company Autodesk, NASA and the Cleveland Clinic. Microsoft is aiming to succeed where Google failed with Google Glass. Applying a multiple of 20 to fiscal 2016 estimates of $2.78 per share, Microsoft stock would trade at $55, or 15% higher. I'm as macho as the next guy, but I have no problem expressing my man crush on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella. And I'm speaking purely from the standpoint of his execution. Since Nadella's arrival, Microsoft has made Wall Street forget about the lost decade under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Need proof? Take a look at HoloLens and how quickly that product is gaining in popularity. No one is waiting for Microsoft to "screw it up." The company is taking a page from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in the manner of detail it is taking in product development. Microsoft is targeting various professional markets for HoloLens, including healthcare and architecture. And at some point, its $2.5 billion acquisition of Mojang, the Minecraft game maker, will make HoloLens a must-have product. Questions still remain about HoloLens, given its resemblance to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus product, which Facebook has done nothing with since acquiring the company in 2014 for $2 billion. HoloLens, on the other hand, is gaining various project-related interest from the likes of Disney (NYSE: DIS ), architecture software company Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ), NASA and the Cleveland Clinic. Companies are interested because HoloLens' ability to render high-definition holograms from its various in-built processors, motion sensors and translucent lenses can already do the things they've spent billions in their R&D labs on trying to perfect. Microsoft is already emerging as the leader in the three-dimensional holographic computing space. And here's the thing, HoloLens is capable of running Windows 10 and can generate holographic images to the real world. This will allow for multiple uses, including video games, videoconferencing and creating 3-D concepts. Essentially, Microsoft is aiming to succeed where Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) failed with Google Glass. And Nadella is the primary reason for having brought back innovation beyond Microsoft's two primary franchises in Windows and Office. So, for investors still on the sidelines, waiting for Microsoft stock to falter or get any cheaper, I have two words: good luck. Microsoft stock closed Friday at $48.65, up 0.03%. The shares have gained 4.75% on the year to date. But the world of virtual augmented reality is only one reason to be bullish Microsoft. Microsoft just posted sales in its commercial cloud division that grew 106% year over year, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. Microsoft's commercial cloud segment, which comes from its enterprise Office 365 product, Dynamic CRM Online as well as its Azure cloud business, is now its fastest growing segment at an annualized run rate of $6.3 billion. So Microsoft is no longer just a Windows and Office shop. While there's still ground to make up before Microsoft can catch salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) or Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), from my vantage point, Oracle and salesforce have just as much to fear. And that merger rumors have surfaced between the two companies serves as an example. Microsoft is showing it has multiple routes where it can make money. To that end, with its P/E at 19, Microsoft stock is still undervalued compared to the S&P 500, which trades at a P/E of 21. Based on fiscal 2016 estimates of $2.78 per share, which puts the P/E at 17, Microsoft stock would trade at $55, or 15% higher when applying a multiple of 20 to those estimates.
