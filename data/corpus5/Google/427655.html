Apple: App Store Revamp Or Positioning For Mobile Search? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL is reportedly revamping its App Store with paid-search, new subscription model and faster app review time. Positive implication as it drives non-iPhone revenue but it is still too early to gauge the revenue impact this may have. App Store search technology could gain greater scale to position AAPL into mobile search, putting it in direct competition against GOOG. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is introducing paid search ads for apps, a new subscription model and faster reviews in what I see is the first major overhaul since the introduction of the App Store. The details of the overhaul will likely to be released at Apple's WWDC next week, but what investors can conclude is that this is one direction AAPL is moving towards to expand its non-iPhone revenue, and focusing on the higher margin and faster growing software segment. To remind investors, my view on AAPL is that the maturing smartphone market, the structural shift in the carrier distribution model and growing competition from the low-cost rivals that are creating equally competitive hardware will continue to pressure iPhone unit growth and limit the expansion of its ecosystem (see - Apple: The Party Is Over, Initiating With A Bearish View ). Given that the App Store is the only fast growing segment at Apple, it makes sense for Apple to place a greater emphasis on this segment in order to be less reliant on hardware as the company struggles with slowing iPhone revenue growth. Long-term speaking, introducing paid ads in its App Store positions Apple to have the option of entering the mobile search market and putting itself in direct competition against Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). I believe this could be an area where Apple may stand out if it is able to scale its search capabilities to in-app search. However I remain bearish on AAPL. I think that much of the expectations on the upcoming iPhone has been factored into the stock price and it is evident that the market is taking a wait-and-see approach to see how receptive consumers are. The sell-side analysts are also keeping their expectations in check so that Apple could exceed, rather than miss, their estimate. However worth noting is that if the upcoming iPhone still fails to move the needle, then we could see AAPL shares slide lower to the $80 range. The paid search ads will be auction-based similar to Google's AdWords that allow developers to focus their marketing budget to where people search and download apps. According to Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of marketing, 65% of the app downloads are driven by search, which makes it a very valuable tool for both users (finding the right app) and developers (getting consumers engaged with their app). While this will certainly generate higher non-iPhone revenue for AAPL, this does create two distinct disadvantages for developers and users. For developers, the less funded ones will likely to be at a disadvantage relative to the well funded ones that have a sizeable market budget. As for consumers, the search results will be less organic and the ad-driven platform may result in a less favorable user experience. The other changes that will be announced will be on a new subscription model and faster review time. Between the two, I see app review time change is more notable and will focus on this aspect. The reason why I believe this is significant is that much of Apple's user experience lies in the quality of its apps. By allowing a faster review time for malicious codes, faults and other undesirable content, there is a possibility that the review may not be comprehensive and that places Apple at risk of providing users with apps that don't perform at the optimal level. Ultimately, I think poor execution on the apps will result in wider gap in Apple's user experience and this is certainly undesirable given the already increasing number of iCloud or App Store failures we have been experiencing over the past year. Finally, although the App Store revamp will be a positive revenue generator, investors should think about the bigger picture on where Apple could leverage the established search technology. Mobile search in app stores, in-app search, or map search are valuable assets in the increasingly mobile-centric world. Apple could leverage this asset and expand its search technology and potentially position itself in direct competition against Google. Although this may be a long shot, it is not entirely unrealistic given that a maturing search market could still generate higher revenue growth than a maturing smartphone market.
