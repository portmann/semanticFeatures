Disney: The Stock Awakens - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Star Wars is a very loud growth catalyst for the company, but has not yet been fully incorporated into the stock. The rest of the movie pipeline will only lead to greater returns for the company, helping to reduce dependence on their ESPN stream. Theme park expansion globally, improving margins, and a strong historical precedence only provides more push in the stock towards the $130 range by the end of 2015. We all don't need another article telling us why to be long in Disney (NYSE: DIS ). We understand the brand, the multiple billion-dollar revenue streams, and strong dividend are enough to make this stock a portfolio staple. What we need is a reason to double down and buy more shares of Disney. This stock is currently undervalued heading into 2016 based upon it's movie pipeline and stake in ESPN, among several other factors. The YTD increase of 26.41% is about to skyrocket before the calendar year is out. With the 2014 change in the stock being 23.75%, preceded by a decade of S&P-crushing returns, I believe we're only going to see higher returns for each of the next three years. Studio entertainment only accounts for 11.9% of the company's overall revenues, but I have every indication to believe that is going to change dramatically over the next three years based upon blockbuster potential. Double down in Disney because you, as an investor, know that while their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise was highly controversial, the move is going to be the best return generator the company has seen in quite some time. With projections for the movie to reach up to $2 billion at the box office, which will only represent the accumulation in the infancy of the film's full life cycle, Disney is sitting pretty with this new revenue component. This franchise alone can bring billions more in revenue for merchandise and video games. But, why stop there? Their lineup for movies in the next three years is packed full of billion-dollar potential films, all familiar and loved by the public. Frozen 2: The follow-up to the $1.28 billion hit at the box-office Cars 3: The third installment in a series that has collectively earned $1.021 billion at the box office Two more Star Wars films with unlimited potential Over the next three years, listed above are 10 separate growth catalysts for the stock to see higher levels. While levels are highly dependent upon street expectations, and they will be high expectations, I fully believe Disney will outperform. With Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm all studios under Disney's control, the profit potential has an exceptional amount of room to run. If the pipeline isn't enough for you, take a look at global expansion in theme parks. A Shanghai location will launch next spring, Disneyland in Anaheim, California is expected to create 2,300 jobs, and DisneyWorld in Florida. It's worth noting that the company's expansion into China is no small feat. Focusing on the middle class, who has a rising digital footprint, will aid in boosting revenues in the long-term. With the recent volatility associated with Chinese markets, and abnormal spreads for everything from commodities to financial products, Disney needs to be incredibly tactful in how they scale out their operations. That being said, a move into Shanghai seems like an increasingly fruitful move. I'd suggest reading another contributor's article to gain the specifics on the move. The profitability estimates contained within this article are on the high end, in my opinion, but nonetheless, certainly possible for Disney for the FY 2015. The stock will see much more growth if the consumer product segment can improve. Representing about 10% of total revenue, the segment should see much more efficacy given the movie pipeline. Playmation is the most notable addition, and I see it bringing in about t $140-$160 million in additional revenue for the company, which is definitely a more than safe estimate. Exploiting Star Wars to its fullest extent will be vital to this segment's growth. I'd like to know where the short interest folks are on this stock, especially in consideration of the company's great dividend. At a 1.1% yield, the dividend could certainly be higher, especially considering the increased profitability over the past decade and the spotty payouts, but it is nonetheless there as a kickback and expected to improve in the coming semis. The company has also enjoyed a steadily high growth rate for the dividend over the past decade. I readily expect Disney to hit $135 by the end of the year, and with a P/E of 20.39, I believe this is more than possible, given that there are next to no signs that Disney will falter on its current uptrend. One recent negative piece on Disney did catch my eye, but I actually believe the "weakenesses" recognized in Disney are actually strengths for the company moving forward. The author noted that ESPN accounts for 56% of Disney's profits. The focus, here, rather, should be that the company owns 80% of ESPN, which has experienced its own tremendous success over the past year. With higher subscription rates and an increasing amount of viewers based upon soccer and fantasy sports gaining a stronger foothold in the United States, this is a lucrative stake. There's an obvious concern that Disney may rely too heavily on ESPN, but I believe the composition of Disney's profits will change with the movie pipeline and global expansion in the coming years. Disney has always bred one type of product in my mind: a quality one. I'm late to the games in terms of an entry point, as this stock is much like Apple or Google or Microsoft where I should've bought years ago. If you're not sinking capital into this company, you're making a mistake. May the Force be with you.
