Warranty Accruals Impact On Apple's Gross Margins - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple’s March quarter gross margins were the lowest in seven quarters. The company’s warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue have been in a tight range for the past two years. One of the analyses I perform on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) finances every quarter is to adjust the company's reported gross margin for its warranty accruals and one-time impacts. Apple's warranty charges have ranged from 0.9% to 3.7% of total revenue since fiscal 2007. I believe it is worthwhile to analyze them as it provides insight into what are the "true" costs of Apple's products and how gross margins may change. Even though Apple has launched the iPhone 5c and 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus, Apple Watch, new iPads and Macs and services such as Apple Pay, the company has been able to maintain what I call adjusted gross margins between 40.1% and 42.7% since the September 2013 quarter or 11 consecutive quarters. Warranty accruals have a negative impact on gross margins and can "mask" the company's actual gross margins for its products. I have developed a Google Doc that has Apple's gross margins and warranty accruals from fiscal 2007 to 2015 on an annual basis and quarterly starting in fiscal 2010 available via this link . Apple's reported gross margin in the March quarter was 39.4%, the lowest since 38.0% in the September 2014 quarter. It was down 140 basis points from 40.8% a year ago and down 70 basis points from the December 2015's 40.1%. It was also the first quarter since the June 2013 quarter (11 quarters ago) that the company did not exceed the high-end of its gross margin guidance. Combine that with Apple's gross margin just above the high-end of gross margin guidance the previous three quarters and it dampens expectations for the June quarter and interest in the stock. When you adjust for warranty accruals of $877 million or 1.7% of revenue, Apple's adjusted gross margin was 41.1% in the March quarter. This was down from the December quarter's 42.0% , which had 230 basis points of warranty accruals and was down from the March 2015 quarter's 42.5% , which had 170 basis points of warranty accruals. It is an interesting side note that for the past seven of eight quarters, warranty accruals have been in a fairly tight range of 170 to 230 basis points which includes the introduction of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, iPad Mini 3 and 4 and Air 2 and Apple Watch. This compares to the 2.7% to 3.8% warranty accruals in the previous three quarters that had the iPhone 5c and 5s and iPad Mini 2 and Air. The big question for Apple investors The big question for Apple investors about gross margins is the actual decline quarter to quarter (reported 40.1% or 39.7% without the patent payment down to 39.4% or from 42.0% to 41.1% when adjusted for warranty accruals) and lower guidance for the June quarter the start of a slippery slope or will gross margins stabilize. Gross margin guidance of 37.5% to 38.0% is 150 basis points below the March quarter's 39.0% to 39.5% which is concerning. At the high-end of the 38.0% guidance, that would match the lowest result from the September 2014 quarter, and at the low end of 37.5%, it would only be the second best result since the September 2013's 37.0%. While bull (company has done a very good job managing gross margins, and revenue growth will help) and bear (iPhone SE adoption will negatively impact margins and the smartphone market is getting saturated) cases can be made for each side, unfortunately only time will tell.
