Yahoo: Nothing Is Finalized Just Yet - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo's sale of its core business appears to be moving forward. Media has reported interest from the Daily Mail UK and Verizon, among failed bids/pullouts by Google and others. Today we are going to offer another small article in our series of skeptical articles surrounding Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and its inability to sell itself over the last year or two. We have written several articles in the past coming up with "wild card" theories as to why the company may not have gotten the deal done already and why the equity seems to simply be a vortex for shareholder value over the last couple of years. The main purpose of this article is to remind investors that the sale of a division (or a sale in full) of Yahoo has not yet been completed. Why is this important to remind investors? The stock has been trading higher and higher, increasing its market cap almost 30% from recent lows as investors bid the equity up and anticipate getting a deal done. We think this is dangerous territory and we think that if we were buyers in the $25 region, that we would be selling up here around $36 per share. We don't think there's any positive surprises under the surface at Yahoo, likely just the opposite, that the company has used all of its tricks and unable to make something happen they finally just decided to go the sale route. Nothing about a sale process guarantees equity holders that a bid is going to come in at a premium above the current share price/core business value. Many times, when stocks run up in anticipation of a merger or acquisition, a deal winds up getting done at a lower volume weighted average price, smoking those who bought at highs strictly for the prospect of a buyout with the premium. If ever there was a company that we think could be a take under, it's Yahoo. We know the business is performing poorly and there are many questions that we have raised about the company's only other tangible asset in its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake. Surely, with all of the interest that seems to be coming out of the woodwork now that Yahoo has announced plans to sell its core business, one must ask where were all of these bidders just months ago? Yahoo has been a complete and totally abject failure under its CEO Marissa Mayer. Ms. Mayer was brought in to reorganize the company and hopefully catch them up with newer companies that are eating their lunch. All Mayer did was come in, collect an enormous paycheck, and get precisely nothing accomplished. Acquisitions have been written down and the core business is now being reported to continue to be in horrible shape, as reported by Benzinga just days ago, Yahoo's financial situation is "increasing dire," at least according to a report by Re/code. Re/code's Kara Swisher obtained access to the "book" that Yahoo's bankers are handing out to potential buyers. Naturally, this book contains the necessary information that a potential buyer requires before submitting a binding bid. Swisher stated the book "shows a company in what appears to be serious free fall." She continued that the book shows Yahoo is expecting its revenue to fall close to 15 percent and earnings by over 20 percent in 2016. At the same time, Yahoo's expenses are indeed declining, but not nearly enough to offset the "troubling landscape." The only thing that has gone right for Yahoo has been its stake in Alibaba. Alibaba's IPO almost two years ago generated a significant amount of value for Yahoo, so much so that buying the equity has been argued over and over again as a way to buy the core business for free. The question then becomes, "Who wants to buy the core business anyway?" We are not going to go out on a limb and peddle crazy conspiracy theories. What we will say is that we have raised the notion of something potentially being weird under the surface at Yahoo many times over. Alibaba has its own questions that it's going to have to answer relatively soon, but one thing continues to stick out to us. Yahoo has been trying to get this deal done and a sale engineered for the last couple of years and hasn't been able to do it. We want to know what the hold up has been. For us, it seems like the company has come too far over such a long period of time to have not gotten anything done yet - whether it's business-wise or sale-wise. We have mild experience in corporate mergers and acquisitions and we know that it is not a fast process. Between the time that it takes lawyers and executives to conduct and complete their due diligence to the time a merger proxy is finalized and approved, it can take years. We are not contesting that. What we continue to raise suspicions about is why a deal has taken this long to even get into these initial stages. What is the hold up over at Yahoo? We have far more questions then we have answers. We want to remind readers that we are not saying a deal will not happen, we are simply questioning what appears to be a stunning inability to get anything done at the corporate level. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's tenure has been a mess and the Board of Directors should be held accountable for the losing of a significant sum of shareholder value based solely on the company's inability to find and execute a strategic vision that is going to move them in one direction or another. Literally, all the company would have had to have done is found a direction and stuck with it from the get go. Sale, layoffs, restructuring...pick one. Instead, we have been subjected to a CEO tenure that has accomplished almost nothing, flailing wildly from one "solution" to the next. So all of those who are out there picking up a few hundred YHOO shares in hopes that there is going to be some white night bidder that will pay a ridiculous premium to what the company's core business is worth, we say don't get your hopes up. There is nothing that has shown us a reason to expect any type of execution on the sale with any type of efficiency or benefits for shareholders. The core business is failing, the company's stake in Alibaba can be questioned loosely, and like everything else under her regime, we don't expect a shareholder friendly deal to get done with Mayer involved. As it has become pretty clear, we are skeptical of not only Yahoo's ability to close on the sale that is beneficial to shareholders, but on their ability to get any type of progress with the current CEO and current Board of Directors in place. A sale might happen, but it might just surprise some people. At this stage with Yahoo, nothing will surprise us.
