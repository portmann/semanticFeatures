The Tesla Falls Far, Far Away From The Apple Tree - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha The Knights Teslar believe Tesla could be the next Apple. Elon Musk recently said Tesla could be a trillion dollar company. This idea is so preposterous as to defy logic. The operational differences between Telsa and Apple are nearly infinite. We will explore the first of those differences here: the two companiesâ€™ approaches to manufacturing their respective key products. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) valuation cannot be justified by comparing it to other auto companies. Tesla enthusiasts recognize this, but insist Tesla is not simply another auto company, and suggest other supposed "peers" with whom it must be compared. I have already debunked the notion that Tesla can be valued like a tech company or like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Here, inspired (astonished, maybe?) by some off-the-wall comments made by CEO Elon Musk following Tesla's offer to purchase SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ), I examine whether Tesla can be compared to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). According to Musk, the resulting hybrid created by the Tesla/SolarCity marriage could create a company worth more than $1 trillion. "As a combined automotive and power storage and power generation company, the potential is there for Tesla to be a trillion-dollar market cap company," - Elon Musk Let's explore the idea that Tesla could be worth $1 trillion. The last company to make a serious run at the elusive "Trillion Dollar Valuation" was Apple. And, of course, it is often said by the Knights Teslar that Tesla could be the next Apple. The Knights Teslar compare Elon Musk to Steve Jobs. The Roadster is the original Mac. The Model 3 will be the iPhone. Just as Apple "disrupted" the personal computing and cell phone industry, so is Tesla disrupting the auto industry (and, now, energy storage, and solar power generation). Comparisons between these companies are difficult, particularly if one is trying to be fair. Apple is a 40-year-old business; Tesla is 13. Apple has a huge ecosystem of complementary product lines, services, and revenue streams; Tesla has a tiny handful. Apple had approximately $234 billion in 2015 revenues. Tesla had 1/60th that amount. Apple actually benefits to some degree from a depressed share price as it is actively engaged in repurchasing its own stock; Tesla survives only because of its inflated share price and its investors' willingness to accept continued dilution. Taking all that into consideration, it is the approach to a few key ways of doing business that really highlight the differences between Apple and Tesla, and help determine whether Tesla has a chance to be the next Apple. To my mind, the most important comparisons to be made (that are fair to Tesla) are: (1) approach to manufacturing, (2) approach to product development and innovation, and (3) approach to synergistic partnerships. Because there is a great deal of ground to cover on each of these topics, I've decided to focus on only the first of those in this article. As Apple's largest revenue stream comes from the iPhone, and Tesla's from its vehicles, we will primarily focus on these products as the basis for comparison. As most people know, Apple doesn't actually manufacture the iPhone. Apple designs the iPhone, and Apple determines what components will be included in the iPhone. But Apple outsources the actual manufacture of the phone and its components. ( Great article here for anyone interested) Apple doesn't even build its own processors. Apple designs its processors, carefully and specifically to run its software, and outsources their production to a capable supplier. Tesla is just the opposite. Not only does Tesla assemble its own final product, but Elon Musk has gone on record that Tesla will strongly consider manufacturing many of the components its final products require. Apple doesn't need, in fact never needed, to develop a manufacturing infrastructure for phones or components. As it turns out, such an infrastructure is a VERY expensive proposition, and a problematic one for makers of consumer goods, be they smartphones or cars. Demand for consumer goods is, to a large extent, subject to fluctuations in the greater economy and a number of forces outside a manufacturer's control. However, in order to maximize profit, a manufacturer must have the capacity to meet demand when it is peaking. The need for capacity in boom times creates the problem of excess capacity when demand later slacks off. There are fixed costs associated with running any business, and this is particularly true in manufacturing. Apple is able to push this problem across the table to its suppliers and to Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ), its manufacturer, ensuring healthy profits for itself even in difficult economic times. As long as Apple can forecast demand with a reasonable level of accuracy, it can maximize its profits and avoid the costs associated with idle factories when demand slows. Tesla has done the opposite, choosing to take the cost of infrastructure risk on itself. Granted, the risk to a company the size of Tesla is somewhat small. It is far from efficient at building cars, so excess capacity isn't really a near-term issue. But that will change if the economics of Tesla vehicles ever make sense for the masses and Tesla has to expand capacity. Tesla will have to answer questions like: What will demand be in five years? How many factories do I need to meet that demand? How quickly can they be ramped? What will our product mix look like then? These are not easy questions to answer, and a wrong bet could seriously cripple a young company. But there are other reasons Tesla appears to have assumed this risk. First, it is much easier to sell a growth story when you can claim you are supply constrained. Further, it is much easier to sell the supply-constrained story when you aren't a mature manufacturer. Second, Elon Musk is a control freak. I doubt even he would object to that characterization. The idea of delegating something important when the delegation can be avoided is (in his mind) unthinkable. Of course, Elon has never shied away from risk. But it isn't just Elon who assumes said risk. It is everyone employed by and invested in Tesla that takes this risk with him. And it will become a significant one as Tesla matures. We've already discussed that Apple doesn't build either its final product or the components contained therein. It turns out there is a very good reason for that, beyond just managing capacity risk. As a very interesting case study, Samsung is Apple's largest competitor in the high-end smartphone space. Samsung is also one of Apple's key suppliers (batteries, chipsets and processors, etc.) for the iPhone. Oddly enough, even though Samsung produces many of the components that go into both its own phones and Apple's phones, Samsung's costs to build its flagship models (S series) are higher than Apple's! As a result, its margins are quite a bit worse, and its profits significantly lower. What does this prove? Well, it proves there is no inherent cost advantage in being your own supplier. In fact, maximizing profits is a function of exceptional supply chain management and use of the most efficient resources available for execution. Elon Musk has indicated a willingness and, even, a desire to "vertically integrate" Tesla. While an egregious misuse of the phrase, he even used vertical integration as the excuse to bail out SolarCity. All this despite the example set by all of Tesla's peers in the automotive industry and by the richest and most successful company on the planet. 3. The Importance of Core Competency What has Tesla demonstrated to be its strengths? Well, Tesla has shown it is great at designing desirable products. About that there is little question, and in this way it is very much like Apple. Tesla has also shown a remarkable ability to form an emotional connection with its core customer base. This type of connection is the goal of just about every company in the world. In this way, again, Tesla is very much like Apple. Frankly, however, Tesla has shown that it is pretty bad at manufacturing vehicles. While this might sound like harsh criticism, I assure you it is not. It is hard to manufacture a car. Exceedingly hard. Elon has confessed as much on more than one occasion. It would be unreasonable to expect Tesla to be good at it after such a short period of time. But it would also be unreasonable to expect Tesla to get really good at it anytime soon. It will almost surely get better over time, but it doesn't need to get incrementally better. It needs to get significantly better if it wants to compete for real against the BMW's ( OTCPK:BAMXY ), Mercedes ( OTCPK:DDAIF ), and Audi's ( OTCPK:AUDVF ) of the world among more than just the wealthiest members of the early adopter crowd. Manufacturing is not Tesla's core competency, nor is it Apple's. But only one of them chooses to do it in spite of that fact. A REAL Path to Profitability for Tesla? The manufacturing problems and product defects Tesla has survived with the Model S and Model X simply will not fly for the larger public, and there is no evidence to support the idea that Tesla is becoming an exceptional, or even average, manufacturer of cars. For Tesla to have any chance of becoming the next Apple over a twenty-year horizon, Tesla would have to focus on what it does well (marketing and design) and leave behind what it does poorly (actually building the cars). Of course, this is unlikely to happen, and it's almost certainly not going to happen under the leadership of Elon Musk. Rather, Musk is moving the company in the opposite direction. Tesla is taking on more and more responsibility for the manufacture of its own components, and has even begun talking about increasing its manufacturing capacity by opening new factories overseas. I'll save the Knights Teslar the trouble: "Oh sure, UBR, you know more about this than Elon, right?" Here is my counter: regardless of who is smarter (and I'm not saying it is me, by the way), we have different motivations. As evidenced by the recent proposal to acquire troubled SolarCity by further diluting TSLA investors, Elon views investors as a means to an end, not a group to be protected and served. By contrast, as an investor, I believe the primary job of company leadership is to protect and reward shareholders, not push a personal agenda or protect self-interest. And that, dear readers, is yet another difference between Tesla and Apple. A Path to Winning for Tesla Shareholders? Interestingly enough, one of the bull arguments for going long on TSLA is the idea that the company might one day be a ripe takeover target for another company, such as Apple. In fact, Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) are about the only two names that even seem to make sense from a buyout perspective, as they both have deep pockets and automotive industry aspirations. The arguments that support this are, interestingly enough, that Tesla has a terrific brand image, intensely loyal customer base, and a head start on BEV technology. Despite the recent SolarCity announcement, NHTSA safety reporting controversy, and reduced reliability marks from Consumer Reports, let's assume Tesla's brand image is solid and untarnished. Given Apple's preference for supply chain management and outsourced manufacturing, what would make Tesla an attractive target for acquisition? The brand? Does Tesla have a stronger brand than Apple? Than Google? Certainly not. At least not according to Forbes. Or Business Insider. Or Fortune, Statista, BranDirectory, Interbrand, Millward Brown, or any other brand ranking that I could find through a Google search. In fact, Tesla doesn't even have a more valuable brand than Toyota, the only automaker in most top 10's. The idea that some white knight will come riding in to purchase Tesla at a premium over its present day valuation is absurd. The only interest these companies might have in Tesla is picking the meat off the carcass in bankruptcy proceedings. I'm going to save most of my "conclusions" for the Part 2 of this article, which I hope to finish soon. That said, there are two important points for investors to understand today. First, Tesla doesn't operate in an industry that supports the type of margins Apple is able to achieve. Tesla has chosen a production path that further reduces its potential margins, and there is no sign that this is going to change. Rather, Elon Musk will stubbornly ride this train into the abyss before admitting failure and changing course. Second, no one is coming in to save the day if things start to go worse for Tesla. Investors who bought TSLA stock in the $30 range could end up ok if things start to get rocky. Investors who buy at today's valuation will be in serious trouble. For anyone in between those extremesâ€¦it might be time to 'get out while gettin's good'. This makes Tesla, to use a phrase Elon loves, a "no brainer" long-term short. The stock's volatility makes it a dangerous short-term play on either side. On the other hand, Apple is a phenomenal long-term investment. The fortress balance sheet, low near-term earnings expectations based on an underwhelming iPhone 7, already brewing excitement about iPhone 8, unfathomably low PE ratio, and currently depressed share price that can accelerate the company's share buyback give AAPL 20-40% potential upside over the next 18-36 months, with minimal short-term downside from here. In any event, the comparison of Tesla to Apple is like comparing cars to fruit, and investors should understand that the Tesla of today is absolutely not the Apple of tomorrow.
