Apple Pay struggles outside U.S., Goldman lowers PT - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jun  2 2016, 04:06 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor More than 18 months after Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ) took the United States by storm (with usage totaling $10.9B in 2015), the smartphone giant has made only a small dent in the global payments market. Adoption has been snagged by technical challenges, low consumer take-up and resistance from banks. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has cut its price target on Apple to $124 from $136, but maintained its Buy rating, as a reflection of lower growth expectations for the smartphone industry. not to mention the US market is moving away from two year contracts. some iphone users will switch over to android as they start to compare what they get for "$650" for a 16gb iphone when you get get htc m10 for 150 less or a samsung s7 or a asus zenphone 3 for 250-400. Apple has lost its touch. Software quality has done nothing but decline in the last years. Every single thing they put out is riddled with bugs now. And they usually take 1-2 years to fix them while adding more than they fixed in the next feature release. That alone is enough to show you the company is going down hill long-term. Nobody will put up with that shit soon while Microsoft is doing the exact opposite: Their releases are getting better and better since the new CEO took over. Apple needs to really look at its software leaders. Innovation has been stagnant in software and well as hardware. They need to  come out with more good products more often. Can't say I've encountered any bugs, and there is a known zero day exploit even in the May patch of Windows 10. Doesn't seem that you're 100% right on your allegations. I respect your decision to be anti-Apple, but only if the content you post is actually true. They fixed the Safari bug in about a month.  How long would Google take??? Microsoft?  Are you frickin kidding?  I STILL run XP Pro on my laptop.  They lost my trust with Vista and every OS release after that.  How is your Microsoft stock doing : -) Apple should go ahead and buy all the relatively  small cap stocks that got killed in January and didn't recover!! Fitbit Twitter FEYE CSIQ SWKS!!! Just buy em dominate every sector in the world!! Those dividends and buybacks are plain stupid!! Buy those undervalued companies and feed them with cash you'll grow so big One thing that baffles me is the absolutely snail pace roll out of Apple Pay globally. Apple has really really failed here. After 1.5 years they only have Apple Pay rolled out in 3-4 countries?? Is this the capability of a company with the resources and commitment of Apple? Something is amiss. Even if the negotiations are taking time, it is in Apple's interests to expedite them so that their global user base can take advantage of the hundreds of millions of iPhones that are Apple Pay compatible. There are plenty of markets which are fully ready for contact less payments and ripe for Apple Pay to succeed. Why did Apple launch this service if they could not commit to all those markets in a reasonable time frame? While their products and services are generally world class and innovative the speed with which they release their services and products is far too slow in today's competitive world. They definitely have the resources, maybe they aren't trying hard enough? Curious timing for this article. As of yesterday (June 1) all 5 major banks in Canada will now accept Apple Pay at NFC enabled terminals. RBC and CIBC launched in May followed now by TD, BMO and ScotiaBank. Other card issuers are also launching. Perhaps a small segment relative to global scale, but I think the stats are that approximately 90% of the Canadian population have financial ties to one of the "big five". Part of the delay was incorporating Apple Pay into the domestic credit system (Interac) plus the banks were also in the process of launching their own mobile pay apps. Bjmesh agree with your statement.  It seems that Goldman just want to control the market, just in case OPEC comes out with a CAP and Friday's job numbers are good enough to start a massive rally.   You push Apple down you push the market down. Here in China everyone uses Wechat to pay with Wechat Pay or Alipay at checkout. You see the ApplePay logo everywhere but anyone with Wechat installed uses the Wechat app right away to pay. Its like twitter and apple pay combined. I havent seen or know one person in my small social circle who use apple pay nor aquaintences. Apple Pay was never intended to provide a significant revenue stream relative to the iPhone.  But it does provide another tool making the iPhone even more useful.  It is short-sighted to judge the success of Apple Pay based on the revenue stream versus how many more iPhones are purchased (and later upgraded to a newer iPhone).  Furthermore, Apple Pay is mostly software, so all the income is gravy.  There may be other reasons a person is not fond of Apple stock, but the adoption rate of Apple Pay should not one of them.
