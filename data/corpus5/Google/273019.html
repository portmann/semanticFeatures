Apple Tax Charges 'Total Political Crap' - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Dec. 23, 2015 12:19 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: AIQUY , ALU , AMH , APPL , ARG , ARPI , ATCEY , CNL , CVC , DMND , DSDVY , ERIC , FB , GOOG , GOOGL , GPRO , IEP , LNCE , MEG , MSFT , NOK , NTI , NXST , PBY , TWTR , UTIW , WNR , YHOO by: Chris DeMuth Jr. Apple settles dispute, pays what they owe, and has new digs. Media General getting sold for $17ish. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ) settled their longstanding patent disputes with a new licensing agreement. Ericsson will get a royalty worth about 50 bps of iPad and iPhone revenue going forward. Meanwhile, Tim Cook has been defending his practice of paying 100% of the taxes that Apple owes while declining to pay $0.01 more. The first indicates that he honors the law, and the second that he honors his fiduciary duty to Apple's owners. Apparently, this is controversial. Regarding the accusation that Apple is engaged in a nefarious scheme to hide from taxes, he said that, That is total political crap. There is no truth behind it. Apple pays every tax dollar we owe. Apple amended its proxy bylaws to allow a shareholder or a group of as many as twenty shareholders that owns at least 3% of company to nominate up to 20% of the board of directors. Apple raised concerns with the UK's draft Investigatory Powers Bill. The bill would overhaul rules governing how the government accesses private communication. Other comments have been filed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). None want to be deputized by the government to aid in unnecessary privacy violations. The deadline for evidence and comments was December 21 and the committee report will be made in February. The company is also progressing on its shiny new headquarters (beautiful… but such HQs are also beautiful signals to short companies. I prefer bare lightbulbs and linoleum). Incidentally, thank you to each and every one of the 13,000 people who have chosen to follow me on Seeking Alpha this year. If you are not one of them and want to be then you can follow me here (if you are one of them and don't want to be, you can unfollow me using the same link). As the new Apple HQ is good for just that number, we could use it as our clubhouse if Mr. Cook ever decides to trade it in for something more futuristic and aerodynamic. For further reading on Apple: It has been a rough year for GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) since I disclosed our short position ( GoPro's CEO Is Stoked... But Selling ). Since then the topic arose in the Best Of SA Comments , For all those who can't be bothered to read the entire report here's a summary from Nick Woodman: So basically in college I was smoking pot one day with my buddy and we came up with this great idea to glue a video camera onto our heads and then walk around campus doing pranks. I then convinced my dad's buddies I stump up some cash and design the first GoPro. Not sure why you people on Wall St bought the idea that's there was an actual strategy/plan and we were going to be the next YouTube. Anyway can we wrap this up...I've got a wave to catch back to Malibu. GRPO again raised its helmeted head in Santa Arb . But where will CEO Nick Woodman be able to go to relax, you may ask? His new Amels 180: This time he is both stoked and buying… and he can well afford it in part due to his aggressive and timely GPRO stock sales.
