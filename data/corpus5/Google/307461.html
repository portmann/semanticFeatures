Yahoo: Wall Street Blames Silicon Valley For A Problem It Created - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS, CMCSA, GOOGL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. CEO Marissa Mayer played the hand she was dealt. Yahoo is now just as big as it was when she started, which in today's Internet media world is pretty good. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) CEO Marissa Mayer is unveiling yet-another cost-cutting plan , insisting she can turn the company around , as corporate sharks circle, demanding her head on a platter. I'm not going to argue here that Marissa Mayer has been Elon Musk (NASDAQ: TSLA ). But neither has she been Carly Fiorina (formerly HP (NYSE: HPQ )). And the sharks are as wrong today as they have been about this company since it was born. I'm old enough to remember that. Back in the late 1990s, Wall Street insisted that Yahoo become a "portal," that it stop focusing on technologies like search and instead grab valuable real estate like user-generated content. It did, and the artist formerly known as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) blew past it like it was standing still. During the 2000s, two things happened. First, co-founder Jerry Yang made one of the biggest, and most courageous, calls in corporate history, putting $1 billion into Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), a move that has turned into tens of billions of dollars for Yahoo shareholders. (There's a Yahoo worth celebrating.) Meanwhile, a succession of mostly New York-oriented marketing guys tried to "turn around" the company by focusing it on media. They built Yahoo Sports into a radio network, built Yahoo Finance into a news page, and curated the Web's content, mostly by hand. This is what Mayer stepped into, in 2012. Flush with cash from selling part of the Alibaba stake, she made a number of acquisitions. Actually, she made a large number of them, almost 50 by last count. Among the most important were Qwiki, a video production application, for $50 million. Lexity, an e-commerce analytics company, cost $35 million. Ptch, a video sharing site, cost just $6.5 million. Then there was Flurry, a mobile analytics company which cost $200 million. What do the analysts talk about? Two companies. Tumblr cost $1 billion, and while it changed the way Web pages are designed, in fundamental ways, it didn't do as much for Yahoo's bottom line. Summly, a $30 million news aggregation outfit, was notable because its CEO was a teenager. They had a good laugh on that. Integrating all this, in a changing Web where everyone is running as fast as they can to stand still, kept Yahoo in the game. Revenue for all of 2011 came in at $5 billion, for 2014 $4.6 billion, and 2015 looks like another $5 billion. Mayer automated the production and distribution of news content as much as she possibly could. But Yahoo is still an Internet media company. It is the only scaled Internet media company left on the board. That is the problem. The word is out - Internet media takes people to create, news is not a good business. But you can't blame Mayer for that. She played the hand she was dealt, played it pretty well. Still the hand, Wall Street has concluded, was garbage to begin with. You can ask, who dealt that mess, but it's Mayer who is the CEO and Wall Street wants her out. Anyone can sell assets, like the rest of the Alibaba stake. Once that's done, the $5 billion company that now has no stock market value might look mighty sweet inside Disney (NYSE: DIS ), which has no real Internet strategy, or Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), which has been buying new media outlets for a few years, or Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), which got talked into buying AOL, one of Yahoo's biggest rivals. Give investment bankers some time and they could come up with a much bigger list, maybe a real auction that would earn them fat fees. Fox (NASDAQ: FOX )? AT&T (NYSE: T )? CBS (NYSE: CBS )? Time Warner (NYSE: TWC )? Once the bidding starts, who knows who might turn up? Maybe a European consortium that wants to help the EU push Google around will get involved. But let's not pretend that what's going on is about Marissa Mayer being a terrible CEO. It's about Wall Street's eternal hunger for fees, about the desire by hedge funds for a quick pop on a sale of this media company to another media company, and about its complete lack of honesty over the moves the Street itself urged on Yahoo management for two decades.
