Amazon: The $50 Fire Tablet Is A Ruthless Killer Idea - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is no longer among the top five global vendors of tablets. Amazon is now accepting pre-orders of its $49.99 7-inch Fire Tablet. The last time Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was among the world's top vendor of tablets was in Q4 2014 . The Fire tablet has seen a big drop in sales over the first half of this year. Amazon dropped out of the top 5 rankings of the biggest tablet vendors this first half of 2015. Amazon's declining fortune on tablet sales may soon reverse course. Amazon's new $49.99 Fire Android tablet is now available for pre-order and it will ship out on September 30. Selling a $50 tablet is a ruthless strategy that could eventually kill sales of other Android tablet vendors. Even Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), the world's top vendor of Android tablets, will find it pyrrhic to compete with a $50 Amazon Fire tablet. Unless LG Electronics (OTC: LGEAF ), Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ), and Huawei match the cutthroat price slice to $50 price tag, they too will suffer from Amazon's merciless pricing strategy. I do not doubt that Amazon is selling its new Fire tablet below cost. My speculation that it is being sold at a loss is helped by the fact that this $50 Android tablet could run the advanced 3D mobile game Real Racing 3 . The rather stiff hardware requirements of Real Racing 3 means Amazon is using a good quality (not cheap) quad-core processor with advanced GPU. Amazon is also hyping up its $49.99 Fire Tablet, claiming it has a more durable build quality than the iPad Air 2 from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Amazon expects to recoup its gamble that some buyers of the $49.99 Fire tablet would become repeat buyers of Amazon movies and other goods. This is the greatest advantage of Amazon over its tablet competitors. It can afford to sell hardware at a loss and still come out a winner. The people who buy the $50 Fire tablet will no doubt get inundated with enticing ads to purchase something from Amazon stores. The custom Fire OS 5 Android operating system is just another channel to attract more people to shop on Amazon. Unlike before, Samsung is no longer selling its entry-level Android tablets on Amazon. A $50 Fire tablet simply kills the competition by its price alone. Samsung sells its cheapest 7-inch tablet, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite at $129 . The Tab 3 Lite also has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM storage but it only has a dual-core processor. This still makes it less powerful than the much cheaper $49.99 Fire tablet. Samsung and other tablet makers cannot offer access to the same 38 million movies and TV shows that Amazon devices now enjoy. The Android App Store of Samsung is also smaller than the 300,000 apps available from the Amazon App Store. What makes the $49.99 Fire tablet an impulse smart buy for me is the new Amazon Underground app store. It offers people the chance to get free paid Android apps/games, and also free in-app purchases on freemium games. While Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Play Store sells Goat Simulator for 190 pesos ($3.99), Amazon Underground offers it free to Fire Tablet owners. Such generosity from Amazon puts other Android tablet vendors in a no-win situation. This is especially true in markets where there are operating Amazon stores like North America, Europe, India, and China. My point is that Samsung, Lenovo, and Huawei could not afford to match the subsidized hardware and apps that a $49.99 Amazon Fire tablet is now offering. Even Apple, with its $200 billion cash hoard, will not dare match the free paid apps offer of Amazon Underground just to make its $399 iPad Mini 4 more attractive. Amazon is also generous enough to offer free unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos recorded from a Fire tablet. Samsung does not offer such unlimited cloud storage feature to buyers of its entry-level tablets. For in-device storage expansion, the Fire tablet's microSD slot supports up to 128GB cards. The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite only supports up to 32GB microSD cards. The battery life of the new Fire tablet is also decent at 7 hours when web surfing/watching videos. Jeff Bezos thinks like no other capitalists on the planet. Where other people/investors see a losing proposition, Bezos sees golden opportunity. The $49.99 Fire tablet is another example of Bezos' unique approach to building up Amazon's future. Bezos is patently merciless when it comes to ensuring that more people will make Amazon their official online shopping site. He doesn't feel the pain of selling tablets at zero margins because he believes their buyers will eventually become addicted to making repeat purchases from Amazon. I heartily agree with Bezos' thinking. I therefore endorse a Hold rating for AMZN. On the other hand a Buy is also reasonableâ€¦ many Bezos believers are still making the decades-old Amazon perform like a momo growth stock. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL.
