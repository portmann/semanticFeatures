Apple: The Market's False Correction - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's stock price has fallen 15% from its April high. Members of the business media are attempting to diagnose the cause of the â€œcorrectionâ€?. With Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share price already down 15% from its high in April, numerous business articles have announced that Apple is in a "correction". By the usual definition, corrections occur to adjust for overvaluation of a stock. Even at its all time high, Apple wasn't over valued, making this a false correction. As Apple prepares to unleash new products this Fall, it already appears to be losing the Game of Expectations in much the same way that Ned Stark lost the Game of Thrones. Paul R. La Monica's article about the "correction" in CNN Money should serve as a comprehensive list of talking points for Apple critics for the rest of the year. His explanation for the "correction" is "disappointing" iPhone sales and the Canalys report citing Apple's market share decline in China in the June quarter. Can Apple find new geographies to drive growth? Probably not. Will they be able to lift the average selling price? Probably not. Are they dependent on the iPhone? Yes. There's only so much room to grow. I like this quote because it captures so succinctly all the classic arguments about why Apple must fail. Before I pick apart the Gillis quote, let me first talk about La Monica's other key points. Disappointing iPhone sales: Okay, I was a little disappointed. A lot of us were. This is one area where Apple really lost the Game of Expectations. I may even have had some small part in that, for which I am duly penitent. Mea culpa. But how disappointed can you be over a 35% y/y increase in unit sales? The depiction of disappointment always seems a little self serving coming from perennial Apple critics. Declining market share in China: Canalys reported that Apple had slipped to third place in market share in China in the June quarter, down from first place in the March quarter. The focus on sequential changes in product shipment or market share has often been exploited by Apple critics to portray Apple as on the decline. Such portrayals are inherently deceptive. Being a consumer electronics company, all of Apple's products are subject to seasonal variations. Sequential declines are not unusual, especially from the December quarter. Apple's smartphone market share in China has tended to follow the ups and downs of Apple's global market share. Sequential changes simply are not a meaningful metric, but year over year changes are. In the chart below, I plot global market share date from IDC. As is my custom, I use the IDC data to calculate market share among the top five smart phone vendors for any given quarter. This excludes generic "white box" smartphones. In the same plot I include Kantar WorldPanel's smart phone market share data for China. Note that the final 2015 Q2 data point for China market share is approximated from Kantar's data for the three months ending in May. Kantar doesn't have data yet for the full June quarter. As can be seen from the chart, Apple posted a decline in market share in China from calendar Q1, but 2015 Q2 was quite a bit higher the 2014 Q2. The sequential decline from Q1 means nothing by itself. Apple can't find new geographies to drive growth: First of all, it's not clear that Apple really needs to for the for next few years. It's not as if Greater China is saturated with iPhones. What China is saturated with is cheap white box Android phones that nobody wants anymore. The upgrade potential is still huge. This is the reason why iPhone sales were up over 87% in Greater China in the June quarter, as Apple disclosed during their June quarter conference call . But Apple is growing robustly in emerging markets, with revenue up 79% y/y. iPhone sales were up 93% in India. In most other regions, iPhone sales growth is outpacing the overall smartphone market by healthy multiples. Apple won't be able to lift the iPhone ASP: At $660 last quarter, Apple's iPhone ASP is the envy of the industry. Everyone knows that Apple scoops up most of the profit of the entire smartphone industry. According to WSJ , Apple made 92% of the profit from selling just 20% of the phones in the March quarter. Why is this even an issue? Apple is too dependent on iPhone: This is one of the many variations of an old stratagem in the Game of Expectations. A critic will point to an area where Apple has been very successful and manage to twist it into a negative. iPhone has been phenomenally successful and grown much faster than its other products, therefore, Apple is too dependent on iPhone. As if there was nothing to Apple besides iPhone. Last quarter, Apple's non-iPhone revenue was $18.237 billion. That's more than Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) total revenue last quarter of $17.727 billion. If we apply Apple's corporate operating margin rate of 28.4%, then the non-iPhone operating profit would have been $5.178 billion, once again beating Google's total operating profit of $4.825 billion. Only in terms of y/y growth did Google beat non-iPhone Apple. There's only so much room to grow: This sounds like a veiled version of the law of large numbers argument, another Game of Expectations stratagem. Apple has been hugely successful, therefore it can't continue to be hugely successful. I've already dealt with the law of large numbers argument, so let me assume that this was meant to be more limited in scope to just iPhone sales. Another point that was made at the June quarter earnings call is that only 27% of the installed base of iPhone customers have upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus. CEO Tim Cook believes that the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6 and its successors still has legs, and he's right. After a few years of following media coverage of Apple, it's become clear to me that there's a pro-Apple camp and an anti-Apple camp. Neither side exhibits a great deal of original thought, but just keeps recycling the same themes over and over again. Since Apple shares have a great deal of retail investor ownership, the media may exercise excessive influence over the stock's price. The average retail investor may not be well enough informed to filter out the rhetoric from either side. As such, Apple's stock price is to some degree a function of which side holds the upper hand in the eyes of the public. Judging by the coverage of this "correction", it appears to me that the anti-Apple camp holds sway at the moment. Just the use of the term "correction" says a lot. At it's peak share price in June, Apple had a P/E of about 15, hardly an overvaluation. Now that the share price has fallen, as of this writing to below $115, the P/E is at about 13 (according to Google Finance ). The "correction" has the character of a fever, and what Apple investors want to know is when will the fever break. Of course, it's impossible to know for certain. These kinds of fevers always play to investor fears and insecurities. Apple could always screw up. The next iPhone could be a flop. It could happen. But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. The product pipeline is very strong going into the December quarter, led by an invigorated iPhone 6S/S Plus. In the coming months we'll probably hear all the reasons why Apple is going to fail repeated in infinite variation. The difficult comps will get frequent mention. Leaked supplier reports will claim that iPhone sales are "disappointing". Apple Watch will be an unmitigated disaster. The litany of negative speculation will seem endless. And it probably won't end until Apple reports fiscal 2016 Q1 results next January. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't blame anyone for bailing out of Apple, especially if there's profit to be taken. I won't be doing that. I continue to regard the negative sentiment as an opportunity to accumulate, especially as the negative sentiment reaches fever pitch.
