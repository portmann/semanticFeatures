Please join Sifting the World for exclusive access to event driven, value investing, and arbitrage opportunities. Here are some examples of such opportunities in today's market. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is buying VocalIQ. The target's artificial intelligence software facilitates natural language speech between people and computers. The goal is to help make Siri more like Iron Man's Jarvis. VocalIQ works with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) on applications for cars. Other companies that are looking to make acquisitions in speech include Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Despite our interest, Apple declined to divulge all of their plans for speech and Apple's car to M&A Daily . Will the Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) be able to close its acquisition of Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI )? They are certainly doing everything possible to make it happen. Their lawyers have been in close contact with antitrust staff. The latest round of remedies appears to be in direct response to what is needed to secure approval. Will they work and does the current spread compensate investors adequately for the risks? Yes and yes. The antitrust issues are solvable and can be solved within the limits of the definitive merger agreement. The $6.80 net arbitrage spread offers a 38% annual return to a close by next February (my estimate, offering a little padding) or over 50% if they close by yearend. I dislike venturing too far out on a limb, but for the remaining months of 2015, this is one of your best bets. Sycamore Partners has been giving a tepid look at buying Chico's FAS (NYSE: CHS ). The valuation case is marginal. The uneven financing market makes it more so. Two investors are in talks to acquire over $1 billion in Cablevision (NYSE: CVC ) shares as a part of the Altice (OTCPK: ATCEY ) acquisition . The $1.88 net arbitrage spread offers an 8% annual return if the deal closes by mid-year 2016. Solera (NYSE: SLH ) filed their preliminary proxy related to their acquisition by Vista Equity. The $1.69 net arbitrage spread offers an 8% annual return between now and next March. Google (GOOG/GOOGL) implemented its restructuring into Alphabet. Each share of GOOG and GOOGL will be automatically converted to Alphabet shares with the same rights and restrictions as before. Alphabet Class A and C shares will trade today. TNT (OTCPK: TNTEF ) held its general meeting regarding is acquisition by FedEx (NYSE: FDX ). TNT shareholders have until October 30th to tender their shares unless the acceptance period is extended. The preliminary S-4 in connection to the Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB ) acquisition of Cameron (NYSE: CAM ) was filed with the SEC. The $1.89 net arbitrage spread offers a 7% annual return if the deal closes by next March. The merger of Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ) was notified to the European Commission/EC. The first phase of the review is scheduled to expire on November 9, 2015. Valeant (NYSE: VRX ) settled shareholder litigation regarding their acquisition of Synergetics (NASDAQ: SURG ). The SURG CVR is worth between $0 and $1 and currently costs about $0.01. The Exelon (NYSE: EXC ) offer for Pepco (NYSE: POM ) is not (quite) dead yet. The companies reached a settlement with the DC mayor that could be the basis for settling with the DC Public Service Commission on appeal. The $2.72 net arbitrage spread offers a 43% annual return if they somehow manage to close this one by yearend. TPG Specialty Lending (NYSE: TSLX ) filed its definitive proxy regarding its offer for TICC Capital (NASDAQ: TICC ). The $1.49 net arbitrage spread offers a 29% annual return if the deal closes by mid-year 2016.
