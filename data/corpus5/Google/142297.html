Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Thursday, August 6. The market has become a falling knife. For a good chunk of time, buying stocks on dips or weakness has paid off in the long run. This is the time investors and money managers wait for to buy stocks at a bargain price. "I think this market has changed, in that the vast majority of portfolio managers have suddenly become fearful of buying the dips," said Cramer. He discussed that over the past few years, markets have given tremendous opportunities to buy stocks by falling. The Fed rate hike scare, Greek crisis, Russia and Ukraine, Iran deal, etc. all led to fears and the market dipping which gave bargains and discounts on stocks. Things are different now. The market seems to be in a freefall and money seems to waiting on the sidelines for the market to bottom. There have been 60 stocks with new lows in the past few days, which means that those investors who bought on dips have been losing. If this wasn't enough, the commodity sector has taken a heavy beating and coal, energy, iron ore stocks are down by almost 40-50% from their highs. Even the MLPs were not spared. Rails and industrial sectors were also hit, and then it was the tech sector's turn due to weakness in China and the strong dollar. A company like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was also hit. These moves have hit the investors who buy on dips very hard. This strategy failed for reliable stocks like Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ). The only leader in this market has been Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). What is good for Netflix, is only good for Netflix. "You're trying to catch a falling knife and unless you're a butcher block, you'll have very little to show for it except bright red losses oozing from your portfolio," said Cramer. CEO interview - Allergan (NYSE: AGN ) The drug company formerly known as Actavis delivered a very strong quarter by beating earnings and revenue estimates, but the stock got slammed. This was the company's first quarter after the acquisition of Allergan. The company has almost 70 products in the pipeline in mid-to-late stage development. Cramer thinks since the company delayed issuing guidance till September, the stock was hammered. He interviewed CEO Brent Saunders. "The DOJ investigation really is a red herring. Each one of these things are important, and we disclosed it this morning," said Saunders. He added that drug pricing is more like a commodity business that works on supply and demand. The government has been used to seeing the drug prices going down. He mentioned that Actavis integration in the US is almost complete. Cramer then posed a question on dividend as the company's balance sheet is strong. However due to the tax status of the balance sheet, acquisitions make more sense. The company has made $150B of acquisitions this year and Allergan has earned credibility to deploy capital in the most effective way. The company's Alzheimer's drug will be eligible for reimbursement from Medicare from 2016. The company's effort in making a breakthrough in depression is in early stages. There is a sector-wide decline in all media stocks and loss of some subscribers in Disney has led to investor panic. "It's certainly the end of their high valuations," said Cramer. Disney is different from other media companies as content from them can be streamed at a later date, but users cannot stream ESPN as sports do not have shelf-life. This is the bread and butter of Disney's offering. Why is Disney still declining then? Cramer said that it has to do more with the mechanics of the stock market than the stock itself, as huge quantities of stocks were not sold on the first day by money managers. "Barring a catastrophe in the market, I think the sellers will be done tomorrow and Disney's huge buyback will mop up what's left," said Cramer. Money managers have started believing that Disney is not a growth stock anymore and hence are removing it from their portfolios. The fact still remains that if Disney continues losing subscribers, they will either have to cut prices or diversify. "The issue I have with the sellers is that it's not like Disney's CEO Bob Iger doesn't know this," said Cramer. Bob Iger has built theme parks and movie studios and with Disneyland Shanghai coming up, along with Star Wars, the company remains in good shape. It is much better than other media companies that depend on subscriber growth. Cramer believes Disney will succeed and by this time next year, it will be diversifying away from cable faster than any other company. How is Clorox managing to perform when Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ) haven't been able to? The company has a lot less international exposure and is incredibly managed which makes it good. The company reported an earnings beat along with higher than expected revenues and the stock is up 7% in the last week. Cramer interviewed Clorox's new CEO Benno Dorer. He said that the company is continuously delivering consistent and profitable growth. Burt's Bees brand is focused on younger consumers and hence Clorox has partnered with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to advertise online. Almost 30% of the advertisement budget is for online advertising. The company is also monitoring social media for flu outbreaks and helping get disinfecting wipes to local retailers just when they're most needed. As consumers want quick cleaning products, the wipes are an important product. He also discussed other products like bleach and trash bags and the innovation which drives their sales. On leaving Venezuela, he said that it was the right move as the company was losing money there. There are companies that do well as Fed rates do not matter to their business. Zoetis is the largest animal health company in the world that makes vaccines and medicines for both pets and livestock. The company reported a good quarter on Tuesday but the stock did not rally. In fact, Cramer thinks that this is the kind of stock investors should be buying. Activist Bill Ackman's Pershing Square owns more than 8% in the company. Cramer interviewed CEO Juan Ramon Alaix to find out what lies ahead for the company. Alaix said that the world will need medicines and technology in order to feed the population. Outbreaks in poultry and cattle is an issue that will always be present. That's where Zoetis steps in. As pet spending in the US increases 15% per year, the company's animal companion products are growing well. There were also supply issues and the company is improving production and by 2016, they'll be meeting all customer demand. On the relationship with Pershing Square, he said, "We now have a representative of Pershing Square on our board, and it is good to have the perspective of an important shareholder in the discussion with our board. So, I think the collaboration is going very well." EMC (NYSE: EMC ): The fundamentals of EMC's business slowed a long time ago. Be careful of this and VMware (NYSE: VMW ). Solar City (NASDAQ: SCTY ): This is a cult stock. Six Flags (NYSE: SIX ) and Cedar Fair (NYSE: FUN ): Both these companies are money and are well run. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ): Yahoo is a buy as excluding Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan, it should be worth something.
