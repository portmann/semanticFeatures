Apple Watch: Revenue Projections - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch will be available for sale in April. Several models with different distribution of sales are analyzed. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is challenging the watch industry with the new Apple Watch collections of smartwatches. Already there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether the new devices will be popular or not. The products enter a field with many entries from startups like Pebble, and major existing players such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has created a toolkit for its Android operating system. The investor wants to know several things: The first is impossible to say. There are many estimates being floated in the media, from a total flop to anywhere between 8 and 41 million units for this year. The Wall Street Journal Digits reported that Apple was building between 5 and 6 million watches just for the launch. But to get to revenues, one also needs to know the distribution of the various Apple Watch models since the prices vary enormously. In my analysis, I present several possible distributions models, calculated in terms of 1 million units. The reader can then easily evaluate both revenue and profits for each level of sales. Profit margins are all important as they determine the bottom line. The margins on the gold Edition collection models are of particular interest as they are expected to be very high - some say as much as 90%. We will evaluate this in a follow up article. Apple Watch comes in three collections. The lowest priced, anodized aluminum Sport; the stainless steel Apple Watch; and the 18k gold or rose gold Edition collection. Prices are summarized below. I have taken these prices, and applied various scenarios, or projections, in which each scenario is presented as a percentage split between the 3 Apple Watch collections: Apple Watch/Sport/Edition. Collections are split into the 42mm and 38mm sizes. Additionally, estimated average selling price for each of these is estimated, and these ASPs may change in different projections. All the projection tables are presented on my blog . Here I summarize only. One example table is given here, for what I consider a reasonably conservative projection: 44% Apple Watch, 51% Sport, and 5% Edition. For each watch category (collection/size) there is an estimated percentage of total units sold. These are consolidated for the collection, color coded. Base price and estimated ASP is then given. A projection is made of the value for sales of that collection/size for a total watch sales of one million units. That is Percent X ASP X 1 million, as can be seen here: When these figures are totaled, we have the Total expected revenue per one million unit sales. From this is computed the Percent of total value for each line (blue divided by light yellow), and these are summed for the two sizes of each collection (59% for Edition collection in this scenario). Also from this Total, the collective ASP for the entire Apple Watch line - in the yellow box - can be computed. Finally, from the ASP we can easily computer the estimated revenue for any given number of units sold. Just pick a model scenario that appeals to you, and your estimate of total sales, and here is total revenue. Of note here is the way the revenue grows rapidly with the increase of Edition sales as a percentage of total sales. This is, of course, what is to be expected, but when looking at real values it is still a bit startling. The chart below shows the relationship. The final number in the X-axis label is the number of Edition watches sold as a percentage of the total number of units (e.g. 1% for the Pessimistic model). Personally, I tend to the conservative model - but in the long run. For the launch, I can see Apple planners thinking that they would rather run out of Sport models than Edition models and scheduling production for the latter. As for numbers, I think that 24 million figure for the rest of the calendar year would be extremely successful, and quite likely. Comparing the Conservative and Moderate models, the difference is only 1%, but the revenue difference is 10%. In the next post on the topic, we will discuss the Profit Margin aspect of the different collections and how the sales of Edition watches will affect this figure even more.
