8 Reasons Why Gilead Is A Better Investment Than Intel And 3 Reasons Why It Is Not - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) | Seeking Alpha Gilead and Intel are both very large $150B market cap companies. Gilead and Intel both have huge profits and cash flow. Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) are two very large tech companies, one biotech and one computer tech. Although they do not compete directly they do compete indirectly for investment dollars. Both have many adherents here on SA and rightly so. However there are many differences in their investment profiles and in this article I will attempt to outline some of them. As can be seen in the following table GILD sales are growing rapidly thanks to their Hep-C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Although there are many who doubt GILD can maintain this rate or anywhere close to it in future years I think the total market for Hep-C cure is in excess of $500B and will grow for the next 5 to 10 years. I outlined my reasons for this optimism in this article " Buy Gilead: Hep-C Market Is At Least $500 Billion Over The Next 10 Years ". At the current run rate GILD is looking at sales of at least $32B next year. Intel's sales for the last 5 quarters has been anemic but they do have some new products in the pipeline that could restore sales growth but the timing is iffy at this point. Intel is well known for its high GM usually above 60%. But GILD's is even higher than that at 90%. That means that even though Intel's sales are 75% greater than GILD's ($56 to $32) Gilead's incremental profit per sales dollar increase is much higher. Not only is Gilead's GM much higher than Intel's its gets to that GM much quicker than Intel does. When the FDA approves a product, the product is fully developed and ready to go commercial in very short order. That's because part of the FDA's approval process includes manufacturing and even packaging. So when the FDA says go, GILD can fire up the manufacturing immediately and get it out the door. Of course, sales and marketing have to take place too but if you look at the ramp up in Sovaldi and Harvoni sales went from zero to $5B in about a year. Intel's products have a longer ramp up due to the complexities of manufacturing products with nanometer spacing. For example predictions for Intel's new 3d NAND drives are 30% of bits in 2016, over 50% in 2016 and full production in 2017. Also the huge CAPEX involved means higher depreciation and amortization charges per item in the early years thus lowering GM. Intel's business of manufacturing chips requires an immense amount of capital. New factories or "fabs" cost in excess of $10B each with Samsung's latest entry to cost more than $14B by the time it starts production in 2017. And with new technology coming year after year Intel must spend big dollars on R&D to keep ahead of its competitors. Pharmaceuticals on the other hand are less capital intensive than the IC (integrated circuit) business although they do have more product failures than the IC companies do. Even though Intel's sales are 75% greater than Gilead's over the last 4 quarters Gilead's profits were much higher. If sales increase at the same rate going forward Gilead's lower costs will result in an ever increasing profit lead over Intel. 6. Gilead's Free Cash Flow is much higher too. As might be expected based upon the above tables FCF also shows up in Gilead's favor. Of course more FCF means potentially more dividends, more acquisitions and more buybacks or all three at the discretion of management. It is a bone of contention with Gilead shareholders that Mr. Market apparently does not believe that the Hep-C market will provide GILD with increasing profits for years to come. Many analyst's in fact think 2016 and 2017 earnings will be lower than 2015's . Since Sovaldi/Harvoni have not really gotten sales up to speed in Japan, most of Europe, China and South America I think there are increasing profits coming for years. Not to mention the ever increasing political pressure to cure more and more Hep-C patients. And there is the issue of competition which I will cover later in this article. Intel on the other hand is believed by many to be on the cusp of big sales and earnings gains over the next two years or so via Skylake processor upgrades, 3D NAND and the new 3d Xpoint. However if you look at analyst's predictions there is not much to look for in 2016 and 2017. Consensus estimates for 2016 and 2017 are 2.38 and 2.55 respectively which if true probably means Intel is fully valued right now. If you listen to GILD managements Investor presentations or conference calls they are a model of clarity, conciseness and conservativism. They tell you what happened, what is going to happen and answer all questions in a professional manner. Intel management on the other hand seems to have ADD; things come and go never to be mentioned again. We have heard about smart bracelets, drones, Haiku, 10TB 3D NAND drives and now on very short notice a game changing product, 3D Xpoint, that Intel has supposedly been working on for 20 years. What we haven't heard about is the extent of the $1B/yr plus contra revenue that was buried in the PC group last year. Nor do we receive any meaningful information on how or when they will grow IoT, a 26% CAGR market , beyond the current YTD's 8%. I have been critical of Intel's management previously in " Intel: Time For Some New Management " and " Intel Conference Call: Much Ado About Nothing ". I have also questioned Intel's ability to exploit the IoT market "I ntel: Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future ". 1. Gilead's Hep-C products are wasting assets. Gilead's Hep-C products are a cure not a palliative like most drugs. At some point in the future all eligible Hep-C patients will be cured and Gilead will stop making profits on it. And unlike Intel's processors they will not be able to make a bigger, faster, stronger new generation product like Intel does every few years. Thus Hep-C products are one and done the only question being how many future customers are there? 2. Intel has less competition than Gilead at least for the next few years. In less than a year two competitive Hep-C products have been approved. One, Viekira Pak from AbbVie is currently being sold and represents about 10% of the market. Coming in 2016 is a new product from Merck (Grazoprevir/Elbasvir) which may take some more market share from Gilead. And although Gilead is far ahead in research, contracts and worldwide marketing other Hep-C products on the horizon may take some share away. The question is how much? Intel on the other hand has two near-monopoly products in CPU chips for both the desktop and servers. These products will provide enormous sales and profits for the next few years but longer term will certainly have competition from ARM designed CPU's used by Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and Google. This article's time frame for real competition is probably too short but gives the essence of the ARM argument " More Woes For Intel: Chip, Chip, Chipping Away At Chipzilla ". 3. Intel has some new products in the early stage of production that might provide for rapid sales and profit increases in a year or two. Intel has a JV (Joint Venture) with Micron to develop a new kind of 3D NAND and an even newer type of non-volatile memory called 3D Xpoint . If they are correct in their market estimate and they can deliver commercial volumes at full margin the profits will be considerable if not at Gilead's Hep-C level. The question is when will they be able to produce commercial volumes at full margin? I would guess 2017 for 3D NAND and 2018 for 3D Xpoint. Obviously the sooner the better. Gilead and Intel are both great companies and deserve the praise they receive by advocates on SA and elsewhere. But as the quote above implies giving up the good for the great is the best investment advice. At this point in time I see Gilead as the best investment due to its huge margins and low PE combined with what I think is a $500B plus market. My only suggestion for Gilead is to do an Apple and announce a $50B buyback over the next 3 years. They could easily pay for it out of free cash flow and reducing share count by 1/3rd would increase profit per share to at least $17 (probably much more) and would ignite the stock price similar to what happened with Apple. Then use the inflated stock price to buy a new product line like they did with Pharmasset.
