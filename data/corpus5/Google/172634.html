What Attracted Me To Dividend Growth Investing, Part 1 | Seeking Alpha How I accidentally stumbled upon dividend growth investing. Time in the market instead of timing the market: compounding is your biggest ally. Over time, a small yield can easily transform into a double-digit yield on cost. I always had an above-average interest in economics and finance, and even before I was an adult, I sometimes kept track of a virtual portfolio on paper or later via one of the web's many investing websites. It was fun to follow up on stocks via the newspaper, or to watch the ticker tape on one of the financial channels on TV, so naturally I wanted to invest some money of my own when I got older. Ever since I was a little kid, the stock market piqued my interest. My first contact with stocks was in the late 1990s. It was around the time of the dot-com bubble, and I can vividly remember that it was a time when a lot of people were drawn to the stock market and invested money in risky positions. Stocks were a hot topic around the turn of the century, but then the market peaked and all those fancy technology, biotech and mining exploration stocks came crashing down. The stock market fascinated me, and 2005 was the first time I seriously considered buying stocks. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) launched its IPO in 2004 and about half a year later, I wanted to get in because I saw a bright future for the company's online advertising platform. I kept watching the stock price for weeks, but in the end I didn't pull the trigger, as Google kept going up and never really looked back. This was of course a big mistake, as this would have been a very profitable investment. My first real stock purchase didn't follow until 2007, which in hindsight was a terrible time to get in. It was some months before the financial crisis hit in earnest, and as you can probably guess, my first experience with investing didn't end well. Between 2007 and 2008, I bet money on financials, tech firms, biotech and some cyclicals, but I didn't really have a grand strategy. I made some small gains here and there, but the result is that I liquidated most of my portfolio at a loss. The years moved on, my wife and I bought a house, and investing didn't really come back on my radar until 2014. One of the companies I had put some money in back in 2007 was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Somewhat by accident, Intel was the company that made me realize the benefits of dividend growth investing. When I bought Intel's stock, I visited the chip maker's investor page and subscribed to the investor alerts so I would receive periodic e-mail updates about the company's financials. Every once in a while Intel would send me e-mails about the latest financial results, breaking news, new investments, and of course, the dividend announcements. When I bought my first Intel ( INTC ) shares, the main thing on my mind was share price appreciation. The dividend didn't seem like much - the company was paying out 11.25 cents per quarter and had a dividend yield of under 2 percent. The yield wasn't that special versus what a savings account yielded that year, so I didn't really put much thought into it and regarded it as a small but nice extra. Long after I sold my Intel stock, I kept getting these e-mails from the company because I never bothered to unsubscribe. These e-mails made me realize Intel not only returned cash to shareholders on a quarterly basis, but managed to grow its distribution quite significantly. The year-over-year increases were pretty small of course, but when I looked up Intel's dividend history, it hit me that the company was paying out a dividend of 22.5 cents per share in 2014, double the dividend I received in 2007. I found this quite intriguing: despite the financial crisis, the slowdown of the PC market, missing the take-off of the mobile market and other misfortunes, Intel still managed to double its dividend in a seven-year period! What made this special for me is that Intel is not a special stock; it is just a plain old blue chip and that is what sparked my interest. If you know the rule of 72 , you can quickly calculate that Intel managed to grow its dividend at an annualized rate of roughly 10 percent during this seven-year period. Granted, Intel froze its dividend in 2014, which caused some DGI investors to sell the stock, but it is this first-hand example of the power of compounding that made me see the potential of dividend investing - and that is the prime reason why I returned to the stock market. Each month I was generating a lot of excess cash that I no longer wanted to put in a near-zero interest rate savings account, so I took a long hard look at my options. A couple of Google searches later, I discovered there's a very lively online community dedicated to dividend growth investing. Ultimately, I decided this was the strategy I wanted to put my money in. There are of course also a lot of advocates for index investing and mutual funds. While I think those could be great strategies too, it's not really my cup of tea. I enjoy the personal connection you get with companies by buying individual stocks, and I don't want to hand over control of my portfolio to some stranger. I like to read and learn about individual companies, so putting an amount of money into something like an S&P 500 ETF didn't seem that appealing to me. Valuations of a lot of companies were not really attractive in the summer of 2014, but I felt investing in stable and large companies offered a good way to generate decent, market-like returns without taking on a lot of extra risk. From previous work and life-related experiences, I know it's important not to get stuck in paralysis by analysis. You need to do proper due diligence, of course, but it's easy to get stuck in the research phase. No one likes to lose money, so when you're new to investing, it can be quite scary to put your money at risk. I often find that the more I learn about a subject, the more I realize how little I really know about this subject. No matter how much you learn, there's always going to be someone more knowledgeable than you. So whenever you're researching investing strategies or individual stocks, you're always going to find opinions from people who will eloquently explain why your idea is a bad one. This can be very disheartening because you want to make the perfect purchase, and before you know it weeks or months pass without any action, or perhaps you'll even shelve the idea indefinitely. One of the realizations I made is that I don't have to be right every time. A lot of your ideas may fail or generate below-average returns, but every once in a while you may stumble upon something that will far exceed your expectations. While a lot of people view the stock market as risky, I came to realize the odds of doing worse than a savings account are extremely small if you move into this with a multi-decade view. In fact, the dividend yield of my portfolio far exceeds the return on a traditional savings account, so under the current zero interest-rate market situation, I feel like I'm already ahead. Another realization I made is that over time, a measly 2-3 percent yield can easily grow into a double-digit yield on cost. With a dividend growth rate of 7 percent, your yield on cost roughly doubles every 10 years or so. This means a 3 percent yield can grow into a 5.9 percent yield on cost in 10 years, 11.61 percent in 20 years, 22.84 percent in 30 years, and so on. Time is the key factor here; over the course of a couple of years, your dividends will grow slowly, but it really takes 15-20 years before compounding works its magic. Fortunately, there's a way you can super-charge your dividend income: if you reinvest your dividends, you can increase the compounding effect by an order of magnitude. To build on my experience with the Intel dividend, I took a look at what would have happened if I had not only kept the Intel stock in my portfolio, but also reinvested the dividend. For this example, let's assume I bought 500 shares of Intel at the first day of trading in 2007 and reinvested the total yearly dividend at the last trading day of each year. With a share price of $20.45, this investment would have cost me $10,225, excluding transaction fees, and it would have a forward yield of only 2.2 percent. Without dividend reinvestment, the shares would have been worth $18,145 on December 31, 2014, and I would have collected a total of $2,819.95 in dividends. So without any reinvestment, my investment plus the received dividends would have been worth $20,964.95, and in 2015, the 500 shares would pay out $480 in dividends, representing a yield on cost of 4.69 percent. By reinvesting the dividends at the end of each year, my total share count would have increased to 610 shares with a value of $22,136.9 on December 31, 2014. These 610 shares would be paying $585.60 in dividends this year, representing a yield on cost of 5.73 percent. Over time the difference between reinvesting and not becomes gradually larger; you begin to notice this effect after just seven years, but it becomes much larger if you stay longer in the market. Based on Friday's closing price, the difference is smaller, but the gist here is to show the impact of the extra compounding enabled by reinvesting your dividends. Timing the market is very difficult, so as a dividend growth investor, I believe time in the market is a lot more important. In the beginning, the impact of small monthly investments and dividend reinvestment will be very small, but over a period of 20-30 years, this strategy can build up a significant, life-changing income stream. I envision I will eventually own a portfolio of 40-50 companies, and I expect the month-to-month performance will typically be somewhat in line with the broader market. My goal here is to invest money I don't immediately need to grow a passive source of income that I hope will cover all of my monthly expenses within the next 20 years or so. I want to use dividend growth investing to achieve financial independence and/or early retirement. About 13 months ago I took the plunge. I opened a new investing account and started my dividend growth investing journey by initiating a position in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ). I always liked this company, so becoming a (very small) co-owner definitely felt great. I started my dividend growth portfolio with a couple of lump-sum investments, and every month I continue to add stocks by investing my excess cash and dividends into companies I like. This was the first part of my two-part series about what attracted me to dividend growth investing; the second part will be published later this week. Are you a fan of dividend growth investing?
