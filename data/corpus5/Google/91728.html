The Future Of Apple Hinges On The Mac Upsell - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The legacy of the Mac will continue to live on. What's important is not how much revenue the Mac generates, but how well it complements the user experience. In other words, the value add of being a Mac user is directly proportional to the number of other Apple devices you own. Therefore, the Mac will continue to grow, and while tech pundits think differently, they have this one wrong. I'm going to try something a little different here, and offer some commentary in light of some clever speculation from a WSJ journalist, who, by my definition is a very talented writer and is an astute observer of technology. But not withstanding his skill as a writer, and logic, I have to disagree with what Christopher Mims had published in a column (subscription required at link) last week from which I quote: But let's put that in perspective. In the quarter ending in January of this year, a funny thing happened at Apple. The company took in the highest revenue for its Mac line ever, yet the Mac accounted for the lowest-ever proportion of overall revenue. Apple raked in $6.9 billion on 5.5 million Macs, just 9% of overall revenue. This would be a crazy thing to say for any other company, but Apple doesn't need this revenue. Which is precisely why Apple should kill off what is perhaps its most-refined brand: The Mac. The thought process to that is absolutely baloney, and while, I'm almost certain he's borrowing from the logic of Jim Collins (the author of Good to Great), there's potential for companies to broaden their scope of effort while maintaining the core competency of the organization. Sure, narrowing the focus on areas where a company can truly be exceptional is one of many ways in which a company can succeed, but in my view a company that succeeds in the early stages of their growth phase don't have many resources, and by definition must focus on a few areas due to opportunity cost. But, when you reach the scale of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and have $200 billion in assets on the financial statement being a steward of capital not only involves the company to be proficient managers, they must also look for every opportunity in which they can growth their business to the benefit of their shareholders. If anything, Apple needs to do anything it possibly can to prop-up the top line growth rate, without creating low margin opportunities for itself. PCs are not a low margin business, not for Apple at least, so there's no reason to scale that business back, or divert resources away from Macs into iPads and iPhones. They also contribute to the top line growth rate, whereas iPads have gone nowhere for the past three or four consecutive fiscal years. The Mac business still has strategic value, as Apple has a portfolio of products it can cross-sell or in the case of Macs upsell consumers into. Upon being an owner of two Macs, two iPads, and one iPhone, I have to say that the way in which the various devices interact inclusive of Apple apps is what creates a unique platform experience. This is what differentiates the Mac from Android and Windows. A platform of devices connected to the computer, allowing users to cross the various screens with the same data and some of the same apps intact. And while we live in a post-PC era in which new devices, and experiences will alter the scope and capabilities of a computer, it doesn't mean that the desktop or laptop form factor has become primitive. In other words, the drop off in broader PC demand isn't solely attributable to tablet growth, but rather cyclical factors in which the market is having difficulty with absorbing supply in certain parts of the cycle. The PC cycle is different from the broader market cycle, and will invariably have its ups and downs. In the end, I'm certain that growth will eventually stabilize as demand for more powerful computers with more established software ecosystems will come back into the forefront of what I would call a revival of the desktop and laptop form factor. Furthermore, the Mac is going to grow, as iPhone users will soon adopt the Mac for its intended purpose of getting work done. People in the younger age demographic eventually grow up, and will get a job, and when they get hired they're going to be confronted with the dingy Windows PC or semi-hipster Mac. I think many will buy the Mac. It's no longer a branding cachet in which the marketers have to come up with some new brand slogan to explain why a Mac is better than a PC. Based on the person's own experience with an iPhone, the natural conclusion is to assume that Mac OS X is better than Windows 10. Therefore, the Mac will gradually gain customers, because it's way easier to cross-sell after establishing a phenomenal experience in other device categories. PCs are an inescapable fact of life, and when confronted with options, any rational human being would buy a Mac over a PC. When confronted with investment decisions, I would say Apple is a better stock than Microsoft and Google. And, anyone crazy enough to say Apple outgrew the importance of the Mac has missed the importance of having an ecosystem.
