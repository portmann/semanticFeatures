Apple's iPad Problem And How To Solve It - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Even Apple couldn't predict the collapse in tablet sales growth. Apple must spend more on R&D if it wants to prosper over the long-haul. Steve Jobs said of the first generation iPad in 2010 , "iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price." Two years later, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) posted blowout earnings, in part because it sold 11.8 million iPads during the quarter . Unfortunately, this "magical" device has apparently lost its touch. Just last quarter, Apple reported selling 12.6 million iPads , up less than 7% versus three years ago. Apple's "next big thing" from 2010 is on the verge of going the way of the iPod. That being said, there are several changes Apple can make to reinvigorate its tablet lineup, but time is running short. According to research firm Gartner, "the collapse of the tablet market in 2014 was alarming." After double-digit growth from 2012 to 2013, Gartner is predicting the tablet market will only grow by 8% in 2015. Unfortunately, Apple's iPad sales aren't growing, they are shrinking fast. In the last quarter, Apple reported unit sales declined 23%, and average revenue per unit fell by more than 7%. Apple's first mover advantage helped the company tremendously, but that advantage seems to have come to an end. Based on operating systems, Gartner expects worldwide devices running Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android OS to grow by nearly 26% in 2015. By comparison, iOS/Mac and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows are expected to post growth of less than 7%. That being said, 2016 appears to be a year of separation. Android is still expected to run ahead of the pack, but Windows is slated to grow devices by 11%, compared to a 7% growth rate from iOS/Mac. The idea that Windows could overtake iOS/Mac when it comes to growth is a clear sign that the iPad lineup needs significant changes. Before revamping the iPad, Apple must address a bigger issue. In the technology industry, it's difficult to thrive over the long-haul without a serious commitment to research and development. According to research by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , "In years of increasing economic growth, R&D investment usually contributes to that acceleration. Similarly, when economic growth slows, R&D often contributes to the slowdown." In short, companies that spend an increased amount on R&D contribute to economic growth (and thus earnings growth). With that in mind, over the last few years, Apple's R&D budget as a percentage of its revenue has lagged it competition significantly. In the current quarter, Apple spent just 3.3% of its revenue on R&D. By comparison, Google spent 16% , and Microsoft spent nearly 14% . The fact that a product introduced almost eight years ago (iPhone), generates the majority of Apple's revenue and profits, suggests finding the "next big thing" is harder than the company wants to admit. There are at least three distinct changes Apple can make to revive iPad sales. To be fair, iOS 9 is a step in the right direction, but only a half a step. If we look at some of the most popular tablets, they have one thing in common…multitasking. The Google Nexus 9 is priced at $100 less than the iPad Air 2, and has fast multitasking. The Microsoft Surface 3 is priced the same as the iPad Air 2, and can multi-task side-by-side. In iOS 9 you can side-by-side multi-task, but only on the iPad Air 2. Making true side-by-side multitasking only available on the company's newest and most expensive tablet is a missed opportunity. The issue is, true multitasking across at least the last two models of iPad Air and iPad Mini would give users of older iPads a reason to upgrade at a more reasonable cost. The second issue is, iCloud related. Five gigabytes of free storage to sync all devices is simply not enough. Google gives users 15 GB of Google Drive storage for free. The Microsoft Surface 3 includes a year's worth of Office 365, and its 1 TB of OneDrive storage. Last but not least, Apple needs to push the design envelope. While newer iPad models have gotten thinner and lighter than prior versions, this is no longer enough. Apple should have learned this lesson from the iPhone. By releasing the iPhone 6 and 6+, the company unleashed pent-up demand for larger screen phones. The iPad Air 2's 9.7" screen seems a hair too small to become a laptop replacement. The fact that the Macbook Air goes down to 11" suggests this is the smallest comfortable screen for a full-fledged laptop. The Surface 3's screen of 10.8" reaffirms this is the laptop replacement size. Apple needs to take the bold step of allowing a larger screen iPad (iPad Pro?) to cannibalize the Macbook Air's sales. The company has consistently priced its wares at a premium, so a $699 iPad Pro would seem to be the sweet spot for this in-between device. Google's Nexus 9, and the Microsoft Surface 3, both have keyboard options. If Apple wants to take full advantage of the iOS9 multitasking capabilities, a slightly bigger screen and an Apple designed keyboard would be a natural fit. The bottom line is, Apple seems focused on the iPhone and the Apple Watch, but the iPad still represents almost 10% of the company's sales. It's time for Apple to re-imagine the "magical" iPad experience once again. If the company keeps pumping out "thinner" and "lighter," Android and Windows will continue to take market share, and that's something Steve Jobs would never have tolerated.
