ETF Hub Jul  2 2015, 18:40 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) rose 1.2% today following news president Renee James and 3 other execs will be leaving soon as part of a management shakeup. In an employee memo (.pdf), CEO Brian Krzanich stated Intel's Technology & Manufacturing Group and HR ops (previously reporting to James) will now directly report to him. The rest of James' direct reports will "transition to other organizations." Intel's PC, mobile, and server chip units began directly reporting to Krzanich back in 2013 . Since then, Intel's PC CPU and Atom mobile CPU units have been merged. Discussing the moves in general, Krzanich says they aim to "continue [Intel's] drive for velocity and streamlined decision-making." Apple , Microsoft , Google , and other tech giants have carried out big shakeups in recent years with similar goals in mind. Bloomberg reports James "doesn’t have a new job lined up and is leaving to carry out the search." Citi's Chris Danely considers James' departure a positive given "the lack of growth and low profitability of [Intel's] software business" under her leadership. Danely: "We believe Renee James was largely responsible for spearheading Intel’s confusing $7.7 billion acquisition of McAfee in 2011. The McAfee deal has been a major disappointment in our view as there are virtually no synergies between Intel’s core silicon business and McAfee security software. When Intel acquired [McAfee] it generated 2010 revenue of $2.1 billion with operating margins of roughly 11%. We estimate McAfee revenues have remained roughly flat since the company was acquired, while operating margins have declined to the mid-single digit range." it will take more than the loss of a few upper management to effectively compete against any company. That being said,  streamlining decision making is always good for an organization ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
