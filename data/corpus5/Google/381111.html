Apple -1% on report iPhone production slowdown will continue - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apr 15 2016, 13:12 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is dipping in the last few minutes, -1.1%, alongside a Nikkei report that the company is stretching a production cut in iPhones into another quarter with sluggish sales continuing. That's according to parts suppliers who heard about the cuts, Nikkei says. The company apparently doesn't plan to put out enough iPhone SEs to offset a slowdown in the flagship 6s and 6s Plus models. Apple had cut production in this year's calendar Q1 by about 30%; the report is that that reduced level will continue in the current quarter. Ay fam call me bill ackman I hold my positions through thick and thin. Didn't get out at the 90s because I'm mega bear. Waiting for aapl to get exposed Supply cuts have already been priced in. This is an act of desperation in front of earnings. Just like clockwork with these shadowy informants with their ominous "news". Hold on, be patient, this is a solid investment that rewards us. It's already reversing itself. Back to 112 on Monday. Yawn. We have seen the early indicats for many months now.   Some on SA have been signaling the alarm.    But as they say you can lead a horse but .... You guys realize Q2 and Q3 are always slower than Q1 and Q4 right? Oh sorry I forgot who I was talking to. Carry on. kazetg3,   I do NOT think people are talking quarter to quarter.   It is a YoY thing so NOT sure what the point of one quarter being bigger or slower than another fits. The primary issue is that Google is killing them.   They are hemorrhaging smartphone share and they need to get serious about slowing it down any way they can. Glen, you repeat it always and it's simply not true. There have been no declines in iPhone sales/shipments YoY to date. None. Nadda. Nil. a $15 billion plunge in market cap value based on a flimsy, unsupported report. No wonder the day traders are the only winners. wait till April 25. it might be a massacre on that day unless there are some unexpected surprises from Apple So, where's there surprise there? 2ndQ is always a slower period compared to 1stQ and 4thQ, no? It is also stated in the article that production of iPhone 7 might begin in May, so why produce more of current or previous models? Whoever wrote that, surely can't know how to piece puzzles together. They are comparing 2ndQ 2016 vs 2ndQ 2015 and 2016 is lower than 2015  which means iphone sales is on a decline That is shocking, we all expected that after the release of the SE lines would form in front of Apple stores with people wanting to get hands on the iPhone6s (at the end of the circle) before the iPhone7 comes out.... Between, show me one Apple Store in the US where you can walk in and leave with a iPhoneSE right now Umm, since 2012 iPhone sales have always been lower in Q3 and Q4 than in Q2 (and lower in Q2 than Q1), so if they are simply maintaining the production levels from Q2, why is that a surprise or even a negative? This sounds like a non-story to me, and a buying opportunity for those who have been waiting for a dip. All industries............  if we can save such and such a percent by dealing Im neither long nor short AAPL but it baffles me how everyone who is long instantly bashes the short and tries to justify his position. I myself will probably be buying some weekly puts closer to earnings. I guess some of the local mobile phone suppliers/competitors i.e. Samsung, HTC, have a cozy relationship with Nikkei Reports (should I say dollar relationship?) to manufacture and try and spin out potential negative news on AAPL -How cute 1. If they sell more phone -still price goes down.  Analysts say they did not meet what was expected 2. If the sell less phone -still price goes sown. Analysts say its the end of phone. Analysts decide when to raise the price and when to pull it down.   Sale and revenue doesn't matter any more Sold out everywhere and still clocking a 2-3 week shipping time on new orders. There may be a lag in iPhone 6S sales but there is no lag in iPhone sales.
