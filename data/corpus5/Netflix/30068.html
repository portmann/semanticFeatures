Why Netflix's Insane Valuation Actually Makes Sense - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub It is becoming increasingly clear every year that streaming will be the future mode of television consumption. Netflixâ€™s original content makes it a must have service for consumers who cut the cord. International costs will continue to eat away at profit, but the rewards are well worth the wait. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) beat analysts' expectations concerning subscriber growth, sending the stock price up more than 16%, as of early Thursday afternoon. I Know First published a bullish algorithmic forecast on Netflix on January 9th citing the promising original content and international expansion, and the stock price has climbed over 40% since that time. These two factors continue to play a huge role in the stock price's appreciation, even as they eat into profits, as was seen in the most recent earnings report. However, the main overall factor driving the bullish behavior of the stock is the reshaping of the TV industry, in which Netflix is a step ahead of its peers. Even though profitability and the valuation might seem problematic, the company is the market leader in television streaming and is set to reap the rewards of an evolving television market. The television model has been slow to evolve over the past few decades. That is set to change in the next few years, as streaming content and cutting the cord is finally set to make television viewing more convenient for consumers. The first models are now on the market. Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) have introduced the Sling TV and Playstation Vue, respectively. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is also rumored to be releasing its own subscription service. These products will give consumers more choices about which channels they want to include in their packages, allowing them to decrease the price they pay for cable by not having to pay for channels that they do not need. These services are definitely not a threat to Netflix, as they are more complimentary services than competitive. This can already be seen with the streaming service from Dish, Sling TV. Currently, one of the biggest events on network television is the show Mad Men. Critically acclaimed, the show does not have the biggest ratings, but does have a very loyal viewership. Consumers who use Sling TV are able to watch the current season of the show whenever they want, or at least the last four episodes. However, they do not have access to the previous seasons of the show, which Netflix does. If a consumer wants to start watching the show to catch up with the national conversation surrounding it, they can watch previous seasons on Netflix, which is available on Sling TV, and then watch the current season using through Dish. HBO, the television subscription service owned by Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), earlier this month also released its own standalone streaming service, HBO Now. Again, the two services are not so much competitors as they are complimentary products in a market going through a fundamental change. The two streaming services provide different, original content to their users. Consumers might want to get HBO Now so that they can view the wildly popular show Game of Thrones, but they also need Netflix to watch shows like Orange is the New Black. Many view the cord-cutting trend, where consumers stop paying for traditional cable models for streaming services, as just an overhyped trend. This is the key differentiator between investors with bullish and bearish outlooks concerning Netflix, in my opinion. Netflix continues to experience healthy subscription growth, domestically and internationally, and continue to believe that they will eventually reach 60-90 million domestic subscribers. This looks increasingly more likely every quarter, and it easily could reach the high end of that goal if streaming services take over, as I believe they will. This development could be similar to the smartphone market when Apple first introduced the iPhone. Originally thought to be a niche market for wealth consumers, they have now taken over the wireless phone market. Streaming could do the same, especially after Apple introduces their new streaming service, as they have an extremely loyal customer base. Netflix is already extremely popular in wealthy, technologically savvy households, but the expanding streaming service market will push Netflix into regular households. This trend will help push Netflix towards its goal of up to 90 million domestic subscribers. If any extra evidence were needed to support this trend, the NFL, which is the most popular sports league in the US and does very well with the key 18-49 year old male demographic, is now exploring the streaming model. The league will broadcast a live game through streaming for the first time on October 25th, further evidence that the streaming model is coming to change television. If consumers cut the cord and turn to streaming services like I believe they will, Netflix will be positioned to take advantage because of the original content that the service offers, along with their catalogue of exclusive rights to other popular shows, such as Friends. While the costs of this content are substantial, eating into current profits, they are necessary to position the company as a must-have for streaming consumers. Although Netflix does not release viewing data, House of Cards and Orange is the New Black have clearly become hits, evidenced by their Emmy nominations and presence in the national conversation surrounding television. This is a good start, but two shows are not enough, both because they are not enough to keep consumers around after they have been watched and because television watchers have such varying tastes. Netflix has done well with their new content to diversify their offerings, making sure that they have products for everyone. For example, the recently released Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is a comedy series for Tina Fey, known for her time at SNL and the critically acclaimed 30 Rock. This show is very different from the previously mentioned shows, and has been received well by critics. Again, there is no way to know how many people are watching the shows that Netflix releases, but there is some data pointing to the streaming service's overall success. CEO Reed Hastings announced last week that Netflix subscribers watched over 10 billion hours last quarter. While this does not give data for any one show, it does illustrate that consumers are engaged by the product more than ever, as they watched only over 4 billion hours during the same quarter two years ago. One of the most exciting projects that Netflix is engaging in premiered on April 10th. Daredevil is a show based off of a Marvel comic book and is the first of four such shows set to premiere on the streaming site. As a darker comic book show, when compared to Marvel's other shows on television such as Agent Carter, Daredevil has been well received by critics and audiences alike. The show is exciting because of the possibilities of the universe, as the show can overlap with the other Marvel projects coming soon. The success of the Avengers movie has shown that such overlap can be hugely successful, and there are already plans for the characters to meet up at some point. The flexibility of Netflix is perfect for this kind of project, as shows can be longer than a half hour. Also coming during the upcoming quarter is the release of the newest Orange is the New Black, which I already mentioned is critically acclaimed and generates conversation about Netflix, and new series Grace and Frankie and Sense8. Even more exciting, the first original feature film will be released on the streaming service later this year, a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Original content including series, comedy specials, and movies will make Netflix a necessity for cord cutters in the future, driving more subscriber growth. The main bearish argument surrounding Netflix is its relative lack of profitability. Content costs play a part, but the main reason is the company's focus on expanding internationally. The company announced in January that it plans to finish expansion by the end of 2016, and will have a presence in over 200 countries at that time. The management team has mentioned that the plan is to remain break-even globally until that time, after which they will be able to increase profits from that point forward. This was seen during the previous quarter, as international streaming had a contribution margin of -15.6%, and it is expected to get worse before it gets better. Further harming the profitability is currency headwinds, as Netflix openly acknowledges that it does not hedge for currency trends. Even with all of the drawbacks included in the international expansion, Netflix has managed to remain profitable overall, which is a good sign. The international subscription growth shows that this strategy will pay off if investors are able to bite the diminished profits for the next couple of years. International subscribers hit 20 million this quarter, a huge milestone that shows international viewers are fans of the business model and content that Netflix provides. Figure 1.

The international profits were also hurt by the fact that the company shifted marketing costs to international markets, which should further drive growth in the future. This makes sense since international subscribers are growing at a faster pace than domestically, as can be seen in figure 1, and still have more room to grow. The presence in international markets will allow the company to eventually attract more than 150 million subscribers worldwide, which will give Netflix the ability to spend on the content needed to be a major player in the television as a streaming service market.

The algorithmic analysis is in agreement with the bullish fundamental outlook of the company. While profitability was underwhelming and will most likely continue to be for at least the rest of the year, it is well worth it as the company is positioned to be a leader in the new television model. When streaming takes over traditional cable services as the preferred television model for consumers, Netflix's original content and presence internationally will give it a leg up on the competition, driving subscription growth and strong profitability.
