Netflix Is Too Hard-Wired When It Comes To Developing Its Own Hardware - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's content-driven strategy has served it well so far with subscriber growth. Netflix's partnerships with others such as pay-TV providers have helped widen its service availability. A Netflix-branded streaming device would further increase its service's visibility. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has got a lot to thank the Internet ecosystem for its content delivery. Different digital platforms of computers, mobile devices, game consoles, set-top boxes and smart TVs provide Netflix viewers convenient access points for the company's growing content offerings. While benefiting from others' Internet-connected hardware, Netflix itself has been focusing on obtaining third party content and later on, producing its own original shows as the way to attract subscribers. As of the end of June 2015, over 40 million people subscribe to Netflix in the U.S., some over 10 percent of the population and a celebrated affair from the company's content-driven efforts. As a result of its subscriber growth, Netflix's stock has done very well. Over the last two and a half years, a stock of under $100 rose to be in the $700 range and was becoming too expensive to own. A 7-to-1 share split had to be called for to bring the stock back to the $100 level, providing some perceived affordability. But knowing by heart that Netflix still commands the same valuation multiple when it was a $700 stock, anyone who purchases Netflix shares at this price level is betting on continued, robust subscriber growth. That's a daunting task and could become harder to achieve when content alone may not be enough to further stimulate subscriber growth. Netflix has produced some hugely successful shows, but so far, they're reaching only 10 percent of the population. How will Netflix go from here to sign up as many more viewers as possible out of the remaining 90 percent? If so many potential viewers are not coming to such alluring Netflix content, it may be no longer a content problem but potentially a streaming device issue. While any streaming device is good enough for a willing Netflix user to find Netflix's service on it, only a Netflix-branded streaming device presents an unobstructed visibility so that even someone not initially interested in Netflix's service may consider using it simply because the service is visibly there on the Netflix device. The idea of having a Netflix visibility that's truly ubiquitous is as important as, if not more than, the company's belief in unique content when it comes to gaining and sustaining subscriber growth. The availability of Netflix's service on all streaming devices is still not the same as an unencumbered Netflix visibility, which only a Netflix-branded streaming device can showcase. When bundled with other applications on others' devices, Netflix's service has to compete for eyeballs against all available choices. Netflix actually believes in making its service as visible as possible, but not by launching its own streaming device. The company has tried to team up with pay-TV providers to incorporate Netflix's service into their TV-viewing navigation systems in hopes of signing up some of the pay-TV customers. The agreement with Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR ) to insert Netflix's service into the hotel chain's own TV platform is another example of Netflix's desire to make its service a thing of ubiquitousness. This illustrates that Netflix understands the importance of actively pushing its service to where it's right before a potential viewer's eye. Netflix didn't just leave it to chance by relying only on potential viewers to decide whether to look for Netflix on their computer or a hand-held device. When someone didn't decide to use Netflix on such a device, that would be one subscriber lost. With all that Netflix is trying to do, the company may think it's doing a good job promoting its service by being highly involved in the fight for subscribers. However, Netflix is not going all the way, and should consider to include a device-driven subscriber acquisition. But First, Netflix has to soften its hardcore stance on no to streaming device. Netflix CEO has a dismissive conviction of " no-value add " in launching the company's own streaming device. But based on the analysis so far, it just seems that Mr. Hastings may be mistaking his service's availability everywhere for a true, ubiquitous Netflix visibility that could potentially make using Netflix a thing of automatic. The only way to engage with potential users in that process is to have a Netflix-branded streaming device. But it cannot be a mobile phone or tablet as both devices have to build other complex computing functions beyond a simple streaming task. Plus, consumers would not want to trade all the goodies from an iPhone or Android for something called Netflix. So the ideal streaming device to help achieve a ubiquitous Netflix visibility is easily a set-top box or better yet, smart TV. The power of people still watching TV from their living rooms has been overly underestimated all in the name of changing digital times. While many people use computers and mobile devices for work, they go and sit in front of a TV for entertainment. Some may not sign up for Netflix even though it's available on their other digital devices, but the same people just may pay $8.99 for Netflix's service if they have a Netflix TV right in their sight. A third party TV just may do the opposite, encouraging people to continue to pay big dollars for other pay-TV programs. The utter convenience of a Netflix service, or totally unhindered Netflix visibility, as provided by a piece of Netflix streaming hardware, is what could win over the audience here. Netflix has embarked on a global expansion and is expected to be nearly global by the end of 2016 . Netflix investors had better believe that a global pursuit has got to be an ambition and is not prompted by any misinformed concerns of a saturating U.S. streaming market, something of a sure misconception. While having not made it easier to penetrate in the home market, a lack of device-driven strategy may show up as a fatal weakness in international markets. China's Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) is said to be competing with Netflix in that country's sizable media market. Not surprisingly, it will do so through the use of both Alibaba-branded set-top box and smart TV . It's time for Netflix to rewire its hardware strategy.
