Disney Q2 2015 Buy - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney has proved to be a consistent, solid performer over an extended period of time, delivering superior investor returns. I have high conviction in the long-term success of the Disney business model and am accumulating the company regularly on a quarterly basis. I expect Disney to deliver solid dividend income over the long term, and recently made a purchase of the stock. I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a low-cost brokerage , with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating. My Disney holding is still fairly small today, however, I expect to add to the stock more substantially in the coming years. Disney has a long-term track record of delivering excellent returns for its investors. In fact, a $10,000 investment in DIS made in 1970 would be worth $2.4M today. This reflects a return over time of over 13% annually. It is this track record and the strength of the Disney franchise that interests me for rising total return and dividend income. Disney recently hiked its dividend some 15%. The business has a track record of very strong dividend growth over a long period of time. Disney has increased its dividend close to 27% annually over the last 5 years and more than 17% annually over the last 10 years. It will be interesting to see for what period of time it can keep up this track record of mid-teens dividend growth. Longrundata.com suggests that Disney has managed to increase its dividend at close to 15% annually for the last 25 years. With EPS growth of close to 15% annually over the last 10 years and a payout ratio that is only at a level of 20%, Disney has the scope to maintain mid-teens dividend growth for the foreseeable future. An interesting recent development has been the launch of Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) skinny bundles, which serve to group bundles of channels together at a range of price points for the consumer. If this concept gains traction, it may have implications on Disney content revenues. For example, if Disney premium channels and ESPN are excluded from basic bundles, this may potentially lower Disney advertising and subscription revenues. Disney and a number of other content provides have launched a legal challenge to Verizon's decision. It will be interesting to see if this is just the beginning of a move toward allowing customers to have personalized content packages. I feel that in this environment, Disney will still be in a fairly strong position as ESPN and Disney family kids channels have a strong brand name and recognition amongst users. There is of course a risk that price-conscious customers avoid more expensive bundles if given cheaper options. I feel very comfortable in my decision to accumulate Disney long term. The long-term trend is toward multiple content distribution platforms. There is increasing evidence of this in the emergence of platforms like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Hulu and others. With the emergence of these new platforms, content will become more valuable and continue to extract increasingly higher premiums. New modes of distribution will create new windows to monetize content. And while there will be a trend towards the creation of lower priced, cheaper content, premium content will still have a place. To get an idea of just how successful Disney character franchises have been, Disney now owns more than 8 franchises with sales exceeding $1B. Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Star Wars, Monsters, Spider-Man, Cars, Disney Jr. and the Princesses account for more than $1B each in sales volume. Each successful character franchise reinforces the success of the Disney moat. It means a new set of characters to take through the company's fixed cost production and marketing activities in game and figurine production and movie development. It's another set of characters to add value to existing theme parks, giving patrons yet another reason to visit. As long as Disney can continue to either organically develop new franchises or acquire them at reasonable cost, it will continue to have long-term success. Disney currently trades at a P/E ratio of 24.5, and a forward P/E ratio of 20. The company trades at a higher P/E multiple, price to book multiple or price to sales multiple than it has traded at on average for the last 5 years. Even its dividend yield is lower than the average over this period. Disney's price has risen strongly since I first started accumulating. It's up more than 17% in the year to date alone. My first couple of purchases were done at $88. My November 2014 purchase was done at $91.50, my March 2015 purchase was done at $106.50. My most recent purchase in June was done at $111. In spite of this, the company is likely close to fair value. Morningstar rates the stock 3 stars. This is a long-term stock to buy and hold in my opinion, given the strength of the brand and long-term trends for content providers. I am comfortable accumulating Disney on a quarterly basis for the long term. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
