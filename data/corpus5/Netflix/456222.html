Netflix Calls Pay-TVs Stacking Bluff, And Wins - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Confirmation has arrived of the Netflix-CW deal, with terms about as expected. Netflix has, at least in this deal, seen off attempts to carve out stacking rights from its content agreements. The deal confirms that Netflix content fees remain too rich to forego, and give the company substantial leverage in content negotiations. Well, that took a little longer than expected. But the deal between Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and CW, which was supposed to be announced a couple weeks ago, is finally official . The deal is certainly good news for Netflix and for CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ), CW's owners. And it is actually rather revealing of some of the ongoing dynamics and changes in TV entertainment. When I wrote the article articulating a bullish interpretation of what was then only strong rumors of a new deal, some pointed out that it seemed a bit presumptuous of me to assume I knew what Netflix and CW were going to say. Fair enough. Now that its official, though, it seems worth pointing out that the rumors appear to have been more or less dead-on. The new deal is a five-year extension of the current arrangement and drastically cuts the windowing delay for complete seasons, all the way down to eight days according to Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos. The deal will cover all new and existing scripted shows, but only covers past-season rights, not in-season rights. Meanwhile, as expected, the "rolling five" rights will revert back to the CW Network itself and its own web/mobile app. That means that Hulu, co-managed by Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and FOX (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) - Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) also owns a stake but is prohibited from participating in management - is now cut off from CW content completely. The only possible problem lies in the finances. As per usual, financial terms were not disclosed. Last time, though, that didn't stop everyone from whispering the figure, which was pegged at around $1 billion. The rumor was that the new deal was for about the same amount, which as I said before is actually a fairly auspicious number for Netflix. It paints a rather auspicious portrait of Netflix's ability to control content costs, one of the key sticking points of many Netflix bears. The lack of confirmation of that number may be concerning to some, but I am not worried. First, while I don't want to get into trouble for relying on rumors again, nothing has hit the Street (or is it the strip in Hollywood?) suggesting that the earlier number was wrong. I have yet to see any entertainment publication publish a substantially different number, or even suggest that there is a number to publish that they just can't confirm. There have been no real denials of the figure. But again, that's rumors. More to the point is that, as I explained before, the number we have is entirely consistent with what the prevailing trend in recent content negotiations has been, for both Netflix and leading traditional providers such as DIRECTV (NYSE: T ) or Comcast, which have also reported 9-10% annual programming cost growth. Readers can check my previous article for the full formula about how to break down the new vs old contracts, I won't take up space doing that all over again. But when our own calculations of what the number should be match what the rumors - yes, rumors, I admit - tell us the number actually is, it becomes less of a rumor and more of a strong inference. In some ways, the most interesting part of the news was what happened to Comcast's and Disney's Hulu. And what it says about what was once pegged as the next great front in the digital vs analog, new vs old guard media titans war: stacking rights. The final bidding for CW's content came down to Netflix and Hulu. Hulu wanted to expand its own old deal with the CW, which gave it the so-called "rolling five" rights. Those are the rights to show the five most recently aired episodes on TV, but Hulu was no longer satisfied. It wanted to replace the rolling five with stacking rights, which are rights to show every episode from the current TV season on-demand. Netflix, of course, has never been interested in in-season rights. Part of its brand is binge-viewing, which 88% of its customers do and which isn't really feasible until a whole season's worth of episodes is available. But CW still had to pick one or the other, because while Netflix didn't really want the stacking rights, it didn't want anyone else to have them either. Netflix sees stacking rights as greatly diminishing the value of its own past-season rights. Why have a Netflix subscription if you already watched the season on-demand through the in-season provider? Netflix has said that seasons which have had their stacking rights sold are worth 20-50% less to them, and they will cut the payments for any shows which have a stacking deal with another provider accordingly. Many have long expected that Netflix would have to yield on this point in order to maintain access to new high-quality content from their partners. If they had, it would severely undermine Netflix's value proposition and go a long way toward restoring the traditional balance of power in TV entertainment. This potential blow to Netflix is one of several reasons Netflix bears have cited as a justification for shorting or selling the stock. This deal may be reason to re-evaluate that thesis. Netflix stuck to its guns and told CW to pick one: Hulu and stacking or Netflix and bingeing. And for all the expectations that Netflix would have to cave, we now learn that ultimately, it was the content provider that blinked. Not only will Hulu not get stacking rights: there will be no stacking. Even CW itself agreed to restrict its offering to the last five episodes only, as it has been for years. For all the talk of rising competition and Netflix losing power, in the end the king was still king: the threat of losing Netflix's high fees is still enough to allow Netflix to essentially dictate the structure, if not the price, of the new contract. That is good news even if it applies solely to this one deal. If it is a sign of things to come, it is outstanding news for Netflix. Netflix continues to be the leader in the streaming video space. Comcast and Disney's Hulu has apparently not yet managed to restore bargaining leverage to its corporate owners in content negotiations. While the deal will probably not materially alter earnings results much in the short term for anyone - roughly the same amount of money is flowing from Netflix to CBS and TimeWarner as last year - I stand by what I said two weeks ago. The deal is a solidly bullish indicator for Netflix. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
