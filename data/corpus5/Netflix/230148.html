Why I'm Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha When accounting for off-balance sheet items, Netflix has 340 days of inventory outstanding, a massive number. Days inventory outstanding has grown by 27.7% in the past 3.5 years, leaving questions as to whether enough cost has been ascribed to revenues. When accounting for off-balance sheet items, days payables outstanding sit at 283.2, also an extremely large number, and have grown by 13.4% since Q1 2013. Cash from operations has turned extraordinarily negative while net income has stayed positive. This has been recently driven by incrementally larger new content costs versus old amortizing content. Netflix trades at a blistering 130x EV/EBITDA multiple. Given the above red flags and lower EBITDA growth I have a $35 price target implying 69% downside from current levels. It has never sat well with me that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has off-balance sheet liabilities representing a whopping 58% of its total on-balance sheet assets, nor that its total streaming content obligations on- and off-balance sheet are a massive $10.4 billion pool of obligations that represents 105% of assets on-balance sheet. This massive pool of streaming content creates uncertainty, in that there is potentially room to manipulate income statement accounts in order to boost margins. For example, inventory accounts are increased by purchases of inventory, and decreased by the use of that inventory when the product is sold - this is called cost of goods sold or COGS. A company facing increasing costs with a massive amount of inventory could get away with expensing less cost through COGS than they should for every dollar of revenue earned. This increases margins, but in an unsustainable way as it leaves behind a bloated inventory account. One way investors can detect if accounting shenanigans such as this occur is by analyzing working capital versus income statement accounts to see how they perform over time. Metrics such as days inventory outstanding, days payables outstanding, and the cash conversion cycle are particularly important here. Netflix categorizes its inventory as "current content library, net", and has an account in addition to its payables account called "current content liabilities" (that is also effectively a payables account). In its 10-Q for the period ended 9/30/15 , it discloses $2.695 BN in its current content library, and $2.623 BN in current content liabilities. Under note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies" it discloses a total of $4.535 BN in aggregate short-term streaming commitments, or $4.535-$2.623 = $1.912 BN in additional off-balance sheet liabilities. To correctly analyze the working capital accounts, we must capitalize the off-balance sheet liabilities, creating a liability (accounts payable) and an asset (inventory account). Adding the $1.912 BN to the current content library, we get $4.607 BN in total current content (AKA inventory). Inventory turnover is T12 COGS / average inventory. Per Netflix filings, T12 COGS is $4.356 BN / avg adj inventory $4.057 BN = 1.073. (The 4.057 is an average, (4.607+3.506)/2). Days inventory outstanding is 365 / inventory turnover, so 365/1.073 = 339.9 days of inventory outstanding, an incredibly high number by any standard. Red flag number one. Another important test is to see how days of inventory outstanding performs over time. An increasing number may indicate management is not costing enough inventory. Management teams facing increasing costs may do this to reduce COGS, thereby increasing margins beyond what is actually feasible. The result is an unsustainable and bloated inventory as cost that should have been accounted for in the income statement gets left behind in inventory. SOURCE: Netflix 10-Q and 10-K Filings Since Q2 2012, Netflix's days of inventory outstanding has risen from 266.2 to 339.9, a worrisome 27.7% and a RED FLAG #2. Days Payables Outstanding - Red Flags #3 & 4 Days payables outstanding is another metric that should shine light on how Netflix is managing its balance sheet. Accounts payable turnover is (purchases+T12 COGS)/average accounts payable. We must first capitalize the current off-balance sheet liabilities of $1.912 BN, and add them to Netflix's current content liabilities account of $2.623 BN (which is just a payables account in disguise). We must also add the other traditional payable account of $0.209 BN they have as well. So Q3 2015 accounts payable of $1.912+$2.623+$0.209=$4.744 BN. We also need Q3 2014 A/P to get an average ($2.075+$1.499+$0.15=$3.724 BN). Using the adjusted inventory calculated earlier and COGS from Netflix's financial statements, we get ($4.607-$3.506+$4.356)/(($4.744+$3.724)/2)=1.289 accounts payable turnover, and 365/1.289 = 283.2 days payables outstanding, another exceedingly high number, and our RED FLAG #3. Another metric to examine is how days payables outstanding performs over time, as an increasing number may indicate management looking to preserve fee cash flow by not paying their bills on time. SOURCE: Netflix 10-Q and 10-K Filings Since Q1 2013, days payables outstanding has increased from 249.7 to 283.2, or by 13.4%. In the case of Netflix, they may be forced to extend the time they pay their bills given the pressure they're experiencing from an operating cash flow perspective. The amount of cash they are spending on content has turned free cash flow dramatically negative, and extending the time by which they pay for their content helps to mitigate this free cash flow deficit. Another good metric to follow is the cash conversion cycle, or how quickly a company can turn inventory back into cash. It is calculated by adding days inventory outstanding + days sales outstanding - days payables outstanding. Netflix customers pay by credit card, so days sales outstanding is likely minimal. They have an "other current assets" account with $0.265 BN in it, $0.02 BN of which was deferred tax assets, the balance may be receivables, but the company states in its 10-Q for the period ended 9/30/15 that "our receivables from members generally settle quickly…" so I will conservatively assume 0 days sales outstanding. Currently the cash conversion cycle stands at 339.9-283.2=56.7 days. SOURCE: Netflix 10-Q and 10-K Filings Netflix is losing balance sheet efficiency as the cash conversion cycle increases to a high of 56.7 in the latest quarter. According to Netflix's 10-Q and 10-K Filings , the cause of this large gap down in cash from operations is the large differential between the additions to streaming content and the amortization of streaming content. In the period ended 9/30/15, NFLX added $1.308 BN in content, and amortized only $0.871 BN. This indicates to me that old streaming content contracts are coming off and new content is likely getting more expensive. They are likely also increasing the total amount of content available, which goes well with the idea that they're expanding their reach globally, but they are doing so at a rate that VASTLY outpaces the cash coming into the business, hence the negative cash from operations, and likely the reason they announced a price increase for all members. Netflix currently trades at a blistering 130x EV/EBITDA multiple. This is one of the highest multiples of any stock I have seen in recent years. A 130x multiple can be thought of as an expectation that EBITDA will grow at 130% for the foreseeable future, in order to get to an EV/EBITDA to Growth ratio of 1. Below is a historical chart of EBITDA growth, with the highlighted white line the implied EBIDTA growth expectation from the multiple. Just by eyeballing this chart, the median EBITDA growth rate is roughly 40% (the green line). Netflix's multiple is approximately 3.25x too expensive. Given the massive pool of streaming asset obligations worth 105% of the balance sheet, the concerning levels and growth of days inventory and days payables outstanding, the large disconnect between cash from operations and net income, and the nosebleed EV/EBITDA multiple, I believe Netflix's stock is grossly overvalued. I have a price target of $35, based on a 40x EV/EBITDA multiple (a 1x EV/EBITDA to Growth ratio), implying 69% downside from current prices. This happens to coincide with Netflix's December 2014 valuation, a time when investors were much more sane about the valuation of the company.
