MS: U.S. media going global to deal with online 'three-headed monster' - Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

ETF Hub Sep 28 2015, 20:24 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor U.S. media firms have good reasons to expand internationally, but it might not be enough to address the challenges of "the three-headed monster " of YouTube, Netflix and Facebook, Morgan Stanley says. In a media update, Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne says those three could pose problems for media firms in Europe and Asia just as they have in America. "While Netflix's global scale gives it a competitive advantage over incumbents in acquiring content, the relative pricing advantage of Netflix vs. incumbent pay TV is much lower (overseas)," Swinburne writes. Still, despite the continued scaling of online platforms, "the advertising outlook for international pay networks is stronger than in the U.S." Among the firms that are making moves overseas -- including Discovery Communications ( DISCA -0.2%), which is moving most aggressively -- Swinburne's top media picks are Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOX -2.2%, FOXA -2.1%) and AMC Networks ( AMCX -4.8%).
