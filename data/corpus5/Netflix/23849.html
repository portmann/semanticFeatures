(GOOG) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor After stating last fall it's considering an ad-free YouTube subscription service, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) has confirmed its plans to offer one through an e-mail sent to content providers. No ETA has been given; Bloomberg reports the service might launch later this year. Content providers will collectively get a 55% share of monthly subscription revenue, with a specific provider's cut based on its viewing/watchtime share for "all or a subset" of the service's content. Content providers have historically received a 55% cut on ad revenue produced by their material. With over 1B monthly active users, getting just 5% of YouTube's base to pay $8/month (on par with Netflix's grandfathered pricing) to go ad-free could yield over $4.8B/year in gross revenue (over $2.2B/year net). That would top the $4B in gross revenue YouTube reportedly brought in last year. The planned ad-free service is separate from YouTube Music Key , which provides both YouTube music videos and audio-only music streams ad-free. Key remains in trial mode and is expected to cost $10/month following a promo period. Update: Sources tell The Verge the service is expected to launch "within the next few months," and will support offline viewing/storage. Unless and until YouTube paid service matches or exceeds Netflix content offering at the same or lower price - this whole discussion is worthless. It's not really competing with Netflix (professional long-form content) any more than YouTube's current content (mixture of amateur and professional, mostly short-form) does. GOOG/YouTube doesn't need to "beat" Netflix. They just need to convince users it's worth paying a bit to stop seeing ads for the content they're currently watching. If they can thrown in some new professional material, that's icing on the cake. I am not sure I agree.  Netflix content is very different from YouTube's.  Netflix content can be purchased and accessed in many ways and places.  YouTube content is not that easily accessible elsewhere.  It was only a matter of time before Google starts to monetize the service.  Revenue sharing with producers similar to SA could enhance and broaden the content in many different directions.  I think YouTube is the HOW-TO visual instruction manual to the world in many different languages.   I use it for all sorts of subjects from CEO interviews, company profiles, product reviews, music concerts and artist performances.  I have used it have instructional video to do just about anything I can think of.  Educational and college level lectures on everything under the sun past and present news clips.  Historical events maintains forever. Netflix is an online blockbuster for people that do not want to pay for cable.  I have a subscription to Netflix.  I hardly use it at all.  It is good for benign watching TV series and older movies when you want to take a mental vacation from the issues of the day, but after viewing them once I have little desire to view them again.  Netflix does not even have the completed newer seasons of many of the popular TV series still airing on cable and network TV. IMHO, GOOG/YouTube will only pry $10-15/month ONLY from cold, dead hands of people who are now willing to watch TouTube with ads. These are the people who belong to two categories: (1) Cheapskates. (2) The ones who simply have no money, and credit cards to charge it to. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
