Netflix: Taking Middle Kingdom - Take Two - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Media reported Netflix is partnering with Wanda Group to enter China. Content production, rather than the pure OTT model, may be Netflix's China strategy. Want Want China reported that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is in talks with Wanda Group to enter China. Wanda Group is one of China's largest conglomerates, owning a large portfolio of commercial properties, entertainment assets, ecommerce platform via partnership with Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and department stores. Perhaps Wanda is best known for its movie theater chains, which include the Wanda brand in China. The company acquired AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ) in the U.S. and Hoyts in Australia to expand its presence overseas. Netflix's choice of partnering Wanda is quite unique and contrary to the earlier reports that the company is in discussion with Wasu Media, which is backed by Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), and BesTV, which is backed by the state-owned Shanghai Media Group (see Netflix: Middle Kingdom Taken ). As I mentioned earlier, Netflix is required to obtain a total of eight licenses to operate OTT products in China. Such a requirement is difficult to achieve without a local partner that has the license already. Based on my knowledge, Wanda does not appear to have all the necessary licenses to operate an OTT platform, so I suspect that Netflix may be entering China to become a content producer rather than an OTT player. This scenario is quite plausible, given that Wanda Group also operates film and TV production, having produced Jackie Chan's Police Story 3 and Beijing Love Story that turned out to be quite popular. Given Netflix's track record in moving towards content production, particular the recently released Beast of No Nations and the upcoming Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2, it makes sense for Netflix to take an alternative approach when dealing with the hyper-competitive Chinese market. Rather than competing head-on against a dozen other OTT service providers, Netflix could become the "arms dealer" for the OTT providers by supplying them with blockbuster content. This is significantly more attractive than competing with OTT platforms backed by Alibaba, especially after its acquisition of Youku (NYSE: YOKU ) (see Alibaba: Ecosystem Stronger Than Ever ). Going into movie production is also consistent with Netflix's existing strategy of partnering with local heavy weights in content creation and distribution. I note that Netflix is already working with Fuji Films in Japan to cater to the local market (see Netflix: Konichiwa Hastings-San ). As part of its strategy for Korea, Netflix will also partner with local players (see Netflix: Going Gangnam Style ) and the entry into India makes Eros (NYSE: EROS ) a very attractive partner for the OTT giant (see Eros: Bullish Thoughts Post Management Meeting ). I remain bullish on Netflix despite the fact that the Wasu-BesTV partnership did not materialize as previously thought. In hindsight, moving into content production in partnership with Wanda may be the better alternative for Netflix's China strategy.
