Netflix: $132 Or $76? Pick Your Scenario - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha We have performed a bull/bear valuation of Netflix. The risk/reward appears balanced: 30% upside in a bull case and 25% downside in a bear case. Even if the short-term news flow is likely to be supportive, Netflix is not a screaming Buy. We will wait for a better entry point. A high-beta name, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has unsurprisingly been one of the main victims of the market selloff. Considering that the stock's valuation multiples have long been an issue for many investors, it's quite difficult to resist the temptation to have a closer look at the valuation of this high-quality name now that the stock has dropped 22% from its recent peak. Hence, we have decided to perform a DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation of Netflix, actually two valuations (a bull and a bear case) to better assess the risk/reward. In our view, a DCF valuation is well suited to Netflix as it enables to capture the long-term potential (revenues and margins) of the company while its current margins are extremely thin. We use a discount rate of 9.9% (with a 1.3 beta) and make the following assumptions: - Organic revenue growth remains above 20% until 2020 as the company's international expansion is successful and Netflix keeps adding subscribers at a fast pace. - Then, revenue growth gradually moderates as the market matures. By 2025, Netflix generates $39bn revenues (vs. $6.9bn expected in 2015, 19% CAGR) and still delivers a healthy 10% revenue growth. - Netflix's operating margin reaches the low twenties by 2019 and the high twenties by 2021. This compares well to operating margins in the low twenties for cable companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ) as we assume that Netflix's online streaming model and international reach (better leverage of content costs) will enable the company to be much more profitable than cable peers. - Stock-based compensation gradually declines as the business matures. We have included stock-based compensation in our DCF even if it is a non-cash item as it reflects future share dilution. We use a discount rate of 9.9% (with a 1.3 beta) and make the following assumptions: - Organic revenue growth is less aggressive than in our bull case as Netflix faces increasing competition in a number of geographies. That said, the company delivers robust revenue growth (above 20%) until 2019. - Then, revenue growth gradually moderates as the market matures. By 2025, Netflix generates $31bn revenues (vs. $6.9bn expected in 2015, 16% CAGR) and still delivers a comfortable 8% revenue growth. - Netflix's operating margin reaches the low twenties by 2021. We assume here that the company's profitability will merely be in-line with cable companies as rising competition takes a toll on Netflix's operating leverage. With 30% upside in a bull case and 25% downside in a bear case, the risk/reward on Netflix appears balanced, suggesting the stock is not yet a screaming Buy. We would wait for a slightly better entry point to become more aggressive on the name, keeping in mind that the short-term operating momentum is likely to be supportive thanks notably to the launch in Japan in September.
