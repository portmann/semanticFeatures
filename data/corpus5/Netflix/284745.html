Will You Chicken Out From Buying Disney (Again)? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Last time Disney stock fell, investors kicked themselves for not taking advantage. The company has issues, such as its drop in ESPN subscribers. In August, shares of Disney (NYSE: DIS ) descended more than 20% from its highs amid concerns over the media industry and broader market I remember so clearly, many investors kicking themselves for not jumping on board back when they had they chance. Will they now? "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" was supposed to be the big catalyst to move the stock higher. Despite the movie's impressive success so far, shares have fallen since its release. While Star Wars may be doing well, there was/is still concern over ESPN's drop in subscribers. And I also question how well the College Football Playoffs did for the network. For starters, the times of the games did not make much sense, with both semifinals being played on New Year's Eve, a Thursday. The first game, Clemson-Oklahoma was played at 4pm, with the second, Michigan State-Alabama being played at 8pm. I worked New Year's Eve, and I personally know a lot of others who had to as well. Assuming that the times of the games didn't have much of an impact on viewership, the fact that Clemson won 37-17 and 'Bama beat State 37-0 in two blowout games, could mean fans didn't stick around until the end to see how it panned out. That could be bad for advertising revenue, although in the grand scheme of things, it could be masked by the Star Wars debut. Although Disney does have some chinks in the armor, it doesn't mean it's a bad company. I like Disney - a lot as a matter of fact. With so many catalysts still on the way (more on that, here ) and with such a clear long-term picture, I see little reason to bail on CEO Bob Iger and company now. While ESPN is seeing pressure on its subscriber count, make no mistake about it: There will always be sports, and there will always be Disney. The company is not standing by idly, twiddling its thumbs and hoping Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) goes away. Iger has consistently referred to Netflix as "more friend than foe" and one of Disney's best customers when it comes to buying content. Disney also has its own ESPN Watch app - a platform that could eventually stand on its own - as well as a subscription streaming service in the U.K., (a format that could also work its way to the U.S. market). Disney also has its hands in Hulu, something I view as a sort of hedge against streaming. All of this matters because it shows that Disney is proactively taking steps to ensure that its media business model won't become extinct. And while ESPN and cable are a big component for Disney's revenues, it has other businesses as well. Its parks were just at full capacity in the U.S. over the holidays, despite continued ticket price hikes, while a new park is due this spring in Shanghai. Its studio division is cranking out films left and right, taking advantage of the blockbuster potential that lies within its Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars franchises. The bears will beat the ESPN drum as loud as they can. The subscriber decline is an issue, but it doesn't spell the end for investors. It's times like these where truly long-term folks should take advantage of the short-term oriented traders. I can't say what Disney will do in the next few days, weeks or even months. Maybe even this year. There are so many different forces that move stocks it's impossible to knowingly predict where they will go. With that being said, I'm looking for high quality companies, with high quality assets that will be around for years to come. Disney fits that bill. That's why it's also one of my Future Blue Chips holdings, as I will patiently wait for the stock to appreciate, buy on dips (such as this one, and the in August/September), and allow it time to eventually become a dividend stalwart within my portfolio. Long-term investors needn't fear the recent pullback. The ESPN subscriber loss is a real thing, and it's a negative catalyst. But it won't sink this ship, which makes Disney a good long-term buy in my view.
