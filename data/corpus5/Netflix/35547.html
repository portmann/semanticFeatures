Why Bears Are Wrong And Why Netflix Isn't A Bubble In The Making - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has outperformed this year, and quite frankly, it's likely to exhibit solid returns when operating on a longer timeframe. Accelerating growth, improving margins and massive market potential have driven the year-to-date performance of the stock. Fears of a tech bubble aren't supported with sound analysis, and Netflix's high valuation is driven by the underlying confidence that investors have in the business model and management. While the business is difficult to value, sell-side analysts and management present fairly cogent arguments for investing into the stock. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is one of many tech companies that are victims of their high valuation. Bears argue that Netflix is unstable because it has to enter into long-term content agreements or because content spend has trended higher, diminishing the likelihood of margin expansion. They go on to mention that the valuation is too high for their liking. Competitors and various balance sheet factors could damage the assumptions built into earnings and free cash flow models, according to the bearish community. While various SA contributors may be justified in their rationale, I'm going to address some of the more recent commentary with fundamental analysis. Here are a couple quotations from SA authors on the topic of Netflix: For those looking to benefit from the irrationality of the market (other than riding the wave and hoping it continues), you can try to figure out when the party could end. This is difficult, to be fair, but eminently achievable, and amply compensated by the potential rewards. Furthermore it is intellectually valuable as an exercise to help avoid investing mistakes on the long side (i.e., not falling victim to manias yourself). - Jeremy Raper SA Contributor This market bubble is compounded in the tech sector. Stocks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Netflix trade with average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of nearly 100x. Even by price-to-sales (P/S), the multiples are strong ranging from 5 to 20. Ironically, of this batch of 4 stocks - Netflix is actually one of the 'cheapest' with a P/E of around 100 and a P/S of approximately 5. - J Mintzmyer SA Contributor The idea that Netflix's stock is overvalued has already been beaten to death but it's still a valid argument. As with many hot growth stocks (like the cybersecurity stocks currently) valuation is less of a concern as the company spends to expand. But for shareholders that means a lot of room to drop if things slow unexpectedly. - Dave Dierking SA Contributor Admittedly, the concern is valuation, valuation and again valuation. However, when studying economics there are many factors that can drive demand, so it's hard to imagine how the authors are making a rational argument. At the very end of the day, the market is usually right when it comes to pricing any good or service, whether that good or service is a bond note, stock note or a mortgage backed security. The stock is trending higher because very few are willing to sell the stock, and there's a lot of demand for the stock. People spend a lot of money on really frivolous things, like a 120-inch TVs, yachts, designer clothing, etc. Realistically, anyone who pays more for a good or service by a value investor's definition is acting irrationally regardless of whatever marginal value they can anticipate from the purchase. The vast majority of Netflix is institutionally owned and commentary from various sell-side analysts remains upbeat for reasons that are fundamentally supported. One can assume that if well-paid professionals are willing to chase after the stock, it's probably because subscriber ramp, pricing power and various other factors can drive significant upside in the stock. Here are the four key-trends we're seeing: the valuation is trending higher regardless of the denominator, solvency metrics are improving, margins are declining, and revenue growth is starting to accelerate. On the other hand, the company is unable to drive that incremental improvement to bottom line results as the company is favoring investment over retained earnings for FY 2015 and parts of FY 2016. Now typically, people imagine an investment year to be capitally intensive. But when you follow technology, much of the investment comes in the form of R&D, SG&A and COGS. The valuation is supported by management's ability to scale its business. Since the global streaming market is a large and untapped market, it's not surprising to see Netflix rely on debt financing, content spend and marketing to drive growth. This seems like an appropriate strategy as significant scale will give Netflix the ability to operate an unprecedented content library at lower average total cost. So while ramp-up is expensive, once the business reaches significant scale, profitability will improve drastically. Here's a series of quotes by Netflix management that negates the arguments made by Netflix bears: And the second thing is a little bit of just the mechanics of how we allocate content cost by geography. So by growing faster internationally and putting that allocation more toward international, it's going to provide some relief to those global originals in the global projects that we do have that are allocated to the U.S. and we intend to continue to invest in that. That's also why we put in the letter that our target remains the same, 40% in 2020. - David Wells (CFO of Netflix) But there are variations. And what's great about the viewing is if you look two years ago in this call, we said it was 4 billion hours in the Q1 and over those two years, we have gone from 4 billion to 10 billion hours of viewing. And so you can see along with our membership growth, we are also having engagement growth, which given all the new competitors, improving television, is really impressive that Netflix is growing not only the subs but engagement also. - Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix) So we see engagement, we see value for the content. So it makes me more comfortable and confident that we are investing in something that has lasting value. Two is that we really are scaling along with the business. So we have grown from $9.5 billion in streaming content commitments in the table to $9.8 billion. That's about a 31% year-over-year growth rate and our streaming revenue has grown at 31% year-over-year as well. So that makes me a little bit more comfortable. - David Wells (CFO of Netflix) Overall, fears over margin and solvency were addressed in those comments. Furthermore engagement trends indicate that Netflix does in fact have room to increase pricing even without a tiered approach because consumers are finding marginal value in the content selection, even as content auctions are becoming more competitive. Netflix isn't as exposed to the middle-man argument because the other half of its content spend will come from its own in-house productions, which generates a great return on investment from the context of spend per billion hours of viewing. It also acts a downside hedge. For example, if in the event content licensors were to charge aggressively, Netflix could reallocate its content budget to original series and movies. Also, when looking at COGS, its increasing at a slightly slower rate than domestic revenue, which indicates that there's a mechanism for improving profitability. Therefore, improving profit margins is not some pie in the sky scenario. There could be inherent risk to investing into Netflix, which is mostly driven by sentiment. We have seen episodes where Netflix's stock would plummet overnight due to changes in its business practice causing panic and fear. However, after a couple quarters management largely mitigated the concerns as various steps to remain competitive despite higher content costs have kept the bears in hibernation for much of 2013 through 2015. I remain bullish on tech in general, and I don't think the current market environment is anywhere near reminiscent of the .com boom and bust era. In many cases, the dotcoms had really questionable business models that were supported by advertising rates that weren't sustainable. The relative ease in which IPOs could fetch really quick returns that were extremely generous drove speculation and stratospheric valuations. Somehow investors thought those valuations would be supported by growth in ad-rates and click-through-rates. Obviously, the opposite happened as consumers avoided ads and bought various spam prevention technologies, reducing the effectiveness of ads. Pretty soon, the math of dotcoms changed, and correspondingly the market started dumping the dotcom stocks. Following Yahoo's downward revision of outlook, the bubble finally popped in 2000. Clearly, the ad-model of dot coms only worked when ads were sold to other dot coms, but nowadays digital marketing is quickly replacing TV advertising due to its reach, potential to convert consumers online, and various marketplace ecosystems that diminish the likelihood of ad-mispricing. Various factors may damage tech stocks but are isolated to specific situations, like litigation, competition and obsolescence rather than sector "overvaluation." Netflix isn't an old tech company, so it hasn't been given enough time to build the size of its balance sheet or improve profitability. However, over the long haul, I anticipate that the company will possess the characteristics of a well-balanced growth investment that trades at a more reasonable valuation while returning capital in the form of share buybacks and dividends. I'm not alone in this positive sentiment, and I think that it's weird for there to be such a divergence of opinion on Netflix. In a recent report by Morgan Stanley, Adam Parker (Chief Equity Strategist in the United States) states that tech companies in general possess great fundamentals: As new business models have emerged and succeeded in the sector, tech companies no longer resemble the makeshift operations that quickly burned through their cash more than a decade ago. In 1999, fewer than half of the technology companies were profitable. Currently, while there are always going to be some headline examples to the contrary, approximately 90% of technology companies have positive operating margins and the tech sector has the highest free-cash-flow yield of any market sector. In addition, more than one-third of the $1.7 trillion in cash on the balance sheets of US companies today belongs to technology firms. Over the long-term, Netflix's business model will address many of the concerns that bears have been making, which is why I'm optimistic. Here's what I published earlier in the year: So I estimate that by 2019, Netflix will have 140 million international subscribers and 57.45 million domestic subscribers (totaling 197.54 million subscribers). Assuming Netflix can switch more users over to its 4K streaming package and moves the average pricing to $15/per month, $180/year (basically, a 10-20% CAGR in pricing domestically) and the company may generate $10.341 billion domestically in revenue. The international segment will likely keep pricing in the upper single digits, perhaps $9/per month, so the international segment will probably generate $15.12 billion. When combined, Netflix's revenue may reach $25.46 billion over the next five years. Following that line of logic, the stock could easily trade at 3 to 5 times sales, which would push the stock to a market cap range of $76 billion to $128 billion. Now historically, can I support this type of valuation? Yes, yes and yes. Look at the historical P/S chart of Netflix in comparison to my projected sales multiple range. Also, my outward estimates are aggressive in comparison to other analysts, but for good reasons. Sales will accelerate due to the international roll-out of streaming and the gradual increase in subscription rates. Subscription rates will increase as users migrate to the higher tier package, which will come as a result of households adopting UHD TV sets. Now obviously, NFLX's valuation fluctuates, but with my suspicion of accelerating growth, there's a decent likelihood that investors will chase the stock. The valuation tends to modulate between a 3.5 to 5 times sales in the prior three years, which is in-line with my comments on a 3 to 5 times sales ratio range. Netflix has the ability to exhibit pricing power, subscriber additions and margin expansion. This runs counter to the rationale made by bears, but is supported by both sell-side analysts and management. Therefore, investors betting against Netflix are contrarians. There's a questionable risk-to-reward when betting against the stock. I also want to mention that the stock isn't a part of another .com bubble. The company has a growing base of subscribers and has high retention rates. For a non-ad model to be treated like an unpredictable time bomb ready to set-off at any moment is absurd. I think Netflix will exhibit further upside from current levels as bottom and top line growth is both sustainable and predictable. NFLX is exposed to the overall performance of the broader market but can offset market volatility with continuing improvement to its operations. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on the stock.
