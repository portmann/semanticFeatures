Netflix Is Establishing A Niche, Not Replacing Television - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Despite expectations, Netflix has no plans on being the sole leader of the streaming TV market. Netflix's unbelievable success has led to price increases from producers, which are motivated to prevent Netflix from dominating the market due to less competition. This article will overview Netflix management goals, alongside my own predictions for subscriber growth, to suggest some numbers as to where Netflix will be in 2020. I'm writing this article to correct a common belief about Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) - that is the belief that Netflix is actually on route to eventually replacing television altogether, so that every household in the world will eventually have a screen and a Netflix subscription. Despite analysts' and investors' expectations, Netflix has made it clear that they cannot achieve this goal, and will instead grow Netflix's niche in content programming. In addition, this article will discuss how Netflix's own growth expectations will leave investors very disappointed based on today's current valuation. On Netflix's investor relations website, they have a section called " long-term view ." I highly recommend that any Netflix investor, or potential investor, reads this. Netflix initially discusses the accurate strengths of their business model over live television shows, and goes on to discuss their belief of what the future of television entails. I want to take one quote from this section: "Our licensing is generally time-based, so that we might pay for a multi-year exclusive subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) license for a given title. In each market, we license content from multiple suppliers, mirroring the fragmentation of the content industry. Typically our bids are for exclusive access to the SVOD rights, and we are up against various cable and broadcast networks, as well as online video competitors. As a rule, content owners always want another bidder, and never want one bidder to become too strong." Netflix has done a fantastic job of being candid with shareholders in basically stating that the market will not allow Netflix to get "too strong" because it would give them a relative monopoly over distribution at a great expense to the producers. If there were two primary streaming content carriers, however, this would encourage competition to bid up the price, resulting in the producer getting more revenue. It's very clear that the large numbers of producers out there will benefit from Netflix having competition, and since they play such a key role in Netflix's success by dictating Netflix's costs, they will not allow Netflix to become that powerful. Management has had a great solution to this problem by creating original content, Since then, the market has cheered this news, and has driven up Netflix's price even higher. Although this was an excellent move by management, it was the only appropriate response considering alternative strategies could be disastrous to the company, as a result of the increasing competition that Netflix is facing. Despite this being a great management move, it was ultimately a reaction to the less appealing market that Netflix is moving into. In a nutshell, the previous quote just highlights that Netflix has recently become a victim of its own success. I want to run three different scenarios that Netflix could engage in at this time to respond to the changing environment of higher content fees being demanded. The first scenario would involve them making no changes, and still trying to bid for top content, but only receiving a relatively smaller proportion of higher quality content due to the lower costs. This would result in Netflix being less appealing and would limit growth to the point that it could eventually reverse it. The second scenario would involve them trying to establish themselves as the leading provider for all TV content, making aggressive bids for content, and making deals with the producers to try and get some sort of a volume discount. This would result in bankruptcy occurring in as little as a few months as Netflix simply does not have the capital to pay for this content acquisition. In addition to this, Netflix would further explode in revenue growth, but this would not be able to keep up with the growth in expenses. The third solution is what Netflix is currently doing, which involves maintaining their niche (documentaries, older hit TV shows, older hit movies, newer less popular movies, etc.) while also growing their original content. This is clearly the best business model for them as they can control costs better as well as obtaining scale from their original content investments, which will carry no additional costs to be released in all of their countries that they operate in. Up until the last couple of years, this would have been highly impractical. I cannot say enough how much I really appreciate how Netflix management has handled the changing environment, and I think that they are growing at a rate that is not unreasonable. I believe that they have an excellent management team, and I find their approach to be very rational. I cannot say the same for the investors that bid the company up to $120. Netflix has ran their company better than almost anyone over the last 10 years, and I absolutely love their plans for the future. Furthermore, I LOVE Netflix itself, and have used the service for years. However, if Netflix decided next month that they would raise their subscription fees to $40 per month, I would immediately cancel my subscription - this is the exact same rational why I would never pay $120 for a share of Netflix, despite it being a fantastic company (although if it was selling for $30 a share, it would be one of my largest holdings). By my own standards, the future of Netflix is very bright. By current investor standards, they are terrible. This is because in order for investors to rationalize a market capitalization of $53 billion, they clearly see Netflix as the future unabated champion of television. In order for this number to be reasonable, Netflix should have a 12-16 P/E ratio after their rapid growth stage is over. Due to their explosive growth over the last few years, using a P/E ratio with Netflix at this time is absolutely useless, as is operating cash flow, as a standalone measure. However if we can estimate future costs and revenue, we can get a general idea of what to expect in a few years. First, I wanted to discuss what I think will happen with Netflix's growth over the next few years. Netflix will continue to grow in the United States and Canada, however, these numbers will slow down significantly as the markets start to become saturated. Over the next few years, customers will have no problem paying increasingly higher fees as Netflix improves its content database. Netflix will continue to grow in their "English" markets very well (US, Canada, Australia, UK, Western Europe, etc.) as their years of data mining will be helpful in establishing appropriate content, as well as the possibility of Netflix achieving scale through producers (e.g. a producer giving a price break when being offered in a large number of countries) to minimize costs. I believe that Netflix will eventually be as successful in these countries as they are in the United States and Canada. I think Netflix will continue its expansion into Latin America, but with very limited success. I believe the lack of data mining, decreased scalability, the increased use of piracy, and the much lower average income will all result in Netflix being much less successful than many investor's speculate. It's also important to consider that one of the biggest draws to Netflix in North America is the lack of advertising - your subscription cost replaces your commercials, and for most middle-class Westerners, the opportunity cost of 10 minutes of commercials every 30 minutes is worth the few dollars per month. I question if this will be the same in a family that has one-tenth of the disposable income. Also, one variable that is almost never mentioned is the widespread sharing of Netflix accounts between friends and family. Consider this variable in a Latin-American culture where we have on average larger numbers of people inside of a single home, as well as more interconnectedness between extended family, ultimately resulting in more sharing. Finally, Netflix's investment into Asia I believe will be extremely unsuccessful - this is for many of the same reasons that Latin American growth will be limited, in addition to the significant competition that is already present in Asia. Also consider that China, the heart of the Asian economy (or world economy for that matter), has Internet restrictions that so far have been very challenging for Netflix to get past. Also, the limited relationships with Asian content producers will place somewhat of a strain on their Asian growth and limit their ability to scale. Because Netflix initially launched in other English speaking countries, we have seen very impressive success so far. This has led to many investors speculating that this trend will continue to other countries with much lower incomes, more alternatives, and completely different cultures. I think this is where Netflix investors will be very disappointed. Looking more generally at the future of all TV streaming, I think Netflix management has it right 100 percent. To quote management on their 'long term views' section: "We strive to win more of our members' "moments of truth." Those decision points are, say, at 7:15 pm when a member wants to relax, enjoy a shared experience with friends and family, or is bored. The member could choose Netflix, or a multitude of other options. Because the entertainment market is so broad, multiple firms can be successful. For example, HBO is now growing faster than in years past, while our business is also expanding. Many people will subscribe to both HBO and Netflix since we have different exclusive content. The transition to Internet TV, with its greater consumer satisfaction, will mean growth for many Internet TV services." Netflix management has once again been wonderfully candid with shareholders by describing that they see the future of TV as a compliment between a few major players. They even went on to discuss the success of HBO's growth in tandem with Netflix, and suggested that rather than choose one or the other, people will just choose both. What does this tell us about Netflix's strategy? I think it is fair to say we can rule out "scenario B" ever occurring. Furthermore, we also can rule out that Netflix is planning on growing their fees dramatically with content over the next few years, as I doubt many people would rationalize having three or four TV subscriptions at $40 a month. This just confirms my belief that Netflix is not planning on meeting the same expectations that investors have. Netflix management also has discussed their expectations for margins in the future. Here is one quote from the same "long-term view" section: "Our US contribution margin structure is set mostly top down. For any given future period, we estimate revenue, and decide what we want to spend, and how much margin we want in that period. Competitive pressures in bidding for content would lead us to have slightly less content than we would otherwise, rather than overspending. The same is true for our marketing budget. The output variable is membership growth that those spending choices influence." The US contribution margin structure we have chosen is to grow content spending plus marketing slightly slower than we grow revenue, increasing our contribution margin to 40% by 2020. We think we can grow to 60-90 million members in the US, based upon our trajectory to date and the continued growth of Internet TV." Here we can get some more insight into the brains behind Netflix. They made it clear that they will be taking a more conservative approach to the US market so that their revenue growth outpaces their expense growth, while also acknowledging that increased content costs would decrease their content, everything else being equal. Although this is a great strategy, I question if Netflix's US revenue can grow fast enough to allow them to actually grow their content, despite the increased content costs. Given that content costs are growing fairly rapidly, I find it unrealistic that revenue growth will outpace costs as so much of the US market is already saturated. Increasing subscription costs I think will help, but they have to do this slowly and carefully. However I trust that they have ran thousands of statistical analysis as to the ideal price point for profitability. In a previous article , I discussed how unlikely it would be for Netflix to reach their US goal of "60 to 90 million customers" within the next few years, although it is very reasonable for them to hit 60 million in the next few years, I outlined a number of reasons in a previous article as to why 90 million households within a few years would be almost impossible. This is not to say that eventually they could reach 90 million subscribers. But I believe that this would take well over a decade, and would require a number of uncontrollable variables to work in their favor. I created a table that compiles all of Netflix's estimated subscribers by the end of December, accompanied by rough estimates of subscribers by country by 2020, based on the variables that I discussed earlier in the article. The general assumptions that I made were that English speaking countries, with a similar culture to the United States, will achieve growth rates comparable to the US. I assumed US and Canadian growth slows down considerably as the market reaches saturation. I also assumed that Asian and Latin-American growth will continue, but will slow down much earlier than their English-speaking comparables. I also considered the relative size of the population of each country and the per capita GDP. I also was very liberal with my estimates, and this should not frustrate even the largest Netflix bulls. Note that I predicted very strong growth for the US, Canada, UK and Australia, which I believe will be dominated by Netflix as the primary content provider. For Asia, it was very difficult to come up with an estimate, as we have no data to go on as of right now, I took a relatively wild "guess" at around 10 million due to their lack of serious expansion into the area, and my beliefs that this expansion will be unsuccessful. This number may be modified over the next few months as we get more data on the success of the Asian expansion. Also keep in mind that for my estimates where I provided a range, I always used the highest number to produce an especially liberal estimate for 2020. Also note that I excluded several countries that had a very small number of users. I used an estimated end of 2015 users by DigitalTVResearch.com to get a rough indicator of the current numbers, which correlates very closely to the total Q3 numbers given in their Q3 financial statements . In addition, DigitalTVResearch.com recently published a report estimating that Netflix will have 115 million subscribers by 2020 . I was pleased to see that my estimate came within a few million of the alternative estimate, although we seem to have different ideas as to where these numbers come from. Considering that I have intentionally used extremely liberal numbers, I am OK with overshooting their estimate. So What Does This Mean For Valuation? Since I'm sticking with my theme of extreme optimism for this article, I'm going to make another list of relatively unrealistic assumptions. First, I will assume that Netflix will meet 100% of their management goals of growing revenue faster than costs. Second, I will assume there will be no recessions or market corrections (for the record, I do NOT believe this one bit). Third, I assume that content costs will not continue to grow despite every available indicator suggesting that this trend will continue unabated. Fourth, I will assume that further share dilution will not occur despite the fact that it has happened steadily for several years. Finally, I will assume that Netflix will increase their fees by $2 across the board. I will also assume that this increase in fees will produce no decline in demand, which for anyone who has taken first year economics, we know is not possible. Why did I make all of these unrealistic assumptions? I had to try and come up with numbers to rationalize the current market capitalization. With my liberal estimates, this would suggest that the overall number of users would almost double (70 to 123 million is a growth rate of almost 76%). For simplicity sake, and to emphasize a point, I will round this up so that we assume that overall users will double by 2020 (140 million total users, therefore giving the estimate an additional 17 million bonus, in addition to all the other liberal estimates). This would double the revenue to 13.9 billion annually (Q3 rev X 4 x 2). Then, let's assume costs somehow only grow by 50% over the same period (Q3 operating expense x 4 x 1.5), which would result in around 10 billion in annual costs. This would produce operating earnings of 3.9 billion per year, or $9.12 operating earnings per share. This is a very fair price, with a reasonable P/E ratio (assuming the tax situation has not changed significantly). So I want you to re-read the article from the beginning, as well as my previous article, to suggest all of the problems with the assumptions that I made to come up with these numbers. In addition to this, I used very liberal estimates for growth, and rounded everything up. Perhaps most unrealistically, I assumed that costs would only grow at half the rate of revenue, something that even Netflix management has said would not occur (they specifically said they want revenue to outpace growth, but certainly not by 50%). A much more reasonable number for the growth of expenses would be around 80-90% of revenue. If we plug in the same numbers with a more plausible 85% growth in expenses (assuming 100% growth in revenue), this would result in expenses being around 12.3 billion annually, or 1.6 billion in operating earnings, or $3.74 operating earnings per share. This would suggest that Netflix is still very overvalued, even with all of these false assumptions baked into the calculations. Finally, if we add the assumption of a $2 growth in revenue to the last two calculations, this would grow overall revenue to an impressive 16.7 billion per year. This would result in operating earnings of 6.7 billion ($15.69 per share) for the 50% cost assumption, and 4.4 billion ($10.30 per share) for the 85% cost growth assumption. Keep in mind that if we used the generous estimate that I originally came up with (123 million), annual revenue in 2020 would be around 12.2 billion without a fee increase. If we use the alternative research report of 115 million estimated users, this would produce revenue of 11.4 billion (compared with expenses between 10 to 12.3 billion). This valuation is just some sample predictions that would have to occur to allow today's valuation to be reasonable; I spent much longer trying to come up with a valuation using more realistic assumptions, however I could never come up with anything close to the current valuation. So if every single one of my unrealistic assumptions was met, along with my unrealistic growth projections, Netflix appears to be reasonably valued for five years in the future. Considering the opportunity cost of five years of investments, I'm not willing to wait for a series of unlikely events to occur to hope that five years from now my investment will be fairly priced. When considering the threats of competition, higher content costs, sharing of accounts, piracy, legal issues, and much lower incomes in Netflix's growth markets, the estimates I suggested will in reality be much lower. This suggests there is very limited upside to Netflix, with enormous downside. When I look at the global economic picture right now, compounded with interest rates set to rise in the US, Netflix is a company I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot poll.
