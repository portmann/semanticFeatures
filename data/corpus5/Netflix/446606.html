Netflix still has its eyes on China - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Jun 30 2016, 02:34 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor "Since China is a great opportunity, we continue to look into China," Ted Sarandos, Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) chief content officer, said at a media event in Seoul. The streaming service has countered slowing U.S. growth by launching in more than 130 new markets, but remains absent in the world's most populous country, where content providers face stringent regulations and censorship challenges. It won't happen, China will never allow access to its market without robbing Netflix blind.  There is no incentive for china to open to Netflix.
