Dreamworks Animation Won't Start 2016 Fighting A Hangover - Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc (NASDAQ:DWA) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long DWA, AAPL, YHOO, FB. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Dreamworks Animation cut costs and released just one feature, "Home" in 2015. The studio will release "Kung Fu Panda 3" in January 2016, in time for Chinese New Year. Near the end of 2016, it plans to release "Trolls" - a musical-comedy starring Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. The company has been growing revenues from non-feature segments, including content appearing on Netflix, YouTube, and a newly-launched Verizon video service. Hollywood film and television producer Dreamworks Animation (NASDAQ: DWA ) began 2015 with a rough start. On January 22, 2015, it announced a major restructuring of its film business. Specifically, in an effort to improve profits, it reduced its production target from three feature films a year to two. The company also announced layoffs, shuttering of one of its California production locations, and completed a sale/leaseback of its iconic Glendale, California headquarters. The company took these measures after writing down four of its features released in about a two-year period from November 2012 to November 2014. Including write-downs, the company reported a net loss for fiscal 2014 of $3.65 per diluted share. That compared to net income of $0.65 per share for fiscal 2013, and a net loss of $0.43 for fiscal 2012. The company released just one movie in 2015, the successful Home, which grossed about $386 million worldwide and $177 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo. Despite Home's success, the company, including charges, has reported a loss of $1.13 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2015, including negative $0.04 in the most recent quarter ending September 30, 2015. Adjusted reported net loss for the first nine months of 2015 was $0.23 per share. Adjusted net income for the most recent quarter was $0.02 per share. Despite the bad start to 2015, as of December 17, 2015, DWA stock has increased about 14% since the start of the year. I think this is because investors are beginning to realize that this company is successfully executing its strategy to diversify beyond the feature film business, as its other segments' revenues and contributions to gross profits are growing. As 2016 approaches, DWA will start the new year with a sequel to its globally popular Kung Fu Panda franchise. In November it plans to release a musical-comedy, Trolls, featuring the voices of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. As the company works to continue its successful growth in its non-theatrical segments, I believe these two films will act as catalysts for the stock at the beginning and end of the year. Obviously whether they are positive or negative catalysts depend on expectations at the time the films are released, and whether results exceed expectations. However, based on current analyst expectations for DWA's 2016 earnings, I believe these films will achieve better results than currently expected by the market. For these reasons, which I explain in greater depth below, Dreamworks Animation is my favorite pick for stock of 2016. As the company still relies heavily on its feature film business, through theatrical releases, digital releases, and pay television releases (see table based on the most recent 10-Q below, with numbers rounded), I will first look at the prospects of its two feature films set for release in 2016. Then I will discuss the significance of Dreamworks growing non-theatrical content provided to companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). Kung Fu Panda 3 is set for release on January 29, 2016, just before Chinese New Year, on February 8, 2016. The first Kung Fu Panda movie grossed about $632 million in theaters worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo , of which about $215 million was domestic. Kung Fu Panda 2 reportedly grossed $666 million in theaters worldwide, of which $165 million was domestic. There are many reasons to get excited about Kung Fu Panda 3 from an investing standpoint. First, it is the first co-production between Dreamworks and Oriental Dreamworks, a joint-venture between Dreamworks and its Chinese media partners. As Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook has often pointed out , China is projected to have the fastest growing middle class in the history of the world. Second, unlike other animated movies in which the characters are drawn speaking English and dubbed into other languages, this movie will be released with English-speaking animation and Mandarin-synced animation . Third, as noted above, as Kung Fu Panda progressed, worldwide receipts increased. The international portion of the worldwide receipts grew from about two-thirds to seventy-five percent. As investors tend to focus on domestic results, especially in movies, investors who listen to box office reports in the media may be overlooking this upcoming film's international prospects. According to Deadline , Journey To The West: Conquering The Demons, which was released in the 2013 New Year/Spring Festival season went on to be the top grossing film of the year in China at about $200 million. Deadline also reported in 2014, the 3rd and eighth highest grossing movies were released during that season. In 2015, Box Office Mojo reported that the Man from Macau II, released on Chinese New Year, was the eighth-highest box office grossing movie in China at a $154 million. In contrast, Kung Fu Panda 2 grossed $92 million in China, according to Box Office Mojo . This was up significantly from the first installment, reportedly grossing $26 million in China. The increasing popularity of the franchise, along with the New Year release date, and Chinese co-producer improving the experience for Chinese viewers are reasons to be optimistic about this movie's prospects in China. As mentioned above, KFP's domestic gross declined for the second installment from $215 million to $165 million, despite international growth. Following the movie's release, during a conference call , DWA CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg attributed the decline to the unexpected box office winning opening weekend of the R-Rated The Hangover Part II. At a reported opening long-weekend gross of almost $103 million, The Hangover trounced the Panda sequel which grossed about $61 million when they both opened on Memorial Day Weekend in 2011. Perhaps investors may not be considering how the last movie in the franchise was up against the Hangover sequel. This time around, according to the IMDB , there are currently no blockbuster Hangover-esque sequels being released on the weekend KFP 3 is released. I suspect that the Marlon Wayans parody Fifty Shades Of Black scheduled to be released at the same time as KFP 3 will not be competing for family audience dollars. All three KFP movies were written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, and star the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie, so I don't expect the quality to decline in the third installment, boding well given the lack of family or sequel blockbuster opening weekend competition. Investors may want to look at the other competition being released that weekend and come to their own conclusions. DWA's second release will be the musical Trolls. DWA owns the rights to the Danish-created dolls with crazy hair that were once popular as pencil-toppers years ago. The movie features the voices of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake, which I believe is a dream team of comedic musical voice talent. Kendrick's musical-comedy Pitch Perfect 2 was one of the top 13 movies of the past 365 days , grossing about $184 million domestically. Justin Timberlake has proven himself to be a comedic-musical genius through his popular songs with the Lonely Island featured on Saturday Night Live that went viral on YouTube. The movie features the same writing team as the Kung Fu Panda movies, so their historical work combined with Kendrick's and Timberlake's strong aptitude to musical comedy could lead to a big new franchise for Dreamworks. As consumer products produced 10% of DWA's revenue in its most recent quarter, success of a film based on historically previously popular dolls could be promising for that segment. While DWA has written off some of its recent movies, that is in the past. The company will start the year releasing a popular sequel catering to the Chinese market, while avoiding prior headaches created by the Hangover sequel. It will end the year releasing a movie starring two of the best musical-comedy talents. These movies will certainly be catalysts for the stock, depending on their success versus expectations. With 97% of users wanting to see Kung Fu Panda 3 according to Rotten Tomatoes, I suspect Wall Street's expectations may improve as investors forget about some of DWA's pre-2015 results. Forbes reported several days ago that Netflix was the top-performing non-biotech stock in America in 2015, increasing 147%. In order for Netflix to keep selling and maintaining subscriptions around the world, it needs content. Dreamworks Animation provides its feature films to Netflix, and also provides animated TV series to Netflix. According to DWA's most recent 10-K , in 2013, it entered into an agreement with Netflix to provide over 1,000 episodes of content based on DWA's intellectual properties. According to DWA's most recent 10-Q, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, 28% of DWA's revenue came from Netflix. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, 33% of DWA's revenues came from Netflix. The previous statistics provide an example of how the Street could have difficulty valuing this company. The percentage of revenue for any quarter will depend on whether the company releases a feature film in theaters or on DVD and digital download. We see that the percentage of revenue from Netflix seems to have declined in the most recent quarter, relative to the nine-month period. However, if we do the math, we see for the three-month period, company revenues were $259 million for the company, and $596 million for the nine-month period. That means Netflix contributed about $24 million per month on average for the most recent quarter, versus $22 million on average for the past nine months. Perhaps some of the most recent quarterly average increase can be due to the reported July 2015 Netflix release of DWA's 2014 feature The Penguins of Madagascar. So DWA has an ongoing stream of revenue from Netflix. Will this stream increase in the future? In DWA's recent Q3 conference call , when discussing Netflix, Katzenberg stated: "...we see a greater opportunity first and foremost with our partners at Netflix. We continue to have conversations with them about new opportunities, and we do think that television is going to continue to be a meaningful expansion place for us and our business in the coming months and years - meaningful." Netflix isn't the only company buying programming from Dreamworks. As indicated in the table above, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, DWA had about $51 million in revenues from selling television content. Dreamworks Also Active In New Media On YouTube Dreamworks also produces content for its majority-owned AwesomenessTV YouTube channel. As indicated in the table above, new media revenues, which include AwesomenessTV, were about $21 million on the quarter. So while investors in cable companies may fear cord-cutting due to YouTube and Netflix, Dreamworks Animation is earning revenues from content consumed by cord-cutters. By doing so, Dreamworks has shown an ability to adapt to ever-changing trends in media consumption. In March, Verizon announced it would launch two channels featuring over 200 hours of DWA content. In October, Verizon launched Go90 , a mobile video service designed for smartphones, featuring content from the AwesomenessTV and Dreamworks brands. One of the most telling comments about the future of content makers came from Verizon earlier this month. When discussing a potential acquisition of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), Verizon EVP Marni Walden was quoted by Re/code as saying: "What I would tell you is we didn't get into the media company business just to be a single-digit market share player. That's not why we did the deal with AOL. We have much bigger aspirations of how we want to grow that business." A leading telecom company has ended the year telling us that it has big media aspirations. Part of those include Dreamworks Animation content. I believe that as consumers realize that much of what they currently do on their smartphones can be done via Wi-Fi thanks to Apple FaceTime, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Skype, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) messenger, and other similar apps, that companies that transmit communications will want exclusive content to differentiate their brands from their competition. We have seen media stocks punished recently due to cord-cutting concerns. Dreamworks agreement with Verizon is another example of how companies that produce popular content can grow through new media. As of December 18, 2015, DWA has a market capitalization of about $2.2 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Last year, Dreamworks Animation was the subject of media-reported takeover discussions that never materialized with Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) majority-owner Softbank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ). Jeffrey Katzenberg controls Dreamworks Animation, so it cannot be taken over without his approval. As mentioned throughout this piece, investors may find this company difficult to evaluate due to the company's history of relying upon the success of two or three theatrical releases in a year. As the company reduces these risks by diversification, we can look at the company's valuation the last year it released two successful movies as a potential predictor of how it may fare in 2016. In 2011, as mentioned, DWA released the globally successful, but domestically disappointing Kung Fu Panda 2 on Memorial Day weekend. The company's only other feature that year was the Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots, released at the end of October. That film grossed about $555 million worldwide, and $149 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo . On a worldwide basis, KFP 2 was reportedly the sixth highest grossing film worldwide, and Puss in Boots ranked eleventh for that year. DWA earned $1.02 a diluted share in 2011. According to Yahoo Finance , analysts, on average, estimate DWA will earn $0.70 in 2016. So if DWA can match its 2011 results, it will beat analyst expectations by about 45%. Its film line-up, cost-cutting, and diversification suggest to me the company has the potential to beat analyst consensus. Unlike 2011, Po of Kung Fu Panda won't have to bow to The Hangover, and DWA has taken serious steps to build on the Chinese growth of that franchise. Looking at 2011's second release, while Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek are talented stars, Anna Kendrick is coming off the musical-comedic success of Pitch Perfect 2, and the Lonely Island comedic music videos featuring Justin Timberlake have exceeded 70 million YouTube views on more than one occasion. According to DWA's 10-K for fiscal year 2011, 95% of DWA's profit that year came from feature and television productions. At that time, television was included in a segment called "Film Library/Other," so one can speculate television was not a meaningful contributor in 2011. In the most recent quarter, television accounted for about 20% of revenues, whereas feature films accounted for about 61% of revenues. Feature films also accounted for about 55% of gross profits in the most recent quarter. As calculated from the most recent 10-Q and table above, in the most recent quarter, the company has accomplished the following: Quarterly revenue from TV Series and Specials increased by about 3.5 times year-over-year. Quarterly revenue from Consumer Products increased about 2.2 times year-over-year. Quarterly revenue from New Media increased 2.4 times year-over-year, and the company reported that adjusted New Media revenue increased over 3 times. Gross profit from the above 3 segments was about $42 million for the most recent quarter. If the above three segments didn't grow, but remained consistent for four quarters that would equal over $160 million in annualized gross profit. In 2011, total gross profit for the company was $225 million. So while the company earned $1.02 in 2011, it has since cut costs and grown in non-feature segments that on an annualized basis could equal in excess of $160 million in gross profits. If one wants to be more pessimistic, one can look at another two-DWA-film release year, 2013. That year saw a release of the successful movie, The Croods, and a movie resulting in a write-down, Turbo. The former reportedly grossed $587 worldwide, while the latter only grossed about $283 million worldwide. As mentioned above, DWA earned $0.65 a share in 2013. So a 2016 analyst earnings estimate of $0.70 a share seems to expect another flop. Dreamworks Animation has cut costs and grown non-feature segments in an effort to diversify its earnings. Based on Dreamworks' historical earnings, analysts seem to expect its two releases this year to not perform well. Analysts also don't seem to be giving much credit to DWA's non-feature growing segments, which have the potential to offset any feature disappointments. That said, recent DWA write-downs serve as a reminder to readers of the risky nature of the entertainment industry. Companies that deliver content, including traditional TV providers, Netflix, other internet and mobile video providers appear ready to differentiate themselves by obtaining exclusive content. Dreamworks has navigated the evolving media-consumption environment to provide content to such companies. Readers looking for a stock for 2016 may want to look closer at Dreamworks Animation's strategy, along with the potential of its January and November film releases, which if successful may be catalysts to draw closer attention on this company's strategy and stock in the year ahead.
