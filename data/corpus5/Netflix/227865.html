With programming buildup, Hulu's losses increase - Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) | Seeking Alpha Nov  6 2015, 18:22 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Over-the-top video service Hulu has undergone a transformative year, adding ad-limited and ad-free subscription tiers, putting heavy investment into new content and exclusives, and focusing on building rather than selling, as it builds up to take on heavyweight Netflix and Amazon.com's video service. Its corporate parents -- NBCUniversal (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Fox ( FOX , FOXA ) -- are happy with that approach for now, which is good, as Hulu loses more money in the buildup. In Disney's earnings call , COO Tom Staggs acknowledged Hulu would keep stepping up programming investment, "and that will continue to increase their losses in the near term." In recent interviews, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins has made clear the service isn't currently pursuing international expansion -- a sharp contrast with Netflix -- and that after the corporate parents eschewed a 2013 sale, an IPO or sale isn't in the near future until it builds up more.
