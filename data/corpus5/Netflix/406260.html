Tim Cook, We (Still) Need More Share Buybacks - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Some investors have missed the real numbers behind Apple's shareholder return program. Nominal returns to shareholders are falling, not rising. This is despite growing cash flows. Apple won't pull the trigger on a big acquisition. It also has plenty of assets set aside. Shareholder returns need to increase. Buybacks, as a tax-deferred investment, reward long-term shareholders better than dividends. The current repurchase authorization is simply too low, and I fear Apple's seasonality in share repurchases will have them miss buying the dip. In November of 2015 on Seeking Alpha , I encouraged Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to buy back more shares of company stock. The premise was simple: share buybacks were falling nominally year/year, few viable alternatives for free cash flow seemed to be available, and there was comparatively very little money left on the current authorization - just $36B. The solution was clear. Apple needed to ramp up share repurchases, and to do so, Apple needed to increase its repurchase authorization. With the fiscal Q2 2016 earnings release , Apple announced the buyback authorization was increasing to $175B. Was this enough to address my concerns? Unfortunately, no, and the situation has not changed. It seems that far too many investors have assumed that the $175B buyback authorization means Apple ( AAPL ) intends to spend $175B of cash between now and March 2018 on repurchases. This thought process has unfortunately been propagated on Seeking Alpha by both contributors and commenters alike. Unfortunately, these investors have glossed over some key wording in the earnings release. My emphasis added below from the most recent press release : Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $250 billion of cash by the end of March 2018â€¦As part of the updated program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $175 billion from the $140 billion level announced last year. Cumulative total. Updated program. So what is the deal? Rather than ending the repurchase program when it is completed and all authorized money is spent, and then starting a new share repurchase authorization when the time is right, management instead extends the old agreement, increasing the allowable authorization over and over. Why? It simply lets management tout big numbers in press releases. It's a strategy I don't blame management for engaging in. Shareholders, especially retail investors, have short memories on how companies have rewarded them in the past. This is a gentle psychological way to remind them how much money they've committed in shareholder returns in total, but it can be misleading to uninformed investors. So what was the true increase in the buyback? From the company's most recent 10-Q filing, investors will find that Apple had spent $117B of the $140B (now $175B) authorization: In 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $140 billion of the Company's common stock, of which $117 billion had been utilized as of March 26, 2016. The Company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). So, prior to the expansion, Apple had just $23B remaining on its existing authorization; the rest had been spent. This means that by expanding the buyback by $35B ($140B to $175B), Apple has now authorized just $58B of repurchases in total through March 2018, or a little over 10% of the float. Without another increase next year, the company can average just $29B/year in share repurchases through the program's expiration. Therein lies the dig. As I noted in my prior piece on share buybacks, Apple spent $45B buying back shares in fiscal 2014 and $36B in fiscal 2015. $29B annually would mean another year/year fall in share buybacks, despite rising net income at the massive consumer electronics giant. Money isn't a problem here. Apple's free cash flow increased to $70B in fiscal 2015 from $50B in fiscal 2014. Despite the rapid rise in free cash flow, shareholder returns (buybacks and dividends in total) actually fell nominally year/year. That is a disappointment, especially since that money was not spent elsewhere, either on acquisitions or on a meaningful increase in capital expenditures to develop new product lines or improve new ones. Instead, it is just sitting in the bank, earning next to no return. The money simply needs to be put to work in some way or another, and this is an area Tim Cook and company has continued to fail to satisfy my expectations on. Otherwise, I'm perfectly content with the day-to-day business operations of Apple. Despite all the anti-Apple hubbub in recent months, 2016 free cash flow has been relatively flat (assuming the massive change in working capital adjusts to the norm by year-end, which was fed by a large paydown in accounts payable). Apple as a business still generates, and will continue to generate, dump trucks worth of money. For large activist investors that act on behalf of shareholders seeking to pressure management to return unused cash to shareholders, returns to shareholders have been disappointing. I wouldn't be a surprised if this was one reason we saw Carl Icahn head for the door. Readers might quickly retort with "Apple could just increase the authorization before its expiration again" - and they could. However, quarterly trends in buybacks are, once again, falling year/year. Apple has repurchased just $10B in shares through the open market during the first half of 2016, compared to $12B in 2015. ASRs (accelerated share repurchases, aka buybacks done in conjunction with investment banks) are also falling, which has been a trend for Apple as it moves towards conducting most of its buybacks on the open market rather than executing deals with Wall Street. Timing also seems to be an issue. For some reason unbeknownst to me, Apple tends to buy back most of its shares in fiscal Q4, at a time when overall investor sentiment tends to be higher due to new product releases, usually yielding higher share prices. You can see this trend in Q4 of 2015 above, when Apple bought back nearly half the shares that it would purchase that year in the last quarter of the year. 2014 wasn't much different, with fiscal Q4 also seeing the highest repurchase interest by Apple. It looks like we will, once again, see that trend repeated in fiscal 2016 given current low buyback interest, during a year where we should see a lot of hype heading into Apple's iPhone 7 release. Is such concentrated spending in one quarter prudent? Spreading buybacks evenly throughout the year seems more logical to me, and would likely help temper some of the volatility the company's share price often endures. Buybacks - Simply The Best Use Of Cash As an investor, I want Apple to invest its free cash flow where it gets the most return. When you think about cash, a company has only a handful of potential uses: Accretive acquisitions would be wonderful, but Apple has traditionally purchased small, picking up cutting edge technology and motivated personnel from small companies, and then developed the products further in-house. As Apple acts primarily as a facilitator of content, not a content provider, I believe frequently cited large acquisition possibilities like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are incredibly unlikely - and even more unlikely given the incredibly stretched valuations such companies often trade at today. I wouldn't want Apple to overpay for quality assets just because it has the firepower to do so. Both Steve Jobs and Tim Cook have similar styles when it comes to acquisitions, and pressuring a change in that style simply won't happen. If I didn't like it, I would have moved on a long time ago. Capital expenditures also remain light, despite Apple's interest in capital-intensive markets like the automotive market. Given its substantial net cash position, Apple has little reason to save more for a rainy day or pay down extremely cheap debt (all of which was taken on to facilitate the shareholder capital return programs due to offshore-held cash). Shareholder returns are simply the only prudent thing remaining to do with the funds, and the coffers will only continue to grow. Fact is that Apple will generate somewhere in the neighborhood of $70B in operating cash flow for fiscal 2016, with $14B in capital expenditures. We'll see a similar number for fiscal 2017, likely more. That's a 10.3% free cash flow yield on expected fiscal 2016 cash flow, which is an incredibly attractive price point to retire a portion of the share count. Buying back a share of company stock retires a dividend obligation, and it is also an investment in the company itself, improving cash and earnings per share for the rest of us. I will always prefer share buybacks to dividends when it comes to quality companies. Buybacks allow shareholders to defer taxes until shares are sold, which allows gains to compound tax free. They also give management greater flexibility as company management is under no obligation to complete a repurchase program. So if things get hairy for Apple, buybacks can be slowed down. Dividend cuts are greeted with much more animosity from market participants. Flexibility is the point here. There isn't any reason for fear from Tim Cook, if he truly sees strength in the company he heads, from authorizing a higher buyback number. Current predictions on cash flows show the capital program could have easily supported a bump to $200B on the repurchase authorization, allowing Apple to retire a similar dollar value of shares over the next two years to what it did in 2014. Retiring Apple shares in the $90s/share is an opportunity that management has not had for some time, and I hope they are both aggressive in retiring shares in Q3 and in approving a further increase in the repurchase authorization come Q2 2017. Time will tell. Apple is actually one of my few large cap holdings.
