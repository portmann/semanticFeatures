Earnings Quality At Netflix Is Subpar - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The future trajectory of Netflix's stock is about as uncertain as it gets. We're growing very concerned about the quality of the company's earnings. Even after factoring in tremendous earnings-per-share expansion into our valuation model, the company's shares still aren't cheap. Traders and speculators love Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) because of its stock price volatility. "Longs" and "shorts" will argue accordingly. Movie-watchers and gamers enjoy the firm's wide selection of content, and the convenience of delivery. But long-term investors looking for an entry point today are very concerned about Netflix as an investment, and they have good reason. The company's relationship between net income and cash flow is frightening, and its credit is rated junk by the agencies. There's a lot to like about Netflix's potential, but its share price is way to rich for our taste. If there's one thing we feel confident about Netflix, it's that its shares are far from cheap. Let's have a look. There are a variety of stocks on the market that have performed well, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are good businesses, or those that own them have been savvy investors. No reasonable investor would ever pay more than they can receive from a company in terms of free cash flows (as in the case of taking the company private). This is just a fact of reason. If investors don't accept this fact, then they aren't really investors at all. Because the future has yet to be written, we use a fair value range in our analysis that reflects a range of probable future free cash flows (and resulting fair value estimates) in reasonable expected cases instead of a specific point fair value estimate. After all, only a "fool" that may be chasing near-term dynamics, for example, will pay more for a company than what he or she thinks it is worth (yes, many investors play the "greater fool" game and call it investing). With Netflix, we chalk up a lot of the company's business performance (evolving from mailing archaic DVDs in traditional snail mail), and long-term share gains, to luck, though we point to executive perseverance as a key asset of the company. On the basis of a wide fair value range, wild swings in its stock price are all but guaranteed because the value ballast that anchors Netflix's shares is itself a large fair value range in light of both upside potential and downside risks. Since the range of Netflix's future-free-cash-flow derived intrinsic value, itself, spans 30%-40% or more, large movements in the stock price are therefore common--investors can feasibly justify a large pricing "area" for the company. Even big moves in the stock price are all within the range of probable fair value outcomes. But many speculators that own the company within the fair value range and capture gains from movements within the fair value range think that something material is happening. It's not. The share price is just bouncing around within the fair value range, as it is expected to do. On the other hand, investors, as opposed to traders and speculators, look for asset mispricings, or situations when the share price of a company falls outside the cash-flow-derived fair value range, which is supported by the fact that any reasonable investor won't pay more than the free cash flows he or she receives from the investment. Any unreasonable investor can pay anything for any asset. From our perspective, buying and selling a company within its fair value range is merely trading and speculating, hoping to capture the next bit of sentiment influencing actions by the next "greater fool." Even investors that held the company's shares a number of years ago accept the view that Netflix's business operations, while profitable, will be highly volatile. We're forecasting significant earnings per share expansion into the teens by the end of this decade, but our valuation doesn't come close to its share price. For those that love multiples, the company is trading at an astronomical earnings multiple. Further, not everything is perfect at Netflix. Rising content costs, as well as expenses associated with the firm developing its own content, will likely apply new pressures to future free cash flow. S&P recently downgraded its debt further into junk, to B+. We're also growing concerned about the earnings quality of Netflix. The company posted over $250 million in net income during 2014, but cash flow from operations was less than $17 million. This is a major red flag. This is where we derive what multiple a company's earnings should be trading at. After forecasting and discounting future free cash flows and adding the firm's net cash position on the balance sheet, we arrive at its equity value. Dividing equity value by shares outstanding gets to equity value per share. Dividing this by next year's earnings per share gets to the fundamentally correct multiple that Netflix should be trading at. Investors can't simply waive their hands and throw a random multiple on a company's earnings stream, even if it is based on a peer comparison or relative to history. All one has to accept is that a company with $100 billion in cash on the books is worth more than a company with $1 million in cash on the books, all else equal. These companies should be trading at different multiples. A company's future outlook at the present is different than its future outlook 5 or 10 years ago, so using multiples of the past is less-than-ideal as well. The PE is a short-cut and used incorrectly. What are investors to do? Though the discounted cash-flow model also has a few pitfalls, they are less severe in nature than the PE application. For one, the DCF values the exact company at the exact time we're valuing it. It is the only valuation approach that does this. We also know that all of what is known is in the past, and all of what has value is in the future; the future is not yet written. This is why a fair value range is most appropriate in estimating intrinsic worth. We want to capture a range of probable fair value outcomes. All of this said, on the basis of this process, we value Netflix's shares in the range of $237-$491 each. We think this fair value range adequately captures the company's downside risks and upside potential. Uncertainty is not always a negative proposition; in valuation, uncertainty to the upside must also be considered. Still, the estimated fair value of $364 per share is well below its mid-$400s price tag. Our future forecasts do not differ much from consensus over the next few years. The enterprise free cash flow model, which drives the fair value, reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 22.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 26.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 10.2%, which is above Netflix's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 12.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Netflix, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. If there is one takeaway from this article, it should be the importance of applying a fair value range in equity analysis. Not even CEO Reed Hastings himself knows exactly what Netflix is worth. The future free cash flows drive the intrinsic value equation, and the future has yet to be written. We put our words into practice. Though we estimate Netflix's fair value at about $364 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). If the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. No reasonable investor would ever pay more for an investment than he or she could receive in future free cash flows. Stocks reflect pieces of a business' future free cash flows, not pieces of paper. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Netflix. We think the firm is attractive below $237 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $491 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. As an investor, it's helpful to think in this framework, a range of probable fair value outcomes. Any research that says that a firm is worth precisely this or precisely that is precisely wrong. The future cash flows are what determines intrinsic worth, and the future, by definition, has yet to be written. A range-of-outcomes approach is most valid in thinking about intrinsic worth. From our perspective, there's just no reasonable argument supporting long-term investors' interest in Netflix's shares. Earnings quality is deteriorating, and even factoring in fantastic earnings expansion, shares aren't necessarily cheap. Content costs are on the rise, and the credit agencies rate the firm as junk. What more can we say? The future trajectory of Netflix's stock is about as uncertain as it gets.
