Netflix limiting video quality on AT&T, Verizon, other networks - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha Mar 24 2016, 18:49 ET | About: AT&T Inc. (T) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Amid chatter that AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) have throttled Netflix video quality down, Netflix itself has admitted for the first time that it's the one doing the limiting . Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) says it restricts video quality on those two and on most carriers worldwide, in order to protect its customers from busting through their data caps -- which could be expensive, and discourage viewing more Netflix. The company is capping streams at 600 kbps -- well within speed capacities of most wireless networks -- in part because a two-hour movie in HD can consumer an entire month's data allowance. The company says it's working on its own "mobile data saver" to let consumers optimize Netflix against their available bandwidth. Netflix doesn't throttle videos at T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ), due to "more consumer-friendly policies" on data overages (i.e., lower speed rather than expensive charges). It was a comment from T-Mobile chief John Legere about lower-quality video at Verizon and AT&T that launched the discussion; and T-Mobile's "Binge On" offering exempts video from customers' data caps, but reduces its quality to 480p (promised "DVD or better" quality). Time to sue Netflix! Who says they should decide to slow it down? It's the consumer who makes that choice! Simple, either nflx or T and VZ will have to increase their prices to pay for such high bandwith usage.
