Netflix: 3 Reasons Why It's Extremely Overvalued - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in NFLX over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Netflix is expected to become the largest video streaming company in the world in the next five years, as announced at CES 2016. However, a few problems like the low profit margins, terribly low cash flows and poor starts in a few countries make us think that the future is not so bright. Even the excellent assumptions in our DCF model do not make the company considered as fairly priced. The comparative analysis shows that the market values Netflix like a .com company. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is the world's largest video streaming company and the most popular one. Owing to it being the market leader in an almost monopolistic industry, Netflix has shown excellent growth rates both in the US and in other countries. As of January 28, 2016, the company operates in more than 130 countries, has a ~75M customer base, and more than $6B in annual revenue. Every year, Netflix makes enormous investments in its streaming content library. These investments typically reach a level of 70%-80% of total revenues. The company has Napoleonic plans for the future: an opening in China, spending of more than $5B on programming, and reaching a customer base of 150 million-plus members by 2020. Additionally, as quoted in this article : "The service will in 2016 debut its first talk show, a movie starring Brad Pitt, reboots of bygone hits "Full House" and "Degrassi" and the first offerings in French and Italian." It is impressive. However, Netflix needs the money to keep funding its fast pace. According to our research, we definitely see a lot of drawbacks in this company. We are going to explore them now. Reason #1. Growth Is Good But What About The Margins? As you can see from Diagram 2, despite the excellent revenue growth rates, the company's net income is growing moderately. The main reasons for that are the low operating and net profit margins, even if we leave out other Ppay-TV platforms (the closest competitors). Financial pyramids have always had triple digits turnover growth rates, but it does not mean that they were profitable. We do not imply that Netflix is sort of an illegal scheme. Nevertheless, we want to emphasize the importance of optimal pricing and cost-reduction strategies that must be implemented by the management in the future in order to make a business model sustainable. To better grasp the idea, just pretend that you are a hotcakes dealer who sets the price at an operating breakeven level (i.e, revenue = COGS). We are absolutely sure that you will become the fastest-growing dealer in your region but it will not make you rich as you will practically work for free. Reason #2. Cash Flows Metrics Are Terrible. Look at Diagram 3. During the last five years, the company has been borrowing cash from its stakeholders because cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to finance its future expansion. The five-year accumulated undiscounted free cash flow is ~($5.5B). A discounted metric would be more reasonable (depending on the discount rate. Assuming a 10% discount rate, the accumulated amount is in excess of -$6.5B). Hence, $6.5B is the amount of money classified as investments made in the past. When will they be paid off? Will they ever be paid off? In fact, nobody knows the answer. What we definitely know now is the stock is trading like the expected cash flows will grow faster than the revenue, and everybody will be happy (even those who bought it at a valuation of 270x P/E). However, this is not true because free cash flows are going to increase very slowly. Why? Look at Diagram 4, which shows the actual and the forecasted amounts of capital expenditures and investments in content. Even though the projected capex-to-revenue ratio is expected to fall, it is not likely to fall below the 40% mark because: Thousands of movies and TV-series are produced annually. The increasing number of content subscribers will force the company to make investments in file servers. The company's competitive advantage over torrent sites requires it to provide high quality for a small price. Investments in IT streaming technologies to provide fast connection speed and IT code optimizing are required in the long run. At CES 2016, it was announced that the company had opened access to its services in countries like Russia, India, South Korea, etc. Nevertheless, the "opened" status does not mean that the company has successfully "penetrated" the market because in most of these countries "the expansion was awful," according to the users' experience. Just a few things to mention: The website has not been translated into local languages. It means that about 80% of potential clientele has been weeded out. No translation of movies and no subtitles. Prices have not been adjusted to make the service more affordable in countries with devalued currencies (especially Russia and the CIS). These points were derived from the articles of analysts living in some of these countries (Russia and South Korea). Read more about Russia here and here . Read more about South Korea here . Learn about the situation in Pakistan here . According to this information, the announcement of the enormous expansion of Netflix in other countries sounds like an attempt to boost the stock price without a footing. These issues make us think that Netflix's future is rather miurky and highly depends on both the endogenous factors like the size of the capital expenditures and the success of the cost-reduction strategy and the exogenous factors like geopolitics, torrent activity around the world, forex headwinds and user preferences. The company's future is uncertain. Now we are going to value the company taking into account the above factors. We will use our standard tools: the DCF model and the comparative analysis. Our discounted cash flow model can be downloaded in the Excel file format, which you can access with this link . In Diagram 5, you can see how different metrics are expected to change during the forecast period. During the modeling process, we had to make several assumptions, which can be examined by readers in the "Assumptions" tab of our Excel file. A few words about them: A net profit CAGR of 12.2% which takes into account both the increasing operating margin, on the one hand and the increasing tax rate on the other. Capital expenditures to become less aggressive than they are at the moment. The current capex-to-revenue ratio is projected to decrease by 50%. The net capex is projected to become 0 by 2021. The cash flow effect of the negative operating working capital will become less significant in the future. The terminal EV/EBITDA multiple is set to be at ~10x, which implies a ~6.5% perpetuity growth rate in free cash flows. As a result, free cash flows will substantially increase and become positive by 2018. However, we think that these assumptions are overly optimistic because capital expenditures may not be as low as we project in the future. Nevertheless, we do not support the view of the Street's analysts regarding $500M in net income in 2016 as the current net income is two times lower than the previous year's (the Q4 filing can be viewed here ) and we do not see the catalysts that may spark high growth in the bottom line. Our model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest and adding back cash and investments, the market value of equity is circa $36.3B in the base scenario. Consequently, the fair value per share is $83.44. It's more than 16% lower than the current share price (around $99 per share). The sensitivity tables are presented in Diagram 6. We find the suitable price range for the stock to be between $73 - $83 per share or lower because of the very positive perpetuity growth estimates. This price range represents a 16% - 26% downside risk for the stock. Our comparative analysis results are presented in Diagram 7. All ratios show that the stock is extremely overvalued. We think that the P/E ratio of 260x+, the P/BV ratio of ~20x and the P/S ratio of 6.7x are extremely irrational. However, the current EV/EBITDA multiple is ~12x, which is not off the charts. The current valuation seems to be justified by the expected success of the cost-reduction strategy that the company is going to implement (we hope the management will, in fact, implement it). Although Netflix seems to be a global superstar, we are very concerned about its future because of a few internal and external factors. We do not think that the company will reach a net income of $500M by the end of 2016. We also see that the accumulated investments balance of $6.5B-plus has not yet been paid off. According to our DCF and comparative analyses, the stock is overvalued. Hence, we recommend shorting Netflix and set a target price range of $73 - $83 per share. This price range is translated into a 16%-26% downside potential for the stock. Netflix Inc. bears currency risks, interest rate risks, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Since these risks are mostly unpredictable, we recommend investors hedge their positions using different financial instruments. Our valuation of the company is based on current and medium-term business trends and does not include the probability of a force majeure. On the other hand, by using our Excel model , you can change the key parameters in line with your personal assumptions and expectations.
