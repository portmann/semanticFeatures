Netflix's Price Increase: Good In More Ways Than One - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix announced that it will increase the price of its standard service for new subscribers by $1.00. Historically, this has not impacted subscriber growth directly. The company has promised to grow net subscribers by 5-6 million annually in the coming years, which will become a reality if it can cut down on subscriber loss. I propose an idea that would cut down on subscriber loss and give Netflix users a reason to stay subscribed for at least one extra month. I recently read an article that admonished investors from by Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) due to its "nose-bleed valuation" and a few other metrics. I was quick to comment that this is by no means a way to evaluate every company under the sun, as some stocks simply do not trade on valuation. Netflix's price action in Thursday's trading session serves as the perfect example. On news that it would charge new customers $1.00 more per month for its standard streaming service, NFLX spiked from $103.00 to $107.50 in the blink of an eye. This momentum carried into the close, with NFLX eventually ending the day at $114.93 This was a 12% move in a matter of hours, all on claims that the company was going to charge about 12.5% more per month. Roughly a year ago, investors balked at Netflix's U.S. subscriber decline, blaming it on a price increase. However, the company stated that U.S. subscriber declines were bound to happen as a result of their growth. This is an example of correlation vs. causation. On the company's most recent conference call , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was asked about his bold projection of 90 million U.S. subscribers. Reed said that he expects "5 million to 6 million net adds every year for a number of years," adding that if his projections are correct, the company will fulfill their goal of 90 million U.S. subscribers. Being a company that primarily trades on subscriber growth, it makes sense that investors saw Thursday's news as positive. By upping the price for new subscribers only, it gives old subscribers a reason to stay. An increase of $1.00 per month for 5.5 million subscribers adds an additional $66 million to Netflix's annual revenue. With the added income, Netflix can put more money toward producing original content, which will please old subscribers and attract even more new ones. Also, people love a bargain, and the feeling of getting something for cheaper than your neighbor is one that is appeals to many, which gives old subscribers incentive to stay with Netflix. A natural extension of this price increase is an initiative to reward old subscribers. One way that Netflix can deliver on its promise of 5-6 million net new subscribers per year is by cutting down on its subscriber loss. One idea that I have as to how Netflix can cut down on subscriber loss is by allowing subscribers of more than one year to unlock exclusive content. The euphoria that would surround this content would be enough of a reason for many to stay, with the content itself being the kicker. In addition, this would tack on an extra month to each subscriber's plan, adding even more revenue per subscriber. Netflix is not stock that trades on valuation. The company's ability to grow its net subscriber count has proven time and time again to be the reason for its incredible market-beating performance. The price increase for new customers allows Netflix to invest more into its original content, and gives old customers a reason to "lock in" their price and stay. History shows that price increases does not greatly impact Netflix's ability to grow subscribers and, when coupled with initiatives to cut down on subscriber loss (such as the one outlined above), the company should be able to beat net subscriber growth expectations going forward. With a heightened number of subscribers will come a higher stock price. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
