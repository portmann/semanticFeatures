Netflix And Paramount Set To Tangle With Theater Chains As New Films Alter Traditional Model - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is looking to move beyond original TV series and into original films, but theater chains are loathe to give up screen space to the streaming giant. Paramount has started a new strategy that closes the window even more on when a film hits video-on-demand after its theatrical run concludes. Both companies have drawn the ire of the theater owners as it could negatively impact their financial bottom line and as such are boycotting select release. This is a busy weekend for the box office. Yet, even though three new films are debuting, the big story is what's coming to the small screen and the ripple effect that's going to cause within the media industry. The film is Beasts of No Nations, and the reason why it's such a big deal is because it is one of Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) first entries into the world of movies. Starring Idris Elba (Luther, The Wire), the movie is a fictional story about the real life child warriors in West Africa. Directed by Cary Fukunaga, the Emmy-winning talent that helmed True Detective's first season, the film is causing controversy beyond its plot. Instead of the conversation being on the film's chilling look at a sad truth, the talk is all about its distribution partner, Netflix. When negotiating for the film's rights, Netflix had to convince Fukunaga and producers that they were the right fit. That wasn't easy given Netflix is a streaming service for your TV and mobile devices. Beasts is also seen as a potential Oscar contender, so the film had to at the very least get a qualifying run on the big screen. Getting theatres to run a movie can be tricky enough as it is, but imagine the request coming from a predominately small screen source. The end result is that 19 Landmark Theaters owned screens in different US markets will show the film, much to the dismay of other chains. The fear being that Netflix is encroaching on their territory and the theaters don't want to help in their own demise. It's become less about the movies themselves and more about staying alive in tougher economic times. We all know theaters are having a rougher go of it as of late as more people are opting to stay in on the weekends. To counter that, exhibitors are trying to add more amenities to lure audiences. From plush seats to IMAX screens, every option is in play. The problem ironically though is that this only INCREASES the price, which is the reason why the decline first began. Beasts isn't the first film to challenge the norm and it won't be the last. Paramount (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) is also feeling the impact, courtesy of a new initiative that is angering theaters. Recently, the studio struck a deal with chains AMC Theatres and Cineplex Entertainment to allow consumers to watch select releases at home just 17 days after they exit from theaters; the typical window is 90 days. In response Carmike Cinemas, Marcus Theatres and Harkins Theatres have told Paramount they will not screen any film of theirs that has the reduced window in the agreement. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension will be the first major film to be released under this new deal which includes a financial carve-out of video-on-demand (VOD) profits for the theaters participating. While AMC and Cineplex make up a large percentage of theaters, Carmike and company are still a huge chunk of the market. Now, instead of the 2,867 theaters that showed the previous Paranormal film, only 1,350 theaters will screen this one. While I get rational, Ghost Dimension is the first film in the found-footage franchise to be shot in 3D which of course carries an up-charge. The non-participating theaters are essentially hurting themselves here as most people who will want to see this film will likely opt for the 3D option, which at-home viewers can't experience. It's a very different scenario than Beasts as while that film is probably better experienced on the big screen, the impact isn't as severe. The battle lines for this fight have long been drawn and they were actually re-drawn a little last year when Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) The Interview changed the game rules. As you may remember, following a threat on any theater showing the film, Sony pulled the release but then opted to change course. By that point though theaters had re-allocated their space, so Sony went with a mix of indie theaters and VOD options. The move was met with scorn by theater chains who felt slighted and the situation ratcheted up tensions across the board. Granted half the problem was the film earned around $45 million off this patch-work experiment which showed films can make money under that model. Coincidentally, that is about the same amount of money it cost to make the film. Some may argue that's not a lot of money, but given the type of film The Interview was, it is impressive. This was a parody and one that was always going to appeal to a limited audience. Had this been a film that reached a larger set of demos, we would have likely seen a larger gross. Yet, this was a solid return. Back to Beasts though as Netflix isn't stopping there and already has four films with Adam Sandler in the works plus a new movie centered on Paul Reuben's' Pee-Wee Herman franchise. The studio is also on the hunt for more and it's a safe bet they'll find more willing partners. Netflix is a disruptor. By definition, it's meant to upset the norm and that's a good thing. The people who oppose it are likely the ones who will be financially impacted as a result. I do understand why they are upset and I don't blame them but with so many other options in play to be entertained, this battle is not going to end anytime soon.
