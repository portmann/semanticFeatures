ETF Hub Nov 20 2015, 19:21 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A new study tries to pierce the veil over Netflix's "ratings" in comparison to its peers, and finds them wanting compared to HBO ( TWX -0.4%) -- though likely due to one big series. Parrot Analytics has studied what it calls "demand expressions" to compare original and flagship shows at Netflix ( NFLX +3%), HBO and Amazon.com. The metric includes a number of factors, including video streaming, social media, blogging, file-sharing and wiki platforms. HBO and Netflix held all the top 10 spots for September in Parrot's analysis: Game of Thrones on top with 28.2M expressions, with Netflix's Narcos second at 14.3M. Meanwhile, Amazon shows held spots 11-15. Rounding out the top five were Netflix's Orange is the New Black (nearly 8M expressions), HBO's True Detective (7.8M) and HBO's Silicon Valley (6.3M). But take Game of Thrones out of the measurements, Parrot says, and HBO and Netflix have virtually the same demand. Netflix has extremely poor quality content. Stale and only the first few of the episodes. I don't even bother using their free 30 day trials. Waste of time and bandwidth, if I may add. The only way they fool the tools measuring popularity by internet bandwidth hogged up by users, is by downloading garbage at 8k resolution. Netflix is just another of the Silicon Valley bubbles blown out of proportion by the feds and the wall street money extortionists. I agree HBO has only 2 good shows Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley  other than that nothing to watch. So it's kind of a stretch to say it compares to Netflix. Especially after True Detective season 2 bombed. Alright, TWX needs to do a tracking stock or spin-off 20% (10% Jeff Bewkes, 10% Public and remaining 80% still owned by TWX and shareholders) just like Fiat did to Ferrari.HBO is and will always be TWX crown jewel and the most beloved pay-tv brand.
