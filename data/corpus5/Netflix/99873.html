Should You Follow Icahn Out Of Netflix? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Carl Icahn recently announced that he sold the last of his stake in Netflix, a large position he's had on the books for quite some time. This comes as good news regarding expansion and strong performance for the company has pushed shares significantly higher. While it's very possible that things could continue to improve, it's likely that some investors will be better off getting out of the picture now too. Earlier this week, Carl Icahn announced that he had unloaded the last of his shares of movie streamer Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Following the sale of around 0.35 million shares of the company for the quarter ending September 30th, 2014, Icahn has left his stake in the company unchanged until now. However, since his last quarterly filing in March of this year, shares have soared another 62.9% from $416.69 to $678.64, prompting him to unload the 1.41 million shares (valued at last quarter's price at $588.34 million and $956.88 million today) he had left on hand. Should this serve as a sign that now's the time to get out of the company or do investors still have plenty of room to run moving forward? Two key things that have pushed shares of Netflix higher recently is its continued growth and the prospect that the company could move into the Chinese market. Last quarter, management reported that revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 23.9% from the $1.27 billion the company reported the same quarter a year earlier. This was driven entirely by strong growth in the company's Domestic Streaming and International Streaming segments, which saw sales rise by 23.3% and 55.5%, respectively, but was somewhat offset by a 15.2% falloff in its Domestic DVD segment. This growth, in turn, can be chalked up to a 23.7% increase in the number of paid subscribers on Netflix's platform, which rose from 52.64 million in the first quarter last year to 65.09 million in this year's quarter. Unfortunately, however, the high cost of expansion overseas pushed net income down by more than half and turned positive operating cash flow severely negative. In spite of this bottom line performance, however, Mr. Market was overjoyed with the strong customer additions, which more than made up for a lack of profitability. Another factor behind the company's strong performance lately has been speculation that the business may be working on a deal to get its services into China. Currently, it's estimated that approximately 641.6 million of the 1.39 billion people in China have internet access and, absent an economic collapse, this figure is only likely to grow moving forward. To put this in perspective, we need to look at how large the market for internet in China is compared to the rest of the world. From what I found, it's estimated that there are about 3.13 billion internet users globally, which means that more than one in five of them live in the populated country. Across the globe, this represents a more than 200% increase from the 1.03 billion internet users estimated in 2005, which implies a roughly 12% growth rate per annum. Although the number of internet users in China is vast, the market for the online video market is still quite small. According to Bloomberg, this market totaled just $5.9 billion the last time it was measured. The main problem is that, despite its strong growth over the past few decades, much of the Chinese populace still lives in poverty so, even though nearly half of them can access the internet, not many can afford to pay for content (or they simply aren't willing to). That being said, however, total spending in this market is expected to nearly triple to $14.5 billion between now and 2018 so the upside for any company getting into the fray now could be material. But this will be a burden short-term As Netflix grows, there's no doubt that it will probably do just fine. However, when it comes to international expansion, the company has had somewhat mixed results. Between 2012 and 2014, for instance, the number of subscribers to Netflix in international markets soared 198.6% from 6.12 million to 18.28 million. This easily beat out the maturing U.S. market, where subscriber growth during this period was a more modest 44.1%, rising from 27.15 million to 39.11 million. As a result of this strong growth overseas, international streaming revenue skyrocketed 354.9% from $287.54 million to $1.31 billion and makes up nearly 24% of sales. All of this is truly positive for the company but what isn't positive is that growth has been incredibly expensive. While domestic streaming and domestic DVD sales bring in strong profit margins (especially the latter), international streaming continues to lose money because of the high cost of expanding to new markets, most of which comes in the form of acquiring and distributing new content that it can't replicate from its U.S. markets. Management describes the nature of this best in the excerpt pasted below: By launching a new and likely large service in China, the costs for Netflix will almost certainly be large, forcing the company's margins even lower in the first few years in this market. Short-term, this will be bearish for investors but for a long-term investor the payoff will come a few years down the road. As you can see in the table below, the cost disparity between international markets and the U.S. streaming market (which is also improving year-over-year due to a larger customer base and economies of scale) is large but quickly narrowing. Most likely, this kind of trend will take place for the company in China as well. Why you may want to consider selling In part, the high cost of expanding into China is one of two big reasons why some investors may want to move away from the business. If successful in its expansionary efforts, Netflix will fare well over the long run but there's no telling how long that payoff period will take. In addition to that, there's also the fact that shares of the enterprise are, today, quite expensive. As you can see in the graph below, investors buying into shares of Netflix are paying 7.45 times revenue for a slice of the pie. On top of being high on an absolute basis, this is also more expensive than any point in at least the past five years for the business, narrowly surpassing how costly shares were back in 2011. Another way to look at the picture is through the lens of earnings. In the graph below, you can see that shares of Netflix are trading for 153.80 times last year's earnings. Although revenue is still growing rapidly for the company and the profits are depressed due to its expansionary efforts, shares of the company are still trading at an incredibly high multiple. Even in the event that International Streaming generated the same kind of profit margins that Domestic Streaming has, the company's shares would still be going for a hefty 60.80 times earnings. While less significant, I also examined the cost of Netflix's shares on a price/book value basis. Right now, shares of the business are going for 21.10 times book value, which is extraordinarily high. In theory, the value of the company's intangible assets could be worth far more than they are stated for but it's still scary to see that, with the exception of the period prior to 2012, shares are going for a five-year high based on this measurement. There's no doubt in my mind that Netflix is an excellent company and I believe that, in the future, the company will be larger and more profitable than it is today. Having said that, while management is working really hard at growing sales, shares of the enterprise are incredibly pricey at this moment. Combine that with the uncertainty revolving around a Chinese expansion and the fact that shares have soared in price over the past few months, I think Icahn made a sound investment move and I don't think investors would be in the wrong to follow in his footsteps here.
