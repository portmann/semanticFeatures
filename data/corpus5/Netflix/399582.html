Hulu's 'Slow' Growth Is Not As Bearish As It Looks - Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOX) | Seeking Alpha Hulu's recent "slowdown" to only 33% subscriber growth has been called out by analysts. In reality, Hulu is looking more promising than it has in years, with a long overdue platform revamp nearing completion. Its recent slowdown stems from lack of exclusive content, which can easily be remedied once its internal metrics show customers responding to the platform changes. Hulu's incumbent owners are too exposed to linear-TV's demise to be good investments, but Hulu's search for a fourth partner might offer a more pure-play entry point for investors. After spending almost a decade in the shadow of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Hulu, the joint venture of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and 20th Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) is on the move lately. With today's confirmation that Hulu will indeed seek to offer live-streaming of its content partners channels in addition to on demand video, the day of Internet TV eclipsing linear TV draws ever closer. And for the first time, it looks like Hulu may actually play a substantial role in the transition. While the recent commentary on Hulu's recent subscriber numbers has been surprisingly negative , I actually thought they were rather good, and I'm becoming optimistic on Hulu for the first time in years. Hulu has long been almost the forgotten also-ran to its more well known brethren despite, or perhaps because of, its more establishment origins and connections. Launching on March 12th, 2008, when even Netflix was just beginning to probe the depths of Internet TV's potential, Hulu failed to catch fire as Netflix did and spent years toiling in the rear. While Netflix rose steadily to 48 million subscribers in April 2014, Hulu had only 6 million , despite offering in-season content of current shows. The fact that some of Netflix's subscribers were overseas was little consolation - the U.S. subscriber count alone was almost six times their own. Last year it suffered the humiliation of watching Amazon Prime Video, which didn't even launch until three years after Hulu did, streak past it in downstream internet traffic, and presumably usage as well. Part of the problem was that its partners were major stakeholders in the very linear-TV ecosystem Internet TV is meant to disrupt, unlike Netflix and Amazon which have no compunction about tearing that system down. They insisted on making Hulu look a lot like linear TV, with all the annoying features - most especially, ads - that people use Internet TV to get away from . What's more, when it became clear Internet TV was taking off, Hulu's content partners began throwing up more obstacles for Hulu customers, including instituting an eight-day waiting period for new episodes, while preserving next-day or even next-hour access for cable/satellite VOD systems. These restrictions on Hulu were waived for cable/satellite customers, threatening to make Hulu less of an Internet TV app and more of a cable-TV portal. Hulu's biggest problem, however, may have been its content deals. When Hulu launched its partners agreed to make it their exclusive home for online content from ABC, NBC, and FOX. But in 2011 that exclusivity was not renewed , and Hulu's content started popping up on its parents' home websites, diverting lots of potential traffic. Over the last two years, Netflix has not really slowed down, but Hulu has started to speed up. From 6 million it rose to 9 million last April and 12 million now. It has begun to address many of the "not as good as Netflix" flaws its owners saddled it with, inking deals for exclusive TV content and expanding its movie library with a non-exclusive deal with Epix. The single most important thing, however, might be the move it made six months ago. Hulu now offers a commercial-free option for just $4 more a month, $12 compared to $8. If that $4 saves the viewer even 30 minutes of commercials - which would require watching about six episodes of TV a month - customers are paying less than the minimum wage to buy back their time. Despite this, analyst feedback over the last few days has been surprisingly negative. Analysts have pointed out that Hulu's growth is already slowing, despite still being less than a quarter of Netflix's size. They were disappointed that 2015, which CEO Mike Hopkins had called Hulu's breakout year, did not bring more eyeballs. I am not concerned. I have had a lot of problems with Hulu bulls over the years, but this is not one of them. The comparisons with Netflix are not entirely accurate because Hulu has what I would call a sequencing issue. When Netflix first launched what would become the most revolutionary TV offering in decades, it began with the engine and then bought fuel. From the beginning, it offered consumers a low price, an excellent recommendation engine, complete device portability, and most importantly, no ads. It began with a collection of mostly B-level movies and one good contract with Starz. Over time it cut deals with most of the major studios, putting more and more fuel in the engine so it could drive the car farther and farther. Hulu essentially started at the other end. It's partners/owners basically handed it whole tanks of fuel, and told them to build an engine. They came out of the gate with an exclusive lock on some of TV's most compelling content, but a very poor platform. They were required to show ads, and they charged more than their ad-free competitor. Content could only be viewed on computers, not mobile devices. The dark days were when exclusivity expired and the platform was still terrible. Now there was still no engine, and a lot less fuel. Since then, Hulu has begun to finish the engine. It has full device portability and an ad-free option is now available. Now for the fuel. So far it only has a few exclusive content agreements, which is a problem. No one likes paying twice for anything. If Hulu is only offering content that people can get elsewhere, there is little reason for people to pay its $12 fee on top of Cable/Netflix/Amazon. Hulu shares the Epix movie slate with Amazon, it shares several of its CBS library shows with Netflix and it shares most of its in-season TV shows with its owners/providers. The good news is that problem, unlike a bad platform, can be solved, and quickly too. Hulu has begun to launch original content , as Netflix and Amazon already have. It is working on more exclusive content deals, which should bring more people to the site to find shows they can't watch anywhere else. Hulu should feel comfortable spending money on these shows because if they are put on a strong platform, they will yield quick results and allow it to tap the same virtuous cycle Netflix has: more content brings more eyeballs, brings more money, brings more content. The only problem with Hulu for investors is that they can't invest. Hulu is a joint venture of Comcast, Disney, and Fox, with no publicly traded shares. Of the three, all are so heavily invested in linear-TV that whatever benefits Hulu brings to their bottom line may well be cancelled out by the damage done to their other businesses. Disney has ESPN, Comcast is America's largest cable company, and Fox has no fewer than 15 RSNs, the channels loaded with expensive sports contracts little less than ESPN. However, there are periodic reports of interest in Hulu from other parties, either joining the Big Three in the existing configuration or in some combination of a sale/IPO. TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ) was rumored to be bidding not too long ago, although so far nothing has come of it. The price was said to value Hulu at $5 billion. My recommendation is to hold off on the three incumbents, but to buy any new partners who enter the business with less deadweight. CBS (NYSE: CBS ) would profit the most from Hulu, since with such strong content they have less to fear than most from the demise of the old system. They could milk Hulu's profits without fear of cannibalizing themselves. For Hulu it would round out their broadcast TV lineup nicely. Discovery Communications (DISC) or Univision (Pending: UVN ) would also be good candidates to go long if they could get their foot in the door. Best of all of course would be an IPO, but that seems less likely right now. To me, the fact that Hulu has gone from 6 to 12 million in two years with as little exclusive content as it has says a lot about its potential, not its shortcomings. To be clear, Hulu has a long way to go. Too much of its library is still non-exclusive, and it probably still charges too much considering Netflix ($10) and Amazon ($9) prices, especially considering that they offer two streams at a time instead of one. But after years of wallowing in the shadows it has begun to move. Netflix today sports a market cap of almost $50 billion. If Hulu can get to even half of that it will yield a very nice return for someone who can buy in at 10% of that valuation.
