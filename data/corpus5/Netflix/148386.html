Is Netflix Safe At These Multiples? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX's original content is always a source of worry. The most recent content is hardly "original". Since so many bulls seem to value NFLX on an EV/Revenue basis, we take a look at what that might mean. Even if NFLX is fairly valued among peers on EV/Rev, the problem is still the "quality" of subscriber growth. We still think NFLX needs to take a breather. We've often commented on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) with the tone of "love the company, hate the stock." We've usually recommended selling or staying away given the effect of hype on valuation and the effect of a content arms race on margins. Speaking of content, we recently viewed the refreshed Wet Hot American Summer. While we weren't exactly impressed, the current IMDB rating is an impressive 7.9/10, with many reviews discussing this being a refreshing "blast from the past." We tend to agree with those giving it two or three stars, as the humor just isn't quite there and the story isn't as big or captivating as the plot-driven juggernauts NFLX has launched in the past. More worrying for investors - aren't we supposed to be concerned about Netflix's "original" content? Even the bulls seem to acknowledge that NFLX needs to keep hitting home runs with their original series. The one thing that many struggle with beyond the content is the valuation behind NFLX and how to value it. In our most recent report , we pointed out that "subscribers" is not a component of a valuation ratio, despite that so many seem to be valuing NFLX on some EV/Eyeballs rather than EV/Sales or something more meaningful. While we understand that subscriber growth is a big deal, and will drive a recurring revenue stream (high-quality) that can generate strong cash flow, the amount management has needed to spend to create quality content (keeping a hold of those eyeballs) has caused us a lot of concern. Because of a subsequent lack of earnings and cash flow, bullish investors have essentially chosen to key in on either EV/Subscribers or EV/Sales. For now, let's play along. Take a look at the current valuations of many high-flying and "cult" stocks in the Software and Internet pile (consensus numbers from Yahoo!): While we had hoped for a higher correlation between EV/Rev and revenue growth, we note that if we excluded a few outliers (Palo Alto (NYSE: PANW ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) for example), we can have a correlation of ~0.75. And importantly, based on these comps, NFLX would appear to be fairly valued based on its estimated ~26% Y/Y growth in FY16. With this in mind, we want to ask 2 questions: 1. Is comparing EV/Rev valuations even possible? Many names in Software and Internet are trading toward their historical highs, so looking at these valuations at a single point in time may not be the best idea. But even for others from our sample that aren't hitting historical highs, a lot of noise comes into the analysis when we see how choppy valuations on the EV/Rev basis can be, especially when they get higher: 26% growth in FY16 would be an acceleration from even FY14's 25.8% Y/Y growth. While acceleration did actually occur in FY13 (12.6% in '12 to 21.2% in '13) and in FY14, both 1Q15 and 2Q15 were decelerating Y/Y. This would imply that unless a large amount of subscribers jump in, especially on the domestic side, given higher price and lack of FX headwinds, NFLX is likely not going to grow 25.8% in FY15 and a natural growth ceiling materializes in subscription adds and overall revenue. Notwithstanding this possibility, our estimates do embed NFLX being able to maintain its 20% growth essentially over the next 4 years, a feat that not many companies have been able to do. We are raising our multiple on NFLX for our EV/Rev to 7x and our out-year terminal value multiple to 6.5x, though the company will face further FX issues. Many here on Seeking Alpha want to point to new countries that NFLX will enter in 2H15 and 2016, including China and Japan. However, this will become lower margin and create larger FX headwinds. On top of that, we believe a pricing war may occur in the out-years for NFLX, which may cause a revenue headwind, driving a stock valuation re-rating. While we are not factoring that into the stock at this point, we caution long-term investors here. We are raising our PT to $118 and remaining in the "sell" bucket, with the footnote that the EV/Rev numbers may be considered reasonable in a relative analysis. Our risk-reward does take into account the altering growth rate, and thus, the multiples applied changes slightly. We see more risk to the stock than reward and caution investors on letting this one become too frothy. The stock has had a nice run but with what we still believe is a low-quality EV/Rev valuation (i.e., nothing left to stand on if subscriber growth slows), and sentiment in the "overbought" territory, NFLX is more likely to catch its breath than climb higher.
