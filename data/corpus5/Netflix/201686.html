Netflix Subscription Growth Disappoints... Now What? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Subscriber growth for Netflix came in below expectations when the company announced third quarter earnings. Operating profit also disappointed, missing the company's target by 9 percent. The quarterly report hurts management's credibility and will likely cause investors to lose confidence in the long-term potential for Netflix to generate meaningful profits. With NFLX trading at a very high multiple, the disappointing quarter could cause shares to trade steadily lower until management is able to reassure investors that growth is on track. Shares of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) traded more than 7% lower in extended trading Wednesday evening following the company's third quarter earnings announcement. For the quarter, the company generated $1.74 billion in revenue, below Wall Street analysts' expectations for $1.75 billion. More importantly, Netflix reported total memberships of 69.2 million users. This number represents growth of 3.6 million new subscribers during the quarter, and is short of the 69.7 million total subscribers investors were expecting. Looking at the company's earnings, the picture gets even more disappointing. For the quarter, Netflix generated $74 million in operating earnings which fell far short of the company's guidance of $81 million. Management blamed this decline on "involuntary churn" which means that the company was unable to collect payments from existing customers. The quarterly letter implies that this is an issue with new chip-based credit and debit cards. This seems like an odd scapegoat for a 9% miss in operating earnings. After all, a world-class retail company like Netflix shouldn't be caught off guard by a change affecting their regular subscription payments. Finally, the company's earnings per share came in at $0.07, which is a penny better than the second quarter of this year, and half of the $0.14 per share earned in the third quarter of 2014. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn $0.08 for the quarter. Investors currently own shares of Netflix based on long-term expectations of significant subscriber growth. It makes no sense to pay $110.23 per share (Wednesday's closing price) for a company that earns just 7 cents per share of profit per quarter, unless one expects a tremendous amount of growth over the next several years. Earlier this week, we laid out a "best case scenario" for Netflix , explaining how even if everything goes perfectly for the company over the next three years, the potential increase in the share price would not likely compensate investors for the risk they are taking. Our recommendation was to sell NFLX shares before this evening's earnings announcement. Now, thanks to the company's disappointing subscriber growth and complete miss in terms of operating profits, it will be even harder for investors to make a bullish case for this company (especially with the stock price still well above $100 per share). At this point, the company's management team has begun to lose credibility which will likely negatively impact consumer confidence. Since the entire market cap of Netflix is based on expectations (and not on the company's current earnings), it's important for the management team to manage investors expectations and to execute on published targets. With credibility now severely challenged, investors will likely require more concrete proof of potential earnings growth moving forward. And in the meantime, it would not be surprising to see the share price drop into the low $50s, near where NFLX was trading as recently as the end of first quarter 2015. International Growth and Price Increases We have two final thoughts on the third quarter earnings report: First, Netflix had worse than expected subscriber growth in the U.S., offset by stronger than expected international growth. There are two ways of viewing this data: A shift toward international growth is good because it represents a larger pool of prospective subscribers. Or, A shift toward international growth is bad because U.S. customers are more profitable for the company. We tend to gravitate toward the bearish side of this argument because Netflix is already struggling to meet its operating earnings target. If it focuses on adding more customers that are less profitable to the company's bottom line, investors will have to place even more faith in the company's ability to execute overseas. And this at a time when Netflix is already losing credibility. The second issue we're worried about is whether the price increase in the U.S. will be effective or not. Last week, Netflix increased its domestic pricing for streaming media to $9.99 a month. This new pricing only applies to new customers, but the $1.00 a month could help to exacerbate weak subscriber growth in the U.S.. We find it odd that Netflix would move forward with its new pricing plan during this quarter while knowing that the company's U.S. subscriber growth metrics would not meet investor expectations. It seems like a wiser strategy would have been to hold off on a price increase until Netflix was able to determine what caused the weakness and make the appropriate changes. The fourth quarter will be a very interesting period for NFLX investors. If the stock is able to rebound from this disappointing earnings announcement, it will represent an impressive show of strength from the faithful NFLX shareholders. But we believe the more likely scenario is that NFLX will trade steadily lower during the next three months, or at least until management is able to prove that exceptional subscriber growth is once again the most probable scenario.
