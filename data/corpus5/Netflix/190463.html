ETF Hub Oct  2 2015, 20:41 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has gone live with its Go90 mobile video service, and today the app jumped into the No. 14 spot in iOS Entertainment. That's a spot well behind Netflix and Hulu , but ahead of Comcast's Xfinity TV Go and HBO Now. The company planned an $80M marketing blitz to support the launch, and says it has a content library of 8,000 titles and 35 exclusive original series. The app is free to all, meaning advertising will be the moneymaker -- and so the quality of content will be king. Go90 got more than $50M in ad commitments including an upfront deal with its exclusive agency partner Publicis Groupe ( OTCQX:PUBGY +1.4%). With few long-form shows at the moment, Go90 is competing less with OTT services like Netflix, Hulu or HBO Now, and more with YouTube, Snapchat and other Webby services. Jefferies noted after meeting with AOL's Tim Armstrong that Verizon wants to grow into a "leading scaled OTT provider serving millions of customers while also becoming a top 3 player in the mobile advertising marketplace."
