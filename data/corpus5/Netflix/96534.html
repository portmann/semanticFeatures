Does Netflix Have Long-Term Upside Past A $40 Billion Valuation? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha At $40 billion NFLX trades at multiples that far exceed the industry average, meaning it is an investment for the future. In modeling 120 million peak subs at various price points, can NFLX trade higher long-term? Even after Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) 7:1 split , it'll still be a $40 billion company. It, and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube are now valued at $40 billion, a valuation that is not tied to today's fundamentals, but rather how the two assets will perform later down the line. That said, figuring Netflix's peak valuation and fundamental upside is not that difficult, but the big question is whether at $40 billion there is valuation upside left? First and foremost, Netflix is a communication company, one that may blur the lines of technology but operates within the scope of communications. It's an industry that trades at approximately 29x earnings and 2.3x sales. As a result, Netflix is valued at a big premium over its industry, trading at 7.1x sales and a whopping 200x next year's expected earnings. With that said, Netflix may trade at a big premium to the industry today, but sooner or later those metrics will start to fall as Netflix begins to trade at metrics that match its industry. This naturally occurs as a company grows larger and transitions away from speculative and into a mature business. Seeing as how Netflix is a bit of a hybrid company between communications and technology, I have provided a few examples below to show how over time a company's price/sales underperform sales growth to reflect that of its industry average. As you can see, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) and DirecTV's (NASDAQ: DTV ) price/sales ratio fell significantly while both companies achieved rapid revenue growth since 2004. This was the market's way of adjusting each company's valuation multiple over time, something that always occurs as a business grows larger, and when a company trades at a multiple that's well over its industry average. Meanwhile, Apple's price/sales ratio increased, but that's only because it was not overvalued in 2004, and its ratio traded higher to reflect a business that improved as it matured. Nonetheless, the point is that revenue outperformed price/sales growth in all instances. One way this can happen is if a stock's performance increases at a slower rate than sales growth over an extended period of time. Another way is for a stock to correct, trade considerably lower while revenue continues to grow. With Netflix, one of these scenarios will naturally occur, but the unknown question is how much upside will remain once that day comes, when Netflix trades at a multiple that better reflects the industry average. To figure that, we must know how much larger Netflix's business will become. Albeit, Netflix is not a difficult company to figure out. Its peak revenue can be found with a simple formula: Total subscribers x subscription price = revenue. With that said, Netflix's total subscribers continue to grow very fast. During its last quarter , Netflix added a total of nearly five million new subscribers, to total 60 million U.S. and international subs combined. Therefore, Netflix is showing no signs that it is nearing a peak in total subscribers. For the sake of argument, let's say that Netflix can peak at 120 million total subscribers worldwide, approximately double its current count. Netflix then has two different price points, $7.99 for ongoing subs and $8.99 for new subs. Rather than trying to determine who's who, let's apply that $8.99 price to all 120 million subs to reach nearly $1.08 billion per month. On an annual basis, that equals almost $13 billion in peak revenue. Granted, I haven't seen too many analysts modeling 120 million peak subs. Therefore, my outlook is more than generous to the streaming giant, and at $8.99 per month, that would put Netflix's current valuation at 3x peak sales. That's above the industry average, and if Netflix doesn't hike prices, it suggests that Netflix does not have a tremendous amount of long-term upside ahead. Albeit, Netflix's long-term upside is directly tied to its ability to increase prices over time. In looking back, Netflix has hiked prices, but not nearly at the rate needed to create substantial revenue upside. Furthermore, neither consumers nor investors responded well to previous price hikes. Back in 2011, Netflix's stock fell 75% in just three months after it split the DVD and streaming business, thereby increasing the total price that consumers had to pay for both services. It then took Netflix another two years to increase the price for new subscribers by $1 to $8.99, noticeably not affecting ongoing subs. This suggests that Netflix may never increase the monthly price for its near 60 million subs, and that it must capitalize on the remaining 60 million subs that I project. If so, we're talking about 60 million subs at $8.99, nearly $6.5 billion in annual revenue. Therefore, even if being very aggressive, and modeling a high monthly price of $15 for the remaining 60 million, that still only reaches $17.3 billion in peak revenue, or 2.3x peak sales. That would be the exact same multiple that the communications industry trades at today, and suggests that Netflix has very little upside remaining, if any from a $40 billion market capitalization. Moreover, given Netflix's difficulty in raising prices over the years, investors must realize that it would be very hard for the company to average $15 per new subscriber from this point forward, especially when it is so far off at just $8.99 right now. While Netflix should be able to charge $15 per month given the price of HBO's streaming service and DISH Network's Sling TV, at $15, the big question is whether Netflix will risk upsetting consumers given its history. Not to mention, investors can't really expect much from Netflix's DVD business long-term. This is a business that has been in continuous decline, now having just 5.5 million subs, but contributing $85 million of Netflix's $97 million in operating profit. As this business continues to decline, and Netflix's content costs continues to rise, it is hard to see the company becoming highly profitable without a big increase in price. Given the uncertainly surrounding monthly prices, content costs, and even its peak subscriber count, it is very hard if not impossible to project profit. With that said, after a big drop in gross margin, caused by the splitting of its DVD and streaming business, and the rise of content costs, Netflix's gross margin has risen from a low of 27% in 2012 to a current 32.3% over the last 12 months. With Netflix's subscriber count expected to keep growing, it may be able to maintain this trend, but the key takeaway is that it'll never reach a P/E multiple that compares to the industry with its current business model, not charging $8.99 per month. Hence, under no circumstance can I model a business where Netflix can support its current valuation on revenue alone, much less profit. Now, if Netflix were to suddenly hike prices to $15 a month for all subscribers, and hike it to $20 for all new subs, and still reach that 120 million subscriber mark, then it could hit $25 billion in revenue, but that's not realistic, and even then there's not a ton of upside with its current business model. Therefore, innovation becomes a wildcard for Netflix, or its ability to monetize the platform in different ways. In a previous article I made a case for Netflix as a video-on-demand service provider , creating big-budget films and charging an additional fee to subscribers. However, Netflix has announced no such plans, and until then we can't model it into the company's peak potential. Source: Does Netflix Have Long-Term Upside Past A $40 Billion Valuation?
