3 Undervalued Companies Paying Increasing Dividends - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha These 3 companies show a great upside potential, AND you are getting paid to wait. Their dividend growth is assured for years to come and will compliment your existing portfolio. I have selected 3 companies with strong business models that will weather any economic storm. Since the beginning of the year, there is an awkward feeling on the stock market. Earnings seasons has shown companies are having a hard time to propel their revenues higher. Some are hit by currency headwinds while others are dealing with mediocre global economic growth. Considering the rise of the stock market since 2009 and the fact that earnings are now slowing down, it has become harder to find undervalued companies. Source: Ycharts, author modification Since interest rates remained close to their all time record lows, many investors moved a part of their money towards equities, especially dividend paying stocks. This didn't help push stock prices higher. If you have money on the sidelines and you are looking for your next buy, I'm pretty sure your buy list is very short. In order to help you out, I've highlighted 5 companies that are not only undervalued but also pay growing dividends to help you wait while the stock market is going sideways. DIS has become more than entertainment parks and Mickey. It is now the largest entertainment business in the world. Walt Disney is divided into five different segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive. The Media division (ABC, The Disney Channel and ESPN) leads DIS' revenue shares with 44% of the company total sales: In late July 2015, concerns started to rise among financial analysts about Disney's media networks division. The main problem comes from the fact that the cable industry is seriously losing steam. The new generation is moving rapidly towards streaming services such as Netflix and couldn't care less about cable. Unfortunately for Disney, the company makes lots of money from its sport division ESPN. It has been a long time growth vector. Now that people are moving away from cable and ESPN is not streaming its content, many investors are worried about the future growth potential of this division. How dividend payments will increase? Since 2010, management has focused heavily on returning more money to their shareholders. The 5 year dividend growth rate stands at 36.22% and the company still shows a low cash payout ratio: Please note that the recent dividend drop on the graph (the blue line) is due to a timing issue as the company now pays its dividend twice a year instead of once a year. Disney will continue to generate strong cash flow and increase its dividend in the double digit range for a while. While ESPN will continue to generate a constant flow of income, other divisions will show strong growth. With a new park opening this year (Disney Shanghai), its second largest business segment will show a strong growth in the upcoming years. Star Wars and Super Heroes movies will continue to drive the Studio Entertainments and Consumer Products divisions to higher levels. The first Star Wars was a real success and the sequels will definitely bring even more fans into the fold. The success of Disney's business remains its ability to integrate and cross sell all their products together. From the Movie theatres to their theme parks and consumer products, Disney is very well integrated. The company not only trades for a bargain, it also meets all my 7 investing principles . Union Pacific is a transportation company focused on railroads. Its railroads cover 23 states across the Western 2/3 of the USA. UNP shows a great diversification in terms of sectors: 11% for Automotive, 17% Agricultural products, 17% Chemicals, 20% Intermodal, 19% Industrial products and 16% Coal. The railroad industry is facing several headwinds at the same time. The low price of oil has made trucking transportation a lot more affordable, hence a great alternative to railroads. Coal usage has dropped significantly in the past few years and will continue its downtrend. Considering this represents 16% of UNP business, investors are starting to get cold feet. With no surprise, Union Pacific's volume guidance for 2Q was weak. The company guided to a 30 percent y/y decline in its coal volumes and a 10 percent y/y decline in its total volumes and down mid-single digits for the year. The company expects comparables to get easier in the back half. How dividend payments will increase? While the company is facing a hard time in the industry, the dividend growth is fairly secure with a cash payout ratio under 60%: The company has posted an impressive 27.42% CAGR dividend growth rate over the past 5 years. As you can see, UNP business model generates lots of cash flow and there are more dividend increase expected ahead. What will change in the upcoming years? In a simple line; railroads are going to come back. First, oil prices will not stay at these low level forever. We already saw the oil barrel bouncing back from $25 to over $40 in a very short period of time. The current oil price is now supported on economic values instead of promises of future OPEC agreements. As the US economy strengthens, UNP will see more activities in its others business segments. After all, the idea of buying a cyclical company is to do it when you hit a down cycle, isn't it? UNP is down by 30% since January 2015. I guess we can call it a down cycle. The company is a diversified industrial goods manufacturer showing #1 and #2 brands in all their markets. Its products revenues are coming from both the US (49%) and outside the country (51%). The company has been paying dividends for the past 139 years and shows 48 consecutive increases. The company hasn't been hit by any bad news and the stock price is up for the past 12 months (about 9%). However, the SWK has been evolving under the radar for some times. There is nothing incredibly sexy about selling tools. The company dividend yield being under 2% ensured that shares are ignored by most income seeking investors. How dividend payments will increase? With a cash payout ratio around 33%, the company will be able to keep increasing its dividend payment for several years. Over the past 5 years, the company shows a dividend growth rate of 9.81% CAGR. What will change in the upcoming years? SWK is a long term play considering its relatively low dividend yield, but strong and consistent dividend growth policy. This is not a supercharged stock that will skyrocket, but it will certainly improve your portfolio's stability and add some serious dividend growth power. SWK has the important size of its distribution network that enables large economies of scale. SWK is using its free cash flow to buy back shares and gives 50% of it to its shareholders as dividend payments. As the US economy strengthens, the housing construction and renovation industry will rise. This will obviously boost SWK sales in the US. Disney, Union Pacific or Stanley Black & Decker? If I had to choose one company among the following 3, I would definitely pick Disney. I think there is an enormous growth potential in the upcoming 5 years considering all projects to be developed.
