Why Netflix's International Push Beat Expectations - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX reports $92M loss rather than the expected $101M loss for Q2 international profits. 2.4M additions helped out by strong Australian response based on survey data. On July 15, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) knocked the cover off the ball with its first post stock split earnings report. The share price jumped by over 16% as revenues topped $1.4 billion with over $248 million in profit . While the domestic market contributed to most of the profits, Netflix is thinking more about its international operations and expansion, and while there were no new markets opened this quarter, the second half of this year will feature further Asian and European expansion, most notably Japan in Q3 . Bearing in mind that Netflix wants its international sector to be profitable by 2017, it should be investors' main concern to see how it is progressing on this cost-intensive goal. International revenue up, costs under control According to the shareholders' letter that came with the earnings release, Netflix emphasized that while no new markets opened up, there was "continued improvement" in existing markets, notably Europe and its newest markets in Australia and New Zealand. International revenues came in at $455 million, up 48% year-over-year , and 2.4 million members were added across international markets. More customers also began paying subscription fees, with over 93% of these customers paying for the service, up from 92% in Q1. This is important for Netflix's continued expansion across the world because it shows that existing markets fully accept paying for the product and provides a solid revenue stream to fund nation and region specific projects such as original content that can cater to these markets, especially with programs like House of Cards often preceding Netflix's entry into these markets. As for Netflix's profitability targets, the 2017 target has become more realistic thanks to lighter losses in the international sector. Netflix only suffered a $92 million loss on international revenues last quarter, better than the $101 million loss that was projected when the quarter began. This was supposed to be the toughest quarter for Netflix from a profit perspective, given the capital investments in expanding the market in Australia and preparing for a mainland Asia incursion later this fall. So coming out $10 million better than expected is welcome news, thanks to $5 million more in revenue and about 200,000 more users than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, Q3 expects to see a $77 million loss on $524 million in revenue, which shows confidence in Netflix's incursion into the Japanese market, which would also result in 2.5 million more paying members. While the numbers already seem promising on their own, Netflix's projections seem like an understatement. Although based on survey data and not on official numbers, Australia alone contributed 1.4 million subscribers last quarter, and it was only three months into the service. Both countries have large mobile internet markets, where most of Netflix's Australia customers get the service, and only around one-third of households in each country have pay TV. However, Japan is a much denser, more traditionally tech-hungry market with some of the highest internet speeds in the world. Given Netflix's continued investment in mobile compatibility, and new user interface design put up in June, it will enter the Japanese market more ready than its other markets, with a ripple effect across the domestic and international markets that also have high mobile internet usage rates. As a result, the 2.5 million addition target seems too easy to achieve for Netflix as it enters an incredibly rich market, and the $77 million loss might be smaller to the same degree Q2 losses were better. This can only be good for Netflix, and could result in hitting profitability ahead of schedule. Netflix has staked a lot on its international market, and after a few struggles in its first wave of European expansion, it appears as though the company is not only meeting expectations, it's exceeding them. Better revenues and user additions in the Australian market bodes well for the Japanese expansion, and while Q3 is already expected to have better numbers than Q2, it might once again be an understatement, which makes the now split Netflix shares a very good deal for those looking to get in before Japan goes online and this past quarter becomes just one of many for Netflix and its shareholders.
