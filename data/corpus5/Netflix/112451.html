Should Netflix Add A Free Tier? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has repeatedly insisted that they will not include ads into their service. We suggest that Netflix should consider adding a free tier with ads, similar to Spotify. Online video streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has had significant coverage in recent years, with equal amounts of hope and doubt on either side. We believe that Netflix, though unbelievably successful, could heighten that success by considering an addition to its business model. We believe that Netflix should switch its model toward a dual-tiered model, similar to the model offered by music streaming service Spotify . Netflix should offer a free tier and a premium tier to its users. The free tier would give a user full access to the Netflix library while introducing ads during playback. The premium tier would be the exact same service that current Netflix subscribers receive. We believe that Netflix should adopt such a model for two reasons. First, we believe that the introduction of a Netflix free-tier would transform the video streaming market in Netflix's favor. Currently, Netflix's primary competitors in the streaming market are Hulu and Amazon Prime. Neither of the two services offer free unlimited access to their library. Hulu offers very limited access to their streaming catalog to free users. Amazon Prime's instant video library is only available to Prime subscribers. In a switch to our proposed dual-tiered model, we believe that Netflix would offer the strongest video streaming product at both the free and paid price-points. Furthermore, we believe that the new model would steal free viewers from Hulu's and piracy's market share. Second, and most importantly, we believe that the adoption of a free-tier with ads would grow Netflix's revenues. With the size of Netflix's user base, Netflix would become one of the most in-demand platforms for online advertisers. While there are many different online advertising strategies, we believe Netflix adopting a CPM model (cost per thousand views) is feasible as it is one of the models that YouTube employs . We modeled such a scenario based on subscriber and viewing activity reported by Netflix in their most recent quarter. There are currently over 62 million Netflix subscribers. These are the assumptions we used to model the new business model: 20% of users are paid, 80% of users are free (the ratio of paid to free subscribers for Spotify). Industry average CPM of $25 (chart below). Every 30 minutes there are 4 ads (similar to Hulu, less than TV). Free and subscription users watch the same number of hours of TV/Movies. Based on the previous assumptions, we calculate a total revenue of $1,753,228,000, which is higher than their Q1 FY2015 results of $1,486,140,000. To examine other possible scenarios, we created tables with different assumptions on the free/subscription distribution, hours watched and CPM price. As you can see, even at the low-end of CPM prices, revenue has the potential to beat current Q1 results of $1,486,140,000. The most influential factor for NFLX's management to consider is whether the daily view count would increase enough to make the switch realistic. We believe that the switch would mean a significant increase in viewing activity, especially in international markets. In the war for library content, Netflix is already winning - by a lot. Thus, the additional revenue would only increase their competitive advantage from a consumer standpoint through further content acquisition and more Netflix original titles (Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, etc). We know that Netflix's current business model is strong, but if management is trying to increase their viewer basis by larger numbers, considering a free service would be the best option.
