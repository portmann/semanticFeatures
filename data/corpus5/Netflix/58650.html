Verizon Might Have Hit A Home Run With AOL - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Investors are trying to figure out what VZ sees in AOL. Neither its advertising, media, nor dial up internet fit into what Verizon is currently doing. The big news today is that Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is dishing out $4.4 billion to acquire a company that many believe to be way past its prime, AOL (NYSE: AOL ). While many have speculated about why Verizon would make such a deal, and whether AOL is a good fit, I initially believe that Verizon hit the ball out of the park with this acquisition, and that it'll lead to good things for the company. First and foremost, I describe myself as a long-term, near decade long investor in Verizon turned skeptic . The $130 billion acquisition to take full ownership of Wireless has not drove free cash flow growth the way that many believed it would, mainly because the U.S. wireless price war forced margins lower. Due to the unexpected reality of lower margins in wireless, AOL became an attractive asset. In a mature U.S. wireless space, new revenue channels are very important for Verizon, and it likely found one in AOL. In response to the acquisition, Verizon investors are most optimistic about AOL's digital content publishing and its services business that allows publishers to automate ad sales. The publishing business is a bit of a head-scratcher for Verizon, which might explain the initial rumors that Verizon plans to spinoff assets like Huffington Post . That business saw revenue of $193.4 million during AOL's last quarter with growth of 8% year-over-year. Meanwhile, AOL's advertising technology is very interesting for Verizon, a business that saw revenue growth of 21% during AOL's last quarter. Currently, this segment's quarterly revenue of just $279.8 million is not large enough to move the needle on Verizon's income statement, but if Verizon does have hopes of becoming an advertising company, and one that provides automated advertising options for other companies, then it could become a long-term growth driver. It could become a segment that diversifies Verizon's business and gives it a service that no other telecom can offer its enterprise customers, mainly those who are using Verizon's Digital Media Services to power video and digital content. Also, the Internet of Things is expected to be one of the biggest technology growth drivers of the next five years. We are talking about 26 billion connected things worldwide, all consuming data and running off of wireless networks. Maybe Verizon sees an opportunity to offer automated advertising solutions to developers on its network, smartphone makers, and software developers. AOL's CEO Tim Armstrong sure thinks so, saying that AOL is "as big as it can possibly be in today's landscape." He then added, "if you look forward five years, you're going to be in a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon." This statement certainly seems that IoT is a big reason for Verizon's interest and AOL's willingness to sell. Another likely possibility has to do with advertising on Verizon's upcoming web TV platform. Verizon has not unveiled how it will monetize the service, and with Netflix, Dish, HBO, and the countless other web video platforms charging a monthly fee, it is possible that Verizon will choose to go the advertising route. The move to buy AOL suggests this as highly likely. The key takeaway is that the possibilities are endless for Verizon with this acquisition, as AOL takes Verizon in a direction that we haven't yet seen in telecom. As someone who has followed Verizon for over a decade, this move to buy AOL feels very much like past Verizon moves that didn't make much sense at the time, but paid dividends long-term. For several years when iPhones were first taking over the market, and exclusive to AT&T, investors thought Verizon was crazy for not taking whatever deal Apple offered and to get its products into Verizon stores. Instead, Verizon waited patiently, and helped put Android on the map, focusing all marketing towards Android when AT&T was pushing Apple. Verizon ultimately got Apple but had a solid foundation with Android at the same time. This helped Verizon outperform AT&T for years in subscriber growth. Around the same time investors thought Verizon was equally as crazy when AT&T was expanding its 3G network, miles ahead of Verizon, whereas Verizon chose to invest in this speculative technology called 4G. We all know how that played out, as Verizon continues to boast the nation's largest 4G LTE network, a title it has owned for many years while competitors play catch up and retire inferior 3G networks. For me, the acquisition of an advertising technology, media company with over two million dial-up internet subscribers feels the same as those events in the past. It doesn't quite make sense, there are still a lot of questions. However, if AOL gives Verizon a way to monetize its video services, provide advertising solutions to its Digital Media and IoT customers, and allows it to convert high-margin dial-up internet users to FiOS subscribers then Verizon would have hit a home run with this acquisition. While we can't know for certain how meaningful AOL's business will be for Verizon's long-term growth prospects, the company's history suggests that we should trust its decision, and perhaps believe that advertising will play a crucial role in Verizon's long-term plan. .
