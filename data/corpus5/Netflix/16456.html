Why Investors In Netflix Should Be Cautious - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha In recent years, Netflix has done incredibly well for itself, as both sales and profits have soared due to rising membership. As a result of this jump in sales and profits, the business' shares have also soared and the company's many investors have benefited handsomely. While this is good, investors who plan to hold on to these shares should remain very cautious about the firm's valuation, which appears sky high from an earnings perspective. With shares up 38% from their 52-week low of $299.50, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) can easily be considered one of the darlings of Wall Street. As management has succeeded in growing sales and earnings at double-digit rates on an annualized basis, it's becoming clearer that the company's hold over the movie streaming (with a side of television production, of course) market is almost certain to create an enduring edge over its smaller peers. That being said, however, it's starting to look like shareholders of the company have become a little too enthusiastic about the business' prospects, paying top-dollar for a service provider whose earnings may not justify its current market cap. Over the past five years , revenue growth at Netflix has been tremendous. Between 2010 and 2014, the company's top line shot up 155% (or 20.6% per annum) from $2.16 billion to $5.50 billion. According to the company's most recent annual report, this rise in sales has been driven mostly by an increase in the number of paid subscribers combined with higher revenue per member. During the past three years alone, paid Domestic Streaming members jumped 48% from 25.47 million to 37.70 million, while paid International Streaming members soared 243% from 4.89 million to 16.78 million. In fact, the only segment to see a decline in recent years has been Netflix's Domestic DVD operations, which saw the number of paid members drop almost 30% from 8.05 million members to 5.67 million. NFLX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts Due to the growth in sales, the company saw a meaningful increase in profits as well. Between 2010 and 2014, Netflix's net income jumped 66% from $160.85 million to $266.80 million. Even as customer count grew, the business' net income could not keep up with sales due to two reasons; Domestic DVD operations and large growth internationally. Surprisingly, Netflix's highest margin segment is actually its Domestic DVD segment, which reported a contribution margin of 48% in 2014 compared to the 27% contribution margin of the business' Domestic Streaming segment. Meanwhile, its International Streaming segment's results were even worse, with a contribution margin of -12% for the year. Though this represents an improvement over the -38.5% margin seen a year earlier, it's important to note that the segment's poor performance has been driven by a combination of a high cost of revenue in relation to sales and a strong emphasis on marketing by management. Despite strong growth, a big concern remains Absent some corporate catastrophe, it's almost certain that Netflix will continue to dominate the movie streaming market. That being said, however, it seems as though investors might have gotten carried away with how much value this will create for the company in the long run, a classic mistake made by growth-oriented investors. You see, using its most recent year's profits, shares of Netflix are trading pretty high with a P/E of 96. This means that, if earnings don't grow moving forward, it would take investors 96 years to make their money back on Netflix. Certainly, this kind of scenario is extremely unlikely, but it goes to illustrate how much investors are paying for growth. Put another way, if Netflix continues to grow its earnings at the 10.65% per annum it has over the past five years, it would take investors over 23 years to make their money back. That's an awfully long time to wait. With free cash flow in the red over the past two years, it's difficult to make a reasonable argument for valuing the company on a cash flow basis so the only other way (and an inefficient one at that since the business is a service-oriented one) to value the company is through its book value. Using this method, we also arrive at a pretty hefty valuation, with the market placing a worth on Netflix equal to 13.9 times the value of its assets less liabilities. This is incredibly high but isn't unreasonable for a service-oriented company like Netflix that is experiencing strong growth and which happens to have a pretty attractive economic moat. Moving forward, it's almost certain that Netflix will continue to thrive and investors who hold its stock for the next 20 years will probably be happy. That being said, the near-term and medium-term risk for shareholders is that the business' shares might be tremendously overvalued. As a value investor who likes to buy companies on the cheap for the long run, this isn't my kind of holding but for long-term growth investors who don't mind significant upswings and downswings, it may not be a bad prospect.
