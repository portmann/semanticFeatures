Netflix Stock Poised For A Major Move - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Seasonal factors are not in favor of Netflix stock. Insiders have sold more shares during the past year than any other year during past 10 years. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is expected to report earnings after the market closes on Monday 7/18/206, with analysts' average earnings estimates of 2 cents per share and revenue estimates of $2.11 billion. Netflix shares are down 14% year-to-date from $114.38 on 12/31/2015 to $98.39 as of 7/15/2016. With multiple divergent signals, Netflix shares are poised for a major move following earnings release. During the past year, Netflix insiders have sold more shares than any other time during the past 10 years. As per below chart, insider net sales totaled 1.742 million shares between Q3 2015 and Q2 2016, for a total value of $183 million and an average price of $105.05 per share.

Sizable net selling continued by insiders during the past three quarters as well. Although some may argue that insider net selling during the past year does not necessarily indicate that Netflix shares are headed lower, we do believe that it is a cautionary bearish signal. Netflix and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) recently announced on July 5 that Comcast will let customers get Netflix on its X1 platform set-top box. Such access is expected to be effective later this year. Despite an associated cost that Netflix would incur, Netflix stands to gain additional customers and revenues; Comcast is estimated to have about 23.76 million high-speed internet subscribers as of Q1 2016, out of a total of about 56.3 million in the U.S.A. Meanwhile, as of May, it is estimated that about 35% of Comcast's video subscribers have the X1 platform, with expectations for such number to grow to about 50% by late summer. On a net basis, such a development is a positive for two important reasons. First, it provides Netflix an opportunity to reinvigorate its slowing U.S. subscriber growth. Second, a truce between Comcast and Netflix will enable Netflix to free-up resources it has allocated to fighting Comcast for numerous years in the past. Netflix announced several months ago that it would be increasing its high definition streaming plan subscription price to $9.99 from $7.99 per month. As the company is implementing such price increase on a rolling basis, and has actually delayed such increase to some customers, related additional revenues from consenting customers will not be fully reflected in Netflix's earnings for Q2 2016. On the negative side, Netflix would be expected to lose some of its subscribers due to the price hike, although the company seems to be downplaying any noticeable increase in its churn rate as CEO Hastings stated in a January letter: The price hike is expected to affect 17 million subscribers, about 37% of Netflix's U.S. subscribers. UBS estimates that between 3% and 4% of affected subscribers will cancel, while a J.P. Morgan survey revealed that 15% said they would cancel (although some may not actually follow up by doing so). Netflix pricing structure - Source: Business Insider Netflix added on a net basis 6.74 million subscribers in the first quarter of this year, although it is expecting to add 2.5 million subscribers globally during the second quarter. For the U.S., net subscriber additions are expected to be about 500,000 in Q2 2016, vs. 2.23 million in the Q1 2016, primarily driven by the expected price hike churn. Netflix currently has about 47 million U.S. subscribers and about 34 million international subscribers. Although the price hike could be a negative factor in case it results in a higher churn rate than desired, reduced subscriber growth expectations provide a lower hurdle to beat. The upcoming summer Olympics in Rio could slow subscriber growth for Netflix as audiences turn their attention to the Olympics. In 2012, it is estimated that the summer Olympics dragged down Netflix usage traffic by about 25%. Taking such factor into consideration, Cowen recently reduced its price target on Netflix to 130 from 135. In addition, Comcast's plans to individualize and personalize the Olympics viewing experience through its X1 platform could tilt the balance back away from cable alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu. When examining Netflix stock during the past five years, between July 15 and October 31, Netflix shares dropped by an average of about 10.6%. Netflix shares dropped in 2011, 2012 and 2014, but increased in 2013 and 2015 as per below table.

It is also noteworthy that Netflix shares dropped by 4.47% between July and October during the 2012 Olympics year, as well as 10.61% in the 2008 Olympics year. Netflix currently has a market capitalization of about $42 billion. With average analysts' earnings estimates of $0.27 per share for this year, and $1.04/share for next year, Netflix boasts forward P/E ratios of 364.4 and 94.6 respectively. Meanwhile, Netflix P/E ratio ttm is 341.07 . Although Netflix mean ttm P/E ratio for the past 13 years is 45.06, it has ranged as high as 629.53 and as low as 14.5. By any standard, Netflix's valuation is quite high; but as we have seen previously, that does not mean that such valuation cannot possibly go higher... There are several divergent signals for Netflix. On the positive side, the Comcast deal could provide a boost to stagnating subscriber growth for later in the year, while higher subscription fees will increase revenues per subscriber. In addition, reduced subscriber growth expectations for the U.S. does provide a lower hurdle to overcome. On the negative side, increased subscriber churn related to the price hike presents an unknown risk. In addition, seasonal factors related to the Olympics and the seasonal period between July 15 and October 31 also present some challenges. Most importantly, insiders have sold more shares during the past year than during any other period during the past 10 years. Finally, Netflix shares continue to have very high valuations, and hence any doubt on potential future growth could cause a substantial drop in share prices From a longer term perspective, Netflix's Hastings still expects to exceed 100 million subscribers in 2017. However, the U.S. market is very well saturated, while Netflix is counting primarily on international growth. In such regard, as we have written about in other recent articles, we believe that macro headwinds related to Brexit and strong dollar will challenge most companies counting on international growth in the near future. Given such divergent signals, and Netflix's high valuations, we would favor establishing an options position on Netflix, such as purchasing puts expiring September 16, with 90 strike, currently trading at a premium of $3.28, as well as calls with a strike of 100, currently trading at a premium of about $6.24, with a ratio of 2 puts for every one call. Although volatility seems expensive for Netflix, we do believe that the divergent signals will provide opportunity for substantial moves in its share price following earnings release this afternoon and the next several weeks. Break-even would be 113 to the upside and about 83.5 to the downside. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
