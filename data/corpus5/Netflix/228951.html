Thanks, Jennifer, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. In January we announced a strategic plan designed to ensure DreamWorks Animation was in the best possible position to succeed over the long term, not only from a creative standpoint, but also in terms of the company's overall financial performance. On the creative side, we appointed new leadership in our feature animation business and committed to a series of changes in our creative process including resizing the business to focus our talent and resources on producing two feature films per year instead of three. Nine months later, we're seeing higher levels of creativity, collaboration, team work, and cost efficiencies. While there is still much to do, I am proud of the work our team have done in what has been a challenging transitional year. That said, our strong third quarter results highlight the earnings potential of our company, when all of our businesses are delivering meaningful segment gross profit and reflect the progress I believe we've made towards the goals we laid out at the outset of this year. I'd like to walk you through a few of the key highlights of the past quarter. Let me begin with our Feature Film segment where the highlight of the quarter was Home's strong performance in the home entertainment market, particularly across digital platforms. In fact Home has sold the highest number of digital sell-through transactions worldwide of any DWA title. It is also the second highest selling family film in the domestic home entertainment market released to date this year. New catalog deals and extensions of our current catalog deals also contributed favorably to revenue growth in the quarter. Looking ahead to our 2016 feature film slate, Kung Fu Panda 3 will be released on January 29, both domestically and here in China. Early previews have been successful and well received by audiences. And while we are excited to bring the third installment of Po's story to his many fans around the world, I do want to highlight that we have a non-traditional release window for an animated film in the U.S. market and currency headwinds from a strong dollar will continue to weigh on international performance. Next up is Trolls, a musical comedy which will be released on November 4 and, as we've recently announced, the movie has an outstanding voice cast led by Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. Turning now to our Television segment where Common Sense Media recently named our original series Dragons: Race to the Edge and Dinotrux among the best shows on TV for families with kids ages 2 to 17 years. This distinction continues to highlight the high quality of our television programming and strength of our brand. Turning next to Consumer Products where several initiatives around location-based entertainment continue to reinforce the strength and value of our brands globally, this quarter we extended the terms of our license with regional theme parks, Beto Carrero World in Brazil and Dreamworld in Australia. In addition we signed a new license agreement with Merlin's [sic] (Merlin) Entertainment German theme park, Heide Park, for the use of promotion of our How To Train Your Dragon franchise in a new themed zone. In addition, we've capitalized on the launch of our hit television series Dinotrux on Netflix, with two exclusive launch partners, Gymboree for apparel and Toys"R"Us for the toy line, who named Mega Chompin' Ty Rux as one of the must-have toys on their 2015 Holiday Hot Toy List. Finally, in our New Media segment, the team at AwesomenessTV continues its success in producing and monetizing quality program across multiple delivery platforms, screens, and mediums. The ATV team is off to a solid start delivering content for Verizon's go90. Only 20 days into the platform's launch and without any advertising and promotional activity around the go90 product, Verizon highlighted ATV's Top Five Live and Betch as two exclusive pieces of content that are gaining early traction with millennials and generating encouraging revisits to their platform. AwesomenessTV recently announced deal with DHX, a component which takes premium short-form content built for digital and repackages the programming format for linear TV, has also experienced early success, debuting number one with teens in its time slot as part of DHX rebrand of the Family Channel. ATV's owned and operated channels also continues to show solid growth third quarter, with viewing up nearly 70% year-over-year. And the DreamWorksTV channel on YouTube continues to demonstrate impressive momentum, growing to nearly 1 million subscribers with over 500 million views. On the Awesomeness Film side both Smosh the movie and Janoskians continues to perform on EST with Netflix picking up Smosh in the pay TV window. Up next for the Awesomeness Film division is the Snervous Tyler Oakley which will be released on December 11. Finally, AwesomenessTV and Endemol Shine Group recently announced a strategic alliance building on the strength of the Awesomeness brand internationally and allowing them to extend their reach in key markets including the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Brazil. Today, more than half of the viewers on ATV's networks are international. This deal enables us to efficiently leverage existing ATV formats and the creation of local language in culturally relevant versions with a goal of launching new talent and content with strong advertising appeal that can be distributed across digital and TV platforms around the world. So in summary, we had a strong quarter. We're looking forward to the release of Kung Fu Panda 3 and Trolls in 2016. We also expect to continue diversifying our revenue mix by executing on our plans and other expansion opportunities in the TV segment, substantially growing both the audience and revenues in our New Media business and leverage the DreamWorks brand to create new entertainment experiences for families around the world. Thanks Jeffery. For the third quarter of 2015, DreamWorks Animation reported revenue of $259 million, adjusted operating income of $26.8 million and adjusted net income of $1.4 million or $0.02 per share. As explained in our earnings release, the adjusted third quarter results exclude the impact of a $3.6 million pre-tax charge related to the company's previously announced restructuring plan. Moving now to the segment highlights. Let me begin with our Feature Film segment where third quarter revenues increased 11% to $158 million and segment gross profit was $54 million. The performance was primarily driven by worldwide home entertainment sales of Home which converted better that we had expected. Worldwide pay TV distribution of the Penguins of Madagascar and international pay TV distribution How To Train Your Dragon 2 also aided the quarter. Library revenues were also favorably impacted by greater contributions from worldwide television distribution of The Croods and Turbo, relative to the performance of titles released within the comparable TV window last year. Feature Film segment cost of revenues increased 33% to $104 million in the quarter, largely because the prior year period benefited from the success of Dragons 2, which has a lower amortization rate than Home and Penguins. That said based on Home's favorable performance in both the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment markets as well as benefits from several new and extended catalog deals, we now expect full year 2015 revenue for the Feature Film segment to increase in the mid-single digit percent range exceeding our previous guidance. Turning now to our Television segment where revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $51 million and segment gross profit increased to $15 million with margin expanding to 30%. These results were primarily driven by a greater number of episode deliveries relative to the prior year period, partially offset by upfront marketing costs associated with the launch of our first original Netflix series Dinotrux as well as the he Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show. With this performance, we remain on track to meet our previously stated full year 2015 guidance for the TV segment. The Consumer Products segment revenues more than doubled to $27 million with the segment gross profit increasing to $16 million in the quarter. These results were primarily driven by various location based initiatives including new and extended license arrangements which have lower associated costs. As we previously stated, the strengthened dollar place challenges on international developers in DreamPlace. That said DreamPlace continues to be a valuable asset for us and we are looking forward to the launch of several additional new locations in the U.S. and the UK in time for the holiday season. While some of the locations have yet to launch their reservation sites, early results are very encouraging, and in some cases various dates are already sold out. A high percentage of the reservations are from repeat guests and many of these guests have been active in social media helping to generate new reservations. Additionally, we've received positive early feedback on the average family size of the reservations and the packages purchased. And given the outstanding consumer experience and the wealth of consumer insight that comes with it, we're even more excited about the many new innovative ways the asset can create unique and differentiated consumer experiences in 2016 and beyond. It's also worth highlighting the Consumer Products segment full year 2015 revenues are tracking slightly ahead of the revised guidance we provided on our Q2 earnings call. Turning now to the New Media segment where third quarter revenues of $21 million more than tripled in comparison to Q3 2014 adjusted revenues and segment gross profit was more than four times higher at $11 million, the increases were primarily driven by higher revenue contributions from new licensing arrangements, delivery of new content, distribution of content on electronic sell-through, as well as from brand sponsorship arrangements. Moving now to the remainder of the income statement, excluding the impact of the restructuring plan, G&A expenses for the quarter were $70 million. The increase was more than explained by performance-based incentive compensation expense for 2015 that was recorded in the quarter. In addition, we saw an increase at AwesomenessTV in support of the growth and expansion of the business, which was offset by savings associated with our 2015 restructuring plan. Also in the quarter, impacting the other expense net line on the P&L, we recorded a non-cash charge of $6 million related to certain investments that are no longer deemed to be recoverable. Turning to taxes, as I mentioned earlier this year, with a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, the company's combined effective tax rate will be largely equivalent to our cash tax liability and includes amounts payable to the former stockholder. Now our cash liability is a function of many factors, including changes in our expected taxable income for the year, which may be different from reported earnings. Just one example of this that I shared last time was the gain associated with the sale of our campus, which is recognized as taxable income in the year but deferred for reported earnings. To the extent the changes in expected taxable income allow us to benefit from the tax sharing agreement, a portion of that benefit is payable to the former stockholder. As a result of these factors, our reported cash tax liability and therefore our combined effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter maybe both volatile and look unusual. During the quarter, our provision for income taxes was $2.5 million or an effective tax rate of 20.3%. However, when combined with a $13.8-million increase in income tax benefit payable to former stockholder, it results in a combined effective tax rate of 133.1% for the quarter and negative 38.6% year-to-date, which is in the area of where we currently expect the combined effective tax rate to be for the full year. Moving happily now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $450 million of total available liquidity, including $360 million of availability under the credit facility and $89 million of cash on the balance sheet. Adding it all up, it's clear that we're entering the fourth quarter with good momentum and many opportunities ahead of us. We also have a sizable number of content deliveries to carry out over the next two months. While we continue to execute on all of our distribution deals, it's important to remember that the timing of various deliveries influences whether or not we recognize revenue in 2015 or subsequent periods. For all of these reasons and then some, it's particularly difficult to be precise with guidance. But at the beginning of the year, we made an exception with the decision to provide several milestones around how to assess the company's 2015 performance because it is a transitional year for us. So in keeping with that commitment and based on our performance through the first nine months of the year, we now expect our full year adjusted operating income and cash flow to exceed our initial guidance of breakeven and to exceed $30 million. Thanks, Fazal. Before moving on to Q&A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance other than the representatives of DreamWorks Animation. Great. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So one for Jeffrey; one for Fazal. Jeffrey, we're seeing a lot of the major media companies now really talking about not renewing their license deals with SVOD - and really Netflix more in particular in order to sort of support the ratings and the ad ecosystem which they're all sort of tied to. Obviously, DreamWorks doesn't have that problem. So are you seeing any kind of incremental opportunities, either with Netflix or any of the other OTT services to actually increase the output of originals you're doing beyond the sort of current framework? Yeah. I mean, we, as you know, have had a very long and a very, very great partnership with Netflix. It began with our feature output deal a number of years ago and then moved onto the television side. They have been an incredible partner to us and we value it in an incredible way. And we are constantly in conversations with them about things that we can incrementally do together, both in the near-term and in the long-term. And being that we are in a unique position of being able to deliver high quality branded family entertainment in the first window, it does really position us uniquely and very, very favorably in the growing SVOD market. So the answer, again, is yes. Great. And then Fazal, one for you. In the press release, I think you sort of noted that the TV segment was benefiting from a favorable amortization schedule. Is this new or has this been the case all throughout 2015? Great. Two quick questions, one on the TV side, I was hoping if you could just discuss the upfront marketing expenses within that TV unit? Maybe just the materiality of that line item and just maybe what the outlook from there looks like? And then just secondly on the CP side, I was just hoping maybe you could compare and contrast the opportunity for CP for your next two feature films, Panda and Trolls. So just maybe how you are differentiating that approach for those two different films? Okay. Thanks, James. I'll take the TV bit upfront. I don't want to get into specifics on the marketing spend, but I think we've said before with the launch of several new series, it made sense for us to deploy some capital towards ensuring a strong launch, particularly to the extent they have CP associated with them. So it's kind of an aligned interest for us and the distributor to make sure the series launches well. So we evaluate it series by series and we saw an opportunity to be more efficient with the dollars we deploy this round. Sure. I think in terms of Kung Fu Panda 3, there will be a modest program. Panda has never been an exceptional property in terms of CP. We do have a very aggressive program here in China, so I think that's the one place where we have expectations for something that is meaningfully incremental from what we've seen in the past. The biggest opportunity for us in the CP feature area is with Trolls, which will be coming in the fourth quarter of 2016. And we are well along on mounting what will be the biggest, deepest, broadest consumer products plan around a property of DreamWorks ever. And we will share more detail with you as we get closer and we start to be in a position where we can maybe size that better. But we have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm across the board from all the major retail partners around the world. As you know, you really need to be working a good year in advance. And so we do have a pretty good insight into the level of enthusiasm from our retail partners, and it's very, very high, and they're very excited about it. So are we. Great, thank you. I have one for Jeffrey and a couple quick ones for Fazal, if I can. Jeffrey, going back to TV, I wanted to ask a little about your longer-term ambitions there. When you initially did the deal with Netflix, I think we were skeptical about your ability to just produce that volume of content and maintain high standards of quality. And at this point, you're well on your way. It seems like the operational risk is lower now. So looking forward, do you have ambitions to expand that further? And it sounds like the relationship with Netflix is strong. Do you think there's demand out there either from Netflix or other parties if you do want to expand? Well, again the answer on all of those fronts is a very strong yes. I think there are no real operational hurdles on the delivery side of this. I think we have not only successfully scaled the enterprise to deliver the volume of content, but frankly more importantly than that is... is that we have done it with a quality and a consistency that has just been first rate. And obviously what matters most of all is what does our buyer or customer - in this case Netflix - feel about the programming. And I think they have been very, very pleased with the quality of what we've been able to deliver to them, and certainly we have met all of our schedules for delivery. Beyond that, as I said a moment ago, we see a greater opportunity first and foremost with our partners at Netflix. We continue to have conversations with them about new opportunities, and we do think that television is going to continue to be a meaningful expansion place for us and our business in the coming months and years - meaningful. And hopefully we'll have more to share with you over the next couple of quarters. Okay, great. Thank you. And then a couple for Fazal - on the New Media segment, was there any revenue that was recognized from go90 in the quarter? And how should we think about how you'll recognize revenue for that? And then to squeeze the last one in, on FX, you mentioned that as a potential headwind. Can you help us quantify at all maybe looking back at historical films and international box what kind of pressure you might have seen, given current rates? Thank you. Sure. On the New Media side, Ryan, yeah, there was some recognition for go90. They're going to recognize based on deliveries, just like we do. So as we said, that deal with Verizon, it's a significant amount of content - 175-plus hours on a multiyear deal. And there's been a ramp-up time leading to this part of the year. So now they're continually delivering, and as they deliver they'll recognize the revenue. And are those deliveries pretty lumpy or are they - with that much content, I would guess you'd be delivering kind of on a pretty constant basis. Yeah, it's not going to be - probably not going to be too lumpy, unless for whatever reason at some point, Verizon decides that they want certain content in tranches, which they may or may not choose. But I'm not aware of them doing that at this stage. So as they deliver - and this stuff has to be QC'd and then loaded up to go90. So as that happens, they'll recognize it. I'm not anticipating it being lumpy at this stage, but I guess that could change later on if they change the way in which they want to ingest the content. On the FX side, it's difficult to say, Ryan, because every film performs differently in different markets. And then each market has its own currency issues relative to the dollar and then settlement rates also vary market by market. So it's a bit difficult to say. I think we've said publicly looking back at the past few years, our feature films have been about - it's been about 60% of the revenue from our feature films coming from international markets. But again it's going to vary title-by-title based on its individual international performance in individual markets internationally. And we will go to our final question which will be from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the momentum on the TV side as we go into 2016. I know you guys have guided for this year. You have been lost to kind of go too far into next year, but it seems like there's an opportunity for more deliveries under the current kind of deal with Netflix and then renewals. And so your thoughts about how you feel about the momentum into next year? And also just remind us what the concentration is in that line from Netflix versus other sources that you could be selling to? Yeah. So I'll give it sort of contextually, Barton, the way I have before, I think, when we've spoken is or with others. So we're comfortable with the guidance for the segment now, which is the $200 million to $250 million in revenue. And I've said before, a disproportionate amount of that is Netflix-related. The Netflix content we've seen or that's behind that this year is obviously a significant increase to the prior year. And then heading into 2016, we actually expected to increase materially further. And nothing has changed in that regard at this stage. And we do have time for one more question and that will come from the line of Eric Wold with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Thank you. A couple of questions on home video and then one on G&A. You noted that Home has had the strongest digital download results of any film in your history. Is this anything different from just the strength of that film in general and the general shift from physical to digital? Or is this represent a different strategy on your part to drive this part of the business and how we should be thinking about that impact on margins going forward? This is Ann. I think it's a combination of things. I think there is a marketplace momentum as people become more familiar with the idea of consuming content digitally, particularly transactional content digitally. In this particular case, there was a specific release strategy that we think also helped the increase in the digital sales as a percentage of the whole which, again, the digital release is in advance of the physical release. And we're seeing that that is giving more focus to the idea of consuming this content digitally. And we're seeing, we think, a positive result because of that strategy. Thanks. And then just a second one on the home video, I know on the last call, you talked about kind of a promotional strategy to ramp home video sales of Penguins towards the end of the year. There's only about a 100,000 unit difference between Q2 and Q3. Was that more of a Q4 strategy into the holiday? Yeah. We definitely got promotional strategies around Penguins heading into the holidays and in particular Black Friday, so some of that to come. Okay. And then lastly, if I may, for Fazal. On G&A, $70 million in the quarter, excluding restructuring, just remind us where we are in terms of what needs to come out of that going forward, what can't come out of that, and what's the right level to think about going forward post-restructuring? Sure, Eric. So the $70 million excluding restructuring, keep in mind that also includes about a $15 million incentive comp charge, as I mentioned, that we took in the quarter. So I think for - when you're thinking about sort of run rate purposes looking ahead, you should be thinking in sort of the $60 million to $70 million range. Excluding restructuring, I think that's probably a good place to be.
