Groupon Might Finally Be Ready To Break Out - Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) | Seeking Alpha GRPN followed a similar path to NFLX and AAPL during periods of stock turmoil. To reverse GRPN's negative sentiment, it needs a catalyst, or two, something that investors can embrace. Investors have found it very difficult to look past the declined gross margin that comes with Groupon's (NASDAQ: GRPN ) shift to e-commerce. I wrote about this recently when I compared Groupon to the mind-boggling stock losses that Apple and Netflix saw in the past, a common effect when company's undergo major changes. As I then suggested, Groupon would need a significant catalyst to reverse its trend, that or continue to produce fast-growth in its high margin Travel business (which has not happened ). With that said, Groupon might have done just that. What Groupon did was two things : It promoted North American Chief Rich Williams to COO and increased the size of its buyback program by $200 million to a total of $500 million. Why are these things significant? The promotion of Williams means that he will oversee all operations, not just North America. North America is by far Groupon's largest region, accounting for roughly 60% of total billings. Yet, North American billings during Groupon's last quarter rose 14%, that was far better than both Europe and Groupon's Rest of World business. Williams can now take the practices that have allowed North America to thrive into other parts of the world, which could very well spark billings and revenue growth. Clearly, that's something to be excited about. Next, a $500 million buyback program might not seem like a lot, but it is good for 10% of the company's outstanding shares right now. Not only will that push Groupon's EPS higher, but ironically (since I compared Groupon's stock turmoil to Apple), it gives Groupon's stock the opportunity to have the same effect as buybacks did for Apple over the last two years. As seen above, Apple has bought back approximately 9.4% of its outstanding shares over the last two years. By doing so, and by buying back when the stock was low, Apple's stock has outperformed its market capitalization gains by 25%. In other words, Apple essentially gave investors an additional 25% of stock gains by being so aggressive, and consistent with stock buybacks. Now, I am not suggesting that Groupon's stock will more than double over the next two years. In order to do so, a lot of things have to go right. For Apple, it not only bought back stock but proved to investors that iPhone sales growth was sustainable, margin pressure was manageable, and that it could continue to innovate minus Steve Jobs. Groupon is putting itself in a situation to prove similar concepts. If Groupon can continue to grow its e-commerce business, remain competitive in online travel, and if Williams can make Europe and the Rest of World match North America's growth, the Groupon's stock could very well double. In essence, Groupon's stock has declined more than 75% since its IPO, this despite consistently producing top-line growth. As a result, there is no doubt that Groupon's stock is oversold. The big question is whether Groupon can capitalize on the stock boost that buybacks will create? Personally, I think so, but it's just a hunch. At the very least, Groupon's buybacks will slow the decline in the stock, maybe even causing it to level out. Given this fact, Groupon looks like a good, but speculative stock to own, one with upside that far exceeds the downside.
