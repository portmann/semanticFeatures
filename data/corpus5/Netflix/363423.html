Netflix to ease into price hikes for older customers - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Apr  8 2016, 11:11 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Netflix customers ( NFLX -0.2%) grandfathered into the company's $7.99 per month plan will see their rate jump to $9.99 in May if they want more than one device supported, reports Quartz. JPMorgan thinks the pricing increase will be implemented slowly to limit subscriber loss. UBS predicts the percentage of Netflix customers that end their subscription due to the extra dollars will only be 3% or 4% - a mark that indicates Netflix will come out way ahead from the change. It's a smart idea to do it slowly, bleed the subscriber losses out over a couple quarterly reports.  Honestly, Nflx's biggest draw is that it's cheap, if that changes it could be over. Completely agree, as a subscriber for 3 years the low original price that enticed me is what would keep me. I cut my cable cord.   So if it goes to $20 for 4 screens I am still way ahead.   I think folks realize prices have to go up I disagree. I too have cut the cord, but there is a limit for the value of the service. Would you pay more for your current cell phone service? I bet not. If you want me to pay more I expect more, it's the American way! Honestly I've been a Netflix bull, having been a early user of their service I would say that if the price goes over 9.99 I will drop the service and use Amazon prime exclusively. The Netflix service is something I could live without. There are many other cheaper options, unlike when Netflix first came into existence I would not have been able to live without it.
