Netflix Virtuous Cycle Is Intact, But Stock Is Fully Valued - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The Virtuous Cycle remains intact, with laudable subscriber growth but somewhat deteriorating average revenue per international user. Content costs seem well under control of management, defying so many prognosticators. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is up 70% since I wrote an article in January calling for 55% upside. I never expected Netflix to rise so fast, so soon, but now that it has, it is important to revisit the thesis and see what has materially changed and determine if Netflix remains a buy. Despite claims by some contributors alleging that Netflix' "virtuous cycle" has broken down, the numbers simply state the opposite. For a quick refresher, CEO Reed Hastings popularized the concept of the virtuous cycle when streaming was still in its infancy in 2011. Hastings' summed it up as, "It's a virtuous cycle. We get more customers, we get more money, we can afford more content, we get more customers." Taken in number form, the concept of a virtuous cycle should be evident and not subject to so much contention. Netflix reported 62.3M global subscribers as of the end of Q1. In the next three months they estimate that they will tack on another 2.5M. Domestic Q2 YoY growth runs at 16% and international is at 65%. Total subscriber growth is expected to grow at 29.4% this quarter. Australia and New Zealand launched at the end of March (8M Broadband households), and Japan launches later this year ( 40M Broadband households ). By the end of 2016, Netflix still plans on being live (with differing content breadth) in over 200 countries. Subscriber growth via international expansion, at least in the near term, has shown no signs of significant slowing. As the base of subscribers grows, the comparative growth numbers will of course abate, but the absolute gains remain strong, with noticeable "higher highs and higher lows" of subs added each quarter: Netflix revenue numbers came in strong again this past quarter, with 24% YoY gains and 22% projected gains for the current quarter. Since Q3 2010, when streaming was first launched, global revenue has increased at a CAGR of 25.2%: Revenue growth has generally slightly lagged subscriber growth, which is a result of incremental subscribers coming from less lucrative countries. This is evidenced further by the recent drop in average revenue per user: Keep in mind these revenues are quarterly revenues, not monthly, so the average revenue shown is actually 3x what the consumer pays per month. US DVD and streaming subscribers are trending up, as they continue to pay more for their services each month. This trend will continue as "grandfathered" $7.99/mo plans lapse and make up less of the revenue mix, multi-stream plans gain more adoption, and 4k streaming--which Netflix seems intent on pioneering--becomes a more popular upsell. One "fly in the ointment" of the Netflix growth story and international expansion is the recent drop in average revenue per international subscriber. Initially, I thought this was due to a greater impact of trial non-paying accounts. However, when I studied further, the percentage of paying international users compared to total international users is actually seeing a noticeable uptrend: So, if the share of non-trial (paying) users is growing, but ARPU is falling, then this leads to only one reasonable conclusion: incremental international users are less lucrative. In other words, the "low-hanging fruit" of developed, wealthy, connected nations is being replaced by "higher-hanging fruit" of less-connected and (relatively) poorer nations. Now, this was largely expected, but I did not anticipate a perceptible effect this soon in global expansion. This is one risk that needs to be monitored: will Netflix have the pricing power to eventually bring International ARPU to Domestic ARPU levels? Only time will tell. It will come to nobody's surprise that Netflix' content slate has expanded tremendously over the past several years. Anecdotally, we can see this by the number of Emmy nominations and wins in 2013 (14 & 3) compared to 2014 (31 & 7) as well as quick look at a list of Netflix original programming . Netflix is certainly stepping up its originals game, but also its licensed content, as shown by its content lease obligations: Netflix "off-balance sheet" obligations is bumping up against the $10B figure. This statistic, and the fact that these future lease obligations sit off-the balance sheet, is oft-spun by Netflix bears as the reason why Netflix is doomed. "Out of control content costs" is the common refrain. But, are these costs really out of control? Taken in isolation, a future lease obligation approaching $10B seems daunting, but when you take this figure and allocate it across Netflix' ever-broadening streaming subscriber base, as I've done, suddenly it doesn't seem bad at all. In fact, it seems downright manageable. When streaming was first launched as a standalone in 2011, Netflix had lease obligations approaching $200 per subscriber. Now, that number is $157 - and on an undeniably downward trajectory. This can be taken in several ways, but my interpretation is as follows: Netflix has more information and, therefore, more negotiating power. Netflix has devised a way to entice content owners into selling their legacy brands on a global platform, and Netflix (and Netflix alone) knows the true value of that content. This is why Netflix' tremendous strength of data analytics and knowledge viewer tastes, habits, and interface makes for a Canyon-esque moat. Netflix popularized the use of the "contribution margin" metric, which is akin to operating margin, but ignores G&A and R&D (but does take into account marketing costs). Netflix contribution margin has slowly improved over the years: Contribution margin is a reasonable tool to gauge Netflix' success, but it is imperfect. The near-term and significant marketing costs associated with international expansion muddies the contribution picture, making international seem like a failure. I believe there is a better means to determine how Netflix is performing. The entire concept of the Netflix virtuous cycle (which is the lynchpin for overall success) can be summed up in one single graphic. I like to call it the "Spread" chart. This chart shows the average revenue per user (ARPU) for each streaming segment, as well as the amortized cost of content per user for each segment (I call this content amortization cost, or CAC). The amortized cost of content is the amount of content (original and licensed) that is "used up" each quarter. Think of content as Netflix raw material; each quarter Netflix amortizes the amount of content that can no longer be streamed tomorrow. If you allocate that amortization figure amongst the pool of subscribers, you obtain the true periodic per-subscriber content cost. Netflix will be successful if the spread between ARPU and CAC widens. I prefer this method of measuring success because it looks at revenue and content, ignoring SG&A, R&D, wages, taxes, and so many other variables. It also ignores huge near-term cash outlays for original content that will be viewed for many years to come. In essence, it shows whether Netflix' core business model is viable. As you can see, the domestic segment is doing phenomenally, with ARPU growing and content acquisition cost falling. This past quarter, the spread between the two hit an all-time high, $8.57. This means that Netflix had $8.57 per user to pay for everything except content, as well as whatever net profit was left over. This bigger this spread gets, the more money Netflix has for profits. International is a different story. The good news is that content costs per subscriber has continued to fall and sits an all-time low, however, the revenue per international subscriber has fallen even more over the past year--meaning the spread has tightened (to $4.69 per sub from a high of $5.89 per sub six months ago). This means that for every international subscriber, Netflix has $4.69 to spend on everything except content. It is discouraging that this number is falling. On the plus side, I'm not concerned with the cost of international content. On the negative side, I am concerned with how much foreigners are willing to pay for the service. I'm confident that this is partly a short-term issue associated with new members only being revenue-producing for parts of the quarter. However, I'm also confident that resuming positive growth for international ARPU will be a long and difficult task. Netflix will have to establish a tremendous slate of global content before it can safely initiate price increases, lest it have another price-increase backlash circa-July 2011 where U.S. streaming growth temporarily halted--a circumstance Netflix could ill-afford in the middle of its global push. Several things have changed for the positive since I gave a $500 price target back in my January article . Subscribers, of course, surprised to the upside by almost 900k. Guidance for global subscriber growth increased slightly. And, perhaps most importantly, Netflix demonstrated that it can achieve contribution margins above 30%. Reed Hastings is now targeting a 40% domestic contribution margin in 2020--this gave some additional upside to my model. However, I did have to temper my expectations for international ARPU. This is trending in the wrong direction and, while it is likely to reverse, there are a lot of unknowns surrounding what value other countries will place on the service. I assign a fair value to Netflix of $565 using discounted owner earnings at a 10% discount rate and 3% terminal growth. Two possible green flags that may emerge in the coming quarters is that the terminal phase of international growth will likely come later than 2022 - as I've modeled. Additionally, 3% ARPU growth in international markets may turn out to be conservative given how young many markets are. Netflix is still a great company and long-term buy. Over the next ten years, I believe Netflix could be a ten-bagger . However, in the next 12-18 months, and until Netflix can establish growth in international ARPU, Netflix is a hold.
