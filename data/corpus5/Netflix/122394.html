Netflix: An Apology - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha In the face of NFLX's meteoric stock rise, I apologize for criticizing an article that predicted such price behavior. Nonetheless, NFLX's rise has more to do with multiple expansion than growing into its valuation. Indeed most market sectors have experienced such multiple expansion. In June 2014 I took exception to overly bullish analysts' appraisals of tech stocks, choosing as my foil an article written by Alex Cho on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). I purposely left out Alex's name from my article, since I was just using his article as one example of many, but given how the stock has performed since then, I think I owe him this public apology. While his ultimate NFLX target market cap of $157.5B hasn't (yet?) been reached, he was certainly right about the stock's direction while I was completely wrong. That said, and without diminishing the apology, I have to say that in re-reading both articles, I'm still of my original opinion (though I've been stopped out of my NFLX short, to focus on other companies which, in my opinion, are even more over-valued.) With the apology issued, I think it's illustrative to look at how NFLX has garnered its current $48.7B market cap, both as an end in itself, and to help readers appreciate the general change in market valuations that I discuss in the closing section of this article. How Did We Get Here - Under Appreciated Business Model or Multiple Expansion? A key element in Alex's valuation case was projecting a 23.4% 10 year CAGR on revenues and a net profitability of 20% on the terminal 10 year revenue number. One year later, how close are we to achieving these targets? Keep in mind that, at least for the revenue growth number, it's much easier to hit high growth percentages in earlier periods than in later ones, if for no other reason than the size of the potential remaining market and the law of large numbers. Yet NFLX doesn't appear to be on a 10 year trajectory anywhere close to 23.4% CAGR on revenues. The profit margin is even more distant, but I understand that the bull retort is simply: we grow market, then we rake in incredible profits. (I personally take the word incredible literally in this case.) Revenue growth and profitability don't ((yet)) seem to substantiate the stock's meteoric rise, but what about other metrics? Perhaps the single most important valuation metric is P/CF (as we'll see below), but that certainly doesn't argue in NFLX's favor: Indeed the stock is trading at lifetime highs on this measure (excluding periods where cash flow was negative). If not cash flows, what about sales, book value or earnings ratios? Again, none of these metrics suggest that NFLX has grown into its valuation, instead all of the important metrics indicate that NFLX's current price is simply due to bull market multiple expansion. That said, and before we look at the market's multiples, there is an area in which NFLX is demonstrating real advances: Employee Productivity as a Sign That NFLX is Extremely Well-Managed In contrast to many companies that I short, NFLX has proved itself very adept at increasing employee productivity as evidenced by the next two graphs: Whether NFLX's management prowess can translate into long-term profits is an open question, but certainly these two graphs have to give bears pause. It turns out that Netflix's rising stock price AND rising valuation multiples - despite decreasing revenue growth and minimal profit margin - is actually typical of today's market. The two figures below, particularly the second, are the best depiction of this process that I've seen in a number of years. The source article is worth reading for these two graphics alone. Two points emerge from a study of NFLX's multiples and that of the markets generally. First, today's market is trading at multiples much higher than it has in at least 10 years. Were fundamentals to remain constant, but multiples contract to historical averages, the market would undergo a substantial downdraft. All investors should be cautious as a result. Second, given that multiple expansions haven't impacted all sectors equally, my plan going forward is to focus my valuation shorts in the 3 sectors whose multiples are highest today: biotech; software & services; and consumer services. Accordingly, if NFLX rises closer to the top of my valuation screens, I may re-initiate a short in it.
