ETF Hub Sep 29 2015, 19:07 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Streaming video service Hulu has made many changes to its model over the past year -- shifting heavily toward its paid service and aggressively moving into original programming -- though its recent move, to create an ad-free tier, raised eyebrows as observers compared its $11.99/month level directly with competitors like Netflix. The tier is off to a good start , though, says CEO Mike Hopkins, who suggests that it's winning over people who wouldn't have considered Hulu otherwise: "So far, so good." Speaking at an IAB ad conference, Hopkins says internal data showed a "big chunk" of potential users wouldn't join due to the ads, while another set points to the ads as a reason for cancellation. Users "like advertising if it’s the right advertising at the right time,” Hopkins said, acknowledging the ad-free tier isn't a big group of subscribers at the moment. Hulu -- co-owned by NBCUniversal ( CMCSA +0.6%), Disney ( DIS +0.9%) and Fox ( FOXA +2.4%) -- has as its ongoing goals personalizing the product further and adding more programming (TV and film) to draw and keep users. I love Hulu. I find a lot more programming I enjoy there than Netflix. I think it boils down to TV vs movie preferences. that is because hulu is owned by comcast a couple of others. id rather give my money to netflix and away from the controlling cable companies. it's about time someone else had a chance to compete in their monopolies.
