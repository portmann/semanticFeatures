Was Netflix's International Expansion Too Hasty? Consider Pakistan - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Earlier this month, Netflix announced it was launching its service in 130 more countries. Since the announcement the stock price has failed to show any positive signs. I try to explain the challenges and opportunities it may face in different countries of the world by using the example of Pakistan. To everyone's surprise Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) announced earlier this month that it had started selling its streaming service in 130 new countries, a move that was expected to take place by the end of this year. One of the most important regions it expanded into was the market located in the subcontinent, even though it still has to tap into China. I can't help but wonder that maybe this sudden global expansion is more like Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, rolling 130 dice altogether instead of putting in the due diligence of proper analysis of each territory. Sure, there will be a lot of places where Hastings and his company will roll a 6, but what about other markets where the company is rather uncertain? To understand one aspect from one of these 'uncertain' countries I am going to examine the market prospects of Pakistan for Netflix. The number of internet users in Pakistan stands at about 13.8% of the population. In other words that's 27.6 million internet users and a figure that has grown at an average pace of 10% over the past eight years. In just 2014 alone the number of internet users in Pakistan grew by more than 26%. The country was a latecomer to the world of e-commerce but still holds significant opportunities, especially when we consider the massive rise in online shopping within the country. As of 2015, annual online spending stood at $30 million. By 2017 this number is expected to balloon to $600 million. In 2014 the government of Pakistan auctioned 3G and LTE licenses to the telecom companies operating in the country, bringing the popularity of high-speed internet to new heights. The response has been promising; Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) revealed that the number of 3G users in the country stood at 21.2 million, as of November 2015, while LTE and 4G subscribers amounted to just over 447,000 users. A major challenge for companies like Netflix in Pakistan will be countering the massive black market. Movies are easily available through bootleg DVDs, while the more tech savvy crowd tends to torrent their material. So when it will come to choosing between a paid monthly subscription versus a free getting the same content for free, which one do you think most people will go for? Lurking behind all of this mess is the country's sensitive censorship laws. More than three years ago YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) was completely banned after the controversial movie 'Innocence of Muslims' was uploaded, sparking deadly riots across Pakistan and many other Muslim countries. It wasn't until January 2016 after YouTube launched a localized version of the site for Pakistan, allowing the government to request the restriction of any content it deems objectionable. In other words, Netflix will have to be patient and tread lightly so that it doesn't offend viewers in the country. All it could take is one over-ambitiously racy scene and countrywide operations could come to a standstill. Alas things are changing in the country. Internet laws and regulations are regularly being focused on, especially as e-commerce becomes a more accessible feature to the common man. The public sector leadership will eventually have to clamp down on illegal distribution of movies and criminalize piracy altogether, a feat which will have economic consequences the country might have to stomach. But the arrival of Netflix and the overall surge in e-commerce activity indicates Pakistanis will be more welcoming of any regulatory action. Netflix being a predominantly English service will have to adjust quickly for the support features as well as the content it offers. The company said that it has added support for Korean and Arabic, along with simplified and traditional Chinese to the 17 new languages it now offers. So far the company has shown some level of dedication toward capturing audiences in different parts of the world. A few weeks before launching worldwide, Netflix announced that they were adding a Pakistani movie called Zinda Bhaag to their content list. This paves the way for more Pakistani movies to try and get them uploaded onto Netflix's content database. Similarly, Netflix is speeding up efforts to reach a more diverse crowd by debuting 31 new series in 2016 alone. The influx of subscribers will proportionately increase the essential financing capabilities of the company to spend on their content. It should be noted that Netflix has also banned the use of VPN's which allowed users in different countries to stream the content available in other countries. This may be a small nuisance for some users, but other users might see this as a deal-breaker. Many subscribers often use proxy servers to surpass the restrictions imposed in their geographic territories. These restrictions often limit the content available to them on Netflix, forcing them to use proxy servers. Using the example of the Pakistani market as a basis for understanding Netflix's global expansion isn't meant to be a conclusive analysis of the company's new strategy. It is meant to help investors, and maybe even Netflix, understand the deep level of complexity involved with each region of the world. What the company did was basically adopt a "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it" strategy. It's not impossible, but it's definitely easier said than done. The expansion has helped the company's subscriber base grow faster than they had expected as the company added 5.59 million users in their fourth quarter, taking the worldwide tally up to nearly 75 million. Despite the bold move of launching its service across the world, Netflix is cautious and realizes it won't start making a profit on this expansion till at least a year down the line, that too if everything works out. Over the past year the company stock has surged by more than 70%, peaking out at a 52-week high of $133.27 per share. However, the last six months have seen the stock price fluctuate to a great degree as uncertainty loomed over its subscriber base due to the saturated US market. The latest quarterly report shows that Netflix reported a net profit of 10 cents a share, down from 19 cents a share the year before. If the expansion fails to impress investors once the company does cross the one-year buffer it has given itself then the stock price will see itself on a slippery slope. Until then, it is a waiting game.
