Last Chance To Sell Netflix Before Earnings - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Netflix are currently trading at 516 times this year's expected earnings and 354 times profit expectations for 2016. Even under a "best case scenario," we believe shares of NFLX would only rise to $170 over the next three years. That represents a 14.4% annualized return. With shares priced for perfection, any negative news for Netflix could send the stock lower. We recommend exiting the stock before earnings are released on Wednesday after the close. Shares of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are trading at a premium valuation ahead of the company's third quarter earnings release. Analysts currently expect Netflix to have earned $0.08 per share for the quarter, and for the company to book profits of $0.22 per share this year. Looking farther down the road, Wall Street consensus estimates for next year are for 45% earnings growth to $0.32 per share on revenue of $8.67 billion (which represents 27% revenue growth over 2015 expectations). Based on these expectations, investors are currently paying 516 times 2015 earnings expectations and 354 times next year's projections. It's difficult to comprehend the level of optimism that could justify an investment at this level. What Is a "Best Case Scenario" For Netflix? To justify the company's $48 billion market cap, investors need to be able to make a case for profits growing exponentially for years to come. And for these profits to accelerate, Netflix will have to see subscription revenue ramp at a very aggressive pace. We've already gone on record stating that we believe Netflix has too much competition and too little profit to justify its current valuation. But today we want to look at an optimistic scenario for Netflix and see what kind of return long-term investors could hope to achieve. For the sake of argument, let's assume that Netflix can grow revenue from the current annual rate of $6.83 billion (using analyst expectations for 2015) at a growth rate of 30% over the next three years. Note, this is above consensus growth expectations, and it's very difficult to scale a $6.83 billion venture at a 30% annualized rate for three years straight. Supposing the company could grow revenue at this rate, Netflix would generate revenue of $8.88 billion next year, $11.54 billion in 2017 and $15 billion in 2018. To put this number into perspective, at $15 billion in revenue, assuming NFLX keeps its streaming subscription price at $7.99 per month (roughly $96 in annual revenue per customer), Netflix would need to have more than 156 million customers worldwide. That's a customer base of roughly 50% of the population of the United States (including adults and children). Of course, Netflix is an international business and at last count the company boasted a membership of 65 million customers in 50 countries. But growing that 65 million into a base of 156 million over the next three years would be an impressive feat indeed. Assuming that Netflix was able to grow its membership and generate $15 billion in revenue, the next question is what that would mean for the company's profit margins. At last count, the company had a gross profit margin of 32.3% as shown in the graph from Y-Charts below. One could make an argument that gross profit margins will shrink as the company grows larger due to the likelihood of lower revenue per subscriber as the company expands into less developed countries. But to keep our model optimistic and assume that Netflix maintains a 32% gross profit margin - that leaves the company with $4.8 billion in gross profits ($15 billion times 32% equals $4.8 billion). In the company's June quarter, expenses related to marketing, technology and development and general and administrative categories made up $448,000 or 27% of the company's revenues. An optimistic investor may assume that as Netflix grows, these expenses will not grow as fast as the company's overall revenue. So let's assume that these expenses fall in comparison to revenue - to just over 13% of revenue in 2018 - or $2.0 billion. By recording these expenses at just half of the current rate of these expenses, we're left with $2.8 billion in annual profit (for the year 2018). Now, we'll assume that by this point, Netflix no longer has any debt and does not record any interest expense. So earnings before taxes comes out to $2.8 billion. And with a 35% tax rate, we can assume that total net profit for 2018 would amount to $1.82 billion. ($2.8 billion times 65% = 1.82 billion in net profit.) Finally, assuming no additional shares are issued, we'll divide the $1.82 billion by 426 million shares outstanding to come up with earnings per share of $4.27. Not bad, considering the company is only expected to earn 22 cents per share in 2015. What Would Netflix Trade At Under This scenario? After growing earnings to $4.27 per share in 2018, investors will likely have strong confidence in Netflix and their ability to generate reliable earnings. At this point, the market would likely be fairly heavily saturated, but let's assume that investors still expect robust growth out of Netflix. In this case, investors may be willing to pay as much as 40 times earnings for this company. Now, that's a generous multiple for a consumer-based company that already pulls in $15 billion in annual revenue. But again, we're discussing a "best case scenario" right now. In this example, shares of Netflix will trade at roughly $170 per share, good for a 50.6% increase over the next three years. But while a 50.6% return may sound attractive at first, consider the fact that it should take three years to generate this type of return. Buying shares of Netflix today at $113.45 and selling them in three years at a price of $170 only yields a 14.4% annualized return. And that's a return based on the best case scenario that we can think of for Netflix. If Netflix does not maintain a high level of revenue growth, or if the company's gross margins contract, or if marketing expenses do not begin to represent a smaller and smaller portion of the company's sales, then forward profit models could wind up giving investors much more disappointing returns. As mentioned, Netflix is slated to announce Q3 earnings on Wednesday after the market closes. Shares of Netflix have been moving higher heading into the announcement as investor optimism picks up. We believe there's a significant risk that shares will trade lower following the Q3 announcement. Broad economic weakness in emerging markets during the third quarter may have challenged the company's international subscription growth, and the company's content creation costs still represent a wild card which could unexpectedly cut into earnings. So with a potentially bearish catalyst on the horizon, and a long-term investment scenario that needs everything to go exactly right to justify the current pricing, we recommend avoiding the stock for now and possibly setting up a speculative bearish position to capitalize on a potential decline in the stock price.
