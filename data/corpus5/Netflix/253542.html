Netflix's Pricing Power Explained By 3 Scenarios - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Pim Keulen , Follow me on Twitter (123 clicks) Some investors consider Netflix's pricing power weak. Netflix raised its monthly fee without losing any of its growth. I will describe two other scenarios that explain Netflix's pricing power. In earlier coverage of television streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), I concluded that the future for this company looks bright. Diversification into sports and/or music could result in additional growth and pricing power for Netflix. Reading through the comments, I found a couple of questions and strong hesitations regarding Netflix's pricing power. Therefore, I would like to elaborate on this matter and explain why I believe Netflix's pricing power is strong. I will provide three scenarios: an increase of the monthly subscription fee, the introduction of an exclusive content tier and a pay-per-view option. Let me start by quoting two bearish comments on my previous article in order to show the hesitation among some investors toward Netflix's pricing power. I don't see how they will even have pricing power. The streaming service could just as easily become a price current commodity as cable is. Second, I would like to clarify what pricing powers actually means in order to avoid any misunderstanding. Pricing power refers to the price elasticity of demand. In other words, how much will demand for Netflix's streaming service decrease if the company decides to raise the price of the service? Now the definition of pricing power is clear, I will continue explaining Netflix's pricing power by the three scenarios I mentioned before. Netflix's television streaming service is relatively cheap compared to cable television packages. The current monthly subscription fee is $9.99, up from $7.99 at the beginning of this year. Netflix already raised the monthly subscription fee for new customers twice so far. The fact that Netflix raised its monthly fee twice this year and subscription growth is still very strong , both domestic as in the rest of the world, gives me confidence that the overall price elasticity of Netflix's service is favorable for the company. As a result, future increases in the monthly fee are not likely to result in a major drop in demand for the service. One of the comments mentioned declining margins. That's likely caused by investments and higher content costs. More and better content will eventually strengthen demand for Netflix's service. This is likely to lead to an even better price elasticity and pricing power for the company. I find that Netflix could easily raise the monthly subscription fee in the upcoming years without losing much of the demand for its service. Despite higher content costs from licensing deals, Netflix also is investing heavily in exclusive content . For example, House of Cards, Narcos and Orange Is The New Black are popular Netflix originals. By providing quality original content, Netflix is able to stay competitive compared to other services like HBO (which features the popular series Games Of Thrones). Since the company keeps investing in exclusive content, the total number of series, films and other material that's available on Netflix will grow over time. Next to just raising the overall monthly fee, Netflix could opt for introducing an exclusive content tier with access to more of its original content. In order to make such a move effective, the company should limit the number of exclusive content on the normal tier and raise the price for the exclusive tier. I admit the scenario described above hasn't been tested just yet. That's different compared to raising the overall monthly subscription fee, which Netflix raised twice already. Therefore, this scenario is less likely, but still interesting to consider. Over the past years, Netflix proved it's able to produce quality content. Why not pay extra for it? Personally, I would gladly pay extra if that ensures extra seasons of the originals series I watch on Netflix. Finally, Netflix could consider introducing the pay-per-view option. In my opinion, this will not harm demand for its core business, which is selling monthly subscription fees. Consumers signing up for the monthly subscription are probably going to use the service more than just once or twice a month. With a pay-per-view option for at least Netflix's originals series, the company should be able to attract users who are not likely to use the service at all. This will boost revenue without harming demand for its monthly subscriptions. The pay-per-view option becomes even more important if Netflix diversifies into sports as Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho suggested . Earlier this year, HBO co-produced the record-setting boxing match Mayweather vs. Pacquiao. This match sold to 4.4 million pay-per-view watchers and earned over $400 million in revenue. However, pay-per-view also could be introduced for originals series such as House of Cards and others. Considering all of the above, I find that Netflix's pricing power is strong going forward. The most likely scenario is that the company will raise the monthly subscription fee as it did twice this year. With a favorable price elasticity, any modest raise of the fee is not likely to reduce demand for the service significantly. Further, Netflix could introduce a more expensive tier with exclusive content or choice for a pay-per-view option. While the pay-per-view option targets a new group of customers, this option could increase revenue without reducing demand for the monthly subscription as well. For the second scenario, the effect of demand is less clear though. Overall, I stand behind my initial analyses that Netflix is a great company with strong pricing power.
