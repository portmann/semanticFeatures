Netflix Just Lost A Major Competitor, Popcorn Time - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha In the dark corners of the web, an event took place Tuesday. This event means that for the time being, Netflix actually lost one of its largest worldwide competitors. I'm not going to recommend Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) here. I find it wildly overvalued. However, this won't keep me from commenting on a development which is actually a positive for Netflix, and which started happening yesterday. You see, there's this thing called "Popcorn Time". Popcorn Time is an app that's available for PCs and Android smartphones, and which is kind of a Netflix on steroids. It has every kind of TV show imaginable, along with a massive selection of streaming movies, including many recent blockbusters. Popcorn Time relies on bittorrent sharing to provide an experience much like Netflix's, but without having to host massive amounts of data or needing a content delivery network. Unlike most bittorrent clients, Popcorn Time is as user-friendly as Netflix - you just search for a movie you want to see and press play. After a bit of buffering, Popcorn Time streams your movie just like Netflix. And Popcorn Time is also free, which kind of makes it very competitive with Netflix. Finally, Popcorn Time is illegal in most places since it's basically piracy as the content authors receive no compensation for its usage. Potentially Netflix's Largest Competitor Why do I say Popcorn Time is potentially Netflix's largest competitor? Well, in the last twelve months, Netflix captured ~4 million new subscribers (including non-paying subscribers) per quarter. As for Popcorn Time, as of March 2015 it was getting downloaded at a clip of 100,000 times per day -- that takes it to a run rate of 9 million new users per quarter. So basically, in terms of growth Popcorn Time was recently as large or larger than Netflix. Since Netflix is the leader in paid streaming, it's easy to see that Popcorn Time is very likely to be its main competitor when it comes to streaming. It's impossible to tell how many of Popcorn Time's subscribers would have otherwise opted to subscribe Netflix, but the answer is clearly "many". At the same time, it's thus no surprise that in its Q4 2014 shareholder letter , when talking about competition, Netflix named piracy as being one of its biggest competitors. Here's the exact phrase: Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors. This graph of Popcorn Time's sharp rise relative to Netflix and HBO in the Netherlands, for example, is sobering. It's also to be noticed that Netflix singled out Popcorn Time. This is not surprising given the growth in numbers I chronicled above. Netflix also pointed towards the following chart depicting Popcorn Time's interest rising in the Netherlands: (Source: Google Trends , sorry about it being in Portuguese, but it's self-evident) So there you have it, in a way Popcorn Time is perhaps Netflix's largest, meanest, competitor. But there is an exception ... While the chart above depicting interest in the Netherlands can be replicated for other countries, this won't be well-known in the U.S. For instance, here are the charts for Portugal, where Netflix just launched, and for the United States: Notice the massive difference? There's an obvious reason for this. Most countries have not yet implemented effective piracy policies, but the U.S. already did. The U.S. implements the famous "six strikes" policy , where after 6 warnings from the ISP, it disconnects the user from the internet. Given this reality, it's natural that Popcorn Time and other bittorrent piracy tools have not taken hold in the U.S. and as such investors are unfamiliar with this trend. This is so even though Netflix singled it out as being one of its largest competitors. Still, Netflix's "International Streaming" segment accounted for nearly two-thirds (62.2%) of the growth in paid memberships on the twelve months to September 30. So it's easy to see why having Popcorn Time fail can be a significant event for Netflix. While people might be focused on HBO and Amazon.com Video, those are competitors mostly established in the U.S., whereas this issue both: And reflects Netflix's main competitor outside the U.S. for obvious reasons (the piracy controls within the U.S.). Also, Netflix trades as much on immediate EPS and revenue growth numbers, as it does on subscriber numbers. And here, as we saw, nearly two-thirds of those increased subscriber numbers are coming from markets outside the U.S., where Popcorn Time is well established. It should be said that by March 2015 Popcorn Time was seeing 100,000 daily downloads -- this puts the quarterly downloads at ~9 million, which greatly exceeds Netflix's international growth rate in subscriptions (~2.5 million total subscriptions per quarter during the last twelve months), hence me saying that Popcorn Time was Netflix's greatest competitor. So why am I saying that Netflix just got good news? Well, as it turns out, there was quite a bit of disagreement within the Popcorn Time team regarding the direction they wanted to take it in. Some of this disagreement no doubt was prompted by rumors of an impending large lawsuit against Popcorn Time and those behind it. This disagreement led to the defections of a large number (5 members) of developers yesterday. And as of yesterday, Popcorn Time stopped working (this happened because the developer holding the keys to the domain was one of those who left). What this means is that overnight, Netflix lost perhaps its largest competitor ever! Now, this might still be temporary. Maybe the remaining team will pick up the pieces and re-enable this software. Certainly other substitutes will emerge. But as of right now, the fact is that it's down and hasn't recovered (this can be monitored here ). Still, the fact that Popcorn Time lost control of its own domain might make any substitutes have much less market reach than Popcorn Time had attained, and thus, be much less competitive than Popcorn Time was. Either way, this is positive news for Netflix -- though again, I must emphasize that it being a positive factor is not enough for me to say Netflix is a but. I'm neutral on Netflix. There are a lot of news reports about Popcorn Time "for the web" being down . This is unrelated, this refers to a version which popped up just a few days ago which promised to make Popcorn Time available through the web browser. This version is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things (it was still too small) and was pulled by its own creator due to lawsuit threats. Popcorn Time - a piracy site and app -- was the single largest competitor to Netflix. Due to internal strife, Popcorn Time went down yesterday. This is likely to be a positive for Netflix, particularly helping increase subscriptions in foreign markets. It's less of a factor in the U.S. since the U.S. has tight piracy policing rules in effect at the ISP level. Obviously, Popcorn Time might yet resurrect, and others will certainly try to take its place. But getting to the popularity Popcorn Time already enjoyed is something of a long process, and in the meantime Netflix is a net beneficiary of this event.
