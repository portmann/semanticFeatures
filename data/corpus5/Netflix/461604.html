Netflix: What Could Possibly Go Wrong This Time? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha In Q1 the stock sold off after weak guidance on subscriber growth. The company should meet its Q2 subscriber growth numbers. However, Q3 international subscriber growth could be hurt by the UK Referendum. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reports quarterly earnings after-hours today. Analysts expect revenue of $2.11 billion and eps of $0.02. The revenue estimate implies 7.8% growth sequentially. The company missed on its Q1 revenue estimates and the stock sold off 13%. The stock has historically traded based on momentum; down by double-digits Y/Y NFLX is starting to show cracks. The question remains, "What could possibly go wrong this quarter?" Below are a few suggestions: In Q1 Netflix grew its domestic and international subscribers Q/Q by 4.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively. This was rather impressive. The rub was that management gave weak guidance; the company expects Q2 subscribers to grow Q/Q by 500,000 domestically and 2 million internationally. UBS believes the company can meet its Q2 bogey; however, headwinds from the UK Referendum and impacts from the Rio Olympics could cause Q3 subscriber growth to fall to around 836,000. If management gives underwhelming international subscriber growth estimates for Q3 -- 836,000 sounds dismal -- NFLX could sell off again. Secondly, I do not believe the UK Referendum or financial straits faced by emerging countries like Brazil and Venezuela are one-off occurrences. The global economy is in shambles and that does not bode well for international subscriber growth or NFLX. The growth engine of the company is its international subscriber base. Expanding into 130 additional countries sounds nice. It also implies the company could be collecting revenue in the currencies of emerging countries whose [i] economies are slowing vis-a-vis the U.S. and [ii] currencies could fall against the dollar. Meanwhile, the lion's share of Netflix's content costs are in dollars. This could potentially create a negative arbitrage similar to that of Weatherford International (NYSE: WFT ) -- a $7 billion debt load in dollars, yet over 95% of its EBITDA comes from abroad. Netflix's Q1 operating income margin was 2.5% -- down from 4.2% and 3.3% in Q3 2015 and Q4 2015, respectively. Cost of revenues ticked up to 70% (versus 68.5% in Q4), and technology and development costs rose to 10.4% (versus 9.9% in Q4). Rising content costs in general could punish margins. If the mismatch between its dollar-based content costs and international subscriber revenue turns negative, it could amplify the company's margin erosion. That said, the mere expectation of such an event could create an overhang for the stock. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.
