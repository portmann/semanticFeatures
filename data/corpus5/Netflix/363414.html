Verizon Can't Fix Yahoo - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha By all indications, Verizon is the most aggressive bidder for the core Yahoo assets. The leaked books for Yahoo show a business in major decline. My latest thesis is that Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) peaked after an impressive rally to start the new year. The news that the wireless giant is definitely in the process of making a bid for hapless Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) isn't going to help the stock price. The news is even more perplexing considering the report from Re/code suggesting the documents from Yahoo showcase a very weak outlook to prospective buyers. Due to these facts, Verizon broke the recent trend of rallying and ended the day with a 2.8% decline and trading below the 20 DMA for the first time since the rally started. The company lists the ownership of AOL as a prime reason for buying the core business. The logic doesn't add up considering the core business of Yahoo is stagnant at best. Not to mention, the core businesses are all mostly secondary brands with limited upside. Verizon has built the brand and stock valuation based on having the premier wireless network. With Yahoo, the search business is far behind Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and other key brands like mail, Finance and Sports are really not distinguishable leaders anymore. Roughly 18 months ago, activist Starboard Value LP highlighted the benefits ( via Business Insider) of a merger of then independent AOL with Yahoo. The investment firm places the ability to achieve $1 billion in synergies as a prime reason for the deal. The ability to significantly reduce cost overlaps in the Display business and eliminate corporate overhead made a combination interesting at the time. Verizon though needs to add growth and the addition of AOL has provided no distinguishable benefits for the domestic wireless giant. In addition, the company purchased digital advertising platform Millennial Media, but the one big initiative to create an app for mobile video to utilize the digital advertising assets has been a complete failure so far. The go90 app ranks far down the list in the entertainment category in the App Store. According to App Annie, go90 is the number 19th most downloaded entertainment app. This leaves the app far below the rankings of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Hulu and HBO Now owned by Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). The app is even far behind The Moron Test and Dubsmash. At the same time, Verizon continues making interesting add-on deals to improve the content for the ad-supported mobile video network. This week, Verizon bought a 24.5% stake in AwesomenessTV. The wireless giant paid around $160 million for the stake with the intent to create more premium short-form mobile video content for go90. At the time that Starboard recommended the merger of AOL and Yahoo, I wrote 2 Wrongs Don't Make A Right . The combination of the businesses would create a unit with annual revenues approaching $7 billion, but the operations haven't improved to change the previous opinion. Sure Verizon has revenues of over $130 billion making the revenue base of Yahoo near immaterial, but the wireless giant already faces revenue growth challenges of its own. Why add a business that Re/code reports forecasting that revenues will decline up to 15% this year? The disclosure documents provided to prospective buyers by the Yahoo bankers shows a business not worthy of a purchase. Besides the revenue decline, Kara Swisher suggests that earnings are forecast to plunge 20% with adjusted EBITDA down to a meager $750 million this year. The number sat at $1.4 billion in 2014. By all indications, Verizon along with Alphabet and a host of other companies are looking to make a big deal for Yahoo by the Monday deadline. These large corporations clearly see a fixable business though the reality in the sale book is clearly not in agreement. Naturally, any value creation from a deal depends highly on the price paid. Ultimately though, the devil is in the details. Yahoo might offer a rare Internet asset with scale, but the company doesn't offer an asset worth owning when Wall Street values growth so highly. Verizon is heading lower if it has the highest bid for Yahoo. The recommendation is to avoid the stock.
