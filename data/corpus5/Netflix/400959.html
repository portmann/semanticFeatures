Netflix's International Expansion And Regulations: Don't Worry About That, It's Just Paperwork - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's last quarter showed subscriber growth lagging and not what the market wanted, hence the price drop to the $90 range. The roll-out in Asia was evidently rushed, as it hit headwinds with regulations. South Korea specifically has run into problems with the media and billing issues, which are replicated in other international host nations. I am relieved that I exited pre-earnings at $111, and will not re-enter at these levels. I foresee Netflix's slower growth will continue, along with a longer-term stock price decline. One of my best friends is a Special Forces Army Officer named Alex. While our career paths have varied widely, as has our geographical locations, we still remain in touch often and share a few laughs. Alex is your typical SF guy - he tends to be a bit focused on a "shoot from the hip" style of action, and follows the mantra that you act first and apologize later for overstepping your boundaries. So, for example, when Alex knew he had an overseas trip coming up, I mentioned that he should probably get his funding codes and visa documents prepped. His response: "Don't worry about that... that's just paperwork stuff, it takes care of itself eventually." In the end, he nearly missed his trip and had to call in a number of personal favors to force others to jump through hoops. But all of this could have been avoided had he just researched ahead of time and done his due diligence and obligatory tasks. And while Alex's shenanigans may have worked when handling a single bureaucratic entity, it is not something to try when you roll out services to more than 130 countries. Ignoring or failing to diligently research regulations is a route to failure. And after the past four months of being a U.S. citizen using a legal Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) account in South Korea , I feel this is how the NFLX management has handled the company's international expansion. They pushed out the expansion with minimal effective marketing efforts and did not fully research the regulations, especially within Asia . And it shows, as South Korea's Neilsen ratings have shown users to only be in the 50-60K per week, as opposed to its local competitor, KT's Olleh TV, which has over 1 million. I am not going to discuss the company's subscriber miss this last quarter - another SA author has done so - but instead, I will provide a look at some of the issues that have transpired for NFLX recently. The first few months in South Korea went well, until the media outlets unleashed their fury on NFLX... for showing "X-Rated" Content to teens (further covered here on an expat/English Teacher Message Board ). I know it is not X-rated by U.S. standards, but it is not the U.S. that has to give the okay on this content. This came about because of one simple fact - NFLX either failed to acknowledge or ignored the Korean government laws that require age verification. So why does this matter? First, the warning was posted to its web page, but no notification was done in a pop-up window until the deadline to register arrived. So, if you watched via an app or blue-ray player as we did, you had no clue what was happening until that day when you were suddenly banned. Second, you have to verify your age via a valid phone account linked to your provider's number. No issue if you are Korean citizen, but for expats, you have a difficult time doing so, because the Korean system often fails to link your information properly. NFLX's answer, when I talked to customer service, was to give me a month of free service until they could figure out the issue. But that still did not allow me to watch Daredevil... yes, this show is considered an 18+ show, and thus, I was blocked to anything at that rating or above. Somehow, Asian ratings though labeled Luther as a 16-year old's show - go figure. But I finally got this fixed by using a Korean friend's number - NFLX still lacks a solution. Probably not the right answer, nor what NFLX or the Korean government intended, but it fixed my issue and I finished the second season of Daredevil. This would have been a deal breaker had it gone on past mid-May, mainly because an already sparse catalogue was reduced by about 60%, leaving me with only a few movies and TV shows worth watching. The key concern here is that NFLX failed to research ratings schematics in Asia , which have resulted in obstacles and challenges the company will need to overcome if it plans to become the global leader its leadership proclaims is its aspiration. But only a few weeks after resolving this issue, two billing issues came into the fold. First, the company changed the monthly charges to local Korean won at a rate of 12,000 won per month. I have zero gripes on this one, as it makes sense. At the time, the rate sat right about 1,200 won per $1 USD - thus, it was right at the $9.99 monthly rate. For me, as the credit card that I used (more on this in a moment) has no forex fees, this was no issue, and anyone with a Korean credit card and account would not mind. It also benefits NFLX to do this when forex rates were based on a strong dollar, as the company hedged for the likely potential of its weakening - which did, in fact, occur. With the rate now at 1,150, it is not a major issue, but could be cause for concern if the rate falls further into the 1,050 range, as the price would begin to move significantly above what it was initially... especially with a small catalogue available to customers. The second issue occurred this week and will result in my discontinued use of Netflix. The company changed its billing policy and now requires only Korean-issued cards for payment. The Korean government has laid no claim to this change and NFLX has not really offered any reasoning for the change, even while Japan continues to accept Visa and MasterCard. Since I do not have a Korean-issued card, I went online to chat with customer service. After explaining the situation, I received the following from their chat rep, Jane: "And I totally get that you don't really need a local Korean credit card, we are working really hard to get our Korean customers the best options possible so you can rest assured I'll pass your voice forward right now so we can be aware that you would like to have the option back for using different cards as soon as possible. And meanwhile if you wish to continue with your service you can definitely do that using a local prepaid card, sounds like a plan?" So, first, let me just say such a prepaid credit card that can be used online does not exist here, and a credit card is a multi-step process in this country, unlike an online application in the States. We don't have that same Visa prepaid card you can just buy at Target or even a gas station. Additionally, NFLX apparently wants me to incur the cost of time, effort, and payment for such a prepaid card to pay for an inferior NFLX, one more costly than the U.S. version, and in which I am down to only a few shows left to watch, while hoping the monthly churn brings new content? This simply comes down to another instance of the company not planning ahead and making decisions from the hip. While many will choose to stay or have such an account to switch to, NFLX has shown that pushing out its roll-out too early, without enough due diligence, is forcing "do-overs" in its account policies. Billing - the "paperwork stuff" - is one of the most rudimentary functions of any company today, and not taking Visa or MasterCard is something that will likely deter at least some potential subscribers. VPN Blockage... and the Long Road to Global Licensing So, I know the response by most people in the U.S. - "just get a flippin' VPN!" This is much easier said than done. While NFLX has admitted it cannot block all VPNs, it has, in just the last few months, blocked most of those previously used by customers here in Korea and throughout Asia in general... and continues to block more and more every day. It also defeats the purpose of a low-cost content provider, as a VPN service can run between $5 and $15 per month. The move has been to force the use of the international versions of NFLX over U.S. accounts, but thus far, the reaction has not been positive . This is mainly because the overseas content... well, stinks. It has some basics, but it is generally well under half the U.S. catalog, and can be as low as 20-25%. So, for those U.S. consumers complaining "there is nothing to watch on Netflix," try it overseas. While it is understandable that Reed Hastings is working to make content available on a globally licensed basis , it should probably consider how long that will take and calculate it into realistic subscriber growth. It seems NFLX feels it has the time, while customers are constantly looking at their watches. Overall, the timing of this blockage and the ability to distribute content should collide, and thus far these events have not, thus even driving some back to piracy of content . I was bullish on NFLX many months back, and had hopes for its international roll-out to be well researched and far more than a PR headline. But my last few articles on this company have come at a time when the outlook has soured. I am relieved that I dumped my shares back at $111 as per my last article on NFLX's purchase of Bright , as I see the company has failed to really plan this expansion with the necessary precision and detail required for it to succeed in the near term. It has followed my friend Alex's advice and left the "paperwork stuff" for much later, and waiting until the last minute in this case will take more than a minute to correct. I don't recommend buying the stock at this level for the long term - it could be a trade as it is likely to creep back up near $100, but I see a downward trend forming with each quarter's results, as subs will likely continue to suffer. With that said, if you are going to short the stock, I would wait until it re-enters the $95-plus range, and as for buying puts, the implied volatility requires a drastic move. This will likely transpire around the next earnings report; hence, I would again await a rise in price for your best opportunity. While I am disheartened to leave NFLX as a customer in that it is under a situation that could have been avoided, I am not overly burdened in that the available catalogue is nothing compared to the stateside options. I have watched most of the shows I found relevant, and after all, I think most can agree that we are at a loss for selections when my wife is watching Sex and the City 2.
