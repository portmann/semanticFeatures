Buy The Netflix Dip - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares have dropped from their high of $129.20 back in August all the way down to a low on Tuesday of $93.57, representing a 38% decline, and a loss of over $15 billion in market cap. This sell-off frenzy ignited due to fears of competitors entering the streaming business, particularly Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). But will these companies like Apple be able to grab enough market share to justify this huge loss in market cap for Netflix? We must peel back the skin and further examine the competition. Whenever someone hears that Apple could be a competitor, they have the right to be terrified initially. Its customers are incredibly loyal and they sort of have a reputation for creating the best products that man has ever seen ... Ever. Apple is expected to announce new products such as a new Apple TV Wednesday morning at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. This could be when they also officially announce their plan to enter the video content subscription market. But analysts don't predict this market penetration to begin until next year. Even then, it is unclear how Apple's subscription service will fare against Netflix, or what type of subscription service Apple will even have. It is unlikely that Apple could begin creating its own Emmy-winning content like Netflix has been able to anytime soon. And although Apple is a dynamic company with incredible resources and capital to fund whatever it wants, it seems that it is more likely that Apple would compete with the cable providers more than Netflix. Apple's loyal customers are generally wealthier, and would likely therefore pay for both, Netflix and Apple's streaming services. Apple entering the video subscription network would thus expand this market, but possibly take away more market share from the cable companies than Netflix already has. A great article written by Alex Pitti further explaining why Apple TV subscriptions won't hurt Netflix can be found here. Netflix still has big opportunities for geographic expansion. For example, at the beginning of the month, Netflix launched in Japan in a partnership with Fuji Television, one of the flagship media companies of Japan. They also signed a deal with Softbank, one of Japan's biggest telecom and internet companies, to be able to market and sell Netflix subscriptions in Softbank stores. This market penetration into Japan is expected to noticeably increase subscriber growth, largely due to the Fuji Network original content that Netflix will be offering. Netflix will be able to use this same growth strategy and enter into any market that it pursues. Additionally, it is important to note that every partnership that Netflix gains builds the barriers to entry higher and higher. This first-mover advantage that Netflix has is being underestimated. Video streaming is a commodity, but the partnerships that Netflix has in place along with it's original content is going to be very tough for any competitor to directly compete with. Verizon announced earlier on Tuesday that it will be launching a new video service that's target market will be young people who choose to watch TV on their phone or tablet. This service, called Go90, still does not stand a chance against Netflix. It is free, but has advertisements. Much of the content will only be available for Verizon customers, including NFL games and shows from Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA ) (NASDAQ: DISCB ) (NASDAQ: DISCK ), Scripps (NYSE: SNI ), and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ), such as "The Daily Show." What I am trying to say, is that Netflix is way "cooler" than Go90 could ever be, and being cool is important for Verizon's target market. Netflix still has the "cool" factor that tech companies normally only enjoy for a couple of years. Everyone loves Netflix. If you are a person looking for a roommate, you are instantly a more popular roommate candidate if you pay the measly $8 per month for a Netflix subscription. Also, if you don't know what "Netflix and chill" means, you probably haven't been on any social media accounts in the year 2015. That has become an increasingly popular phrase and hashtag used on the internet. The phrase, "Go90 and chill," will never be a thing, unless you are an employee of Verizon. Basically, Netflix is a name that people associate with good feelings, and many people's Sundays would be much less fulfilling without it. Netflix has many key partnerships already in place that will make entering the video streaming business harder than the market currently seems to anticipate. Apple is an incredibly popular company, but Netflix has the first-mover advantage and has the competitive advantage of specializing in this industry. Other streaming services are likely to expand the video-streaming market rather than detrimentally reduce Netflix subscriptions. The recent dip in Netflix shares is due to panic and has only speculative substance. Buy the Netflix dip. Disclosure: I am/we are long NFLX, AAPL.
