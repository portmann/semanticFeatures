Apple Should Buy Vessel - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is approaching its TV subscription service the wrong way. It doesn't need large cable companies to create a great product because millennials don't watch them. The future of video entertainment looks something like Vessel. This is why Apple should acquire it. It needs unique content that appeals to younger viewers to have a successful offering. Traditional media websites are applauding Apple's move, but my young age gives me a unique perspective on the future landscape of video content consumption. Obviously, anyone can make the argument that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should buy hundreds of different firms because it has an obscene amount of cash. The point of discussing this specific potential acquisition is to spark a discussion of where the TV industry is headed. Apple is expected to unveil its own web TV service in June alongside a new version of Apple TV. In this article, I explain why I don't believe it will be successful based on the information we currently have available. Keep in mind my perspective is coming from someone who is in tune with the trend of millennials' content viewing habits because I am one. The reason why this younger demographic is important is that it is a leading indicator of how the entire population views content. I have been consuming the majority of my entertainment and information on mobile internet-connected devices for over 5 years. It seems as though the rest of the public is now starting to catch up. Apple and the cable companies may have now recognized this trend toward viewing content on internet-connected devices, but they are wrong about the reason behind it. Apple is basically repackaging a slimmed down version of some TV networks (excluding NBC) and including it with non-traditional content possibly including services like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Hulu Plus and HBO. The idea that consumers will buy the service is based on a few assumptions: It has a lower price than a traditional cable bill ( $40 vs. over $100). If it includes some of the online content such as Netflix this value is even greater. These points are all well taken, it does give consumers a better option than traditional cable currently does. Obviously, Apple wouldn't go through with an initiative if it didn't have a significant amount of logic behind it. When determining that a corporation is making a mistake you have to first explain what their logic was before you deconstruct it. The reason why I believe this initiative won't work is because it is backward looking. Sure, it is a better value proposition than what we have today, but what we have today isn't the market it will compete in. It will be competing in the future market. So what is the biggest reason why this won't work? The reason why it won't work is the same reason why millennials have abandoned cable. We have stopped watching cable because we simply don't like the programming anymore. No millennial will want to have a combination of new and old media for $40 per month because we reject the cable networks. We don't want to watch cable because it isn't engaging and it isn't relatable. If you don't want to take my word about these trends, I have statistics to back up my claims. DEFY Media did a survey of millennials aged 13 to 24 in which it studied their video viewing habits. The first slide in their report simply reemphasizes what I stated at the beginning of this article. We do not spend nearly as much time watching TV as we do online content such as YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). If you talk to anyone under the age of 24, I guarantee you that they know the YouTuber Jenna Marbles. An older adult may assume that the internet is a decentralized mess where kids are watching random videos. This is completely wrong; just as there were a few major celebrities that young adults all paid attention to in the previous generation, there are currently a handful of powerful internet celebrities. This means that a new type of subscription model can be created to appeal to this demographic. One that includes internet stars and has a monthly subscription would be preferable. So why are young people switching to YouTube instead of TV? The content is better and the stars are more relatable. The survey shows that 69% of young people believe that digital content delivers what they want compared 56% having the same feelings about cable. 67% of those surveyed felt that digital content was relatable compared to 41% for TV. You could have looked up those numbers on your own, but I can give a better picture of what's happening because I am one of those millennials. The content is better because it is being made by people like us. Who knows what young adults want better than young adults? They are just like us, meaning they are very relatable. Who knows if a star like Jenna Marbles would have gotten her own TV show if she would have tried out for a role in the 1990s? The internet allows for a voting mechanism to determine who is successful. The internet has an unlimited amount of creators to take from to create great content. This compares to the centralized TV networks, which have a limited amount money they can spend and content they can produce. Speaking of money, we like internet content creators because of the limited budgets they have because it makes it feel like we are watching our friends on YouTube. No one feels like they are watching their watching their friends on linear TV because most of us don't know celebrities. This concept is born out in the survey data, as 56% of 13 year olds, 55% of 14-17 year olds, and 51% of 18-24 year olds believe they could be a YouTube star. This compares to 40% of all respondents believing that they could be TV stars. Why do millennials believe this? Because we have witnessed their meteoric rise to fame. This fame didn't occur because of some talent agent determining their fate. We all collectively determined their success by watching their videos. Internet celebrities are almost always thankful to their fans, this makes them more relatable. It makes the viewers feel important. They are constantly on social media connecting with their fans. They go to meet and greets to meet all of their viewers at events such as Playlist Live, Digifest and VidCon. It may be difficult for you to visualize this concept if you are over 30. The media often shows how long lines are for the iPhone. Picture these lines except that they are for YouTube stars. There was a line of hundreds of people to meet Jenna Marbles and other stars at Playlist Live, the ticket to get into this 2-day event cost about $200. The following survey shows the impact YouTubers have on young adults' purchasing habits compared to TV and movies. In every age segment studied there is a significant amount of those surveyed that would trust a YouTuber to buy a product over traditional celebrities, leading the company to conclude that this trend is not a fad. As a millennial myself, I can tell you unequivocally that this trend will continue. Why do we trust YouTubers more than TV and movie stars? Because we feel that they are less influenced by money and are giving us an honest opinion of the product. Obviously, some YouTubers are getting paid to do endorsements, but when they are simply giving their honest opinion it sounds like it is coming from a friend, so I will follow the advice. To summarize, we haven't stopped watching TV because it is inconvenient or too expensive. We stopped watching it because we don't like the content and don't relate to the people on TV. We relate to YouTubers and trust them like we would trust a friend. Earlier in this article, I mentioned the prospect of an internet subscription service that included popular YouTube stars. I was referring to Vessel, which just launched this week. It is a service that has a $2.99 monthly subscription service and features the top YouTubers. The subscription allows users to view fewer ads and to see the content a few weeks before the general public. This is akin to the Pro service that Seeking Alpha offers where Pro subscribers get to see the articles 24 hours before the general public. You may be wondering why users would pay this fee considering the fact that the entertainment isn't time sensitive like stock advice can be. To explain this, I will go back to the events that I have gone to. If you were personally at Digifest NYC and witnessed the thousands of screaming teenagers, you wouldn't question whether they would pay for this content. Whenever YouTubers released any product there is a huge amount of demand for it. For example, Vine star Cameron Dallas released a movie called "Expelled." It topped the iTunes charts. The number one spot typically is held by movies that reach more than $80 million in sales at the box office. If you are someone who doesn't watch YouTube, you may not be aware of which stars have the sway to make consumers subscribe to Vessel. I can tell you that even though every star is not on Vessel, Connor Franta and Caspar Lee alone are enough to make millions subscribe. If the product is successful all the YouTubers will join because most are friends. The platform hasn't been marketed heavily yet as I have only heard the service mentioned once in the hundreds of videos that I watch on a monthly basis. This will change soon because Vessel gives YouTubers the potential to earn up to 20 times the amount that they earn on ad supported content. This is because the CPMs will be higher because the quality is more consistent than it is on YouTube. The money from the subscriptions is also being shared with the creators. They earn money by the percentage of views they drive on Vessel, so there is an incentive to drive traffic to the site. Besides YouTubers, Vessel also has traditional channels such as the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, BuzzFeed, the WallStreet Journal, Time magazine, and an NHL and NBA channel. This is what the future of TV will more closely resemble. I can see a user potentially subscribing to Netflix for movies and Vessel for internet content and some more professional content. Any other content that is not on any of those services can be gotten for free online on websites such as on YouTube. Live sports is certainly the elephant in the room as it is truly the last content that TV owns that the internet doesn't have a part of as most of the packages that sports leagues offer to stream content online are too expensive for mainstream adoption. For example, NHL Gamecenter Live costs $169 for the season. Once live sports figures out how to find stream content online for a more reasonable price, the cable subscriptions will tumble and the internet content providers will defeat the cable companies. If Apple wants to come up with a TV package it needs unique content that users want to watch. This unique content is what Vessel has. Sure a Netflix and HBO packaged with Fox and ABC would be cheaper than buying them individually, but millennials only want the Netflix and HBO part of that deal. If consumers really want channels such as CNN, AMC, TNT, ESPN, and the Food Network, they can always subscribe to Sling which is a product made by Dish, which costs as low as $20 per month . If Apple bought Vessel and had exclusive rights to some content it would gain a large amount of millennial subscribers. This deal would likely not cost that much to Apple as the Vessel service was just launched and is still unproven. I would consider this deal similar to the one where it bought Beats in which Apple made an attempt to get more involved in music streaming. In conclusion, Apple may have needed to partner with ABC and other traditional networks if it was making a deal 10 years ago. Now millennials don't like the content that they provide, meaning they are dying brands. Millennials are a leading indicator to the direction the country is going just as they were early adopters of social media. They are rejecting the TV and so should Apple if it wants to get involved in creating a video content streaming subscription service.
