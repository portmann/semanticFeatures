Dish's Charlie Ergen Gives A Nod To Netflix - DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) | Seeking Alpha Industry luminaries are suggesting Netflix is a category dominator. With not even a close second. Dish Network's Q2 results featured an 81,000 subscriber loss and provide another data point that linear TV is a declining industry. The only way for Pay-TV to grow is to raise ARPU which further validates the value proposition for OTT players. The Linear TV to OTT transition will be messy, incumbent Pay-TV operators seem like avoids given the potential disruption over the next 5 to 10 years. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) bears should heed the words of Charlie Ergen from Dish Network's (NASDAQ: DISH ) 2Q conference call : Netflix is most powerful content aggregator in the world today. And there's nobody that's even close. I don't think, from second point of view, I don't think there's anything they couldn't buy that they wanted today on original content for example. They pay a fixed price. If they go buy something from Discovery, they pay fixed price for it. And as their subs grow, their cost per customer goes down. So, when we buy something from Discovery, we pay a variable costs and we pay the same for each customer. No one else is even close to Netflix. Not Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Not Hulu. Not Sling TV. And Charlie Ergen knows a thing or two about the TV business. Here is the key: content aggregation, distribution and production is a scale game driven by subscriber growth and the disintermediation of content and traditional content distribution. And there is no one better at driving subscriber growth than Netflix given it has an unbeatable street-level value proposition. $8/month for a growing original content library and good enough "free agent" third party content to justify the subscription fee. Equity value, of course, is driven by future cash flows and life time customer value of subscribers. For Dish, linear TV represents a mature to declining business (subscribers were down 81,000 in 2Q 2015) with high subscriber acquisition costs (up to $800 per sub). Yes, they will grow their OTT service Sling TV from three sources: cord-nevers, cord cutters and Pay-TV supplementers, but the Pay-TV business will likely face strong headwinds going forward. If it is uneconomical for Dish to acquire subscribers at less than a $50/ARPU, 6x higher than Netflix $8/ARPU, that is a tough sell for consumers who are actively seeking to lower their content consumption costs. So how does Dish sustainably grow its Pay-TV business from the ~13.9 million subscriber base? I don't think it can. To grow sales with a declining subscriber base, the only option is to increase the price (ARPU was ~$88 in Q2 2015, up from ~$84 in Q2 2014). But increasing the price for Pay-TV will only make Netflix and OTT players more attractive and will likely accelerate cord-cutting. In my view, this looks like more evidence of a pernicious cycle for Pay-TV operators as consumer behavior shifts to lower price OTT options, creating a virtuous cycle for Netflix. While there is likely a lot of latent value in Dish's spectrum, recent regulatory uncertainty around the FCC rejecting a $3.3 billion discount in a recent AWS-3 auction casts more doubt around the competitive environment in which Dish operates. I'm not smart enough to figure it out, so Dish is an avoid (not a short) for me. But I am fairly certain, and I think Mr. Ergen is too, that Netflix is the category dominator in the content business and has a long runway of growth ahead of it looking out over the next 5-10 years.
