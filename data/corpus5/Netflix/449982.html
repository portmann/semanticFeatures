Netflix: A Model To Judge The Strategic, Financial Assumptions Currently Priced By The Market - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha We built (and attached) a DCF model to provide each reader an instrument to run their own sensitivities moving on more than 30 variables in the input panel. The decision to create original contents as well as the #NetflixEverywhere plan marked the crucial steps to become a major company. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is one of the most iconic corporations of the Internet related economy. Its success is substantially based on four pillars: Generally, the market is quite efficient in pricing the potential revenue expansion of a company and its ability to generate cash. However, sometimes mispricing situations could emerge and threaten the wealth of a highly-exposed investor. Now, if we look at Netflix's stock price performance, it is rational to assess with skepticism the 98% increase since 2015, the 631% increase since 2013, and the more incredible 2,164% explosion since the beginning of 2009. In addition, what has grabbed our attention as value investors is the following Netflix PE table. The aim of this article is neither to explain the terrific Netflix's share price evolution we have been experiencing since its listing, nor a priori judgment on its multiples. It is a more neutral observation of the market to eventually give insights of what could be Netflix's path in our view. As the company starts to generate cash and visibility about future results rises, it made sense for us to create a DCF model and better understand which drivers could have been responsible for the current price ($96.67 as of July 1st 2016). We chose a number-driven analysis since we evaluate most of the articles we read about Netflix as lacking real financial content and often targeting consensus instead of objectivity. We modeled the cash flows for 5 years and then we used a 3-stage terminal value estimation to sum up the value of a company in a growing (at a decreasing rate) perpetuity. We separately considered the three business segments because they have different growth patterns (Graph 1) and most of all different margins. Then, adopting a macro view, we tried to appraise the potential audience considering the reference market. Let us begin with the domestic segment. In recent years, Netflix has delivered impressive numbers in terms of membership net addition, reaching about 47 million of subscribers at the end of this year's Q1. Since 2011, the company has been able to add in average 5.77 million users each year, with a 19.9% CAGR. The management has a long-term objective to reach 60 to 90 million homes. In our analysis, the US population represents the broader market. As the graph below shows, the aggregate actual number of cable and broadband TV users is over 100 million at the end of 2015, meaning 32.5% of the US population. Furthermore, these numbers exhibit a clear trend: cable companies are slowly losing customers, while SVOD companies are able to add new subscribers each quarter. We believe the company could realistically achieve about 75 million subscribers at the end of 2020, with an 11% CAGR. We forecast a 12% growth in 2016, then decreasing 1% each year until 2020. We expect a similar path because of the following considerations: So far, Netflix has produced unique content, which are greatly appreciated by the public. Along with its platform, the competitive advantage of the company is the ability to retain customers by streaming the most appreciated TV series and movies. We won't want to further discuss this point because the company has been proved successful. Estimating 75 million customers in 2020, Netflix will have approximately 22.6% of the expected US population. The objective to reach 90 million homes seems a little bit too optimistic since it will mean 1 out of 3.7 people in the US will have and pay a Netflix membership. Competitors are aware of the potential the market has and will compete as hard as they can to gain market share. The competition has already started and it is coming from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), HBO and Hulu. Furthermore, in line with the decision to raise prices in May, we decided to constantly increase the Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) by 6.5% each year, meaning a $0.5 average increase on the monthly plan. Despite the astonishing numbers shown by the domestic market, growth in the international segment represents the real trigger for the company to definitely become a major corporation. Netflix doesn't give any target in terms of international presence. Therefore, we used the following method in order to forecast the international expansion and asses the outcome of our expectations. We divided the international streaming segment in 8 regions for which public data are available. Then, based on the year of introduction, we applied at each region the same growth rate that occurred in the domestic streaming segment. It made sense for us since we noted this trend in regions where Netflix is present since some years. We expect about 137 million memberships in 2020 from the 27.4 million at the end of 2015, with a 35.4% CAGR. We assess the growth by observing the ratio between Netflix international subscribers and the number of the English-speaking people in each region. We do that as the production of contents in original languages will be a plus and not the company's core business: the scale will come from the offering of English-speaking contents. The two major sources of cost for Netflix are essentially content amortization and marketing. COGS are represented by the supply of third-party contents and by the costs related to the production of in-house contents. Historically, they accounted for approximately 50% of the yearly domestic revenue. We forecast this percentage to gradually decline by 100bps each year. As regards the international segment, we expect the ratio to decrease from 77% in 2015 to 54% in 2020 (4% each year). We foresee marketing-related costs to continue to rise due to international effort. Furthermore, since the good provided by the company is in a way a sort of commodity, with a lower degree going forward, customers are highly price and brand sensitive. Netflix should be able to attract new customers at a pace that approaches the historical growth rate and retain the already on-board clients through appropriate strategies. As the competition becomes stronger, we forecast that the historical 12% threshold will be breached and the company should commit at least 15% of its revenue in perpetuity. The other costs mainly summarized in the SG&A count for circa 15%, we would have said is in line with the average corporations in the market. An interesting brief look could be done at the D&A. Netflix is structured to have a very low depreciation of its tangible assets and this peculiarity could bias the EBITDA calculation. Summing up only the tangible depreciation, we could underestimate the company's EBITDA thinking the company is not able to auto-finance the operations. Instead, if we adjust the EBITDA for the intangible amortization incorporated into the COGS (as for GAAP standards), we obtain a more reliable figure. Just to have a clue of that concept, the company is currently trading at 85.3x on a GAAP basis and at 8.8x on an adjusted '16 forward basis. The company has not been able to generate cash yet. However, the breaking point is approaching. In 2015, the company burned more than $1.41bn of cash in order to support the international expansion. We expect the cash effort to continue for the next three years. Going forward, Netflix will benefit from its cash cow businesses (the domestic streaming and DVD rental by-mail services) replicating what happened for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and other giants of the high-tech industry. For that reason, we assume the company won't back its growth through any kind of fixed-income products but through internally generated cash. In order to be prudent, we modeled a neutral capital structure that did not add or subtract value from the equity value. It is reasonable to expect the company will just exploit a revolving facility to finance the working capital. Regarding this matter, we suppose Netflix will be able to both rationalize the cash commitment to support operations and generate cash from the accounts receivable/payment management. We modeled the adjusted D&A as we have already commented. Finally, we have assumed the CAPEX will be sustained in the near future, approaching the D&A in the perpetuity for normalization purposes. Summing up, we have approached the perpetuity with a WC able to generate cash for 1.6% of the revenues, D&A and Capex at 49% of the revenue, offsetting their opposite effects in the FCFO in the long run. The discount rate we used in the DCF has been probably the more theoretically challenging matter in the Netflix valuation. The company has a peculiar business mode, a pure first mover in a sense (if we look at the way it provides content), a pure follower in another sense (the media- entertainment industry is a long living industry) exposed the company to a very wide range of not-perfectly-comparable universe of players. We thought the best way to approach the WACC calculation was to observe what investment banks do. We took a consensus discount rate of 12.3% and we adjusted it using a rolling methodology, i.e. we decreased the discount rate on a yearly basis as long as the company gradually reduces its risk profile as long as its business model consolidates. To be considered that our WACC expresses a pure cost of equity as we modeled a neutral capital structure. Since the company has a high-growth profile, the utilization of a single phase terminal value wouldn't have been correct from a valuation standpoint. In fact, the company neither could grow at the current level in perpetuity nor could start to grow suddenly at a low rate. A more reasonable way to think is that Netflix will slowly approach a long-term FCFO CAGR. In that way, we modeled a three phase terminal value with three different, and decreasing, growth and discount rates. With those assumptions, an explosive 28.2% revenue CAGR, an increasing ability to manage the working capital, a decreasing risk profile and a perpetuity growth higher than what could be a reasonable long-run inflation rate, we could expect a monster valuation and a tremendous upside potential. Instead, those assumptions led us to a price of $81.7 per share! We leave you all the space to make all your comments on that price. We'd grant you the possibility to use our model. Just leave us the space to say that we run a table sensitivity to see which growth rates, using a 10.1% discount rate, could justify a $98 per share valuation. We ended up with a 7.2% rate. This means the market is currently assuming Netflix as a company able to increase cash generated from its business, after a five-year explicit forecast period in which the FCFO approaches $1bn, at a 7.1% CAGR in perpetuity. It sounds a little too much for us. Moreover, as for duty, we would like to point out that one of the top equity research analysts in the high-tech industry has a target price of $65, even lower than our "truth." Whoever wants to open a position in the next weeks could probably profit short selling the company keeping a long-term investment period.
