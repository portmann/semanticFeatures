Amazon Benefits Most From Cloud As A User - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's AWS revenues powered its stock higher. Despite the fact that Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) scored a net profit of $500 million on revenues of $2.1 billion from its AWS cloud during the third quarter, it should not consider a spin-off. From the Wall Street perspective this seems to make no sense. AWS probably carries a valuation of $110 billion, based on the trailing year's $7 billion of revenue, with a growth rate of 81% per year. This equals fully one-third the store's market-opening valuation of $291 billion. The rest of its estimated $100 billion in 2015 revenue is being valued at two times sales. But that $90 billion in volume, even if it's breakeven revenue, would not be coming in without AWS. Amazon could not handle the traffic needed to compel its vast network of warehouses to order vast arrays of merchandise and handle millions of customer visits each day without the AWS cloud. It could not stream its movies and TV offerings and music without its AWS cloud. It could not even dominate the book market without the AWS cloud. The chief benefits of cloud, in other words, continue to fall to the most effective users of cloud. They don't fall to the "arms merchants" of cloud, the companies that make the hardware or even write the software. They don't fall to the companies re-selling cloud capacity, either. Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ) CEO Jim Whitehurst explained all this at one of his company's Summit meetings a few years ago. He analogized computing to the machine age. Standard bolts, screws, and fittings didn't appear until 60 years after the Industrial Revolution began, in about 1750. Standards-based cloud computing also appeared roughly 60 years after the first computers did, which happened in the late 1940s. But what the Industrial Revolution brought forth, what it's known for, aren't the steam engines of the 1750s, or even the screws of 1810 powering Jacquard-card looms. (Jacquard looms were the grandfathers of IBM punch cards.) The Industrial Revolution brought forth planes, trains, and automobiles. It brought forward mass production for mass consumption of both consumer and industrial goods. In computing terms, the revolution has barely begun. The companies building cloud are creating an enabling technology for the 21st century. That revolution begins in services like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and in Amazon Prime. It's Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) itself, not the re-sale of the Google Cloud, which is the revolution. Even bigger profits will come to the products and services that follow these services into the market, the Internet of Things and the Internet of Systems, where the objects we use have networked intelligence and can serve us without our telling them what to do. It's what you do with the cloud that matters, not the cloud itself. It is Amazon customers use of the AWS cloud, what Amazon itself does with the cloud, which drives investors to buy Amazon stock today. Just as it is what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) does with its Azure cloud, selling software services, that will power its stock higher today, because of what Microsoft's customers do with that software. Don't try to separate AWS from Amazon, in other words, even though AWS revenues grew 17% from the June quarter to the September one, while the rest of the company is only growing at a 23% annual rate. The store powers the cloud, the cloud is just one product of the store, and that's what you want to focus on. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
