Verizon Is Well Positioned To Lead The U.S. Mobile Market - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Both AT&T and Verizon maintain very healthy dividend yields, though neither impresses when it comes to dividend growth. When comparing the United States' top mobile operators, Verizon and AT&T hold a competitive advantage in the spectrum each owns. Sprint's unlimited data plans may be providing more benefit to AT&T and Verizon than to Sprint itself. The US wireless market is marked by fierce competition, with the top mobile operators constantly vying for new customers and looking to steal competitors customers. Consumer bandwidth demands are growing rapidly, and operators must carefully balance capital spending for network maintenance and upgrades, technological choices, and evolving competitive data plans to navigate to the top as a market leader. This article discusses why Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) are well positioned as market leaders, and why Verizon may be best positioned for the top spot. Both AT&T and Verizon maintain very healthy dividend yields. Though the former currently leads the latter by a fair amount, neither one impresses when it comes to the rate of dividend growth, with both companies posting compound dividend growth rates in the 3-4% range over the last decade. Low dividend growth rates generally dissuade dividend growth investors. However, these telecom giants' high yields make them viable dividend growth investments when dividend reinvestment is part of the equation. AT&T currently yields 5.7%, with a 2.8% average compound growth rate over the last 8 years. In absolute terms, the company's dividend increase policy has been straightforward, with $0.01 increases. With the company continuing to increase dividends by the same amount every year, AT&T's dividend growth rate will continue to decline. Verizon trails AT&T with a current yield of 4.9%, although it posts better average compound growth at 3.5% over the last 8 years. Comparing the free cash flow payout ratio also suggests it has more room to grow its dividend than AT&T. Excluding the highest and lowest annual free cash flow payout ratios over the last decade produces an average free cash flow payout ratio of 47% for Verizon and 65% for AT&T. When compared to a generally accepted benchmark, SPY , both companies offer much higher yields at the expense of lower dividend growth, as shown in the following table. It should be noted that the dividend growth rates were calculated using the average of the rolling three- and five-year compound annual growth rates over the last 10 years to smooth out the data points. The table shows both Verizon and AT&T more than double the yield of SPY, but lag dividend growth over the last decade. It should also be pointed out that while distributions for SPY declined during the financial crises, both Verizon and AT&T continued to increase distributions. Verizon's decision to eliminate discounted phones for new customers may create an insurmountable barrier for some. However, if AT&T's take rate on its Next phone financing plan gives any indication regarding consumer preferences, that barrier may be limited. AT&T has reported that roughly two-thirds of its customers chose to finance their phones through Next, despite still offering subsidies with a two-year contract. This reveals that consumers would rather forgo subsidized phones and a contract and just pay the full phone price in monthly installments - a financing option that Verizon also offers. Verizon and AT&T's Spectrum Advantage When comparing the United States' top mobile operators, Verizon and AT&T hold a competitive advantage in the spectrum each owns. While the amount of spectrum owned is important, because it largely determines how much bandwidth an operator has to work with, spectrum frequency is also important. Lower-frequency signals hold an advantage over higher-frequency signals, because they propagate further and can penetrate obstacles, such as buildings and walls, better than high-frequency signals. This allows a carrier to cover more area with fewer towers than would otherwise be required. Verizon and AT&T own a significant portion of the available spectrum under 1-Ghz, as shown in the following graph. Sprint's Unlimited Data Likely Benefiting Competitors Sprint's unlimited data plans may be providing more benefit to AT&T and Verizon than itself. Offering unlimited data at a lower price would logically attract consumers that use more bandwidth, including some that may be considered bandwidth hogs. Conversion of these high-usage subscribers places more demand on Sprint's network, and the company is receiving less revenue than its competitors. I'm not sure that either AT&T or Verizon are overly disappointed in losing high-usage customers to Sprint. Conversely, a carrier's perfect customer is one who reliably pays their bill month after month, while placing low demand on the network. Sprint may be setting itself up for failure by aggressively attracting customers with its lower-cost, unlimited data plans. While the company owns plenty of spectrum to supply bandwidth, it isn't in the best position to leverage its spectrum and upgrade its network to keep up with demand. I believe the addition of high-usage, unlimited data customers will ultimately lead to major congestion problems on Sprint's network. The company's network already hasn't yielded very good download speeds, as the following FCC report graph illustrates. To further the potential problems, I have doubt in Sprint's ability to add capacity quickly enough to avoid inevitable disappointment among customers who switched from other carriers to take advantage of unlimited data plans. While AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) makes for an interesting triple-play offering, I think satellite TV will be right alongside cable TV with eroding core businesses as consumers switch to lower-cost alternatives such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Hulu, and Sling TV. As a side note, I also believe that satellite TV will be hurt more than cable companies, given that cable companies will still be able to fall back on providing the high-speed internet access required to reach online content. This isn't as much an issue for AT&T, since it is a major player in providing high-speed internet access. In the long run, AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV will provide minimal return and little benefit other than acting as a defensive measure to prevent some customers from switching to cable. This becomes less attractive when considering that more and more consumers are looking to avoid both traditional satellite and cable offerings for television services. This eventually leaves AT&T with just another network to maintain - something that Verizon is learning with its FiOS service. When it comes to mobile markets, high-speed network availability and fast connections are the name of the game. I believe Verizon is the best positioned to be the market leader moving forward, given its large network coverage, high customer loyalty, and sufficient spectrum to handle bandwidth demands. Moreover, the company has proven to be a leader in efficiency, as it has continually led in EBITDA per customer, as the following table shows. Finally, although AT&T and Verizon both have strong positions in the US mobile market, I believe AT&T won't be able to focus as much as Verizon in the wireless game due to distractions created by the DirecTV acquisition and testing the waters in Mexico. This is what will ultimately give Verizon the edge. Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ, T. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
