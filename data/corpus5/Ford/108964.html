Ford In The U.S.: First-Half 2015 Review And Outlook - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has turned in a mixed performance in the U.S. in the first half of 2015, falling behind the industry's growth and losing some market share. Ford, however, is making capacity investments in Mexico and focusing on the revival of the Lincoln brand in order to tap the luxury market. Ford has lined up a number of new cars and pick-up trucks in order to pick up pace in the North American market, which should help it gradually get better. 2014 was a year of transition for Ford (NYSE: F ), and this clearly reflects in its sales in North America. Last year, Ford's sales in North America declined close to 5.5% as the company focused on bringing new models such as the aluminum F-150 truck. In addition, Ford also underwent a CEO transition last year. However, 2015 hasn't turned out to be particularly good for Ford in North America either. The company has posted mixed results in the U.S., which is its largest segment in the continent that accounts for close to 45% of its overall sales. More specifically, the U.S. accounts for almost 39% of Ford's global sales. As such, in this article, we will take a closer look at the company's performance in this key market, and how it is positioned going forward. Ford sells its vehicles under two brand names in the U.S.: Ford and Lincoln. Both the brands have a line-up of cars as well as utility vehicles, while the Ford brand also offers trucks. All the three categories are equally important for Ford as the volume sales for each of them contributes to more than 30% of its total sales. However, Ford has not seen a perfect year so far in the U.S. It started off with a bang, but what followed was a series of not so impressive monthly performances. Ford ended the first half of the year with a sales figure of 1,293,621 units, up 1.86% from last year's 1,270,032 units. With three months of negative growth out of six, Ford is not looking good for the rest of the year at first sight. Comparing this with the overall U.S. auto industry, we get an even clearer picture. The industry has sold 8.5 million cars till the end of June. This amounts to an increase of 4% over the first half of last year. Thus, it is evident that Ford is lagging the overall market in the U.S. so far this year, as shown in the following charts: Ford has also lost some market share over the last 6 months. It had 15.5% of market share at the end of the second quarter last year, which has dropped to 15.1% this year. In June, the market share was 15.2% this year as compared to 15.6% last year for the same period. Hence, Ford's performance has not been up to the mark this year in the U.S., and this is a cause for concern as this particular market is growing at a steady pace. But, Ford is trying to make a comeback in the U.S. by way of different strategies. Let's take a look. In April this year, Ford announced an investment of $2.5 billion in Mexico to develop a new generation of engines and transmissions. The company will be setting up manufacturing facilities in Chihuahua and Guanjuato for these purposes. Further, on Ford's priority list is the revival of its struggling luxury brand, Lincoln. Automotive News quoted CEO Mark Fields saying, "From a profitability standpoint and from a presence standpoint, it's really important for us to be part of [the luxury market] and to be there when Ford customers want to step up." This is an important priority for Ford, as by sales volume, the global luxury market is only 10% of the total number of vehicles sold in the world. But, nearly one-third of the industry's profits come from this segment. For the same reason, Ford is planning to invest heavily in the Lincoln brand. In addition, Ford will launch the next generation of its medium duty trucks built in America for America. The truck will be launched under the series name 2016 F-650-750 and will also include tractors to cover a broader spectrum. The 2016 Ford Focus RS will be also rolled out in the spring of 2016. It will offer new Ford Performance All-Wheel Drive with Dynamic Torque Vectoring. In addition, the Raptor's next-generation, the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor will hit the North American market in the fall of 2016. It will be more powerful and lighter in weight as compared to its current generation model. As a result, customers can expect better fuel efficiency figures from this model. Also, due to be launched in late 2016 is the Ford GT that will deliver a mix of performance and aerodynamics. Now, driven by these new launches and investments, Ford is trying to bring about some consistency in its sales performance in the U.S., which has been lacking so far this year. A key reason behind Ford's weakness in the U.S. so far this year can be attributed to the growing clout of competitors such as General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Volkswagen (OTCQX: VLKAY ). While GM is its traditional rival, the recent initiatives undertaken by Volkswagen, the second-largest car maker in the world, could pose a key threat to Ford going forward. For instance, in May and June, Volkswagen's sales in the U.S. increased 8.07% and 5.58%, respectively, as compared to last year. In comparison, as we saw above, Ford's growth was negative in May, while it managed just 1.61% growth in June. This indicates that the likes of Volkswagen are taking market share away from Ford in the U.S. Looking ahead, Volkswagen will try to sustain its momentum in the U.S. market as it has planned a multi-billion dollar investment in the region. For example, Volkswagen is on track to invest $7 billion in North America over the next five years as a part of its strategy of achieving 1 million units in sales of the VW brand in the region by 2018. As such, the company will be constructing a couple of new plants over here, taking its total plants to 4. More specifically, VW will invest $900 million at Chattanooga to make a new, 7-seater SUV. In my opinion, this is a good move from VW since the market for SUVs and crossovers in the U.S. is growing at a fast pace. For instance, so far in 2015, the sales in this segment have increased 12.9%, so VW is moving in the right direction to tap growth in the U.S. Thus, in my opinion, Ford will need to step up its game in the market if it is to overcome the likes of Volkswagen and improve its market share. The first half of this year has not been great for Ford in North America, especially the U.S. But, driven by the launch of new models and investments in engine and transmission technologies, Ford could gain some momentum going forward. Since this is a key market for Ford and contributes a substantial portion to its revenue, it will have an important bearing on its overall performance. Thus, investors should not count on a comeback at Ford's North American operations going forward despite a mixed first half of 2015.
