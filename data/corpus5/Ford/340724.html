Automakers Getting Run Over, Part 3: I Won't Say 'I Told You So' - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha February auto sales figures are out for GM and Ford, and they've made a strong declaration. Stock price is starting to recover after being slammed hard into the ground over the past six months. Panic on China's economic woes were responsible for unrest with U.S. investors, but the faith in the system is back; hopefully, here to stay. If the analysts were right at the end of last year, we should have ideally fallen off the auto sales cliff by now. Nothing of the sort seems to be happening. The way Mr. Market hammered auto stocks over the past several months you'd think something as serious as a major recession was in the offing. That's how furiously U.S. auto majors Ford's and General Motors' stock value eroded. The automobile market is a cyclic one for sure, but the ferocity with which the market has treated GM (NYSE: GM ) and Ford (NYSE: F ) isn't justified. Looking at their market cap collapse over the period in question will show you how true this is: From $60 billion levels in April 2015, they've both moved dangerously close to $40 billion - GM more so than Ford. Note: I covered this in more detail in my prior two articles on the subject. I invite you to review Part 1 and Part 2 for an overview on the situation over the past months. Things seem to be looking up, however, over the past three weeks. Specifically, since February 11, soon after January sales figures were published and crushed all predictions of doom for both companies. Will this upward trend continue? Is there enough evidence to suggest an upsurge in both stocks over the rest of this quarter and beyond? The data clearly leads to that conclusion, as I will show. What Happened to Mr. Market Over the Past Few Months? I just never got my head around one thing: Everybody believed that 17+ million was the peak auto sales number, and the U.S. auto market has been hovering around that 16-17+ million level since February 2014 - and even breaking the 18 million barrier during the final quarter of 2015. The market knew of the 16-17 million trend, yet kept pushing GM and F on an upward trajectory right until April 2015, when it suddenly woke up to reality and started pushing the stocks disproportionately downward. Then in September, when the market realized that the peak was yet to come, it again reversed its path and briefly pushed stock prices up for about four weeks, after which it yet again reversed itself and pushed the stocks back to 2013 levels. Talk about volatile! This isn't what you would expect in one of the most analysed and closely watched industries in the world. The only plausible defense for such a crush is because, before 2015, there wasn't any fear of a slowdown. But after the Chinese economy took a beating, the market started to feel the fear and pushed the panic button on one of the key industries that highly correlates with the general health of the economy. Now, though, the market is again coming to the realization that "peak auto" was not, in fact, the crest before the deep trough in the wave-like nature of auto sales. The auto stocks in question are slowly picking up their broken teeth and making their way up the value vine once again. But first, let's take a look at U.S. figures as a whole and then, specifically, GM's and Ford's first two months' sales for 2016. This should give us a much better view of how things are likely to move forward, and stop all the guessing and uncertainty around this vital market. Light Weight Vehicle Sales in the United States I've first shown January and February auto sales for the lightweight vehicle segment in the United States. As you can see below, January was a healthy 17.451 million units for the industry as a whole, and February was close behind at 17.426. Not a significant drop in sales over the period. The data above shows that the economy can still support a 17 million level sales volume in this vehicle segment. This is a critical point because most previous analyses on the subject predicted a doomsday period post the December highs for both General Motors and Ford. As we can clearly see from the above, that is not the state of the industry. But does that mean GM and F are home free? Not in the least. We'll have to dig deeper to see what their January and February sales numbers were, and compare that with the same period last year. First, however, I'd like to talk briefly about the current state of the economy because that is one of the pulse points for how the auto industry will fare. In the quarterly analysis, you can see some random distribution that indicates occasional downturns during a particular quarter, but then look at this excerpt from Statista , along with the graph below it: The GDP increased to about 17.9 trillion U.S. dollars in 2015. According to the BEA the deceleration in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected downturns in private inventory investment and in federal government spending and a deceleration in exports that were partly offset by a deceleration in imports and an acceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Rather than showing signs of an impending recession, it points to a much more stable economy than before. Obviously, there are numerous forces at play within the world's largest economy, but Real GDP is a reasonable indicator of the general healthy of any economy. Some might rightly argue that there are several reasons why Real GDP is not an accurate measure of an economy's welfare, but for the purpose of this particular analysis, it's as deep as I want to get. Now for the real test! Let's see if overall U.S. sales and the Real GDP can accurately reflect the sales performance of the top automakers in the country. As you can see from the graph above, Ford's January sales were nearly 5,000 units down from last year but still at a healthy 173,000+ units. February, however, was a surprise to many, with the company racking up nearly as much as they did in September 2015 when their stock started climbing briefly before the collapse again towards the last week of October. Now, with strong sales during the first two months, and the seasonal increases expected in March and May, I see F going up significantly over the remainder of the quarter and into Q2. In GM's case, too, the trend is very similar, with the exception that their January sales were better in 2016 than the year before - although only by 1,000 units or so. February again surprised many by showing strong signs of expansion over the previous month. If the cyclic pattern holds - which I think it will - then we can see more sales increases right through May, as we saw in Ford's case. If you look at the stock chart for GM, it shows almost the exact same pattern as F. Investor-speak: Are They Out of the Slump? I believe both stocks are on their way to recovery. Even though two months may be too short a period of time in which to make a future assumption over several quarters, I see both stocks' prices increasing at a healthy rate over the next three months at least - and possibly beyond. It seems now that the market has realized that a recession is not on the horizon for the foreseeable future. Panic over China's sudden economic shocker was bound to make U.S. investors head for the hills, but I think that period is finally over, and we can see some gains for GM and Ford over Q1 and Q2 this year. As I showed in my articles about GM's ( General Motors: What is your Rationale for Investing? ) and Ford's ( Ford's Dividend Payout - An Attractive Proposition ) dividends, both companies are in a good position to keep paying dividends for a long time, and the sales growth along with stock price growth now - if sustained - will only make them stronger, and more attractive investment destinations for your money.
