Ford's 2016 Prospects Looking Positive - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is well positioned to succeed in 2016. New models will continue to increase profits and drive buyers to dealerships. Lincoln's progress should continue with the unveiling of the Continental. In several articles of late, automotive journalists have penned something to the effect of: "2015 was a great year to be an auto enthusiast." Newly revised models, with historic bloodlines like Mustang, Camaro, and Challenger made the rounds on the international auto show circuit. Throughout much of last year, however, I wondered whether this year will be a good year to be an auto investor. The "Big Three" U.S. automakers, Ford (NYSE: F ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ), and Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ), are in various stages of recovery. The automotive world, as we all know, was rocked by the Great Recession. GM entered bankruptcy protection, emerging with an IPO in 2010. Chrysler became owned by a combination of the UAW pension fund, the U.S. and Canadian governments, and ultimately, Italian automaker Fiat . Finally, Ford avoided government ownership, though it did receive a loan through the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In this article, I will address some of the challenges faced by Ford Motor Company while highlighting its various strengths. However, to avoid beating a dead horse, I'll refrain from discussing Ford's P/E ratio, which remains a contentious issue. Whether you agree with Ford longs or not, the stock's 4% dividend and apparent upside potential make it a compelling investment. Under the stewardship of Alan Mulally , Ford weathered the Great Recession, emerging well-positioned to succeed in the long term. The company reorganized with a government-backed line of credit secured through the TARP program and worked to streamline its operations by selling off several of its various brands. Today, the company is much stronger than it was prior to the recession. In the wake of the financial crisis, Ford worked to improve its small-car offerings, which faced (and continue to face) strong competition from foreign competitors. Focus and Fusion models, popular abroad, have gained a following in the United States. Halo models like the Fiesta ST, Focus ST and Focus RS have achieved critical acclaim. Ford's reworked Mustang, according to Bloomberg, is now the muscle car to beat . The car is Ford's first global Mustang; it is now being sold in 100 countries , introducing the Ford brand to buyers the world over. The biggest news from Dearborn as of late has been the success of the F-150, widely seen as Ford's most important model. Most estimates suggest that the F-150 and its derivatives provide the bulk of Ford's profits, both at home and abroad. The automaker has published encouraging sales numbers for the new truck, whose aluminum-intensive body is a segment first. Average transaction prices are on the rise, as is an increase in profit generated by each vehicle, according to various reports. Rumor has it that GM is looking to develop an aluminum-bodied Silverado and Sierra to compete. Ford's Expedition and Navigator models are likely to receive the same aluminum treatment in their next generation, goosing gas mileage and ATPs. Brand loyalty remains strong in the pickup segment, though generous incentives from GM and Ram could cause some Ford fans to jump ship. As Ford worked to bring a second plant online, the truck's availability remained spotty. However, Ford's Kansas City Assembly Plant came online nearly a year ago, and the truck's updates for 2016 aim to keep it competitive. At the 2015 Detroit Auto Show, Ford debuted its new GT . This halo car, in concert with the redesigned Raptor, will continue to stir interest in the brand, increasing traffic into dealerships around the world. The company's resurrected Lincoln Continental not only looks great, but should encourage luxury buyers from markets including North America and China to consider the brand. The company continues to face currency challenges in Venezuela and slow growth in Brazil, an important foreign market. The success of Lincoln's introduction and continued growth in China remains to be seen, but initial signs appear positive. Ford faces strong domestic competition from Chevy's Silverado and recently redesigned Camaro. Unfortunately for the company's bottom line, Lincoln's models do not command the margins achieved by offerings from BMW, Porsche, Lexus and Audi. In this case, Ford might actually regret selling off its European luxury brands (Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin) in the midst of the financial crisis. Though Lincoln certainly has name recognition, especially in places like China, it appears that perhaps it does not possess the panache Ford's management might have believed it did. The bottom line, however, is that Ford continues to have a low valuation, and it pays a great dividend. The company's stock remains highly cyclical, with high costs and slim margins. Unfortunately, the company no longer benefits from an ultra luxury brand to drive profits after it sold off Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin, but it is a solid investment today.
