Ford Shares Offer Income, Growth, And Value - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The stock is conservatively 15% to 20% undervalued. The all new F-150 will be a key driver for the company's near-term growth. Ford recently increased its dividend by 20%, and more dividend increases are planned over the next three years. Ford is projected to grow earnings 17% annually over the next five years, yet the company trades at just 9 times forward earnings. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) is the type of stock that is hard to find in this frothy market; a high-yielding growth stock that is undervalued. Due to a decrease in 2014 earnings, shares have lagged the market significantly. For the one year period, the stock has managed a 7.6% return while the S&P has gained just over 13%. With the introduction of the new F-150, 24 other new models, and a strengthened balance sheet with plenty of cash for dividend increases and share buybacks, investors seeking value, growth and income may want to consider picking up some shares while they are still cheap. With robust projected earnings growth over the next five years, shares may not stay cheap for long. At the heart of my bullish opinion of the stock is the launch of the first-ever aluminum-alloy body pickup truck, the 2015 F-150. Sales of this highly-sought after truck have been robust. This line has been Ford's bestselling vehicle year after year. The F-series has been the bestselling vehicle in the United States for 33 years and the country's best-selling truck for 38 years. The 2015 iteration in no exception. In January, the F-Series had its strongest sales month since 2004, which was the best sales year ever for Ford. Sales of the pickup are so strong that Ford has not been able to meet demand. The trucks are only staying on dealer lots for an average of 18 days as opposed to an average of 105 days for full-size, light duty pickups. Earlier this month, Ford began production of the F-150 at a second plant in Kansas City. The company recently invested $1.1 billion to expand and retool the plant to accommodate production of the F-150. This is in addition to the Dearborn, Michigan truck plant where to date all of the new models have been produced. This second plant will help Ford meet the strong demand. In a press release, Joe Hinichs, Ford president for The Americas stated , "With production starting at Kansas City Assembly, we are better poised to start meeting growing customer demand for our pickup." The F-150 will be a huge driver of revenue for the company going forward, and now the company appears to be equipped to meet the booming demand. After an abysmal 2014, Ford and analysts expect much improvement. I believe the current share price reflects the pessimism of the recent performance as opposed to the forthcoming growth the company will experience. If we look at the stock's current value relative to future growth expectations, it is clear that the current share price does not reflect Ford's promising future. At first glance, a P/E of nearly 21 times earnings may imply that Ford is fairly or even richly valued. If we look however, at next year's estimated EPS of $1.87 we get a forward P/E of 8.8. The stock's average P/E for the last five years has been 8.3 so it is trading at about its average. If we apply the company's projected five-year EPS growth rate of 17% to the 2015 estimate we get projected 2016 EPS of $2.19. If we apply the current multiple of 8.8 to this earnings figure, we get a share price of $19.27, or roughly a 15% premium to the current share price. Ford spent $35 billion between 2009 and 2013 to reduce its debt, fund pensions and strengthen its balance sheet. The company is expected to now begin using this cash to reward shareholders. Stern Agee analyst Michael Ward, who has a one-year price target of $20 a share, expects Ford to spend $15 billion over the next five years on debt reduction and pensions, but close to $30 billion on dividends and share buybacks . Over the next three years the dividend is expected to hit 70 cents. This renewed commitment to returning value to shareholders bodes well for the company's future share price. Ford increased its quarterly dividend by 20% in January. As a result, the stock currently yields 3.6% based on an annual dividend of 60 cents and the current share price of roughly $16.50. Based on EPS of 79 cents, this equates to a payout ratio north of 75%. At first pass, this would be a red flag. If a company pays out more than 100% of its earnings in the form of dividends, then the company is giving shareholders more money than it is making. While that is not the case here, it is a high payout ratio. This is really not a concern. Again, if we consider the company's improving outlook, the current payout ratio becomes irrelevant. I believe a more accurate picture is to look forward. Ford obviously has a lot of faith in its future considering the company just upped its dividend in January. If we look at the 60 cents in terms of next year's projected earnings of $1.59, we get a payout ratio of 38%, which is much more palatable. Assuming that the forecast is correct, and Ford's dividend reaches 70 cents in three years and the third year's EPS are $2.19, that would represent a payout ratio of only 32%. The fact that Ford is willing to increase the dividend during a time when earnings are down speaks volumes as to management's confidence in future earnings projections. One of the major causes of the slowdown in Ford's business has been its overseas operations. Slowing economies and currency valuation impacted the bottom line significantly . The company in its fourth quarter report gave its 2015 business environment overview. In short, Ford is looking for the global economy to expand by 3%, led by the US and China. They are predicting global sales of approximately 90 million units. The company believes that European business will improve due to improvements in that region's economies. The report also noted that Russia and South America will continue to be a drag on results, but that South America will see improvements. Finally, the company is forecasting a pre-tax profit of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2015. Wall Street seems somewhat optimistic about the company's near-term future as well. Analysts expect Ford to earn $1.59 EPS in the current year and then $1.87 EPS in 2016. Analyst expect a 37% increase in earnings this year as opposed to the 17.6% for the industry and a paltry 2.7% earnings growth for the S&P. Next year is when the Street expects Ford to separate itself from the crowd. The company is expected to grow EPS 17.6% compared to 2.7% for the industry and 13.2% for the S&P. Most importantly, analysts expect Ford to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 17% over the next five years. This metric alone implies Ford's stock is substantially undervalued. The following chart illustrates just how undervalued Ford is relative to its expected growth and the expected of its industry, sector and the overall market. As we all know, the auto industry is cyclical, and sales and profits can all but disappear in an economic downturn. Much of Ford's optimistic outlook is dependent upon continued economic improvement in the U.S. and Europe, as well as continued robust growth in Asia. South America will most likely continue to be a drag on Ford's results. Currency concerns, most notably the strengthening dollar and weakening Euro could also limit Ford's recovery in Europe. Other unknowns such as the public's rejection of Ford's new models, or a massive recall could greatly impede Ford's ability to reach its growth targets. Ford seems to be moving in the right direction. The new F-150 is selling faster than Ford can make them, but the new Kansas City plant will help Ford meet this demand and fatten the company's bottom line. Ford launched 24 new models world-wide last year, which should help Ford regain lost market share. The company has spent billions to shore up pensions and pay down debt and is now ready to return cash to shareholders, as evidenced by a recent 20% dividend increase. Ford's shares are undervalued at current levels, but with 17% annual projected EPS growth over the next five years, they probably won't stay cheap for long. The stock should be trading at $19 to $20 a share within the next two years, representing a 15%-20% premium to the stock's current price. Patient investors can earn a 3.6% dividend yield while they wait for share price appreciation.
