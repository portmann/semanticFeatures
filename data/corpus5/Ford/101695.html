Ford: No More Excuses Please - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has been range bound over the past two years. The next 6 months are very important for the company as it can't afford any more hiccups. The demand for Ford's new F-150 is high and the company needs to solve the frame-shortage problem as early as possible. The new F-150 recorded the highest ever selling price for the month of May and has potential to considerably boost the company's bottom-line. The last two years have been pretty frustrating for Ford (NYSE: F ) investors as the company has failed to live up to the promises. The stock has been range-bound, and the company has been plagued with many unforeseen headwinds. The slowdown in the Brazilian economy and slower-than-expected revival rate in Europe has kept a lid on Ford's stock. To make matters worse, the sales of Ford's main revenue generator-F-150-are also falling due to the production constraints. Ford was expected to reach full production speed in the second half of 2015 and the Blue Oval cannot afford any more slip-ups. Ford has no further room for error and needs to deliver in the second half of 2015 to gain investor confidence. Earlier this month, Ford released sales statistics for May. Sales of the company's full-size pickups were down close to 10% while General Motors (NYSE: GM ) posted solid gains. Ford is losing market share to peers. However, the company's falling sales aren't a result of lack of demand but production constraints. Ford sold over 300,000 trucks in the first five months of 2015, and the number would have been much higher if the company had produced the trucks at desired capacity. Ford took a huge risk in switching to aluminum, especially after commanding a strong position in the U.S. as the F-Series has been America's highest selling vehicle for 33 years. While the demand for Ford's new F-150 is high, the company has been faced with supply shortage as the two facilities making the trucks were being retooled. Consequently, Ford has lost market share to peers. However, Ford should be able to manufacture at the maximum capacity in the coming months as CFO Bob Shanks recently confirmed that the company has finished ramping up production of the 2015 F-150 at both plants that build the aluminum-bodied pickups. Although the shortage of supplier-built frames has restricted the plants from running some scheduled overtime, Ford expects to counterbalance it by removing the conventional two-week shutdown at its factories this year. While sales are down, the 2015 F-150 is clearly generating more revenue per sale than its predecessors. The truck averaged a price tag of $43,300 in May, $3,000 more than last year. The average selling price has also increased by $900 since March. $43,300 was a record for the F-150. The higher average selling price, or ASP, has partially offset the plunge in sales. And if Ford manages to reach its goal of selling 800,000 F-Series trucks in 2015, it will contribute over $10 billion to the company's bottom-line. One thing that investors should not worry about is the demand. As per TrueCar, demand for the F-150 has forced GMC, Chevrolet, and Ram to offer more discounts on their trucks so as to keep Ford from stealing market share. TrueCar President John Krafcik said : "The initial success of the all-new aluminum body F-series is undeniable. We project that positive sales and revenue momentum will continue and expect automakers within the full-size segment to offer larger-than-usual discounts to remain competitive." The 2015 F-150 has received positive reviews and given the high demand, I think Ford will find it easy sell 800,000 vehicles if it manages to produce them at desired rates. The next two quarters are extremely important for Ford as the company can't afford any more hiccups. The company has already sold over 300,000 F-Series trucks and shouldn't have a problem in reaching its target if production remains at desired levels for the remaining part of 2015. Due to the high ASP, the new F-150 will considerably increase Ford's bottom-line. Ford has a juicy dividend yield of 4%, and I think investors should continue to hold the stock for the next two quarters to see if Ford finally lives up to its promises.
