Don't Knock Ford, Another Record Year Is On Tap - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha US auto sales plunged -6% in May, but was not unexpected. Ford sales fell in May, also not unexpected. YTD sales are tracking higher than last year, full year outlook remains strong. Labor trends, regardless of the May NFP, support ongoing auto sales. Don't knock Ford, it's built... Ford Tough! US auto sales fell a not-so-surprising -6% in May. The headline, for those unprepared, may have been a shock but when you factor in the loss of an entire calendar weekend the numbers are not so bad. Due to calendar shifts, the 2015 May included 5 full weekends with Memorial day falling on the 4th weekend. In 2016, May had only 4 weekends with Memorial Day falling on the last. Considering that weekends are the top selling days for the entire auto industry and that the final weekend of a month the strongest of all it makes sense that sales data would be affected. Ford (NYSE: F ) sales in May also fell -6%, in line with the broader industry, due to slowing sales in passenger vehicles. A shift in mix, however, resulted in a 9% jump in May truck sales (+7% YTD), the best May for Van sales in 38 years, a 7% increase in May Lincoln sales (+15% YTD) and a 9% increase in SUV sales (a new record level). Digging deeper into the data it becomes clear that Ford is still on track for yet another record year. The entire auto industry is expected to sell over 17.7 million cars, a 1.15% increase over 2015, and Ford is set to do at least that well. On a year-to-date basis, Ford US sales are tracking +4.2% over last year with a favorable change in sales mix upping the average transaction price by more than $1,500. On a global basis, Ford's sales are also strong and trending higher. The EU/Asia data for May is not yet available but looking to the April data, we can see gains in both regions. EU sales were up 4% in April and are up 9% year-to-date. In China, April sales were up 7%, and also up 7% year-to-date. Labor Markets Support Auto Sales Growth In their monthly conference call to discuss the sales data, Ford execs stated that labor trends are supporting auto sales. Byan Bezold, Ford Senior Economist - From the conference call transcript: U.S. economic conditions, particularly the household sector remained broadly supportive of industry sales at the current run rate. To-date, the labor market continues its gradual recovery, producing both job and income gains for households The May NFP numbers may call that into question but really, that number is extremely flawed and does not quite jibe with ALL the other data. For one, the NFP margin of error is 115,000. This means the average number of new jobs over the past year, roughly 210,000, could be anywhere from 95,000 to 325,000. That being said, job creation is important but not the only thing driving labor markets. Additionally, there is talk that an increase in productivity during the quarter could be hampering new hires; if productivity increases new laborers are not needed for growth. As for the "other" labor data, job openings and hires are trending at all time highs, total claims for unemployment are trending near historic lows, average hourly earnings are up 2.5% over the past year, the quits rate is running at historic highs (led by construction workers) and together equal a positively trending KCF Labor Market Conditions Index . For those of you unfamiliar with the KCF LMCI, it is an aggregate of 24 labor market indicators used by the Fed to judge the labor market. It has moved above 0 in recent months, the first time since before the housing crisis, and is indicating economic boom on the horizon. The analysts see Ford earnings and revenue on the rise as well. Since the last earnings release, estimates for the current quarter, the full year, and next year have risen. The only negative I can see is that next quarter estimates have fallen, but not enough to hurt. Current quarter estimates have risen 9% over the past 60 days, full year estimates are up 6.6%. Next year estimates are up 5%. On a year over year basis, these estimates equal a 7.6% increase over 2015 and another 2% in 2017. Looking to full-year 2016 estimates, the low of 18 analysts is still $2.00, a 3.5% gain over 2015, with the high of $2.25, a 16.5% increase over 2015. Analyst price targets are also promising. The median estimate of $15 is a 15% increase over current share prices. The mean estimate of $15.87 is a 22% gain. Based on P/E, the stock is also undervalued. The stock tends to trade in a range between 3X and 12X earnings and at current levels is about 6X last year's earnings, and about 5.75X next year's earnings. Simply bringing share price up so that forward P/E matches trailing, we could get a $1 of gain, if the stock moves up to the high end of the range, forward or trailing P/E, could add $8 or more to current prices. Even with the rosy picture that sales and labor data paint, there are some risks for Ford and the entire industry. One is the ride-sharing economy. Companies like Uber and Lyft are feared to cut into sales of new and used cars but studies have shown that more and more Millennials, the primary users of these services, want to own their own cars and that the majority of Americans will choose to own their own vehicle . It is estimated that the number of Millennials who want their own vehicles has risen by 25% over the past 3 years, from 27% of demographic to about 32%. The expected impact of ride-sharing is only about 1% of sales per year. Discounts are a growing concern for the entire industry. Automakers are relying more and more on discounts and other incentives to drive sales and posted a 7.1% increase in May alone. Leases and fleet rentals are part and parcel to this issue. March data shows that leases were about 33% of all sales and are expected to have an impact on future sales as a glut of used cars hits the market. Another is recalls. Ford has recently issued another recall due to brake/master cylinder issues with the F-150s, but it is not likely to become a major problem. This issue has been going on for many years and Ford, unlike GM, has long recognized the value in addressing these problems as the potential costs of accidents are far greater than merely correcting troublesome parts. Yet another, and one that may be the most pressing, is the record levels of consumer auto loans on the market. According to Experian, the total amount of auto debt in the market has topped $1 trillion, a record high. Fueling this is a new high average loan, above $30,000, with record high payments, above $500. The average length of loans is 68 months, nearly 6 years, meaning a car bought today will not be paid off until mid-2022. The most alarming thing is that sub-prime is on the rise making the nature of the loans more risky for automakers as well as more expensive for consumers. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) says the market is "a little stretched" and that someone is going to get hurt. That someone will likely be the consumers as well as the automakers if/when the bubble bursts and debt shuts down the market. Ford's inventory may also be a concern, especially if you are in the camp that sees economic slowdown on the horizon. Inventory fell from April to May, by -2.5%, but is up year over year by 21%. There are mitigating factors, ramped up production with the new Aluminum bodied F-150s is one, and management expects to see sales volume increase into the second half of the year which will alleviate the issue. The risk is that the economy will slow and sales will not pick up which would increase the need for incentives, mark downs and other revenue-eroding practices. May sales figures were a bit of a disappointment, if only on the headline, but the year to date numbers and the forward outlook negate them. If you believe in the strength of the US labor market, prospects for economic growth and the positioning of Ford as I do the company is set to have another record breaking year, and another one after that. With that in mind valuation is low, perhaps very low, and leaves quite a bit of room for the stock to move higher. Add in the dividend, about 4.5% at today's share prices, and the chance of another special dividend at the end of this year, owning this stock becomes a no-brainer. Risks exist, but when do they not when it comes to investing, the risks with Ford are manageable and do not raise significant concern at this time.
