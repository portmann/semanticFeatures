Come On, Admit It, An Investment In GM Is A No-Brainer - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha General Motors released U.S. sales for the month of May on Tuesday. General Motors grew domestic car sales by 3.0% AND beat the consensus estimate of a 1.0% year-over-year decline. General Motors has begun to outperform Ford Motor; in terms of sales growth and share performance. Ford Motor will likely catch up to General Motors when production runs on full capacity in 2H15. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) reported their monthly domestic sales figures for May on Tuesday and the two auto companies both beat the consensus estimates. For the month of May, General Motors reported 3.0% higher total vehicle sales compared to last year. During the last month, General Motors sold 293,097 vehicles as opposed to 284,694 vehicles a year ago. General Motors' total vehicle sales did not only grew at a healthy clip year-over-year, but they also managed to beat the analyst consensus estimate of a one percent decline in sales. Like in past months, General Motors' GMC brand saw double-digit year-over-year growth in total sales. In May, the GMC brand sold 50,657 vehicles in the United States, reflecting a 12.5% growth rate -- the highest of General Motors' brand portfolio last month. General Motors' flagship brand, Chevrolet, grew sales 1.4% to 207,970 vehicles. Year-to-date, General Motors has now sold 1,246,192 vehicles compared to 1,188,407 vehicles that were sold during the first five months of 2014. Year-to-date, General Motors saw an increase in vehicle sales of 4.9%. More importantly, General Motors has been performing much better than Ford Motor lately, at least in terms of total sales. Consider Ford Motor, General Motors' main rival in the United States, which reported a 1.3% decline in U.S. vehicle sales in May . Ford did manage to beat sales expectations -- the consensus was for a decline in sales of 3.3% --, but General Motors' results were undoubtedly better than Ford's. Further, Ford Motor's year-to-date sales increased only 1.9% to 1,067,974 vehicles, which is significantly lagging General Motors' year-to-date sales growth rate of 4.9%. In fairness, though, Ford Motor is still ramping up production for the F-150 and the reality is that Ford will likely see more positive sales momentum in the second half of the year and in 2016 when production is running on full capacity. General Motors has begun to outperform Ford Motor since the start of the year. Year-to-date, General Motors' shares have returned 3.75% whereas Ford's shares have actually lost 1.55% in value. General Motors' comparatively better sales growth and generous capital return plan are the main reasons why investors have come to prefer General Motors over Ford Motor lately. Further, the auto industry has moved on from the recall crisis that dragged the sector down in 2014 and that made investors scale back their auto investments. Some of those investors have already come back in late 2014, attracted by appealing reward-to-risk ratios in the domestic auto sector and by the realization that Mr. Market overreacted to the recall dilemma. When it comes down to sales growth, General Motors is the way to go here, although both auto manufacturers remain comically cheap at 7-8x forward earnings. The extremely low valuations imply a large margin of safety for an investment in both General Motors and Ford Motor. General Motors' sales growth is healthy and has been much better than Ford's. Since General Motors' shares also yield 3.98%, an investment in this auto manufacturer is really a no-brainer.
