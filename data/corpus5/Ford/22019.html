Ford: Still Positive Even After A March Decline In The U.S. - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 3.4% decline in U.S. auto sales in March 2015 compared to March 2014 as the new F-150 aluminum-bodied model increased production levels. Ford has sold 12.5K more Mustangs in the U.S. than the Chevrolet Camaro has so far in 2015 in an effort to be the best selling 2015 U.S. muscle car. Ford remains well positioned to take advantage of the booming U.S. auto industry going forward and is a strong long-term investment. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced March 2015 U.S. vehicle sales of 235,929, down from 244,167 the same month in 2014. This approximately 3.4% decline came in slightly better than the 5.4% decline expected by analysts. Of the major automakers , Honda's (NYSE: HMC ) decline of 5.3% and Volkswagen's (OTCQX: VLKAY ) decline of 18.2% were the only auto companies to have larger declines in U.S. sales when comparing March 2015 with March 2014. Ford trailed behind other U.S. automakers, with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) decreasing 2.4% and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) increasing 1.7%. With the frigid February weather behind us, Ford continued to stagger behind competition despite the industry's expectations to sell approximately 17 million new automobiles in 2015. Even with the slow start to 2015, I'm remaining patient on Ford going forward and believe there were a lot of positives to take away from the March 2015 U.S. sales conference call. The Ford F-150 production is ramping up as the Kansas City assembly plant is expected to reach full production levels in quarter 2. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors. This conservative pricing allowed the company to increase the F-Series transaction price by $2,100 in March 2015 compared to March 2014. After talking with an individual that recently was shopping for a new pick-up truck, he confirmed that Ford was holding to their sticker price, while GM and Toyota (NYSE: TM ) were offering significant discounts. Given the excitement over the new aluminum bodied model and loyalty to the F-Series, I believe a lot of customers are holding off purchasing the new model and are waiting for future price incentives. Despite the inventory issues, Ford truck sales still saw an increase of 3.8%. With only 29% of the new F-150 sales in March being the new model, I believe the company will rebound as the newer model inventory issues are resolved. This will allow the company to start being more aggressive with their incentives and the customers waiting for the new model's price to be reduced will start buying. The excitement over the new aluminum-bodied model is evident in the average turn time of 18 days, which continues to show that the new design is being accepted by new consumers. Consistent with my view of Ford's February U.S. sales announcement, I think it is important for Ford to get this product launch right as they are taking the F-series brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage. With optimal inventory levels expected later this year, I think it's important to look at the average turn time of the model and the overall health of the U.S. economy. Both of these indicators are indicative of a positive second half of 2015 for the F-150 and Ford as a whole. In March 2015, the U.S. auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuel efficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices. This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the company's higher profit margin vehicles such as the F-150, Explorer and Expedition. Consistent with February results, the Mustang saw impressive gains in March. Mustang sales were up 61% year-over-year after taking advantage of the 21% growth in the sports car segment. The Mustang was responsible for 61% of that growth as it continues to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. Through the first quarter of 2015 , Ford has sold an impressive 29,811 Mustangs compared to only 17,320 new Camaros. I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the U.S. economy improves. Given my long-term approach with Ford, I'm not worried about the year-over-year decrease reported in March. Ford still reported the second highest U.S. sales figure in March, slightly behind GM, and there are opportunities to grow. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 ramps up production, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the return of the Mustang. With the consumer purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth. I remain bullish on the U.S. automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the near 4% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term. Note: The following table was used to populate the graphs.
