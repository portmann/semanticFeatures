Ford's November Report Shows Impressive Average Transaction Price Gains - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 0.5% increase in U.S. auto sales in November 2015 compared to November 2014. However, the company posted a $4,000 average transaction price increase. The aluminum-bodied F-150 is seeing positive customer reception and the company announced plans to make a significant capital investment to upgrade a pickup truck plant. As the U.S. economy stays strong, Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming U.S. automotive market. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced November 2015 US vehicle sales of 188K, up 0.5% from the same month in 2014. This small incremental increase came in below expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of 3.2%. Despite missing expectations again, Ford utilized strong F-Series and Van demand to post the best November truck sales since 2007. Despite seeing a decrease in demand for passenger cars, the Ford F-Series, Ford Transit, Ford Edge, Lincoln MKZ and Ford Explorer posted gains of 10%, 98%, 6%, 11% and 1%, respectively. Despite missing the analysts' expectations in November, there are two important factors from the results that have me feeling optimistic about the reporting. First, overall sales are up 5%, or 1.1 million vehicles, year-to-date in 2015 when compared to 2014 and secondly the average transaction price is up 2.7% year-over-year to $36,533. This average transaction price is nearly $4,000 higher than the U.S. industry average compared to General Motor's average price up only $580 when compared to a year ago. Ford's less than 1% growth came in below the industry average of 1.4% gain from last November. Competitors such as General Motors (NYSE: GM ) (up 1.5%), Toyota (NYSE: TM ) (up 4%), Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU )(up 3%), Hyundai (up 12%) and Nissan (up 4%) beat Ford's increase, while others such as Honda (NYSE: HMC ) (fell 5%) and VW (plummeted nearly 25%) saw larger decreases in the month. The auto market reached 15.82 million vehicles through November, which should give them a chance to challenge the 17.35 million sales record achieved in 2000. Barring a period of really bad weather or another unexpected event, many analysts are anticipating consistently high demand in December. Ford's impressive year-to-date results are due to the strong second half I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup reaching optimal inventory levels. It has become clear that as the US economy is strengthening, Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economy dependent auto market. The key to the company's turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F-150. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of 2015. However, the company has reached full production and saw a 16% increase in F-Series retail sales, which pushed total F-series sales to their highest monthly level in eight years. The F-Series pickup is the most popular vehicle in the US and is gaining popularity with lower oil prices. Another key indicator of the new model's public reception, management announced the company would spend $1.3 billion to upgrade the pickup truck plant in Kentucky. Despite a sluggish November (down 16.5%) the Mustang still supports a 55% year-to-date increase as it builds its case for comeback car of the year in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. Over 113,000 Mustangs sold year-to-date in 2015 compared to only 73,000 year-to-date in 2015. I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide long-term growth for the company in the reclaimed muscle car segment. With these results, it's clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in the U.S. ever since. However, there are certainly contingencies that could derail the company's momentum. These include the overall health of the US economy, the upcoming interest rate hike, labor negotiations with the UAW, and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry. If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession, it would definitely have a major impact on Ford. Furthermore, with an interest rate hike expected in the near future, it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit. However, I'm convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts. Additionally, labor negotiations with UAW are key to Ford's bottom line as it employs more than 52,000 US UAW hourly employees . It's important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control. Finally, with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle. Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose, but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way. It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. Because of this and other factors, the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed. However, it's encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it has not posted since the early 2000s. This shows me as an investor that the new F-150's results are positive and the high-end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Despite the sluggish vehicle sales, the company continued to increase the average transaction price, which shows the company is not utilizing heavy incentives to make sales. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I'm extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is seeing quick turnaround times, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the strong sales of the Mustang. With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of 2015. I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the above 4% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
