Ford: Time To Beat GM At The Share Buyback Game? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha General Motors' $5 billion share buyback has bought back millions of shares well above current levels. The market crash has made buybacks of automotive shares at current levels, GM included, even more accretive for investors. This could be an ideal time for undervalued Ford to step in and repurchase its shares during a market downturn. Automotive investors have had a rough year watching their shares go from trading at low valuations to ultra-low valuations. But this sets up a situation where well-positioned companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) can repurchase shares on the cheap and build shareholder value. Furthermore, the recent market downturn has not only made shares cheaper but gives Ford a way to execute its buyback even better than General Motors (NYSE: GM ) ongoing $5 billion buyback. Both Ford and GM have a history of share buybacks to look back upon. While pre-crisis buybacks were not the best moves in hindsight, it's also clear that share buybacks were not the make or break factor that caused Detroit automakers so much pain in 2008. Since then, the companies have taken varied approaches to buybacks. GM has been highly aggressive repurchasing a $5.5 billion stake from the U.S. Treasury in 2012 and adding a $5 billion buyback after being pressured by an activist hedge fund. Unfortunately for GM, the company has a paper loss of about $500 million from its latest buyback. While I still see this buyback as having positive effects for long-term GM investors, the price paid for these GM shares was far from ideal. In contrast, Ford has remained lighter on the buyback front. In 2014, the company announced a $1.8 billion buyback but it was for countering dilution from convertible notes and executive compensation. In its 2014 annual report, Ford noted that the buyback was completed in August 2014 and that the 116 million repurchased shares essentially balanced out other dilution. As a bull on both GM and Ford, I have seen shares as undervalued for over a year now and the recent market downturn has only made these investments appear even better priced. For companies like Ford, this is an ideal opportunity to commence a buyback (i.e. when shares are on sale) to get the most value per buyback dollar. By waiting until this market downturn, Ford could actually beat GM at its own buyback game by repurchasing shares at a better time in the market. With shares trading at only 8.2x est. 2015 earnings, 7.2x est. 2016 earnings, and 6.4x est. 2017 earnings, valuation is on Ford's side. Additionally, retiring shares would save the company on dividend payments and put some buying pressure on shares. Ford also has some advantages over GM when it comes to safely executing its buyback. Much of the capital investment Ford needed to make happened in 2014 when the company refreshed or launched over 20 models freeing up future cash for buybacks, dividends, and debt reduction. Ford is also less exposed to a downturn in the Chinese auto market than GM due to smaller Chinese vehicle sales allowing it to better weather the storm if forecasts for a Chinese slowdown prove correct. How Ford wants to implement and structure a buyback is ultimately up to itself. Ford's management probably has the best information on what the company's capital needs will be over the next several years and should be able to plan a buyback accordingly. In my opinion, Ford would need to make the buyback a significant size in order for it to actually reduce outstanding shares rather than just balance out executive compensation. That said, Ford should determine a buyback that's right for itself and not get into a battle with GM over some type of buyback size envy. Ultimately, it would be beneficial if Ford could also keep raising its dividend alongside the buyback as many Ford investors like the company for the income and a flatlining of dividends could cause some of these shareholders to leave. In light of the recent market downturn, I see Ford as being in an excellent place to implement a share buyback, even if modest in amount. This would send a signal of management confidence while allowing the company to repurchase shares at a deep discount boosting EPS and reducing total dividend payments. While GM could not have seen this market downturn coming, Ford should consider picking up where its rival has incurred paper losses to drive shareholder value.
