Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, on Q4 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year End 2015 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, February 23, 2016. I would like to now turn the conference over to Mr. Chip Johnson, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you, operator, and thank you all for calling in. Despite the challenging commodity price environment, our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company. Our net oil production of 24,942 Bopd was up 6% sequentially and represents a record level of oil production for the company. Our team has also done an outstanding job managing our expenses as our unit operating costs declined by approximately 12% versus the third quarter. We expect some of our cost reduction initiatives to bear further fruit this year, which David Pitts will discuss. For the year, we delivered a 246% reserve replacement at an attractive finding cost of $15.40 per Boe. This brought our year-end proved reserves to approximately 171 million Boe, up 13% versus 2014, despite negative price-related revisions of 15.8 million Boe as a result of the significant drop in the SEC Commodity Price deck. Excluding the impact of this price drop, we would have reported 363% reserve replacement at a finding cost of $10.40 per Boe. The fact that we were able to grow our proved reserves in this environment is a testament to the quality of our Eagle Ford position, which accounts for the vast majority of our proved reserves. That Eagle Ford position is why RS, a respected third-party research analyst, gave us the number one ranking of breakeven costs compared with 60 other E&P companies in North America. Our primary focus in the current commodity price environment is protecting our balance sheet. As a result, our initial drilling and completion CapEx plan of $270 million to $290 million represents a decrease of nearly 45% versus the 2015 level. Our initial land CapEx plan for the year is $15 million. The total 2016 CapEx program is focused on the Eagle Ford, allowing us to run one rig to two rigs during the year, but also provides us with the flexibility to continue testing our Delaware Basin acreage and allocate a small amount of capital to our other regions. Based on this level of activity, our initial 2016 crude oil production guidance is 24,700 Bopd to 25,300 Bopd, or roughly flat with the fourth quarter level. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter 2016 oil production to be higher than fourth quarter of 2015 oil production. We believe this program optimizes our cash flow, liquidity, and leverage metrics in the current environment, while also providing us with the flexibility to increase or further decrease activity in response to changes in the commodity price outlook. Now, I'll turn it over to David to talk about the quarter. David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. As Chip mentioned, oil production for the quarter was a record 24,942 barrels per day, 6% higher than third quarter of 2015, and 13% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Gas production for the quarter was 67.1 MMcf per day, and NGL production was 4,032 barrels per day. Fourth quarter production exceeded the high-end of guidance primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Eagle Ford assets and lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus. Fourth quarter included revenues of approximately $99 million, of which $87 million was attributable to crude oil. During the quarter, we realized 89% of NYMEX for oil, slightly below the range of our guided realization due to higher than expected differentials in the Eagle Ford. We realized 64% of NYMEX for gas, above the range of our guided realization due to better than expected differentials in the Marcellus, and 26% of NYMEX for NGLs, also above the range of our guided realization. Last quarter I mentioned the implementation of several cost reduction initiatives. While higher than expected gas production in the Marcellus contributed to lower per Boe operating costs, we continue to see the positive impact of these initiatives with total cost and expenses for the quarter of $39.7 million, or $10.74 per Boe below our guidance, and down 12% from $12.20 per BOE in the prior quarter. In 2016 we expect our overhead expense reduction initiatives will reduce our annual cash G&A by 15% compared to 2015. DD&A for the quarter was $17.75 per Boe, which is below the range of guidance largely due to higher than expected reserve additions in the Eagle Ford, and lower than expected future development costs. For the quarter, our adjusted net income was $18.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, exceeding consensus earnings estimates of $0.22 per diluted share. Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were $104.5 million, more than 75% of which was in the Eagle Ford. Included in the press release is the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance. For the first quarter of 2016 we expect to realize 84% to 86% of NYMEX for oil, 64% to 69% of NYMEX for gas, and 18% to 23% of NYMEX for NGLs. DD&A guidance for the first quarter is $15 per Boe to $16 per Boe. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter is primarily due to the ceiling test impairment recorded during the fourth quarter. We currently have hedges in place for 14,800 barrels per day, or 60% of our estimated crude oil production for 2016. These hedges consist of 9,300 barrels per day of swaps at $60 per barrel and 5,500 barrels per day of collars with $51 floors and $75 ceilings. Additionally, we will receive $45 million in cash for those during 2016 related to the offsetting hedge transactions we entered into during the first quarter of 2015. Based on crude oil strip prices as of yesterday, we expect to receive $49 million to $52 million from derivative settlements during the first quarter of 2016. Given our strong hedge book for 2016, we've recently turned our focus to adding hedges for 2017 to protect our cash flows. Since the beginning of the year, we've added 6,000 barrels per day of swaps for the first half of 2017 at $50.27 per barrel. We're planning to be opportunistic about adding additional hedges for 2017. Additional details regarding our derivative contracts are included in the press release. At year end, we had total debt of $1.25 billion, $43 million in cash, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.67 times. Our revolver is undrawn with a borrowing base of $685 million. Based on the latest bank price deck, which we received late yesterday, we expect our spring redetermination to result in a borrowing base of approximately $550 million to $575 million. However, this 15% to 20% reduction in our borrowing base is not expected to have an impact on our planned capital program. This borrowing base estimate is higher than that disclosed in the 10-K we filed yesterday afternoon. This is because the latest price deck was received after we filed the 10-K. Now, I'll turn it back over to Chip for an operations update. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thanks, David. In the Eagle Ford, we're producing from 267 gross wells, or 234 net wells with two drilling rigs running and one 24/7 frac crew. During the fourth quarter, we drilled 17 gross wells, or 16.8 net operated wells and completed 13 gross wells, or 12.8 net wells. Crude oil production from the play was more than 22,300 barrels a day for the quarter, an increase of approximately 8% versus the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 29 gross wells, or 27.3 net operated Eagle Ford Shale wells waiting on completion, equating to net crude oil production potential of more than 10,200 barrels a day. We currently expect to drill approximately 49 gross wells, or 46 net operated wells and frac 67 gross wells, or 60 net wells in the play during 2016. Our drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford is currently based on a combination of 330-foot and 500-foot spacing and we continue to test multiple initiatives aimed at significantly increasing our drilling inventory. We remain encouraged by the results from the remaining 330-foot tests and now have three months to four months of production data from three stagger-stack pads testing effective lateral spacing ranging from 165 feet to 280 feet. To-date, we haven't seen any data that would indicate a stagger-stack development is not feasible. If successful, a stagger-stack development could add from 200 to more than 800 additional net locations to our drilling inventory. Our initial Upper Eagle Ford well has been on line for almost four months and the data indicates that the formation is acting independently of the Lower Eagle Ford, which adds another layer of potential to our future development options. In the Delaware Basin, we have drilled five wells to test the Wolfcamp and completed three of them. Our drilling efficiency increased significantly over the period, and we expect to be able to drill future wells in 15 days to 20 days at a completed cost of approximately $7.5 million. Our 2016 plans currently include completing at least one of the remaining wells. Two of the completed wells were brought online late last year but one of them had to be shut-in during December due to a fire at a third-party operated midstream facility. The first well, the Mustang State 1H, had a peak 30-day rate of 823 Boe per day for the entire well bore prior to the plant fire. We later isolated 40% to 45% of the lateral which treated more effectively, after which the well produced 832 Boe per day over an eight-day test period. While this was only a limited period of time, we're encouraged as it does imply outperformance relative to the nearest industry offset well on a lateral-normalized basis. And that's important, because this offset well is what we use for initial economic evaluation of the area. Our second well, the Avenger State 1H, was drilled in a riskier location as it was drilled near a geological fault. While the well was still cleaning up and production was still increasing when we had to shut it in, we do believe that performance was adversely affected by the fault as the water cut was higher than we've seen in the area. Our third well, the Liberator State 1H, recently began flowback. While it's too early to discuss conclusive results, we are encouraged by the early information as the well did appear to treat effectively over 6,900 feet of lateral. We got oil production sooner than the Mustang well producing oil at about twice the early rate of the Mustang well, and the oil is about 57% of hydrocarbons. In the Niobrara we are producing from 123 gross wells, or 53 net wells with nine gross wells, or 5.2 net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter representing about 1,400 net Bopd of potential initial production. Given that our acreage in play is primarily held by production, we're likely to limit spending in the Niobrara during 2016. Our current plan calls for the completion of several drilled but uncompleted wells later in the year, as well as some minor lease management activity. For the first quarter, total company oil production is expected to range between 24,800 net barrels per day and 25,200 net barrels per day. For gas and NGLs, first quarter production should range between roughly 60 net million cubic feet per day to 64 net million cubic feet per day, and 3,800 net barrels per day and 4,000 net barrels per day, respectively. So to summarize, the near-term catalysts, have Eagle Ford downspacing, both going to 330 feet for the rest of our acreage, and determining the right stagger-stack spacing is close to being completed and the Liberator State well which we just brought on last week should have more results that we can talk about in the next month or two months. Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Morning, guys. Say, Chip, just one Del and one Eagle Ford for you, give you sort of the guy's thoughts now on, after these three wells you've seen so far in the Delaware, has your thoughts changed? I know on that slide you've got sort of the outline of what you all designate as that Carrizo focus area with the Wolfcamp Shale A bench, I guess my two questions are, is that focused area changed at all? And is the target still primarily that A bench? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think the target area is okay. I think the complexity of the faulting is something we have to be careful of. We were worried about that, and we had 3D over some of it, and it was kind of like when we started in Barnett Shale we had to figure out how close to the faults we can drill without having a problem with water, and it looks like on the Avenger we got too close. But that will help us figure out going forward exactly how to put the wells in those areas, and also help us avoid leasing or farm-in into acreage that has faults on it, because we've been offered acreage like that, and with these results now, we've been able to stay away from them. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. And the target is still the same there, Chip then for the zones? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director In that area, the Wolfcamp A is the best zone. We're in some Wolfcamp B wells with Conoco, and actually Energen has an excellent Wolfcamp B well right next to us. But at this point, we're still going to keep testing the Wolfcamp A. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. And then just lastly, moving to the Eagle Ford, obviously the reserve report and everything you stated, not only the new wells continue to improve, but obviously your existing wells. Certainly, it must be flowing quite well. Any thoughts; I know you've got that slide out that shows the Eagle Ford well economics, and kind of your type curve behind that. Are you still comfortable with that, are there chance – thoughts about boosting that any time soon, you know, the one where you kind of show your economics at different oil prices, and then just the one where you show your type curve given obviously the improved performance you've seen there. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think we've got all the year-end Ryder Scott data now, so we might be tweaking those numbers. We're thinking about also splitting them to highlight the oilier acreage. And if you remember the slide we have that shows how many wells have a breakeven cost lower than $40, which is the majority of our acreage, we're probably going to separate those two streams, so that instead of an average, you can kind of see the better wells and the worse wells. We've also had some improvements in costs with some reductions in fracking cost, drilling efficiency, so we'll be able to put those lower costs into those economics going forward. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hey. Good morning, guys. And congrats on the great quarter. Chip, I was hoping you could provide us with some color around portfolio management. You have some assets that some might view as non-core, and I think your actions in 2015 and budget for 2016 largely support that view. So I was curious if you could update us with how you're thinking about potential divestitures? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We've talked in the past about selling some of the assets we're not spending any capital on, and we've put data rooms together, but we haven't pulled the trigger to go off and launch the process as yet. The bankers have basically told us, let's just watch the market for another month or two months and see what the market is valuing assets for in terms of how much price you get for the upside in an asset and what PDP strip pricing people are using. And then we'll just make the decision when we need to launch one of those processes. The ones we've looked at are a Marcellus process and a Niobrara process, and then we've also looked at a DrillCo in the Utica where we use private equity money to start drilling so that we can get the midstream built out in that area. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. All right. Great. I appreciate that. And then I apologize, I missed in the prepared remarks just your comments on the Eagle Ford, the number of DUCs you have currently. I know it's been to 29. But could you walk us through that map on how many you're drilling and how many you're completing in the Eagle Ford based on the budget that you've provided, and how that sets you up for your DUC inventory heading into 2017? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, Brad. It's Jeff. Yeah. I think we actually have a little typo there. The completion is correct in the press release. Its 56 gross wells, 53 net wells that we'll complete this year. Sorry, those numbers that we mentioned, that I can only pull the 2015 completion counts. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. So you just plan on drawing down the DUC inventory slightly and maintaining I guess what you'd consider a healthy balance going into next year? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities The next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Chip, stagger-stack, when can you declare it conclusive? And like when do you start rolling that out on a I guess more of a widespread scale than what you're doing right now? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We're still hoping to do that in the second quarter. At that point we ought to have six months data on all the different tests. There's also some competitor data we think we can look at and make the decision on exactly which one of those options we're going to go with. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. So you're saying at some point like in theory if you continue to see what you're seeing and you like what you see the second half of the year, you'll be going primarily stagger-stack? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director That's what it would appear like at this point. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then second question, and I'll let somebody else jump in. How should we think about, or how do you think about, better question, how do you think about 2017? Like if the strip holds here, and I know we're in 2016, there's going to be a lot of moving parts. But the strip kind of holds where it's at, what's philosophically top-down? How do you think about managing the balance sheet? How do you think about capital spend? How do you think about cash flow, like any broad strokes around that? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, we've been modeling that and looking at a bunch of different scenarios. And in a strip case, the first thing we look at is just hold production flat. It turns out that if we let production drop the Eagle Ford payback is so fast that that almost hurts your leverage metrics. So we've just been running everything at flat production at this point in modeling how that would go forward. We haven't put any more CapEx savings in and cost reductions, but we're on the strip case, I think those will happen later this year and that'll probably cut CapEx even more. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Just one follow-up there, so in theory though if you exit fourth quarter, I think in the press release you said 4Q 2016 is going to be higher than 4Q 2015. So you should be on at least on the crude side, so you should be on an upward trajectory headed into 2017? And then that's the number you're trying to keep flattish at strip pricing? That's the right way to think about that? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, we'd probably just say year-to-year it would be flat, so... Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director ...I mean, we're not giving guidance on 2017, but that's the easiest case for us to model. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC I wonder if you guys could help on the G&A savings. 2015 to 2016, that's going to be down 15%, how much of that is already kind of at a full run rate? Were we already seeing a full run rate of that entering 1Q, or should we expect that 4Q to 4Q is actually may be greater than 15%? How to think about that? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President This is David Pitts, Will. Our G&A is not incurred ratably throughout the year. So the savings – some of the savings we started to realize in the fourth quarter, but most of them are not going to occur until calendar 2016, and they'll occur throughout the year. Okay. So steady improvement is the way we should think about that? And then on the Avenger well, can you guys maybe give us a little bit more detail on the water cut there? How much additional water cut did you guys see versus, say, surrounding offsets or any other wells you've seen in that area? Any kind of color there would be helpful. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director No, we're just saying it was higher. It's probably – I'd say it's too high. We basically have to drill back off farther from these strike-slip faults that we were testing the spacing to. So you just make enough water that, especially at low commodity prices, it's going to hurt your economics. And can you just remind us how much 3D you guys have over your acreage position, and how much you may have over other prospective acreage position to help you guys lease? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We probably have 75% to 80% of our position. And we've got some sort of seismic on every well we drill. And then we bought more seismic as we've tried to form into other people's acreage. And some of it is almost free, and some of its $30,000 a square mile. So it just depends on where we are, whether we're being really picky or we've got some big blanket sheets. Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Just a quick one on your production guidance. You guys now have several pads online testing tighter effective lateral spacing. Are you risking any of that production from those pads versus your 330-foot wells? Just kind of curious how you baked that into guidance. Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey Kyle, it's Jeff. I mean we're not going to get that much into the weeds in terms of how we give guidance. Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. That's fair. I guess, just moving over to the M&A front, we've seen a few Permian operators announce some bolt-on type acreage acquisitions and then kind of over-equitize these deals as a way to bolster the balance sheet. Is that something that Carrizo could look to do? And if so, what size opportunities are out there right now? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We've looked at most of the big deals that have transacted. And I don't think we're in that market yet. We don't have enough confidence in the Basin and in the economics to pay $20,000 per acre for undrilled acreage in the Basin. So those big deals we'll keep looking at, and we'll get more and more comfortable with time. But I don't think that's something we're going to do on a big scale. Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And then can you just remind me your JV partner's right of participation in Eagle Ford and any future transactions there? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Our partner, we've got a couple of partners. GAIL, the Gas Authority of India, is a partner in some of our acreage and they have a right to buy anything we acquire in a halo around the leases they're in. And I don't know the details of that. And then CNOOC, then Nexen, then OOGC, is our partner for about a third in some of the acreage that we bought from Chesapeake. And I think we just have a joint operating agreement with them. I don't think there are ropers or anything like that. The next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, Chip. I'm back. Just a quick question, M&A... David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC I don't know. I'm in now, so it's too late. Hey Chip, can you just give me – obviously, the bid-ask spread, everything you hear from your side of the table is bid-ask spread is too wide. Is that – I assume you're still saying that, but is that a 10%, is it 20%, like how far apart would you view the market right now? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director It's closer than it was four months ago. I think in some cases it's getting real close. It depends on whether you're in the right basin. Global Hunter has put some data together to show how outside of about three basins, nobody's paying much for upside. But if you're in those basins, then you might get, you know, as we've seen in the Delaware Basin, up to $20,000 per acre. I think the Eagle Ford, Niobrara, some of the Bakken still commands those kind of prices; obviously the stagger-stacked. But outside of those, the bid-ask have started to get pretty close because it's narrowing down to just PDP, PV-10. Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Hey, guys. Just on the stagger-stack, can you comment, I guess is there any degradation you have seen on those wells versus the 330-foot or 500-foot spaced wells? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Yeah. This is Andy Agosto. Again, as Chip talked about in his operational comments, we're not at a point where we're going to give a lot of detail here. But we have seen some encouragement. And certainly, we're forging ahead. We've got a couple additional pads that are going to be fracked here in the next couple of months. Again, we're optimistic, but we're not really in a position to give a lot of details on that at this point. Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Okay. Fair enough. And then just to follow on the M&A, I mean, in the Eagle Ford, have you all seen, I guess, more willing sellers than you've seen in the past based on a lot of the current commodity situation or balance sheet issues? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I guess we've seen some of the gassier assets transact and be put up for sale. And there was one non-opposition in the DeWitt, Karnes area that got put up for sale. But they haven't been large packages, so there haven't been a lot of transactions. Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC Yeah, good morning. I'm curious why you all decided to drill a high-risk well near known faulting early on in the Permian program? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We had to figure it out. I mean, the Permian, as anybody in the Permian will say, is probably in the second inning or third inning of understanding everything. And we knew there were faults on the acreage, and we wanted to know how close we could drill. We did this in the Barnett and figured it out pretty accurately and had some algorithms for exactly what kind of fault and what kind of throw we could get exactly how close to. And that worked very well for us, and we're trying to figure that out before we waste a lot of money out here chasing acreage that might have faults in it to dim the whole acreage plot, because we're seeing deals like that. Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC Okay. Makes sense. And then on the Upper Eagle Ford, can you just give us some cost data on that Upper Eagle Ford well, and what you're thinking on the EUR? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director It's too early on the EUR; on the cost side it's only about 300 feet shallower than – or 200 feet shallower than some of the Lower Eagle Ford wells. So really not much of a cost savings. Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC Okay. Great. And then last question, on the F&D, you said that you're – excluding revisions you're at $10.40 for the year, and you have a $12.11 cost in your last slide deck. What was responsible for that improvement over what you just showed in the January deck? Is it that the per-well reserves came in so much higher with the 2015 engineering? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC I know that – no, I know it's a single well versus everything that you've done for the year. So maybe then what you can do is talk about how that number will change as you move into 2016. Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Well, I don't think – this is Andy Agosto again, I don't think we're going to see, and I think Chip alluded to this, a big change in reserves. We are going to continue to see some lower capital costs, so the number could get lower based on the capital costs going forward. The next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, morning guys. I know there is some other operators out there in the Delaware Basin that have stressed the importance of picking the correct landing zone within a reservoir. Can you just provide maybe some color on how you landed your first two wells within the Wolfcamp A bench? And maybe how that impacted the well performance? And maybe anything you might change on some of the future wells? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director All we'll say is that we have tried at least three different techniques of landing, and sometimes in the same well. So we're experimenting with that also. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. I know you also earlier mentioned the B bench looks good on some of your acreage, and I guess Bone Springs sands is wet, any thoughts on the Bone Springs Shale around your acreage? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I don't think we've seen much potential above the A. There are a couple places where we've had shows in the zones above the A, but there is not any good competitor data around us that would make that a target. So we're basically – at least on that Reeves/Culberson line we're looking at the top of the A down. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. And just one follow up on an earlier question regarding 2017. Any thoughts on whether that maintenance CapEx level might actually go a little bit lower in 2017 relative to this year, and do you think there might be a little bit more of a focus on working down some of the DUCs to kind of improve the capital efficiency? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey Chris, it's Jeff. I would just say it's too early for us to start talking about 2017 right now. We would have a lot of flexibility as we enter 2017, that's part of how we designed the 2016 program to kind of maximize that flexibility. So working down DUCs could be an option, but as of right now, we don't have to decide that's exactly what we're going to do. All right. Good morning, folks. My first question was on the Delaware Basin; I saw your acreage position is down to 22,000 acres, it was 26,000 acres. Can you explain, was that just kind of a farm-in that you decided not to do? I mean, I guess kind of, is that a solid number, like can we see that acreage position decrease at any point? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director That's a combination of some acres we're letting expire, at the same time we're adding acres. So some of the deals we've done, we've gotten some really good acres with some really bad acres, and so we'll just let those drop off and we'll keep trying to bolt-on around the good acres. So that number will be in flux. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I had a question on kind of the DD&A guidance that you gave. 4Q came in sharply lower. You're guiding continued reductions. I know David talked about kind of the reserves and development costs driving that lower. Is there anything else, because it is a really big reduction, or was it just those two items? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President It's just those two items. It's about 60% of the beat versus guidance was attributable to higher than expected reserve adds in the Eagle Ford. And the other 40% was lower than expected future lower costs. Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then one last quick one, more efficiencies from your Eagle Ford rigs, just going from, I guess, 2.4 wells a month to 2.8 wells on the margin. Is that pushing your well costs down a little bit, $100,000, or is that kind of – how impactful is that to the cost, that latest improvement? John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President Tim, this is Brad Fisher. Really, we're just talking about the spread rate, including – and our spread rate runs probably $70,000 a day. So if we cut a day or two days off, it's $70,000 per well to $140,000 per well. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Capital Markets Good morning, guys. Wanted to go back to the initial Upper Eagle Ford well and maybe ask the question a little differently. And understanding it's still early and hard to project an EUR with any confidence. But comparatively, kind of based on how the well's trending right now, how do you think the economics are going to compare to your Lower Eagle Ford? If say for example, you were to plot it on that bar chart where you guys kind of lay out your breakeven economics by your lease area? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development This is Andy Agosto again. It is still too early. The comments that Chip made about it behaving independently from the Lower Eagle Ford, that's really been the only conclusive data we can glean. And that's a combination of just kind of the trajectory on the oil production, what the water production looks like, some of these things like that. So the comments that Chip made so far are those that we feel really confident. And the economics, it's not going to be as good as our best Lower Eagle Ford, I think that's clear from the numbers, but beyond that we need some more time. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Capital Markets Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe – hoping to get maybe a little bit of an update on Biovert; I know I think last quarter you guys had said that given that you guys choked the wells back it was impossible to really indicate any meaningful production uplift. There was a few more months of production data here. Has there been anything else you guys have been able to glean on these Bioverts early on here? John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President Jeff, this is Brad Fisher. I think we're going to stick with what we said last time. I mean we're seeing a definite increase in the overall energy that the reservoir's delivering. But once again, I think we're pretty consistent and not releasing a lot of data until we have a strong production decline support behind that. I mean, the results have been positive. The energy is a function – is a driver of how many reserves we get out. But we'd like to see a little bit more data before we comment anything beyond an increase in energy. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Capital Markets Okay. And then last one for me just on that second Wolfcamp well you guys did around the faulting. Have you guys been able to identify maybe how much of your net acreage position is kind of at risk or maybe too close to that fault where you're going to see that higher water cut? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We haven't disclosed it, but I think in one nine section area we thought that there was one section we wouldn't be able to drill. Comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH. Please go ahead. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Good morning. I was just wondering if you can make a comment about the Mustang State well and what it was about that 3,000 foot of lateral in the heel that makes you think it was treated more effectively? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I guess the results are why we think it was more effective. We got more oil and gas and less water. And we pumped the jobs on both ends of the well. But this, obviously, was more effective. We made more oil out of 3,000 feet than out of the entire well. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Okay. I was more just trying to understand if there's something with the completion design that you all feel like you can change to try to improve on results, or how do you all sit with the completion design as it sits today? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think that we would say that on the Liberator well that we're testing now, we basically used what we learned on the Mustang on that 3,000-foot section. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Okay. And then, that's helpful. Just one question on the Eagle Ford. Can you just talk a little bit about how the – I guess, if you're running a one rig to two rig program this year, how spread-out that is across the acreage? And if you roll into 2017, do you think that there'd be any material shift in terms of where you would target development? I know that's in the weeds, but just kind of curious your thoughts on where you'll spread out across the acreage position? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development This is Andy Agosto again. We're in a $30 to $35 price world. Obviously, if you look at our breakeven chart, we're going to push the activity to the lower breakeven areas. That said, we do have lease obligations, you know, they're modest, but we do have some in those areas where we're going to be required to either grow wells or buy some extensions. So I don't think we have a detailed schedule through the entire year. But your perception that yeah we may shift more to the lower breakeven inventory is correct. John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President And Michael, I'd then just kind of echo something Chip mentioned, over 80% of our inventory is in those lower breakeven areas. So we have a lot of running room, even if that was the only thing we elected to drill. The next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, and good morning. Just to clarify or follow-up on that last question, how much of the company's Eagle Ford drilling inventory is economical at $30 per barrel or lower? I know you quantified it based on $40 per barrel in the press release. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I can't even remember what's on the slide, probably 10%? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Yeah, I'd refer you back to the presentation on that, Dan. I mean, I think the truth of the matter is, very little in this industry is economical below $30 a barrel. I mean, if we're really counting all the costs. Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Right. I concur. Great. And maybe a follow-up here, just broadly here, an another M&A-related question. Is Carrizo more likely to come out of the downturn a bigger company, acreage-wise, or one that's maybe the same size or even smaller considering asset divestitures? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President I think we would like to come out at about the same size with the highest possible quality acreage. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah, I think we're going to be in a situation, because of our balance sheet, that we're going to be able to rearrange our portfolio and make it better. But we're not just trying to get smaller to raise money. I think if we're going to sell something, we're basically still thinking we're going to use those proceeds to buy something. Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And just following up on that – on your answer then, Chip, where is the greatest opportunity to add leasehold that's accretive in quality and maybe would lower the economic limit of the overall asset portfolio? Is that South Texas or West Texas? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I'd say it's about the same, but we're just still so early in West Texas that we're not willing to make a huge bet out there. I think our West Texas strategy will be the farm-in approach. That seems to be working. The majors still seem to be interested in doling out little pieces of acreage that we can drill to hold bigger things for them. And that's a better way for us to invest until we know exactly what we're doing out there. The Eagle Ford where we are is pretty well understood. I think we know the economics of just about every part of the play now, so that's a little easier for us to evaluate and possibly make bigger bets on. Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Great. And lastly here, just appreciating liquidity is still abundant and leverage relatively low, can you rank capital-raising options, maybe from most likely to least likely, absent an acquisition, talking about equity, talking about outright asset divestures to JVs? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director No, what we always say is that we have a lot of tools in our toolbox here. We can sell assets. We could sell equity. We can hedge. We'll look at all of those. We're flexible. But right now, we're in really good shape for 2016, and I think we're starting to get the hedges in place for 2017. We have a huge amount of liquidity, great capital efficiency with our drilling. So we're in a good spot and we really don't have to do anything. Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Very good. Thanks again. Have a great day. The next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company. Please go ahead. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Morning, Chip. A quick question on the Eagle Ford in the spacing. If you look at the stagger-stack tests in your testing from 165 feet to 280 feet, if you break down your acreage, are there particular areas that you think are more likely to be more apt to be on a 165-foot versus 280-foot? And what are some of those factors that make it such? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Hi. This is Andy Agosto. Those are exactly the kind of things we're trying to figure out right now, and it is why we've been pretty consistent in saying we need some more time. But I think you're absolutely right in saying that one size may not fit all depending upon where you are across our acreage position. But those are the kinds of questions we're trying to answer right now. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC And are the stagger-stacks spread across your acreage in a position to test? Are there three stagger-stack tests designed on the three, the 165-foot, 220-foot and 270-foot spacing, or is there still more testing – or are they more centered around one particular stagger-stack pattern? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development We're in – I think if your question was geographically are they all in the same spot? No. And then, we've got, as I mentioned, a couple of other staggers we'll bring online here in the next few months that are also in a different geographic location across the acreage. Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Ron, asking about the spacing, the two pads we have on the longest, we have those production history on them right now. We're testing three different orientations of lateral spacing. So we're trying to test from the 165-feet to 280-feet. I don't think you can say they're focused on one of those specific spacings. Right now, we're really just trying to understand what's the right way to move forward. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC That was a part of my question. Thanks, Jeff. And then just to follow up on I think it was one of Michael's questions earlier about the Mustang well. You look at the remaining 4,000-plus feet of lateral behind the packer and the relative contribution of the lateral near the heel. From a completion design standpoint, was there something potentially about what happened in terms of the lateral placement in the back half of the lateral, or do you think you've got greater frac height in the back half of the lateral, or is it just too early to tell? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think in general it's too early to tell, but we fracked into water somehow. So we think we know why. But we need to put the Mustang well back on production once the gas plant's in place and produce it longer to see what kind of well we really have. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Michael Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC Hey, guys. Good morning. I'll fire two at you here. Any lingering gas takeaway issues in the Delaware post this plant blow up, is number one? And then number two, just curious if it's logistically impossible or at least impractical to – in the Eagle Ford, to hand back the rigs and just blow down the DUC inventory count from 27 to zero in an effort to boost capital efficiency? Thanks. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I guess first on the gas side, the plant that caught fire will be back in business as long as you have the right kind of gas, which we do. So that should happen – I think the last time we talked to them it was April. There's also another gathering system going into our Southeast and there is a Regency system already in place. So there are three options, or will be pretty shortly. But we don't see that as being a long-term issue. If we can do that, we'll be able to get those wells back online. We'll have to flare the Liberator for a while, because we can't put that online, I don't think until April. But we'll flare that until we have some good tests. As far as the DUCs, we have long-term contracts on those drilling rigs, so we can't walk away from them. We're going to be spending that capital anyway. I guess if prices kept dropping at some point we might consider that, but right now, we're not, except for short periods of time this year. Good morning. Just a couple of housekeeping questions for me. First, what should we be using for capitalized costs for 2016? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, John. We don't provide guidance on cap interest and cap G&A, if that's what you're asking for. But if you circle up with me after the close, I can kind of tell you what they've been running and you can just sort of use that going forward. Okay. Fair enough. And then second, the 10-K I think shows or indicates I think about 15,000 net acres to 16,000 net acres of Delaware Basin leasehold expires by year-end 2017. How should we be thinking about either the drilling or capital requirements to retain that acreage? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director A lot of that we've already starting talking about extensions with the landowners. We'll probably let some of it expire. A part of it had to do with the farm-out we did last year, and we're evaluating whether we're going to drill more wells on that farm-out or not, but we probably will. So that's why we said, we might shift some capital from the Eagle Ford to the Permian as long as we think the metrics for the capital efficiency are just as good. With regards to the extensions, any sort of bucket, how we should think about what that capital number would be? Number of wells that would be needed? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah, we've – for instance on the Utica we started doing that too, and we've seen pretty good response from the landowners for dropping their price quite a bit as long as we go to shorter leases. And that might be what we do in the Delaware also. Fair enough. And then just checking on your last comment about the Liberator well, so should we be anticipating Liberator results on the 1Q call, or is there still the potential for – is that still up in the air as to kind of when you would have results for that well? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, John. It's Jeff. The Delaware Basin is kind of a different beast. And you typically don't get your peak 30-day rates in the first 30 days of production. So when we have a peak 30-day rate on that, we'll likely disclose it. Eli Kantor - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Hey. Good morning, guys. What quantity of Marcellus volumes were curtailed in the fourth quarter? And what quantity of volumes – of curtailments you have modeled into 2016 guidance? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Eli, I mean we don't typically give guidance on the quantity of volumes we have curtailed. I would just say that we think we could produce at a materially higher rate than what we produced in the fourth quarter. And I think if you look at the guidance for 2016, it implies more curtailments than what we had in the fourth quarter of a year. And if you want to think about it throughout the year, we're probably assuming that gas prices will be worse in the second and third quarters than they are in the first quarter and fourth quarter. So we'd probably have a larger curtailment built into the guidance in those two quarters than we do in the winter quarters. Eli Kantor - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Okay. Fair enough. It looks like you guys added some oil hedges in the first half of 2017. Just trying to get a sense of your high-level outlook for the price of oil. Maybe a better question, at what point do you kind of hit the brakes and wait for rebound in crude prices? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think we need to be fully hedged a year out. So that's why we started putting those on in the first half. We'll probably put some more on in the first half. As we get further into this half, we'll start looking at third quarter 2017 and fourth quarter. But there have been some positive announcements out of OPEC and Russia that gets the market all excited. But it has been positive; at least people are talking. So I don't think we want to hedge too far out, too fast. And we've been able to be opportunistic on hedging and catch some of these upticks and add a little bit in and a little bit more. And that way we're able to manage what we're going to do next year. Eli Kantor - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC And that goal to be totally hedged a year out, that's price agnostic? Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, its price agnostic on what's the best we can do right now. So if we're at $45 crude in the second half of this year, we'll be hedging the second half of 2017 hopefully at $60 hedges. So we generally like to be 50% to 75% hedged. And our banks like us to be 50% to 75% hedged. We do have a follow-up question coming from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company. Please go ahead. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Just a quick follow-up on that hedging question. In terms of hedging strategy, if you look at the first half of 2017, as you said, a little bit over $50, were those straight swaps, or how did you achieve that kind of price? David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Ron, this is David Pitts. Those were enhanced swaps. You'll see in the detail of our derivative contracts included in the press release. We sold some natural gas call options in order to achieve those enhanced swap prices of $50 per barrel. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Okay. I'll look at the details. Thank you, David. Sylvester P. "Chip" Johnson, IV, - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director All right. Thanks again for calling in. We thought we had an extremely good quarter at the end of an outstanding year where we kind of nimbly adjusted to the commodity prices and changed what we were doing and put some hedges in place and put ourselves in a good position this year. So it helps that we're in the Eagle Ford with the lowest breakeven cost that some third-party analysts think exist. And we're in the right part of that play. So with that, we should have some news going into the second quarter on stagger-stacking and possibly on the Liberator well in the Delaware Basin. So we'll be back in 90 days. Thanks for calling in. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.
