Long Ford Into Earnings, $28 Long-Term Target Price - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is set to report next Tuesday prior to market open. Weâ€™re long Ford on the basis that the company is fundamentally undervalued. Ford (NYSE: F ) is set to report next Tuesday prior to market open. We're long Ford on the basis that the company is fundamentally undervalued from a valuation perspective. We're also bullish on the company expanding its global footprint and pushing some of its bigger luxury vehicles for sale worldwide. Ford stock has, like its U.S. counterpart General Motors (NYSE: GM ), underperformed the S&P average over the last five year period coming out of the financial crisis. Analysts for Ford's upcoming report are going to be looking for $0.26 for the quarter on revenue of $33.92 billion. This compares to $0.25 on revenue of $33.9 billion last year. The high end estimates for this quarter run as high as $0.35. The company is expected to earn $1.59 this year and $1.87 next year, making today's valuation at $15.82 extremely cheap. All the while, Ford has been cranking out new F-150's, which we've long believed to be a key for the company's new "post 2008" path to success. While profitable in the States, Ford is still struggling to achieve profitability overseas in key markets. The company has spent billions in the last 5-10 years establishing a presence in areas like Mexico, China and Europe so that when the capex sieve turns off, the company can eventually drive some serious profitability in these areas. This will be key in moving the stock and as we've said before, we don't mind collecting the fantastic yield while we wait. As we've written , over the weekend at the Shanghai Auto Show, Ford debuted its new Taurus sedan. The days of the gas guzzler are slowly fading here in the U.S. While in the U.S. bigger cars like the Taurus and the Lincoln Continental have fallen out of favor and been replaced by gas friendly smaller vehicles and luxury SUV's, "big cars still need lovin, too" and they're getting it in China. Here's the stats on that, from a Reuters article, According to research firm IHS Automotive, China's market for large sedans has overtaken the United States, with sales of around 4 million last year, topping the 3.6 million sold in the U.S. By 2020, IHS expects that gap to have widened to 5.3 million large sedans in China and 3.7 million in the U.S. So far Ford has been meeting the goals its setting for itself and investors in China. They met expectations in 2014 and have continued to show promising results. You can read more about the company's auto sales domestically and internationally by looking through our catalog of articles over the last few months here . On top of this, Ford's going to be releasing a number of new models in Europe, as detailed by this great article by Jeroen Jongbloed, Ford will release a number of new models in Europe this year, including the new C-Max, S-Max and Galaxy models, as well as the Mustang fastback and Convertible, which will help boost sales even further. In the most recent fiscal year, Ford's losses in Europe were $1.06 billion before taxes. If the company manages to regain profitability in Europe, it will not only increase its earnings per share, but also reduce its dependency on the US market, giving the company a more diversified stream of income. As we've already written , we think there's some good signs coming from overseas. It was reported that GM reported strong sales in China. Specifically, Cadillac sales rose 75.6% on new model introductions. This is important because it indicates to us that our argument that American luxury is still in demand overseas holds water. Ironically, the Cadillac is still partially out of favor domestically, but we're not the country with 1.35 billion people in it. We'd much rather see a burgeoning U.S. luxury market in China, with its dense populous, than in the U.S. If China responds the same way to the Lincoln Continental, Ford may have found its catalyst to break out of the funk it's perpetually been in the last couple of years. As investors, these indications are exactly what we're looking for.

With the company at a jumping off point for global profitability and the equity priced at just 8.4x what Ford is expected to earn next year, Ford is begging us to buy more. In general, Ford continues to be our preferred way to invest in the U.S. auto market. Here's a piece on why we have a target over $20. Again, we have to reiterate that we take a long-term view on the company. We get sales data from Ford domestically and overseas just about every month anyway. What we're interested from this report is management's commentary on spending and reaping the rewards of investing in the company overseas. We look forward to hearing from management as to how global expansion is progressing. Source: Long Ford Into Earnings, $28 Long-Term Target Price Disclosure: The author is long F.
