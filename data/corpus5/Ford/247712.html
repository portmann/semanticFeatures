Would A Buyback Program Help Ford's Stock? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is considering a new buyback program. The company's cash flow after CapEx is not high enough to cover the higher payout to shareholders than in 2014. Cash flow after total investments is deep in red; leverage is rather high. It would be better to strengthen the balance sheet. The pressures from competitors will not decrease on the contrary. A strong balance sheet will be a key advantage in the future. Several days ago, the CFO of Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), Bob Shanks, mentioned the possibility of a share buyback (see this for more details). Returning money to shareholders is surely a good thing, but only if the company really has enough money to return. This may seem like a trivial observation, but I know several companies which play out large dividends or have a buyback program while their free cash flow is minimal or even negative. Usually, this is a road to high indebtedness, a severe problem in the future. Is Ford really in a situation where it should give shareholders more money? Smart Buybacks? Cash Flow After CapEx Is Already Fully Utilized Carmakers are often not able to cover their cost of capital, and their free cash flow is weak. Looking at the cash flow statement of Ford, we can see it was able to significantly increase its operating cash flow in 2014, but largely due to a movement in working capital. That's nice, but it probably cannot be a sustainable trend. CapEx is far below the operating cash flow, but it is steadily growing. Last year, the company generated cash flow after CapEx of approximately $7 billion (about $3.5 billion if we eliminate the effect of working capital). In 2013, it was nearly $3 billion, and in 2012, it was about $4.5 billion. Dividends amounted to nearly $2 billion in 2014, and the company bought its own shares for a total value of less than $2 billion. Overall, nearly $4 billion was returned to shareholders in 2014, which is about the same level as the "standard" cash flow after CapEx reached in the 2012-2014 period. In other words, if we take the cash flow after CapEx as a key metric, there does not seem to be room for an increased payout to shareholders. Ford Deep In The Negative After Total Investments If I look at the total investment figures, the picture gets even less encouraging as far as value-enhancing buybacks are concerned. These investments amounted to $21.1 billion in 2014, and $19.7 billion in 2013. Therefore, the company has invested significantly more than it earned from its operations. In other words, it earned nothing for the shareholders and creditors. On the contrary, the creditors had to give the company more money (the debt increased by $7.3 billion last year). Still, Ford already "returns" money to shareholders via dividends. In the first nine months of this year, Ford was able to increase its operating cash flow significantly to $14 billion (see second table above). CapEx stayed essentially unchanged at $5.3 billion. Other investments are again high, and after total investments, the company is once again deep in the red. These other investments are mostly represented by receivables related to financing and leasing. These investments cannot grow indefinitely, and in the long term, it may be more relevant to focus only on cash flow after CapEx and not cash flow after total investments. Nevertheless, the other investments currently consume a large portion of the company's cash flow, and the result is clear; if Ford wants to pay additional money to shareholders, it has to increase its leverage (or significantly increase its operating cash flow), which brings us to the last key point: How indebted is the company? Total long-term debt, including the portion that is due next year, now stands at about $95 billion (as of Q3 2015). Cash is at $14.5 billion, and the net debt should therefore be close to $80 billion. 2014 EBITDA reached almost $11 billion. Based on these figures, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is higher than seven. This is a very simplified calculation, and we must not forget that carmakers are to a large extent financing companies. Still, the above, together with the overall development of indebtedness, indicates to me that Ford does not exactly have a conservative capital structure. For comparison, Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ) has a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of close to 4, and Toyota (NYSE: TM ), close to 3. Based on the above, I would not be pleased if Ford started with a new buyback program without significantly and sustainably improving its operating cash flow and/or reducing its investments. It seems to me that more value could be created (or at least preserved) if the company went in the opposite direction - if it focused on strengthening its balance sheet. The situation in the automotive sector is not going to improve in the foreseeable time, the companies will continue to choke each other, and only those with the strongest balance sheets will survive, or those with the governments willing to support their balance sheets. But that's another discussion. And Please Do Not Believe The Myth Of Value Creation Via Higher EPS I would also like to have one general remark: Sometimes, we can read or hear that buybacks create value because they increase the EPS. This would be a unique free lunch, but it really does not exist. Repurchases do reduce the number of shares, and hence with unchanged earnings, they do increase the EPS. But, at the same time, they increase the stock risk, and thus, the required rate of return. Therefore, in the most common scenario, the buyback just moves us from a situation of "lower EPS" - lower required rate of return - to a situation of "higher EPS" - higher required rate of return. And the overall effect of this financial engineering may well be negative, especially for relatively highly indebted companies. Disclaimer: I encourage you to do your own research and analysis.
