As to what is good for our country, I don't like this one bit and if Ford is going to move their major plants out, I will divest.  Now, if these plants are to make parts for vehicles sold there or elsewhere, then it's ok with me, but I'm  not going to keep stock in what I view as companies that are not helping America recover the middle class here.  We made this company what it became and some loyalty is owed here.  It's just like Burger King and their disloyal move after they became so big and popular here in America.   It's not all about the bottom line to me. The question is what would i take for Ford to build these factories in the USA? Does anyone in the federal government ever ask that question?
