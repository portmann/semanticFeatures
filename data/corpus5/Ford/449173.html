The Bear Case For Ford And The U.S. Auto Sector - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha US auto sales set a first-half record, growing 1.5% to 8.65 million units, the sixth consecutive year of growth. Ford (NYSE: F ) did particularly well: sales for June increased 6.4% to 240,109 units, compared to 2.5% for the overall auto industry. Year to date, Ford's sales are up 5% to 1,353,048 units, a record for the company. The stock has bounced approximately 3.5% over the past few days on this news, any many investors are considering taking a position in Ford based on the expectation of continued strength in the US auto market. We caution against this, and offer a number of reason why investors should be bearish on Ford and the US auto industry. Industry-wide sales are growing, but they are increasing at a slower pace. This happens naturally over time due to the law of diminishing returns. The problem is that the recovery has been fueled by credit rather than natural economic forces. Underlying economic fundamentals are weak. HIS Automotive expects US auto sales will hit a peak in 2017 (Figure 1) before leveling off as interest rates rise. The auto industry is benefiting from a combination of factors that can reverse just as easily as they came into place. Low interest rates, easy credit, low gas prices, and rising home and stock values (which in themselves are a product of low interest rates but are boosting consumer confidence nonetheless) are all contributing to the impressive auto sales figures. But the sources that sustain demand over time are absent. Incomes are not growing and millenials are exiting the labor force. We provide some specific reasons why you should be cautious. The Federal Reserve has played a big role in the auto boom over the last six years. Through quantitative easing and ZIRP, the Fed has increased the amount of credit available in the economy and kept borrowing costs artificially low. We think the economy is too weak to handle another rate hike this year, but eventually the Fed will have to tighten for credibility's sake. According to Charles Chesbrough, an economist, "an interest rate increase of two-to-three percentage points would add a couple thousand dollars to the price of an auto loan". The average duration of auto loans has increased for six consecutive years. While the average auto loan was 64.6 months in 2015, it is closer to 72 months now. Much of this is a product of a weak economy, as consumers with squeezed budgets are attempting to keep monthly interest payments to a minimum. But it also stems from increased competition in the auto industry, which is causing carmakers to offer more attractive terms in order to win business. Longer loan terms today will weigh on demand in the future, as customers are unlikely to purchase new vehicles until they can pay off existing debts. It will also lead to lower levels of equity on outstanding loans, which brings us to our next issue. According to J.D. Power, the percentage of car owners who owe more than their car is worth is expected to hit a 10-year high in 2016. Almost one-third (31.4%) of car owners are in negative territory, which exceeds pre-crash levels of 30.7% in 2006, a period not so dissimilar to today considering how it was also fueled by credit. . Increasing loan terms are a big reason for these trends. The longer the principal on a loan remains outstanding, the greater the likelihood that a car-owner will have negative equity, as vehicles depreciate over time. A growing prevalence of negative equity is a big problem for the auto sector because it has relied on credit for sales. Customers with negative equity will be forced to delay new car purchases until they pay off existing loans. Fewer and fewer consumers in this demographic are driving and buying cars. In 2014 76.7% of people between the ages of 20 and 24 had a driver's license, compared to 80% in 2011. While baby boomer talking heads think this is because of the rising popularity of ride-sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft, and that millenials "don't care about driving cars", allow me (a millennial) to tell you that it is mostly because this generation can't afford to. It's the same reason why millenials aren't buying homes. Do you really think they live with their parents because they want to? The labor force participation rate is near a thirty year low, largely because so many millenials have left the labor force. The path to future income growth for many in this generation has been permanently damaged due to prolonged absences from work. This generation will be responsible for the bulk of future car purchases, and automakers should be worried. According to the Wall Street Journal, the supply of used cars is expected to increase as vehicles sold in recent years are returned to dealers as trade-ins. Tom Kontos, an economist, believes that the ensuing fall in used-car prices will make newer vehicles less competitive and "dampen new car sales". If incomes in the US were rising this would be less of a concern, but with wage growth as stagnant as it is, we expect consumers will continue to be relatively sensitive to price. The US auto industry has been on a great run over the past six years, but it wasn't based on anything concrete. With the economy fundamentally weak, the industry has thrived and survived on credit. If rates rise and credit conditions tighten, you will see a big correction. There are plenty of warning signs, you just need to know where to look. While Ford has expanded into new markets in recent years, it still relies on the US for the majority (58%) of revenues. The firm's financing arm has been instrumental in driving growth, but the credit business exposes Ford to many of the factors discussed in the article. Despite the recent strength, Ford's low valuation (forward P/E of 6) is justified.
