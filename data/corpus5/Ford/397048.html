Ford Pays The Price For Being A Dividend Parvenu - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is unlikely to become a company that will increase its dividend every year. The stock is undervalued relative to dividend aristocrats on several metrics. Many of the dividend growth investors on Seeking Alpha have one category of stocks in their portfolios-- dividend champions , companies that have raised their payouts every year for a quarter-century or more. If they're in the S&P 500, these companies are known as dividend aristocrats . Ford (NYSE: F ) will never be in that category. After coming out of the 2007-09 recession as the only U.S. automaker not in bankruptcy, it resumed paying a dividend in 2012. Its cyclical nature makes annual dividend raises problematic. Even this year, when 2015's great operating results made it easy to raise the dividend, Ford behaved more like a dividend parvenu. It kept the base payment at 15 cents a quarter while declaring a 25 cent special dividend. It yields 4.7% without the special dividend, 6.2% with it. The stock did not benefit at all from the special dividend, which was declared during the market turmoil of January. Indeed, it fell in after-hours trading as soon as it was announced. Despite last week's great earnings report , which showed no signs of a slowdown from last year's record-setting results, the stock is only about even year to date. Still, CEO Mark Fields vowed last week to keep the policy of special dividends in place. Investors prefer the seeming certainty of annual payout increases. A 10-year chart shows dividend aristocrats have outperformed the overall market since 2009, after the Great Recession made investors crave predictability. Ford has a price-earnings ratio of 7, less than half the average of the S&P 500. Even some longtime Ford bulls have despaired of ever seeing capital appreciation. Let's consider two of them: W.W. Grainger (NYSE: GWW ), a well-run industrial supply company that's raised its dividend 43 straight years , and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK ), the maker of tools and industrial goods, with a 48-year dividend increase track record. Ford is a much cheaper stock by P/E or in relation to its growth rates. The automaker has a dividend yield higher than Stanley and competitive with Grainger even though the special dividend isn't included. Ford also has the lowest payout ratio, so there's plenty of room for increases. The one place it falls short is return on assets, where Grainger shines. Since Ford owns a large credit finance company, its debt and asset levels are higher those of pure industrials, and the numbers aren't really comparable . Grainger is also in a less capital intensive business. Overall, like "Downtown Abbey," where wealthy American heiress Cora saved the Crawley estate by marrying into the family, someone who wants to get into the aristocracy pays up for the privilege. Barron's views Ford as undervalued and its dividend policy as sound. On the financial side, Ford plans to maintain its regular dividend, now 15 cents a quarter, and pay a supplemental one early each year, if conditions warrant. This year's extra payment was 25 cents. [Chief Financial Officer Bob] Shanks says the company will aim to annually pay out 40% to 50% of the prior year's net income in total distributions. Making a special payout a part of this avoids locking in a higher regular dividend than Ford might be comfortable with."We want to make sure that we can pay [the regular dividend] through any downturn," the CFO says. A company knows better than its shareholders how much cash is needed to reinvest in the business or to improve the balance sheet, and how much can be safely paid out to shareholders. Ford's prudent approach serves shareholders well, even if the market is slow to give it credit. Owning Ford and reinvesting dividends should, over time, produce sustainable increases in income received--even if they're not as regular as clockwork.
