Ford: Europe Sales Dictate Global Profitability Progress - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha European sales numbers released on Tuesday show continued progress for Ford's plan of global profitability. Demand for Mustang in areas where the vehicle wasn't previously offered is promising. This European report does well to reiterate our bull case: global profitability will drive the bottom line and fuel the stock move long investors have been waiting for. Ford (NYSE: F ) stock continues to do nothing, which is old news if you're a Ford investor. Chances are, if you're long, you don't mind Ford heaping on a nearly 4% annual yield at current prices. The company is a different story however. Month by month, quarter by quarter, Ford has been executing on their plans to innovate their product line and expand the Ford name across the globe. With each month that passes, we get decent domestic and global sales data continually guiding us to believe Ford is moving in the right direction. We have said for a while that profitability globally (and the effect it will have on the bottom line) is going to be the next catalyst to stop Ford's stock price from being an immovable object. Value investing is about finding companies that have been overlooked by the market, or are simply valued at much lower than what they're potentially worth in coming years. Ford meets this description for us in so many ways and the missing link that would let the market in on this, Ford's global profitability, could be coming to fruition sooner than the market thinks. Much of Ford's ongoing bull case, for us, revolves around this. While we hate to carry on every single time that Ford reports decent sales, we do like that it offers us a guiding look at one of the main proponents to our long thesis. This morning, Ford reported that sales in Europe rose 15.8% Y/Y in June to 126,800 units. Seeking Alpha stated that volume leaders were the Fiesta (33.4K), Focus (24.8K), and Kuga (10.6K) models and that Ford added market share in Britain, Germany, Italy, and France during June. From a model standpoint, the F-150 and the Mustang were key pieces of our bull case. We have long been bettors that the F-150 and the Mustang would drive both domestic and global demand. The Mustang's presence in foreign countries for the first time, we long hoped, would be a continued driving force for the company. Another nice piece of reassurance in June's report is that Mustang sales appear to be starting off strong in areas where the vehicle wasn't previously offered. We'd like to take a second and once again review the valuation of the company as it stands. The company trades at a very attractive 0.41x price to sales, and a respectable 2.3x their book value. At about 7.8x what Ford is expected to earn next year, nothing about Ford's valuation seems overdone in a market where we believe that equities are starting to push their upper limits valuation wise. Ford's EV/Sales of 1.13x is extremely attractive. The difference between that metric and its ballooning EV/EBITDA of 14x all relates to earnings and earnings quality. We believe that once global profitability begins to find serious traction and the company's EV/EBITDA (among other) valuations begins to drop, it's going to be far more obvious what a great buy that Ford is. We continue to be bulls on Ford and still believe there is a case for Ford to trade well over $20 in the future, as the company secures global profitability.
