Ford: More Promising Metrics - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is rallying over the last few days. Additional positive registration data out of the UK is good news for automakers. All of the right things continue to happen for Ford. The latest has been the small rally that we have seen in the stock over the last few days. Those that have been following Ford ( F ) for the last year know that stock rallies do not come often lately, and despite the share price being lower then where we had been bullish on Ford, we are still encouraged by the share price over the last week. As you can see from the above chart, Ford and its sister company General Motors have both outperformed the S&P. This could be for a number of reasons, but we believe the foundation for the strength is likely in the fact that the company is producing above average results in the US and internationally. The monthly sales metrics that roll in each month have been impressive for several consecutive months. You can read about all of them here . The guiding factors that we use to ensure that Ford is staying on the right track are metrics like US auto sales and larger scale data like European and UK vehicle registrations. We were privy to updated UK registration information yesterday that continues to support the bull case for the company. Car registrations in the U.K. were strong in September, despite the Volkswagen scandal which occurred in mid-month. Registrations were up 6% to 462K new cars. YTD registrations are up over 2M through September for the first time since 2004. The best selling models in the U.K. during the month were the Ford Fiesta (NYSE: F ), Vauxhall Corsa (NYSE: GM ), and Ford Focus. In addition the company has a just adjusted supply and inventory levels of its new F-150 series in order to meet what appears to be fairly excessive demand from US consumers over the last few months. This demand, when combined with Ford's international initiatives, continue to give us confidence that the company is moving in the right direction. When we first started writing about Ford, the stock was well over $15, near $18. We thought even at that price that it was undervalued, and we were looking for the catalyst that was going to push Ford over $20 per share. While the stock has moved in the opposite direction that we had hoped, we have firmed and finalized our investment thesis on the company, and we were buyers as the stock began to fall. Our case still remains very simple, fairly fundamental, and basic. We believe that increased profitability will finally be the catalyst that pushes forward stock higher. We think the company is going to achieve this bottom line success by bearing the fruits of its international investments in populous areas like China and India, while maintaining momentum in the US. At home, we are counting on things like continued demand for the F-150, mixed with demand for the Mustang, mixed with the resurgence of the Lincoln brand to help Ford chug along in its native United States. Backed by consistent encouraging monthly metrics that we can use as guide rails for our investment, we continue to stay long Ford. The company's dividend yield is now over 4%, giving additional incentive to own the stock at these levels. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
