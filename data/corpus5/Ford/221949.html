More On Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's Q3 results had little effect in terms of giving their share price any boosts. Their robust growth in net income was overshadowed by profits missing estimates. I want to buy Ford (NYSE: F ) so badly. I would be so psyched to see some signs from the firm that their stock is going to shift a gear. Unfortunately, it's just not happening. Awhile back I wrote about Ford becoming more of a dividend play than a strong contender for stock price appreciation. Understandably, I was met with quite a plethora of comments stating my position was wrong and that Ford shareholders would be reaping the benefits of their new aluminum based pickup in the latter part of 2015. Well folks, we're a few days from November and Ford's stock price is almost exactly where it was back in June when I first wrote about it. When you consider the five year performance of the stock, I'm not incredibly surprised. Ford has had a very tough time finding momentum in its stock prices, and their latest quarterly results have not added anything to fuel a takeoff. The company had a great jump in net income of 129%, but missed on profit estimates. The fact that this miss has the stock down 5% today tells me that investors aren't easily satisfied when it comes to this stock. They want to see something big for Ford. They want something that truly separates the firm from the other automakers before they'll run this stock up. Sure you have your stalwarts and loyalists who have kept Ford in their portfolio for years and have zero intentions of changing that. Truthfully, it's a good idea considering the great dividend yield that you can get right now. Outside of that, I still hold strong that there is little upside to this stock. Achilles Research has a good article pointing out the lack of enthusiasm the market gave to the good parts of Ford's Q3 moves. The carmaker made great strides in terms of improving its operating margins and the stock price was unaffected. Is Ford a bad company? Not at all. I want to buy this stock. I'd love to own an American carmaker with growth potential; but there appears to be a psychology at work where the market is demanding something truly spectacular before the share price has any chance of climbing into the $20's. Over the past 5 years the company has battled hard to improve its lineup, and its profits have been great. 2015 Q2 and Q3 earnings per share have been well above last year's earnings. Alas, We haven't seen much activity above $18. I understand the tentative nature of the situation. Car sales are a fickle business. Demand goes up and down and all around. If the economy takes a hit, people are not going to just go by a new car. With a volatile business cycle comes a constant need to have nest eggs in place to protect the company. I think everyone reading this saw the utter devastation inflicted on the "Big 3" back in 2008. Ford was not very far from joining GM (NYSE: GM ) and Chrysler in filing chapter 11. Those kinds of situations are not easily forgotten. The steel industry is taking real hits right now in demand, and that's usually a sign that manufacturers like the auto industry are slowing down (Though it's worth noting that Ford isn't buying as much steel these days as their trucks move to the aluminum body). With global economies looking at bit shakier than the U.S., Ford could easily end giving some back next year. I'm staying away from Ford for now. I can't find any clear catalysts that are going to drive this stock price. I'm still a little nervous about their Aluminum pickup. Do I think it's going to go down? No I do not. I think it's going to stay right where it is. They're paying out a lot in dividends, which I personally would like to see diminished. I think it would aid in getting Ford closer to the $20 range. I'm sure many would disagree with me and that's fine, but I want to see price growth, and right now Ford isn't delivering.
