Ford Fears Creating Attractive Entry Point - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is well on it's way to beating last years record profits. Global sales are forecast to be very strong this year; company results match this expectation. Despite results and projections fears are helping to depress share prices. Ford's (NYSE: F ) earnings in 2015 were good, to say the least. Record earnings were driven by strong sales and aided by expanding margins. Since sales this year are already ahead of those reported for last year and efforts are underway to trim costs company guidance for results to "at least match" those seen in 2015 is modest indeed. Despite the robust expectations there are a number of fears that have been holding investors back. According to forecasts from JD Powe r global sales are projected to hit 92 million in 2016 with more than 17.8 million of those in the US alone. If Ford can maintain its momentum and market share I see no reason for the company not to exceed 2015 earnings Based on sales figures for January and February it looks to me like Ford will easily match 2015 results and most likely exceed them. Sales in all three of the company's major markets are soaring and even S&P Ratings sees the company able to overcome weakness in South America through strength in its other areas of operations. Results for February are quite spectacular. The company saw increased sales in both Europe and the US and although there was a slump in China sales remain robust. European sales jumped more than 19% in the EU with +20% or higher gains in many nations, and after a double digit increase in January, marking 3 years of expanding sales in the region. Market share also increased, gaining 30bps to hit 7.5%. US sales were also quite strong, so strong in fact that they blew away the estimates. Consensus was in the range of 12%, actual results were nearly double that at +20%. Sales were up in all categories with a 2.6% increase in average sale price. Year to date sales for all brands is up 8.8%. The company also saw a notable uptick in US market share , 16.1% in February and nearly 2% higher than this same time last year. China was the one weak spot but results are only weak when compared with the previous month. Sales in February fell -9% after rising more than 36% in January; year to date sales in China are up 18% even with the "weakness" shown in February. There are three major efforts underway to cut costs and drive profitability that are expected to begin bearing fruit over the next year or two. In Asia, operations in Japan and Indonesia are being suspended as the company sees no path to profitability. Competition from Japanese automakers Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Daihatsu ( OTCPK:DHTMY ), Honda (NYSE: HMC ) and Suzuki ( OTCPK:SZKMY ) is to great. They own more than 80% of combined marketshare in the region, foreign automakers command less than 5% of total marketshare. Operations are expected to be closed out by the end of the year except for a token force of service departments. In Europe efforts are underway to cut about 10,000 jobs and a few of the less popular models. The result will be a savings of about $200 million annually. The company is also expanding its facilities in Mexico in an effort to reduce costs further. This move comes on the heels of the latest contract negotiations with the UAW and help control the impact of wage increases here in the US. This facility is not expected to come online until 2018. It's Not All Roses And Sunshine For Ford Although sales are strong and costs are coming down there are still hurdles to face. One is the possible impact of leases on future sales. According to a Wall Street Journal article new leases accounted for more than 32% of the market in February and could have a negative impact on sales, and profitability. In terms of sales leases have been on the rise since 2009 and are now flooding the used car market, providing an alternative to buyers much cheaper than purchasing a new car. JD Power estimates that there will be a 20% increase in cars coming off of lease this year alone with similar increases expected for next year too. Not only are there more used cars to buy, prices are expected to come down in the face of such heavy supply. In terms of profitability, automakers subsidize the lease market to make the cars more affordable. With the number of leases on the rise the cost of supporting the market will go up as well. The health of the US consumer is showing signs that trouble may be on the horizon for the entire auto industry. The number of sub-prime and deep-sub-prime loans has increased to 20.4% of all auto loans outstanding with nearly 1% of all loans at least 60 days past due. While not overly concerning at this time it bears watching as it suggests a crisis in the auto market similar to the sub-prime mortgage crisis could be developing. A Ford specific hurdle, namely another problem with the brakes on its F-150 line, may affect sales of the iconic brand. The latest issue is a number of complaints the brakes failed, resulting in at least 4 crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a probe into the complaints after dealership inspections revealed the master cylinders were not holding fluid properly. Results are not yet in but could result in legal issues for the company and a recall of up to 420,000 trucks. This is not the first time Ford has been faced with a recall of the F-150, one was issued in 2013, also due to brake issues. The bombings in Brussels are also a concern. The growing threat of terror in the EU and its effects on the economy are two issues we won't know the answers to for a little while yet. The fact is that Ford's business is doing quite well. The fear is that it won't keep doing as well as it has been. While the negatives presented here are certainly worth keeping tabs on they do not pose a material threat to Ford's performance at this time. Sales trends are positive and strong, margins are on the rise and efforts for further cost reduction are in the works which should result in earnings growth in 2016. The analysts are expecting to see earnings grow by at least 1.5% in 2016 and then another 3% in 2017, no reason to get bearish on this stock. What the negatives are doing for Ford is keeping share prices near the low end of the projected range and providing attractive entry for new investors. The average analyst estimate for Ford shares is $15.65, a 6.1% gain over today's prices. With the outlook for sales as they are, and Ford's already stellar performance YTD, I think we could easily see this target met or exceeded by the end of the year. An important takeaway for investors is that the company issued a substantial special dividend in the wake of strong 2015 results and it is very likely to be repeated at the end of 2016.
