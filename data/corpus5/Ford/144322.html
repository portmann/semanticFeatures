Continued Bullish Ford F-150 News Supports Our Bull Case - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Domestic sales and F-150 sales are the backbone of our long case for F. The demand for F-150's has been called into question numerous times over the last month. Amid reports of F trying to ramp up production, WSJ confirms that the company has gone to a second steel body supplier to meet demand. We continue to follow Ford (NYSE: F ), and as we disclosed that we were going to do last week, we added shares this week with a long-term focus on both collecting the company's impressive yield mixed with waiting for it to achieve global profitability. We have a multi-year outlook on the company. One of the things we've talked about in our past articles was the F-150 and Mustang continuing to be the backbone of the company's production in the U.S. Domestic production needs to remain decent so that the company has a foundation for when it finally starts collecting on some of its overseas investments. Domestically, the F-150 is a sizeable investment the company has made in itself, and the results of F-150 sales show us whether Ford's use of its capital has been worth it. So far, things look good. Coming off some news last week that the F-150 didn't perform well in crash tests combined with the (misunderstood) news of incentive based selling, we were happy to read some news that continues to support our case. The company has now gone out and hired an entirely new supplier just to provide steel frames for the F-150. This is all part of Ford's continued plans to ramp up production, as demand is keeping the F-150 model flying out of dealers' lots. The steel frame remains one of the steel parts of the vehicle which now incorporates a significant amount of aluminum that helps with emissions and gas mileage. The Wall Street Journal said , The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is struggling to get as many redesigned F-150s on dealer lots as planned because of troubles its supplier, Mexico-based Metalsa SA, is having building enough frames to keep up with demand, according to the people. Ford recently hired a second supplier to fill in the gap and has been shipping frames to its factories by truck rather than rail to get them there faster but at a higher cost, the people said. With not enough frames, Ford has had to cancel planned overtime, and at times, temporarily halt the assembly line during regular shift work as plant employees wait for more frame deliveries to arrive, say people familiar with factory operations. This, combined with the company's new addition of an even higher end model of the F-150, continues to fuel the fire that suggests domestic demand for the F-150 is meeting and exceeding expectations. Again from WSJ , The F-150's frame was re-engineered for the 2015 makeover, and is about 60 pounds lighter than the old one. It has a higher percentage of high-strength steel and is built with a new process that varies the thickness of the metal used to reduce weight. The frames are built by Metalsa at a factory in Elizabethtown, Ky.-about 400 miles south of Detroit and 530 miles east of Kansas City. The shortage has become so acute that Ford has sent a team of "fixers" from advisory firm KPMG to Metalsa's factory in Kentucky to ensure smoother operations, people familiar with the move say. This is a nice day by day update that the company continues to have the active problem of not producing enough F-150's and that they are working to reduce the supply chain bottleneck. We think this will be good news for the financials moving into the back half of 2015. Despite this progress, it's been much ado about nothing for Ford stock, still. It stays parked, and paying out a nice yield. As we said in our last article , the company is continuing to roll out its foothold globally and become an international powerhouse in the automotive market. We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets, backed by strong domestic sales, will be the catalyst that drives Ford shares higher.
