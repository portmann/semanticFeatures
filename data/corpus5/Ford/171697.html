Ford On Track Abroad And Domestically - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Focus over the last month has been on the state of Ford's operations in China and India due to the overseas market volatility. This week we check in on Ford's domestic progress. The company's two most important domestic sales pieces, Mustang and the F-150, continue to impress. We are long Ford for the long haul. We continue to follow Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) as it crawls out of the muck of the 2008 financial crisis and tries to forge forward as the leading US automaker. Ford has advanced over the last seven or eight years beautifully while rival domestic automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM ) has had major trouble in both the press and with regulators. We have long preferred Ford to General Motors; however, with General Motors under $30 per share, we now own both companies in our long-term dividend portfolio. Ford's recovery has been fantastic, while the "new" GM continues to struggle and trades at lows, vastly underperforming the S&P since coming out of bankruptcy. We continue to track global and domestic auto sales for both companies in order to make sure that, on a month-to-month basis, our bull case for the companies continues to at least move in the right direction. For Ford, we have seen these results and we are happy with them. We have reached the investment conclusion that a good domestic backbone combined with strong global profitability will eventually be the two items that can take Ford's stock and begin to move it upward again in the interim; however, we are DRIPing shares of Ford and we're happy to sit on the shares and collect the dividends while the company continues to execute globally. Of recent, we've done a lot of focusing on Ford's operations in China and India for obvious reasons. Asia has been in the news over the last two months due to the market volatility and due to China's economic woes, and we have been tracking Ford's progress and the comments of the management to make sure that this major part of our thesis for being long the company continues to hold up. So far, what we've seen is Ford moving its strategies to fit the mold it needs to in India, and a management team that continues to think that things are on the right path in China. It's also important that we keep in check how the company is doing domestically. Our domestic case for Ford is focused mainly on its new F-150 series and its new Mustang offering. Both of these models are selling very well, and actually selling in excess of predicted demand, here in the US. As the foundation for our long thesis in the company, it's important that we continue to see these type of positive headlines from the company here in the US. It's been good news on both fronts, as the Mustang recently beat out the Camaro as the best-selling domestic sports car, closing the most recent chapter in an important rivalry for both companies that existed more than 30 years. After years of competition, the Ford Mustang now rules in the US. The sports car has also outperformed the Chevrolet Camaro, which is one of the biggest achievements for the automaker. However, the sixth-generation Camaro has just entered the market and competition is doomed to go onto another new level once again. Last month in August, sales of the sixth-generation Mustang rose significantly to 70 percent. This proves that the sports car has established its worth in the US, now only time can prove how it performs in the rest of the world. The Ford Mustang is currently sold in the US for a price of $23,800 and can be preordered in Australia for a starting price of $44,990. Our research also led us to several new articles that seem to think Ford's F-150 continues to hold promise in the US. This rounds out the two most important factors of the domestic case to us. Business Finance News stated about the F-150: Ford Motor Company ( NYSE:F ) has reported record sales for its F-series trucks, a strong indication that Ford's last year gamble is reaping benefits for the US auto-maker. The automaker introduced a massive implementation program in August last year, converting the steel-body-made popular F-150's to aluminum-coated body. However, the company faced hefty costs, in the process of shifting to aluminum-made trucks, and the question is: Was it all worth it? Ford initially had to close the truck assembly plant at Dearborn, resulting in a fall in production. Ford had earlier on derived about 40% of the revenue from its Ford trucks according to marketwatch. Moving away from steel lead to high disruption costs and a fall in sales, as demand outstripped constrained production. The company estimates that due to production issues, it will not be able to entirely fulfill demand for the new truck. The company estimates a shortfall of about 90,000 units per year. As a reminder, the company is also coming off of fantastic August auto sales numbers. Month after month, the company reports good numbers domestically, but it does little to move the stock. The stock will move, we believe, only when the bottom line improves. For August, the company saw strength in its SUVs, Mustang sales, Lincoln sales, and F-series. The product line domestically continues to be robust and in demand. This follows several articles we've written tracking the strong demand of the F-series and the management's continued bullish commentary that is pointing to stability in sales in key areas like China as well as continued growth in the US, which makes up the backbone of Ford's revenue. We stated in a past article that we see this as a positive sign for the US economy and the strength of the auto industry as a whole, which appeared to be strong in August across the board . U.S. auto sales were the strongest in any month since July 2005. The annualized selling rate in August was 17.8 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, well above expectations of 17.3 million. The six largest automakers in the U.S. market all beat the sales forecasts of industry analysts, with Toyota, Honda, Nissan and GM reporting declines that were not as severe as expected. Domestically, it appears that the bull case is still very much intact for the short term, even though we take a long-term view on the company. We continue to think Ford is an attractive buy here due to its valuation, which at $13.71 gives it a price/sales of 0.38x, a PEG ratio of 0.37, and a forward P/E of just 7.14, which is low even for an automaker. The company's consistent yield, which is not at risk, remains a great reason to add at lower prices or continue to DRIP shares while the price of the equity sinks. Disclosure: I am/we are long F, GM.
