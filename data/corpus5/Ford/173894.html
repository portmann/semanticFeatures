Ford's SUV Segment Will Be A Catalyst In China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Fordâ€™s sales in China have dipped this year due to an economic slowdown in the country and the stock market crash, but the company is making a recovery. Ford, however, has arrested the slowdown in its sales in China in August by almost half as it has added new SUVs to its line-up, which is a smart move. The SUV market in China jumped 47% in the first half of the current year, 34% in July, and 46% in August, which is why Ford is bringing new SUVs. Ford, however, might face competition from Chinese and Japanese players who are trying to capture more of the market by offering incentives. Stimulus measures worth $160 billion and interest rate cuts will help bring the Chinese economy back on track, acting as a tailwind for auto sales and Ford. The Chinese economy is going through a very tough phase as its growth is expected to slow down to another low this year. In 2014, China's economy grew at the slowest pace since 1990, and the trend is expected to continue in 2015 as the economy is expected to slow down to a 25-year low in 2015. This year's stock market crash has left Chinese consumers with less cash to spare and they are forced to lower their budgets drastically. Decline has been the story of every industry in China including automobiles, which has affected all the key car makers including Ford (NYSE: F ). China is the largest automobile market in the world since 2009. But, growth has now stalled with new vehicle sales declining for five straight months until August 2015. Sales of passenger vehicles dropped 3.4% to 1.4 million units in August, and they have shown no growth for the first eight months of the current year. Japanese car makers such as Toyota (NYSE: TM ) (up 13% year-to-date) and Honda (up 35% year-to-date) are the only ones who have bucked the trend of slowing sales in China. On the other hand, American manufacturers have borne the brunt of the slowdown with General Motors' (NYSE: GM ) sales growing just 2.3% and Ford's declining by 1% in the first eight months of the year. The local Chinese brands have benefited from this slump in the sales of American brands as they reported a 2.5% rise in combined sales in August and a combined market share of 39.4%. Many analysts attribute this recovery by the local Chinese players to their strong exposure in the SUV segment. The SUV segment is still more than alive in China with sales jumping 47% in the first half of the current year, followed by a 34% increase in July and a 46% improvement in August . This is one key area that will help Ford make a comeback going forward. In fact, Ford has been able to pull back its year-over-year sales decline from 6% in July to 3.3% in August. This is a result of Ford's moves to tap this key growth hotspot of SUVs in the Chinese market, because the company has recently rolled out new SUV models that it has readied specifically for China. Taking a cue from the growth trend in the SUV segment, Ford has brought three new SUVs to China to benefit from the growing demand of this segment in the region. The new SUVs introduced by Ford in China include five-passenger and seven-passenger versions of the Edge. These vehicles are being manufactured by Ford's Changan Joint Venture. In addition, an SUV under the Everest nameplate is being manufactured by the JMC venture and has been recently introduced in the country. More importantly, the Everest, which is based on the Ford Ranger pickup platform, is capable of going off-road as well, giving buyers more utility and expanding Ford's reach in rural centers. All in all, by adding three new models to the line-up, along with the Kuga, Explorer, and the EcoSport, Ford now has a complete line-up of SUVs that can satisfy every type of buyer in China. More importantly, since SUVs generally command higher margins, Ford is doing the right thing by tapping this market as it will allow it to overcome the slowdown in the Chinese market. Ford's new SUVs will face competition from domestic players that are flooding the market with cheaper SUV options and gaining market share rapidly. Further, the Japanese companies also have a strong level of cost competitiveness as compared to the Chinese, which could be a negative for Ford. Also, after the Chinese equity market has lost close to 40% of its value since mid-June, Chinese customers have suffered a serious blow to their purchasing power. People have started deferring their plans about buying their next new car. Under this tough market situation, dealerships and manufacturers are forced to offer discounts and other incentives in order to help prop up sales. They are offering attractive incentives such as "subsidized insurance, zero-down financing, interest-free loans and higher trade-in prices in a bid to lure car buyers back to showrooms." As a result, vehicle deliveries in August climbed 11% as compared to July. At the same time, retail deliveries also increased 0.6% to 1.44 million units, reversing the decline seen in the last two months. Although these incentives have helped avoid a decline, margins are coming under pressure now. Prices of SUVs, too, probably will continue to drop as competition intensifies, according to Macquarie. The SUV market is will act as a key growth driver for Ford in China going forward. This is why Ford's strategic initiatives and expansion into the SUV segment can translate into higher profits in the medium term. But, competition from the Chinese and other Asian players will be a big hurdle for Ford unless it can sustain its margins while fighting this war of incentives. But, at the same time, investors should not forget that the Chinese government is taking steps to prop up the economy. For example, the government is carrying out stimulus measures , and plans to inject around $160 billion into the economy in the next three years. At the same time, the Chinese central bank has slashed interest rates five times since November, and this has brought some stability to the market. Thus, we should not assume that China will remain in a state of slump forever, and the government's moves to improve the economy will play a key role in enhancing the purchasing power going forward. Hence, in my opinion, Ford's investments in the SUV segment in China will bear fruit in the long run and help the company improve its overall financial performance as the country contributes 18% to its sales.
