Ford Motor: No Doubt, This 4.5% Yielding Income Stock Is Now On Sale - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The global equity market sell-off has made Ford Motor a compelling income investment. After the market meltdown, Ford trades at less than 7.0x estimated 2015 earnings. Ford Motor's stock yields 4.5%, but dividend growth will boost the yield on cost over time. A 10% per-year dividend growth over the next three years implies a 6%+ dividend yield by 2018. Stocks have sold off sharply this week, but that is not entirely a bad thing. Companies like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) or Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) were brutally beaten down at the beginning of the week when Chinese stocks melted down on concerns over faltering growth in China, but that doesn't mean investors should run from equities. In fact, stocks often have the most appealing reward-to-risk ratios when a sell-off runs out of steam and investors reprice risk. Stock market indices have bounced back from their Monday lows, but good companies like Bank of America or Ford continue to sell for low earnings multiples. Frankly, Ford Motor's valuation has declined even more than I thought was possible; the stock now sells for less than 7x forward earnings, which reflects investors' concerns over global growth. On the other hand, there is a good chance that investors are overestimating the risk of a China-induced recession. From a valuation standpoint, investors run very little risk of overpaying for Ford Motor. More importantly, the meltdown earlier this week has driven Ford Motor to such a low level that even dedicated dividend investors might want to consider the auto company for their income portfolios. That's right. Investors are behaving so irrationally right now that they allow Ford Motor to sell at a 4.5% dividend yield. That kind of yield is normally associated with medium risk, large cap real estate investment trusts, not companies of Ford's size and equity valuation. Ford Motor has morphed into an income stock, and a rising yield on cost is the real story here No doubt, the nearly 5% dividend yield is a major selling point here. If you are looking for a solid yield backed by mountains of free cash flow, Ford Motor is definitely worth a lock. But the high yield only tells half the story. And the other half of the story is just as exciting: A rising yield on costs. Ford Motor increased its quarterly dividend by 25% in 2014 from $0.10 to $0.125 per share. In 2015, Ford Motor raised its per-share dividend by 20% to $0.15 per share. Since General Motors announced an ambitious capital return plan earlier this year, which I discussed here , investors rightfully expect competitive capital returns from Ford Motor's, too. General Motor's ambition to return more cash to shareholders will also keep the pressure up for Ford Motor to deliver dividend growth and let investors participate in the growth of the auto company. Though it is unlikely that Ford Motor will grow its dividend at rates north of 20% every year moving forward, a 10% dividend growth per-year is entirely within the realms of possibility...if the company's performance remains as robust as it is now. A look at Ford's excellent U.S. sales results in July proves that Ford's growth story is far from being over. And even if China's stock market remains rocky in the near term, Ford Motor's results depend largely on the U.S. auto market. And the U.S. economy is doing just fine . Let's assume for a moment that Ford Motor grows its annual dividend by just 10% a year, which is a significantly lower growth rate than the one Ford actually produced over the last two years, then the auto company is on track to paying $0.80 per share annually/$0.20 quarterly in 2018. Since Ford Motor now sells for $13.21 -- the lowest price since April 2013 --, Ford's market valuation implies a 6.1% yield on cost. Rising yields on cost add to the appeal of Ford Motor as an income investment. The worldwide stock market turbulence earlier this week has made Ford Motor an appealing candidate for a dividend portfolio. The auto manufacturer is obviously undervalued at less than 7.0x 2015 earnings, but at a 4.5% dividend yield Ford Motor is also interesting for investors that accentuate dividend growth. If Ford Motor raises its annual dividend payout by only 10% each year over the next three years, which is a much lower rate than Ford's actual dividend growth rate over the last two years, Ford Motor's yield on cost will grow from ~4.5% today to 6%+ by 2018.
