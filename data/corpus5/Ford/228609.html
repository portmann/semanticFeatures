Ford Motor: I Am Reducing My Price Target On The Stock - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released U.S. vehicle sales for the month of October last week. Total vehicle sales surged 13.4%% on the back of persistently strong pickup and SUV demand. I have lowered my return expectations with respect to Ford's stock. Is Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) dead money? That's the question I raised at the end of October in my last article on Ford Motor entitled " This Doesn't Make Any Sense...Is Ford Motor Dead Money? ". The reason why I brought this theme up was because Ford Motor's stock has profoundly disappointed my return expectations this year. Under normal circumstances I'd say that a company with poor financial results deserves to perform poorly, no question. But Ford Motor seems to be special case in which fundamental investment principles don't apply. Take Ford's stock for example: Since the start of the year, Ford Motor has lost ~6% in value. Even when factoring in the dividend this year, Ford has not been a winning investment so far. And that's despite the fact that Ford released near perfect sales updates throughout the year, at least for the United States. But investors simply don't care. Will things change on the back of strong profit growth moving forward? Frankly, I don't think that's likely at all. Ford Motor's stock has hardly moved in light of the Volkswagen emissions scandal -- even though one would think that Ford benefited from Volkswagen's blowback. In addition, Ford Motor released October sales figures for the U.S. market last week, and they were expectedly strong. And what did the stock do? Nothing. Last month Ford Motor's U.S. vehicle sales surged yet again; total vehicle sales were up 13.4% Y/Y from 188,654 in October last year to 213,938 vehicles this October. According to Ford's press release, see here , last month's total vehicle and retail sales signified the best October in terms of sales in eleven years. That's quite an accomplishment. Year-to-date, Ford Motor has now sold 5.4% more vehicles than during the same period last year: 2,186,126 vehicles to be precise. Ford Motor's U.S. retail sales climbed 13% in October, while F-Series retail sales were up 12%. These are respectable numbers by any standard, but does Mr. Market care? Nope. The stock either doesn't move at all, or even heads lower. Good news also came from the price front: Higher average transaction prices and demand growth were driving Ford's results in October. According to Ford's press release, average transaction prices increased a whopping $1,800 Y/Y: Strong demand for our vehicles provided another double-digit sales increase in October, and Ford vehicles posted all-time record average transaction pricing of $34,600 per vehicle. Gains in our truck business were especially strong, with F-Series delivering its fourth straight month of sales gains and its best October retail levels since 2004. Sales and price growth reflect robust economics on the ground, but we all know that already. Since Ford Motor's stock continues to fail to react positively to good news, I don't think earnings surprises and continued sales growth will be positive catalysts for Ford anymore. As a result, I believe Ford will not be able to outperform the market over the next twelve months, and I am reducing my price target from $18 to $17. A large part of my position in Ford Motor consists of January 2017 calls with a strike price of $17. Since I have to take the time value of such options into consideration, I might very well restructure my position and shift more funds into the common stock now that I have adjusted my price target. The common stock at least pays a 4% dividend. From a sentiment point of view, however, I don't expect investors to change their "disinterested" attitude towards Ford any time soon. Buy for income.
