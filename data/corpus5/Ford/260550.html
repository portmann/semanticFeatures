SM Energy's (SM) Management presents at 2015 Wells Fargo Energy Symposium Brokers Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities All right, we’ll go ahead and get started. I’m Gordon Douthat with the equity research team here at Wells Fargo, and this morning we’re pleased to welcome SM Energy. We’ve got Wade Pursell here to present, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Samuels, IR in the back. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for your interest in SM. It’s great to be in New York this time of year, isn’t it? But it is a tough time in the oil and gas business, I don’t have to tell you guys that. For those of you that know me, what a difference the year has made, right? A year ago, I had a full head of hair, okay maybe not, but it’s been a tough year. And not just for us and our peers, you guys too. I don’t envy your job in the least trying to figure out when the macros is going to turn, what the macro is going to do and then which companies to invest in when you’re making those decisions. I’m sure you want a company that’s a top tier performer with a solid balance sheet and lots of inventory, and frankly that sounds a lot like SM Energy. I hope you’ll agree with me at the conclusion of the presentation this morning. So I have to warn you, I’m sure I’ll talk about the future a little bit this morning and I’m definitely not a prophet, but I would summarize those words. There is again top tier performers, strong balance sheet, lots of economic inventory and that inventory is in some of the best basins in the country; the Williston Basin, the Eagle Ford and over in the Midland Basin. I’ll kind of take you through those areas this morning. It’s going to be a very simple presentation this morning. I’m going to organize it around those three main points, so let’s get started. Top tier performers; it’s always a big question what metrics do you use when you’re measuring performance in the E&P industry. I think it has to be cash flow growth as well as production and reserves growth, but not just growth for the sake of growth, economic growth. And then what’s the best way to measure that. I think everyone would agree on a per share basis and even better yet on a debt adjusted per share basis I think is the best way to measure that performance. There’s really no place to hide when you think about it if you measure it that way. So you can see on this slide, we look at this, this is an annual metric, so you’re looking at 2014, '13 and '12 us versus our peer group and you can see we were in the top tier, top quartile in each one of these metrics through '14. The other thing, I think we’re the only company that’s been top tier on each of those. I think the other thing that jumps off the page at me every time I see this slide is how many of the peers don’t even grow on this basis. And if you think about it, this was during a period where commodity prices were pretty robust the whole period, so just keep that in mind and this should be a really interesting slide when we put the 2015 metrics in. More recent performance; this is third quarter, we released this information about a month ago. Solid quarter, outperformed our guidance. I think every quarter this year we beat expectations pretty handedly. Production was up, it’s up 30% over '14 levels. Costs were down. LOE was down about 16% over the comparables levels in '14. And CapEx continues to fall. I think the best example of that is the cost of the wells in the Eagle Ford now are about 46% below where they were a year ago. I will talk about that further later in the presentation. The other point we made and I’ll reiterate it today, haven’t given any specific guidance on 2016 yet. The other thing we are saying is that we’re building a program that we’ll spend within our EBITDAX levels next year. From an activity standpoint, we’re exactly where we thought we would be. We started the year at 17 rigs. We’re now down to seven rigs and that’s primarily in the Eagle Ford and the Williston Basins. The other thing that’s interesting on this slide, the line going up into the right represents our count of drilled but uncompleted wells. We’re now projecting that we’ll end the year at about 140 DUCs as we call them. That’s higher than we had previously anticipated and that’s really due to the faster drilling times that we’re experiencing. So this program of reduced activity coupled with cost falling as they are is resulting in a budget of about $1.28 billion this year, which is 37% below 2014 levels. So I said strong balance sheet; how do you define strong balance sheet. I think there’s three main ways to do that that you have to cover one as total debt compared to your cash flow, the other is how much liquidity do you have and the third is what does your maturity schedule look like? So from a total debt standpoint, we ended the third quarter with 1.9x trailing EBITDAX. Lots of liquidity. Our borrowing base recently has been re-determined at $2 billion. We had about 184 million drawn on that at the end of the third quarter. And then from a maturity standpoint, the nearest term maturity on our long-term bonds is 2021. So, a strong balance sheet. You look at those metrics relative to the peers and stack up really well, probably the most important metric we have to EBITDAX, we’re well below the peer average of a little over 3x. The other thing I’ll say is this is a pretty strong peer group that we’re comparing to. I mean you guys all know there’s a whole lot of peers out there with credit metrics much worse than this. Final slide on balance sheet relates to hedging. We do include hedging as an important part of our financial risk management program. We hedge volumes out four or five years. All those hedges that we have in place currently are in the Appendix of the presentation. If you want the details relating to 2016, I’ll tell you we haven’t guided production but if you just assume flat production was where we are currently, our hedges cover about 44% of our production next year. Okay, so the last piece was economic inventory. About a year ago, for the first time, we quantified how much inventory we believe we have and we said we had about 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and that’s a big number for a company our size. If you compare that to production last year, that’s about 20x, so a pretty good number. And it’s in – as I said earlier, it’s in the Williston, Eagle Ford and also in the Midland Basin. These are some of the best plays in the country and the economics stack up very well with everyone in the industry. So I think the more exciting thing about inventory right now is now just those numbers that we released last year, but the belief that we really do have the potential to double those numbers that we just showed you on that slide and it’s really in each basin. In the Eagle Ford, we have some of the thickest pay in the area anywhere between 250 feet and 300 feet thick, it’s energetic [ph]. In those numbers that I just showed you, we were assuming very conservative spacing and frankly primarily just the lower Eagle Ford, and I’ll get to that in a minute. The Bakken interval, we’ll talk about Divide County where we’re most excited right now. In the inventory numbers, we’ve only assumed Three Forks and I’ll show you in a minute that we’re very encouraged that the Bakken is working there as well. And then finally in the Midland Basin, not unlike a lot of folks we believe that there is at least five intervals of interest here and we’ve only touched a couple of those to-date. So let’s go through each of those areas real quick, starting with the Eagle Ford. Those of you that know us well know that this has really been the growth engine of the company in the last several years, very large productive position for us. You can see the production has gone from beginning in '09 to currently about 137,000 barrels a day. That’s about 75% of the total company’s production. The position is located over to the West. You can see the Mexican border on the western edge of our acreage. We’ve got about 180,000 net acres. A little over 80% of that we operate with the remaining 20% being operated by Anadarko. So you’ll hear us seem a lot recently better wells, better cheaper wells, better wells at lower costs. This slide I think is a nice demonstration of the cost reductions in the Eagle Ford, not just the drilling side but the completion side. So starting with the drilling side, you can see that we’re drilling these wells for about 28% less than we were a year ago and it’s not just the reduction in the services costs, it’s also the efficiencies. We’re drilling them in about 14% reduced time period versus last year. And then on the completion side, costs have really fallen. They’re down about 54% this year versus last year on a per lateral foot basis. So you combine all of that and you get the number that I quoted to you earlier. Total drilling and completion costs are down about 46% versus last year in the Eagle Ford. So what about inventory, that’s what we were talking about earlier. As I mentioned before, we have especially from an energy standpoint some of the thickest pay in the Eagle Ford, you think about 250 feet to 350 feet thick but that’s a lot of pay. And I will repeat what I said earlier, the numbers that we were reporting in the inventory was based on very conservative spacing and really not much contribution from the upper Eagle Ford. So what we’ve done is we’ve put in place a very aggressive testing program; nine pilots that you see listed on this slide to test the acreage to find out how many locations we think we have by pushing the spacing, by testing the upper Eagle Ford. The first five of these nine are already producing or flowing back. Pilot number one, you know we’ve given a lot of data already on and those wells are now producing the tight curve. I can tell you they’re continuing down, performing on the tight curve. Pilot two; still a little early but that’s a 2-well test over in the East as well. I should have mentioned that the first pilot is over in the eastern area and you can see on the map where these pilots are located. Regarding two, it’s still too early to report any results on that 2-well test. I will remind you that we anticipated lower pressures on these wells and that’s what we’re seeing, but we’re seeing good production so far, just too early to make any conclusions. Pilot three, I’ll come back to in a minute. We have some news on that. Pilot four and five swinging over to the North side, our programs that we’re really excited about and hoping we’ll be able to talk about those in the coming months, but certainly still too early to tell on those. So I mentioned that we have some results to share with you on pilot three. Let me back up for a second to locate it on the map. You see that pilot three is down in kind of the southern part of our position, so here it is. It’s a 5-well test in the W style design testing both the lower Eagle Ford and the upper Eagle Ford. So you can see on the map to the right where those wells are located; two in the upper, three distinctly in the lower. The point I’ll make from this slide that you can see is how aggressive the spacing is; 312 foot planned new spacing on these wells and you can see that the multiple facies to the left and this is testing in the facies 3 and 6. Early data very encouraging. This is showing you the production, showing reliance for the upper Eagle Ford and the lower Eagle Ford and you can see both of those are now handedly outperforming the tight curve. I’ll point out you can see it, these wells were choked back early on and finally through November we were able to release them and let them produce, and you’re seeing the very positive results now. Equally as important and as encouraging is the pressure data relative to these wells and you can see that both in the upper and the lower, we’re seeing very strong pressures hold up and that’s very encouraging to this as well. I think there’s no interference which is great. I guess the final point on these wells that I’ll make, if you know the acreage very well, you know this is kind of the gassier part of the play, so that’s not great. But the thing that’s exciting to us here is we think this has huge implications for our ascensions in the whole eastern area with respect to the upper Eagle Ford and spacing. And as you also should know that that area is in some of the most economic wells in our play. So you can see why we’re excited about the Eagle Ford. Let’s turn to the Bakken where we also have a very large asset, about 245,000 net acres up in northwest North Dakota and eastern Montana. Kind of the area of focus for us right now is up in Divide County near the Canadian border. You can see that yellow blob in the middle, that’s about 120,000 net acres, very large position for us. We have about 60% average working interest in that area, so if you imagine 120,000 net acres, a very large position that we’re controlling in the area. So why are really excited about it? We really do believe we have the geological sweet spot here. If you think about that map of Divide County, this is kind of in the center of the county where it gets shallower I guess about 8,000 or 9,000 feet. It’s very thick pay and the water cuts are lower. So what you end up with is lower cost wells which are also very productive, so very good economics here. I don’t have a slide in here for the Bakken showing the lower costs as I did in the Eagle Ford but I can tell you we’re seeing the same things in the Bakken/Three Forks. For example, I think the most recent well we drilled was about 8,000 down and [indiscernible] 18,000 feet of drilling was done in 9.75 days, which was pretty amazing. What I have done is included a slide on improving economics we’re seeing by going to plug-and-perf from sliding sleeve. That comes with a cost obviously. If you think about these wells costing about $4.1 million using sliding sleeve, I told you they were really low costs, adding about $0.5 million a well for plug-and-perf that you can see from this slide that the benefits far outweigh the costs. You can see that we’re outperforming the tight curve and more importantly the IRRs are significantly improved. So what about inventory? I’ll take you back to that slide where we talked about the amount of inventory we have companywide. The numbers that were assumed in the Bakken/Three Forks there assumed only the Three Forks up in Divide County. At the time, based on the logs, we were assuming the Bakken would be wet and would not work. That’s turning out absolutely to not be the case, and we’re testing that this year. We’ve drilled about nine wells now in the upper part of the acreage in the Bakken and you can see they’re actually outperforming the Three Forks tight curve, so very encouraging. We’ve now drilled two wells in the southern part, actually completed those, so we should be able to report some news on those pretty soon as well. So you can see while we’re excited about the inventory in the Bakken as well. And then finally, the Permian position we have, more economic inventory I say. This is a very contiguous position we have, about 15,000 net acres in the Midland Basin, kind of right on the border of Midland and Upton counties. If you know the area very well, you know that this is where the best Wolfcamp B wells are being drilled and I’ll talk about that in a minute. But first of all on inventory, we’ve only touched, I mentioned earlier, a couple of intervals here and we believe we’ve got at least five intervals of interest in this area. So we’re looking forward to testing those and if we start thinking about 15,000 net acres, start thinking 4x or 5x becomes a lot bigger position. So we’re very excited to get back to work in the Permian frankly. In the reduction of activity during this year, we dropped our rig in our Permian I think back in May and frankly that was just because it was easy to do. Our position is HPP. We didn’t have any long-term rig commitments, so it was easy to slow down and wait on cost to fall in the Permian. So, we’re excited to get back to work here probably in January. So I mentioned the Wolfcamp B, this is just some recent state data on all the wells being drilled in this area and what is shows is that our wells based on early production, early IPs are actually the best in the area. So obviously a testament to the geology but also to the guys and pushing the completion designs, more sand, et cetera, and doing a really nice job hitting the right landing zones, which is very important here. So looking forward to '16, I mentioned excitement about getting back to work in the Permian. It shouldn’t shock you that we say we’re going to be focused on the best returns, right. We always do that but it’s particularly important in this low price environment. So what you could envision with that is some slight allocation away from the Eagle Ford a little bit into the Permian and the Bakken, the oiler areas. We’ve already started completing the oily DUC wells up in the Bakken later here in the fourth quarter. It should have a very minimal impact on CapEx because of starting so late. And we continue to focus in talking about bigger wells at lower costs and obviously still working on the inventory, continue to test and see how much we got in the Eagle Ford and up in the Bakken Divide. So I told you it was a simple presentation. I hope you sense some excitement about where we are right now at SM Energy. Look, we’re not doing cartwheels down the hall at $37 oil and $2 by gas but we are excited about the opportunities that we think that gives us to differentiate SM Energy from a lot of the peers and that’s what we’re doing and working on. And we really believe coming out of this, we’re even going to be stronger and that’s exciting to us. So hopefully when you think of us, you’ll remember top tier performer with a strong balance sheet and lots of economic inventory. Thank you again for your time and interest. Thank you, Wade. We do have a little bit of time. We can take a couple of questions. So I’ll kick it off. You mentioned a number of things about – in the various basins a number of initiatives you’re undertaking to double the inventory. And just as you look forward into 2016, I know it will play some part of your program, but how expensive will those initiatives be as you look to formulate your 2016 program? They’ll play a very large part. As I mentioned, we certainly haven’t guided anything for next year but we have guided the fact that we’re going to spend within EBITDAX. If you think about the rig count we’re at now, the seven rigs – I’ve told people before if you think in terms of two or three rigs in the Eagle Ford, a couple of rigs in the Bakken and one or two in the Permian, you end up with a program that’s probably pretty close. And within that program we certainly have a very significant amount of the testing that you’re asking about that we’ll continue to do. And certainly one of the trends from you and across the industry in this downturn has been doing more with less. With kind of that general framework out there, how might that translate to 2016 and beyond? And then also with the DUC inventory that you have there, how do you kind of weigh all those within the context of your balance sheet and leverage? Yes, it’s hard to quantify anything in that question but directionally I certainly anticipate wells getting better. Amazingly, we’re still working on different things with completion designs and improving well results. I think if prices stay down here or continue to fall, I think cost will continue to fall as well. So that will be part of the more with less. And what was your third -- Well, from a balance sheet standpoint I think I’ve said that we’re going to close this year around 2.2x. That’s part of the idea of working with an EBITDAX next year to keep the balance sheet metrics in areas that we’re comfortable with, so that will play a part of it as well. And sorry, working the DUCs down, that will clearly have an impact. As I mentioned, we have 140. I think you need to think in terms of 60-ish or in that ballpark of an area that we probably have normally anyway. But the first half of next year we’ll be pretty aggressively I think working that count down and obviously that will be very efficient productive capital since the drilling’s already been done, so that will be part of it as well. Good question. If you didn’t hear the full question without the mic is if we’ve had some great production in the Eagle Ford in the past years and with some reallocation of capital to the Bakken and Permian, what would be the impact of that on the Eagle Ford? I certainly can’t guide any production in the Eagle Ford at this point, but everything equal it’s going to slow it down a little bit. We’re not going to be focused on production for the sake of production. Gas production is pretty easy, right. So when you’re allocating oil that’s going to slow the production line down a little bit and it’s going to make it more economic, which is what we’re all about.
