Ford family keeps the voting power at company - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha May 12 2016, 10:55 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Shareholders at Ford ( F -0.5%) voted down a proposal to change the class structure of the shares which gives the Ford family voting control of the company. 63.1% rejected the measure? Of that 63.1% how much of it was Ford family members? Answer-40%, so truthfully only 23.1% of Ford shareholders voted not to change it, ummmmmm nice scam if you can keep it going So  38.5% by your logic.   23.1/60.   Not as big a scam as your numbers try and make it either.  Still less than half though.  Just not a scam per se. Scam?  The Ford family built the company and rightfully own a significant portion of the company.  Their part is still not half, so there is a possibility to vote against them.  Not a scam by any means, but certainly frustrating to someone wanting to effect change. Ford makes great trucks and some pretty good cars, too.  If you don't like the family politics, you don't have to own stock.  Last I checked there were plenty of other companies to buy . . . even other manufacturers of cars and trucks. It always amuses me that typically the stockholder who initiates these numerous and yearly revisions to the company are identified as owners of ...100 SHARES. Part of Ford's successes are the actual beating hearts of the Ford family who give I do want to see some change. Change can be good. I am one of those with over 100 shares. I am happy with the company. If I had more money, I'd buy more to make my voice heard more but unfortunately that hasn't happened yet. Besides great cars, i went and drove a new Mustang and it is a really great responsive car, the Ford family has done more for this country than most. How many jobs over the years? Great story in my book, If you don't like it start a company and you can call it what you like and do with it what you want. Then, I'm sure the first thing you would do is give away control of the company. Because of the Ford family's wisdom and vision Ford was able to incest in the future, avoid bankruptcy hire Alan Mulally, create a lot of value for all stakeholders and move to record setting profits. Without their leadership, investors looking for short term profits would have behaved differently and the company would not be where is is today. I don't believe Ford family "incest" had anything to do with it. I realize that was just a typo, but gee whiz, sometimes spell check can really make a difference. RSR kingherman - No, it was 63.1% of the Class A stock that rejected the perennial proposal.  The shares the Ford family own are separate and distinct from the publicly traded shares.  Since Ford went public in 1956, the Ford family has retained 40% voting rights in the form of Class B stock.  Edsel Ford established the Ford Foundation in 1936, and when Ford Motor Company went public additional shares of F were given to the foundation, which remains one of the largest foundations in the USA to this day.
