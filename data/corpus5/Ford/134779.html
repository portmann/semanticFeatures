ETF Hub After reporting earnings, Ford’s stock price has not exactly broken out from current levels, as it is still down 9.5% over the last year. The performance in North America carried the company, but profits should only improve during the second half of the year domestically and internationally. The company’s long-term management looks more than competent to carry out the breakout they have predicted during the second half of the year. I Know First wrote a bullish argument for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) last week on Seeking Alpha, arguing that the run-up to the earnings report was a great time to buy the stock. Much of the fundamental analysis which pointed to the stock being undervalued proved to be true during the earnings report, and the company's overall performance was quite good. In spite of that, the stock price has not been able to break out from the $15 level like it should. Even after reporting its best quarterly profit since 2000 with better performance coming in the next couple of years, the stock price is remaining stagnant. While pessimistic investors might point to the irrational trading of the stock, patient long-term investors can take advantage. The company has successfully made it through a transition during the first half of the year and a successful second half of the year is coming. Much if not almost all of the success during the second quarter came from North America, where the company posted its best ever margins at over 11%. Demand for the retooled F-150 and Sport Utility Vehicles helped the company earn $1.9 billion in net profits during the most recent quarter, a 44% increase from the same quarter a year ago. The performance was boosted by some external factors, as more customers wanted larger, more expensive vehicles due to low oil prices. These external factors should continue into the second half of the year, as any recovery in oil prices is expected to be slow and gradual. The performance of these vehicles, especially the company's trucks, should actually improve during the second half of the year. The first half was always expected to be a transition period as the company retooled its factories for the new aluminum bodied trucks. The manufacturing turnover was completed during the first quarter, but sales were still lower compared to the year ago period as production was lower during the first couple of months. With production now at full speed, sales should improve during the second half of the year. The truck shortage during the second quarter was offset by higher transaction prices, as customers are going for higher end models. The stock price took a hit in the beginning of July based off of reports that the company was offering huge price deductions for the new trucks. Speculation that demand was not as high as expected were clearly off base, as the company reported that average transaction prices were at all time highs and price deductions were lower than they were last year. Further, these vehicles also spent less time on the lot than other vehicles in the segment, showing that there is still more demand and upside for these vehicles to contribute to profits during the second half of the year. Indeed, with the company's performance during the second quarter in North America so impressive, it is almost baffling that the stock price has not traded up more than the roughly 5.5% gain since earnings. It is possible that investors are worried that external factors are playing a larger part than the company's actual performance, and there are still concerns in other markets. But this strong performance in North America came a quarter earlier than the company promised, and guidance for the region is being pushed higher. Performance will need to improve to make up for struggles internationally, especially South America, but there is reason to be optimistic about Europe and Asia. Ford has been struggling in Europe for some time now, but that trend is expected to turn around during the second half of the year. The strong dollar is negatively affecting the profitability in the market. Even so, the company increased sales in the region as a whole by 3% during the first half of the year with higher industry sales in 20 European countries. The improved performance in Europe is also building up recently, and even though sales in the region are usually weaker during the second half of the year, that might not be the case this year. Sales in June increased 16% in June compared to the same month a year ago. Ford has already opened one hundred FordStores across Europe with another hundred modern stores to open by the end of the year. With more stores, sales of popular models should increase. This is true of models like the Mondeo and Fiesta, the latter of which was named the most popular supermini in the market for the first half of 2015. The second most popular vehicle in the market overall, this shows that Ford's move to recalibrate efforts in the region are paying off, and, having already come close to breaking even, Ford will start to post profits there during the second half of the year as the company has long projected. Concerning China, the big news coming from the earnings call was that management at Ford was lowering its guidance for the rest of the year. This is not as big of a deal as it initially seems for the long-term, and I will explain that in a minute. In the near-term, this market still showed improvement and reasons to believe that performance will exceed expectations during the second half of the year. While the overall sales in China are expected to slow down, it still remains the biggest market in the world, one in which Ford is expanding its market share. And while sales slow in the major cities, Ford believes it can continue to grow share by targeting smaller cities, or so-called Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities. These don't have the same restrictions on new cars as some of the larger cities, and Ford is focusing much of its efforts on these smaller markets with new dealerships. Clearly, there is enough to be excited about in the short-term to push the stock price higher. Even more exciting for long-term investors should be how the company's strategy adopted in 2007, the One Ford plan, is clearly coming to fruition. The first half of the year was expected to set up the company for a breakout in the second half, and it has overachieved on these expectations. The restructuring to operate profitably has achieved its goal, with profits improving everywhere except for in South America. Even in this market where the automotive industry as a whole is facing huge resistance, the company's local team there is managing to keep losses at a respectable level with high pricing until the market recovers. This is going to take time, unlike in China where the current projection for a fall in demand during the second half of the year should only be temporary. Management at Ford expects sales to increase to 30 million vehicles within the next five years. Even with the dip in the industry during the previous quarter, the company was able to increase operating profit by 21%, recording $192 million in profit. The company has successfully been able to adjust production in the market due to falling demand, and it will be ready to address growing demand in the future. Even more exciting for investors in the long-term should be the management's competency. As such a large company with a respectable dividend yield still at 3.83%, investors can take advantage of the income from this company that is ready to take advantage of the legwork of its strategy. Mark Fields, the company's CEO, talked about thinking as a startup in the changing auto industry, as the company is exploring the future of the auto industry in big markets with things like car sharing and other ways for people to get around. With 25 experiments currently going on exploring everything from autonomous cars to car sharing to connected cars, the company is looking forward to a changing environment instead of focusing on its laurels, something that put the company in danger roughly 10 years ago. As the article published last week previewing the earnings report predicted, the earnings report beat expectations and laid the groundwork for a breakout in the stock. That hasn't quite happened yet, and the stock continues to trade in the low $15 dollar range, something hard to justify with its prospects for the second half of the year when profits should only keep improving. Even more importantly than near-term prices, this report shows that the company has an excellent strategy and is set up great for the next five years. With the current P/E ratio still near 9.5 and the high dividend yield, this is a solid investment choice that long-term investors can hold on to for a long, long time. I Know First is bullish on this company over the long-term, believing the stock price still has plenty of upside during the next year and beyond.
