Why Ford Will Get Better In Europe - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s latest sales data for the month of February in Europe indicates that it is set to build up on its profitable performance last year. Ford has lined-up SUVs, crossovers, and performance cars going forward as these will enable it to improve its margins and overall profitability on the back of strong end-market demand. SUV sales in Europe are expected to grow from 1.9 million units this year to 2.2 million units in 2020, opening up an opportunity for Ford to increase high-margin sales. Ford’s Kuga is already outpacing other crossovers in terms of sales growth in Europe, while the company is also reducing reliance on fleet sales to improve profitability. On Thursday last week, Ford (NYSE: F ) released its European sales numbers for the month of February that turned out to be very impressive. Its sales in Europe increased 18% during the month on a year-over-year basis, leading to an increase of 0.3 percentage points in the market share. What's more, across 50 markets in Europe, Ford's sales growth of 17% outpaced the industry's growth of 10% as the company saw strength across different segments including SUVs and commercial vehicles. In fact, Ford's performance in February was even better than its performance in the preceding month. Ford had sold 9.7% more vehicles in the month of January 2016 in Europe as compared to the prior-year period. For the month of January as well, the automaker's monthly sales were better than the industry sales growth of 6.7%. Thus, it cannot be denied that Ford has got off to a tremendous start in Europe this year, and this will allow the company to build further on the success that it had seen last year. So, let's take a look at the reasons why Ford will continue to do well in Europe. In 2015, Ford achieved a remarkable turnaround in Europe. The company's European division reported an income of $259 million before tax as against a pre-tax loss of $598 million in 2014. This clearly indicates that Ford has got its strategy right in Europe. For instance, Ford is looking to push sales toward retail customers as compared to fleet customers. This is because the company gets superior margins from retail than fleet. In fact, the contribution of Ford's fleet sales out of its total sales dropped from 22% a year ago to 19% in January 2016. Additionally, Ford is also closing down on the practice of "self-registration." Under this practice, dealers register new cars as demo cars, therefore counting such cars as sales and thereby inflating the numbers. By clamping down on the practice of self-registration, Ford will be able to distinguish real sales from rentals and devise its strategy accordingly for the future. In 2016, Ford is on track to release seven new or updated models in Europe. The new upcoming models include the new Kuga and the Edge SUVs, apart from the Focus RS performance car that's aimed at the enthusiasts and will improve Ford's profile. Additionally, the company will equip the Transit Custom and the Transit 2-ton models with new power trains, apart from giving a facelift to the Ranger pickup. Once Ford is through with these launches this year, it will come up with five new crossovers for the European market over the next three years. Now, as we can see above, Ford is focusing a lot on the SUV and crossover segment in Europe. This is not surprising as the company expects sales of SUVs and performance cars to remain strong in Europe this year. In fact, Ford expects SUV sales in Europe to surge 30% as compared to 2015 on the back of increasing demand. As a result, Ford expects to sell more than 200,000 SUVs in Europe this year, which will be a record for the company. This will help boost sales, margins, and overall profitability as SUVs and performance cars carry higher margins . At the same time, sales of Ford's performance cars are also expected to increase by 50% over 2015, with a projection of about 40,000 cars to be sold in this segment. Moreover, by launching new crossovers and SUVs over the next three years in Europe, Ford is making a smart move. I'm saying this because crossover and SUV sales in the continent are expected to grow from 1.9 million units this year to 2.2 million units in 2020. The good part is that Ford is already on top of the crossover game in Europe as the growth in sales of the Kuga has outpaced almost all of its rivals. Ford has started the year well in Europe with sales increasing at a faster clip in February than in January. This will allow Ford to build up on its profitable performance in Europe last year, especially because the company is focusing on improving its high-margin SUV and crossover line-up. Thus, investors can expect Ford to go one up on its performance in Europe this year as compared to 2015, which will ultimately have a positive impact on its bottom line.
