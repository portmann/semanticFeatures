The Weirdness Of A Ford Motor Investment - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released robust sales data for the Chinese market on Friday. Yet, Ford Motor's stock retreated sharply and again slipped below $15. Positive news flow doesn't seem to help Ford Motor's stock. Wow. Something is definitely not right here. It is not only since yesterday that I think that Mr. Market is completely off when it comes to valuing Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), but though I have seen a couple of ups and downs in Ford Motor's stock price, sometimes even I am left in awe when I look at how weirdly the stock reacts to good news. Ford Motor has not been a great performer, to say the least. The stock is down 13% over the last year and 5% year-to-date. That's annoying when you are a Ford Motor shareholder or, like in my case, a stock and optionholder. More important, it is frustrating to see that Ford Motor's stock languishes despite a fairly good news flow. Consider Ford's release of U.S. sales figures for the month of May at the beginning of June. Ford beat the consensus estimate by a wide margin, yet the stock failed to react positively to the sales announcement. Further, Ford Motor reported robust vehicle sales growth in China at the end of last week, and what did the stock do? Yeah, you guessed it; it went down again. â€‹SHANGHAI, China - Ford China sold 91,013 vehicles in May, a four-percent increase compared to 87,887 in May 2014. From January to May, Ford sold 459,982 vehicles in China, up one percent from 456,594 during the same period last year. Ford's passenger car joint venture Changan Ford Automobile sold 67,357 vehicles in May, an increase of three percent from 65,229 in May 2014. Year-to-date sales for CAF reached 332,999 vehicles, up one percent from 330,896 during the same period last year. Despite a softer commercial vehicle segment, Jiangling Motors Corporation (JMC), which sells the Ford Transit commercial van, sold 20,910 vehicles in May, up seven percent from 19,569 in May 2014. Year-to-date sales reached 114,638 vehicles, up four percent from 110,248 during the same period last year. Wrong. Ford Motor's stock retreated 1.79% on Friday in a lackluster trading session that saw the Dow Jones fall 0.31% and the S&P 500 slip 0.14%. Downward pressure on the stock market indices came from good jobs data that reignited the 'rate debate' once again. Good employment numbers raise the odds of the Fed increasing interest rates sooner than expected, which is something that should have happened years ago, but rate fears continue to scare investors every single time the topic crops up. Sell-offs related to good employment data make probably the least amount of sense. Rate hikes will surely come, and that's a positive for stocks. The reason is that positive interest rate growth underscores the fact that the economy is strong enough to grow on its own and without the artificial life support it still gets from the Fed. In any case, the sell-off in Ford's stock on Friday and the current trading weakness aren't justified at all. The unfortunate truth is that Ford Motor is simply not an investors' favorite right now (despite good news) as opposed to General Motors (NYSE: GM ), for instance, which made a strong case for itself by announcing a major capital return initiative in March. For the time being, shareholders of Ford Motor need to play the 'patience game' and hang on. Weak fundamentals are NOT the cause of Ford Motor's slumping share price. The auto maker is not a preferred investment right now, which is kind of odd since the company pumps out (and sells) a good amount of vehicles around the world and is valued very lowly. In the stock market, companies rotate in and out of favor and investors simply prefer General Motors over Ford Motor right now. As far as I am concerned, I am holding on to my Ford stock and my options and I will sit out the current trading weakness. A Ford investment still offers a very wide margin of safety and at 8x forward earnings investors are clearly not running the risk of overpaying. Any retreat in Ford's share price is actually a good opportunity to take advantage of a rising dividend yield. Buy. Source: The Weirdness Of A Ford Motor Investment Disclosure: The author is long F.
