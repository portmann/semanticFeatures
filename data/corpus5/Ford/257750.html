Made In China: GM's Latest Vehicle - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha General Motors has long made vehicles in China and has a major presence in the country. Now GM plans to make a vehicle in China and import it to the U.S. Overall, this appears to be a smart financial move for GM especially given the type and brand of the vehicle being produced. Automakers from Detroit have long been thought of as the American core of the automotive industry providing jobs, building factories, and supplying vehicles to the American market and exporting to foreign markets. But General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is very much a global company and it is now taking its next step by building a vehicle in China and importing it to the U.S. General Motors is the largest of the Detroit Three automakers and the only one that is a reasonable contender for the world's largest automaker title. But while GM has its roots and headquarters in the U.S., it has become a worldwide automotive giant. Among the largest of GM's markets now is China where GM and its Chinese partners sold 3.5 million vehicles in 2014, far more than the 1.1 million sold by Ford (NYSE: F ). To supply the Chinese market, GM has been busy building factories and networks to both manufacture vehicles and get them to consumers. Investors that do not follow the Chinese auto market may be surprised to learn that GM's most popular brand in the country is Buick; a brand that was considered for the chopping block during the restructuring of GM. Chinese buyers tend to see Buick as a choice luxury vehicle making it popular with executives and government officials. This has led to GM selling over 900,000 Buicks in China during 2014 comprising roughly 80% of the brand's worldwide sales. With Buick being GM's ticket to the Chinese market, it would make sense that the brand would be the one most involved with China. GM has long built vehicles in China but the automaker has now announced that it will import one to the U.S. market by the summer of 2016. The vehicle will be the Buick Envision, a small SUV to fit into the crossover segment between the Enclave and the Encore. But despite assembly taking place in China, GM has noted that the vehicle was "designed, engineered and tested in Michigan." But the Envision appears to be just the beginning for Buick. Reuters has noted that by 2017, most U.S. sold Buicks could be imports from either China or Europe. As a business strategy such moves make sense. China has lower labor costs and the large number of Buicks sold there adds the advantage of centralizing Buick production around the brand's core market. And in Europe GM can take advantage of excess capacity created by the slow economic situation in Europe by utilizing this capacity for exports. As a bonus, GM also gains an edge in negotiations with the United Auto Workers as GM can threaten to take more production overseas. Of the Detroit Three GM has by far the largest presence in China but Ford and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) are not going to ignore this market. Ford already sells over a million vehicles on an annualized basis in the country but some evidence suggests that the Ford Taurus could become an import from China. The Taurus was redesigned in 2009 and slightly updated in 2012 but U.S. sales have remained sluggish. In response, Ford has called for redesigning the Taurus but only for the Chinese market. If Ford takes this option, it may choose to shut down U.S. Taurus production and import a small number of redesigned Taurus models from its Chinese factories. Fiat Chrysler has a very small China presence right now but it calls for growing its share of the market as part of its ambitious five year plan. This is likely to entail more factories and production in China would could also increase the ability of Fiat Chrysler to import Chinese made vehicles to the U.S. In the past few months there was already some speculation that the automaker may move production of the Jeep Wrangler to China if it could not secure a good deal in the U.S.; however, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne dismissed this rumor says that Wrangler production would remain in the U.S. Still, Fiat Chrysler has shown a willingness to produce U.S. brands overseas and import them to the U.S. as it has done with the Italian produced Jeep Renegade. Fiat Chrysler is also beginning to produce Jeep Cherokees in China but a spokesperson for the automaker said there were no plans to sell these vehicles outside of China. Based on the current situations, I would not be surprised to eventually see GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler import at least some vehicles from China to the U.S. Labor cost differences are substantial with autoworkers in China making about $4.10 per hour compared to UAW workers at $15-$28 per hour. Additionally, factory capacity in China continues to grow making it more economical to build some vehicles in China. However, moves towards importing vehicles from China are likely to remain gradual as Detroit Three automakers look for the vehicles that make most sense to import and which vehicles are better off built in the U.S. GM plans to begin importing Chinese made Buick Envision models in the summer of 2016 and will likely transition most Buick production to China and Europe over the next few years. But Buick, seeing the core of its sales in the Chinese market, is the ideal brand for the strategy and shifting production of other brands is less certain. Overall, I see this move toward producing Buicks overseas and importing them to the U.S. as financially beneficial to GM and it could set up a template for certain models from Ford and Fiat Chrysler in the future.
