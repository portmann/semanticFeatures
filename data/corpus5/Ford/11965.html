Economic Production In The Eagle Ford Makes Carrizo Oil And Gas A Good Investment - Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRZO) | Seeking Alpha With Carrizo's Eagle Ford production being profitable in the current oil price environment, the company has held its ground on the stock market this year. Energy investor T. Boone Pickens is of the opinion that oil prices will make a strong comeback, enabling Carrizo to take advantage of low production costs. Carrizo, however, faces certain fundamental problems such as a huge debt and a weak cash position. But Carrizo's focus on cash-flow rich assets will allow it to overcome the weakness in the balance sheet in the long run. Despite the drop in crude oil prices this year, Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ: CRZO ) has held its ground on the stock market as the following chart shows: This does not come as a surprise, since Carrizo has been able to improve key financial metrics such as revenue, cash flow, and earnings per share in a challenging environment. The reason behind Carrizo's resilient performance is not hard to find. The company operates in the Eagle Ford shale, where the economics of oil production are favorable even at low oil prices. In fact, according to Carrizo chief executive Chip Johnson, "We estimate that more than 80% of our Eagle Ford drilling locations are economical below $44 per barrels." Now, Brent crude is currently trading at around $55 a barrel, which means that Carrizo's production is still profitable despite the recent drop in crude oil prices. Going forward, an improvement is expected in the pricing of oil. According to a Newsmax report that contains energy investor T. Boone Pickens' thoughts on the oil market: Legendary energy entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens doesn't think the bad times will last for black gold. In an interview with CNBC, he predicted a price of $70 by year-end and $80 to $90 within 18 months. A plunging rig count in the United States will help spark the rebound, putting supply and demand in better balance, Pickens explained. The rig count totaled 866 last Friday, down 41 percent from a year earlier and 6 percent from a week earlier, according to Baker Hughes. Thus, as oil price picks up, Carrizo's economic production in the Eagle Ford will allow it to improve its margin performance in the future and accelerate earnings growth further. In such a scenario, it is not surprising to see why Carrizo has been increasing its production despite weak oil pricing. For example, Carrizo drilled 21 gross or 19.1 net operated wells last quarter, bringing the total to 25 gross wells and 22.5 net wells. In addition, it upgraded some of its rigs in order to enhance extraction efficiency. In addition, Carrizo is developing its Eagle Ford shale acres on a combination of 330 feet and 500 feet spacing, of which 65% drilling inventory is based on 330 feet spacing. Additionally, it is down spacing its remaining Eagle Ford shale acreage to 330 feet, which will approximately add another 150 net locations to its drilling inventory. These new additions at Eagle Ford, combined with its ability to produce low cost oil, will enhance Carrizo's performance going forward. By way of these moves, Carrizo is increasing its oil reserves and extraction efficiency, and such initiatives will come in handy when oil prices start picking up. In addition, Carrizo also operates in Utica shale, where it recently brought online its second operated well, the Brown 1H in Guernsey County . The well displayed encouraging results, producing more than 525 barrels of condensate per day. Moreover, Carrizo has also drilled two new wells in the region that will be brought online after April. However, the company will restrain from drilling more wells in the Utica until and unless oil prices improve. Now, this is a smart move as reducing drilling activity in certain areas will help Carrizo optimize its production and lower costs. As a result, the company has decreased its capital expenditure budget by 35% this year. But, the good thing is that despite lowering its capital expenses in a significant manner, Carrizo estimates a 17% jump in production this year. This indicates that the company will produce more barrels of oil per day at a lower cost, and as oil prices pick up, this will have a positive effect on Carrizo's margins. However, investors should not discount the headwinds that Carrizo has to face. At present, there are multiple factors that could decide the direction of crude oil pricing. First, in spite of an oversupplied market, OPEC has maintained its stance and has refused to cut back production. Second, the company has really weak fundamentals. Carrizo's cash position is very weak at just $10.8 million, while the debt is way bigger at $1.35 billion. In fact, Carrizo has a high debt-equity ratio of 122, while its current ratio stands at just 0.66. This means that the company will have to bear the brunt of high interest expenses, and if crude prices don't pick up soon, Carrizo's balance sheet position might get worse. But then, Carrizo is generating strong cash flow as the second chart above indicates. Additionally, the company has reduced its capital expenditure this year, and this will also have a positive impact on the cash flow. Moreover, as oil price is expected to improve in the future as different sources point out, Carrizo's financial performance will get better. Hence, despite a weak fundamental position, Carrizo looks like a good investment due to its economies of production.
