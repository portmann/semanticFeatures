Is It Time To Bail On Ford? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's earnings miss and range bound nature is frustrating. Production of the new F-150 trucks will accelerate rapidly in the second half of 2015. The increased average selling price of the F-150 will boost Ford's margins. Ford (NYSE: F ) has been a frustrating stock to hold for investors over the last two years. The stock has been annoyingly range bound and has hardly crossed the $18 mark. To add to the woes of investors, Ford released disappointing quarterly numbers last month. The company's earnings of $0.23 per share missed the analysts' estimates by $0.03 while the revenue of $34 billion was in-line. Ford investors may have started to grow tired of the company's misfortunes and a 10% jump in short interest shows that many have started to bet against the company. Despite Ford's troubles, I think bailing on Ford at this point of time is a terrible idea. The company has invested billions of dollars over the last two years in order to increase market share and boost profits. And to sell the stock when the company is on the verge of reaping the benefits of its investment is a bad idea. Hence, I think investors should look past its latest earnings report and hold on to the stock. Although an earnings miss is nothing to be happy about, Ford's earnings report was not as bad as it looks. Over the conference call, Ford's CFO Bob Shanks said that a large portion of Ford's $2 billion revenue drop can be attributed to the increased strength of the U.S. dollar. Another cause of concern was the plunge in Ford's F-150 sales. The F-series trucks have been Ford's best-selling vehicle for 37 consecutive years and are also the company's most important profit-generator. While the dip is bad news, I expect Ford to make up for the lost ground in the second half of the year. As I have mentioned in one of my previous articles , due to the new F-150 having aluminum body panels, Ford had to shut down its two major factories to make the changeovers. The changeover at Ford's Rouge factory was completed in 2014 while the other factory is expected to be converted in the coming weeks. As the production of the F-150 accelerates, Ford will regain lost market share, as the demand for the efficient F-150 is high. Regaining market share will largely add to Ford's profits as Shanks said Ford's pre-tax profit would have been roughly $1 billion higher, and operating margin in the U.S. would have been "easily over 10 percent, which gives you a feel for what might coming later in the year." Looking at the company's April sales' statistics, it's clear that sales of the new F-150 are improving at a rapid rate. The company said half of F-150 sales in April were the 2015 version, up from 28 percent in March and the average selling price, or ASP, was the highest ever at $42,600, roughly $3,200 more than last year. Due to better efficiency and higher towing capacity, Ford can command elevated prices for the F-150. According to Automotive News' calculations , each F-150 sold contributed over $13,300 to Ford's profit and if Ford meets the forecast of 800,000 F-Series sales in 2015, it will contribute over $10 billion to Ford's profit. Given that Ford's months-long factory overhaul will be complete in the coming weeks, I expect Ford's stock to breakout in the second half of 2015. For investors who have held on to Ford during the last few months, selling now would be a terrible idea. Ford's factory overhaul is nearly complete and I expect F-150 sales to pick up soon. The increase in the average selling price, along with the production ramp-up will enhance the company's bottom-line. Moreover, despite being range bound, Ford has always had a juicy dividend yield (which now stands at 3.8%) and is too attractively priced to ignore. The company is currently trading at a forward P/E of 8.4 and is a buy at present levels.
