ETF Hub Oct 24 2015, 10:23 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor The gigantic bet by Ford (NYSE: F ) on using aluminum in the popular F-150 line is starting to pay off as production wrinkles smooth out and consumers show confidence in the truck's reliability. The gap between Ford F-150 sales and Chevrolet Silverado sales has widened in recent months as positive reviews on performance continue to pour in. F-150 sales in September improved 16.4% Y/Y to 69,651 units. Perhaps more important than the raw volume number, the average F-10 sticker price was up $6.1K from a year ago. What's next: An aluminum-bodied Ford Expedition was spotted near the Ford development center in Dearborn, Michigan. Bottom line: Ford is up 11.8% over the last 52 weeks. Some auto industry analysts think that concerns on the F-150 roll-out have been a drag on share price. The next week or so should be great for Ford shareholders.  Earnings next Tues should be impressive, followed in a few days by October sales announcement.  Then the analysts will jump on board and set a more sustained climb in motion. Ford's earnings from quarter to quarter have been all over the place the last 4 years.  Would you buy the stock of a company that had earnings of $0.24 in Q1, $0.32 in Q2, $0.21 in Q3, and $0.26 in Q4?  Well that is what Ford earned last year.  And that is after Ford earned $0.74 in Q4 of 2013! However that is the past and that is why Ford has not gained much this year, but that is all about to change.  So far Ford has earned $0.23 in Q1 and $0.47 in Q2.  We should see something higher than $0.53 for Q3 on Tuesday morning.  Q4 will most likely be 5-6 cents higher than Q3 and 2016 should see $0.50+ for every quarter.  That will get the stock moving to probably $20+ in late December or January after a BIG increase in the dividend. Yes - at the minimum there will most likely be a $0.10 yearly increase, but strong cash flow may raise that to $0.20. Beating a "dead" horse.  Old news and their trucks never had an ignition recall.  We are all into investing to make $$$.  I own both Ford and GM and wish both well so my retirement account grows for my old age! Too much exposure to autos in your portfolio.  You should never have too much of any industry in your portfolio.  I would choose 1 company and sell the other.  I would choose Ford.  If you think autos will be a good investment than overweight Ford or GM, but don't own both. Wow, you and tdot are always so full of bad advice. First of all you don't know how large of an allocation to autos he has. Secondly, the smart move would be to own smaller amounts of both to avoid single stock event risk (e.g. major recall). Third, if you were choosing one or deciding weighting, GM has a far cleaner balance sheet (yes, due to the bankruptcy) trades at a turn or two lower multiple - 6.5x forward earnings, has a 1.2bn incremental annual EBIT opportunity in GM financial, further advances in electrification, giant opportunity to double Cadillac to 500k annual sales. I own both, weighted toward GM. Ok the ship is in port and unloading money bags, by Tuesday we will know how much are their contemns worth, so lets wait and see before arriving to any conclusion ahead of time.Talk to you next week!!!!!! Selling Ford is unwise times ten. Sales are climbing in all segments, truck, SUV, passenger vehicles and a 4% dividend while you wait.  And I agree with ark2; own both, only I'm weighted toward Ford.
