Ford's Turnaround Continues With Another Impressive Month - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 13% increase in U.S. auto sales in October 2015 compared to October 2014, which was near the top when compared to other large auto manufacturers. The Ford Mustang saw the strongest October since 2006, as it looks to reclaim the best-selling muscle car title from the Camaro in 2015. As the U.S. economy stays strong, Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming U.S. automotive market. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced October 2015 U.S. vehicle sales of 214K, up 13% from the same month in 2014. This 13% increase came in slightly below expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of 14%. Despite missing expectations, Ford posted the best October in over a decade on several different fronts. The double-digit increase in sales was largely due to the impressive performance of Ford-brand car sales (up 17%), Ford-brand SUV sales (up 12%), and F-Series sales (up 3%) year over year. Ford's 13% growth came in above many competitors , including Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ), up 12.5%, Honda (NYSE: HMC ), up 8.6%, Volkswagen, up 0.2%, and BMW, down 6.6%; however, Ford sales lagged behind Subaru, up 20%, and GM (NYSE: GM ), up 15.9%, and kept pace with Toyota (NYSE: TM ), also up 13%. These positive results for Ford come amidst an auto market that reached an annualized rate of 18.2 million units in October, which is likely to lead the industry to the highest sales levels in 15 years, if the momentum continues through the end of 2015. Ford's impressive results from October are part of the strong second half that I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup reaching optimal inventory levels. It has become clear that as the U.S. economy is strengthening, Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economy-dependent auto market. The key to the company's turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F-150. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of 2015. However, the company has reached full production and saw a 12% increase in F-Series retail sales, which pushed total F-series sales to their highest level since 2004. The F-Series pickup is the most popular vehicle in the U.S. and is gaining popularity with the lower oil prices. In addition to the F-150 model thriving, the Mustang continued to build its case for comeback car of the year in 2015. Mustang sales were at their highest October level since 2006 and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. During October, Mustang sales were up 121% with over 106,000 Mustangs sold year-to-date in 2015 compared to only nearly 64,000 year-to-date in 2015. I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide long-term growth for the company in the reclaimed muscle-car segment. With these results, it's clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in August and October. There are certainly contingencies that could derail the company's momentum. These include the overall health of the U.S. economy, the upcoming interest rate height, labor negotiations with the UAW, and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry. If there was an event or condition that forced the U.S. economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession, it would definitely have a major impact on Ford. Furthermore, with an interest rate hike expected in the near future, it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit; however, I'm convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts. Additionally, labor negotiations with UAW are key to Ford's bottom line, as it employs more than 52,000 U.S. UAW hourly employees . It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control. Finally, with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla, Google, and Apple, it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle. Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose, but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way. It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions, as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. Because of this and other factors, the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed. However, it is encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it hasn't posted since the early 2000s. This shows me as an investor that the new F-150's results are positive and the high-end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I am extremely encouraged by the U.S. sales results the past few months. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is seeing quick turnaround times, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the strong sales of the Mustang. With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of 2015. I remain bullish on the U.S. automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the above 4% dividend yield, as the company prepares to be successful in the long term. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
