Ford And The Most Misunderstood Debt Ever - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has a ton of debt but not really. Their long-term debt is actually a cash generating machine and is pretty similar to what you'd want in a bank. They only really have $13 billion in debt which is easily covered by cash on hand. Ford (NYSE: F ) is one of those companies where the stock and the company just don't seem to play ball on the same court. Despite record-setting results the stock price languishes and just can't get any traction. Investors are frustrated, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, there is not just one aspect of the company or the auto industry that is keeping the stock price low. Bearish investors point at the SAAR, "peak auto", sub-prime auto loans and even the possible disruption from ride-sharing services and electric vehicles. Internal to the company investors point out the over 4 billion shares, pension obligations, union contracts, and the insane amount of debt. I'm not here to explain away the bearish issues; I've dealt with the sub-prime concerns here and here already, but I can offer some information about that terrible debt that gets brought up time and again. After all, I'm guilty of grossly misunderstanding the debt , and I want to spare others the embarrassment I felt. Many investors may use Morningstar to do some research, and of course the balance sheet is a great place to get a picture of whatever company you are looking into. This is where the trouble starts. Starting at the top things look really great. The company had over $67 billion in cash at the end of their last quarter. Heck, they could buy Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) at a very generous premium and still have some left for snacks for the board room. Short term debt at just over $13 billion doesn't look bad either. And then down a little further it happens...do my eyes deceive me? Is that over $127 billion in long-term debt?! Yes it is, but my fellow investors your eyes do not deceive you, the consolidated balance sheet does! You see, Ford operates its own internal bank. This "bank" known as Ford Credit is a huge strength for Ford Motor, it allows them to finance their vehicles at attractive rates to qualified customers and provides flexibility to dealerships to maintain a healthy amount of new cars on the lots. Ford Credit even brought in $2.1 billion in profit before taxes in 2015, not too shabby. Unfortunately, Ford must account for those loans on their vehicles somewhere, and it naturally winds up on the balance sheet as a long-term debt. That long-term debt is the managed receivables of Ford Credit, which just so happens to be $127 billion. On the surface this is enough to scare away the average investor. For computers that aggregate information and robo-trade on that information it can make the stock a "no-go." Ford only has $13 billion in automotive debt, or debt we would normally count "against" a company. Ford Credit even maintains a balance of cash to protect Ford Motor from delinquent loans. Ford Credit is self-funding and self-liquidating, a remarkable strength to have in the loan business. If Ford were a bank it would be an attractive investment. It has a large portfolio of high quality loans at attractive rates spanning in time from 36-72 months. A rising interest rate environment even stands to benefit Ford as well by increasing the potential yield on their loans and easing pension obligations as treasury notes increase in yield as well. Heavy regulation helps protect their assets and offers an incredible barrier to entry. When we compare Ford to banks there are a lot of similarities. Lets look briefly at Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) a highly respected and sought after large US bank. Wells Fargo has about $19 billion in cash on their balance sheet and $227 billion in long-term debt. For Wells Fargo though, the higher that long-term number is the more investors love it. That means even with loans that may go into default the bank will make more money than it lent out, at least that is the hope. That debt is a cash generating machine for the banks. If only investors saw Ford's long-term debt the same way perhaps we could trade closer to Wells Fargo's P/E of 12.4, double Ford's P/E of 6. We established that Ford's debt is actually pretty darned good for the health of the company. But that doesn't really matter until the markets realize this. There is good news though, Ford is starting to separate Ford Credit from Ford Motor. Ford isn't going to spin-off its finance arm, that would be incredibly stupid. What Ford is doing is treating Ford Credit like another company entirely, and they started in earnest this last quarter. For the first time Ford Credit was given it's own conference call to discuss the quarterly results. The call is worth a listen and illustrates the importance of Ford Credit to the overall company. It also shows that Ford may be trying to somehow separate their automotive debt from their operational debt. If you listen to previous conference calls you can even hear the frustration in their voices as they try quarter after quarter to explain why Ford's debt is different. Does this make Ford a screaming buy? Maybe, that will depend on what kind of investor you are. Ford still yields a healthy ~4.5%, has strong sales, strong margins, and a healthy balance sheet. I think that if you could remove that $127 billion in debt from the balance sheet we would have a much higher share price. I also understand that institutional investors, or so called "smart money", probably understands already what the real picture of the debt is. Either way, my point with this article is to explain the debt and hopefully prevent someone else from looking stupid like I did back in December of 2015.
