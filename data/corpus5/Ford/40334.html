How Better Cars And Trucks Will Drive Ford To $20 Per Share - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Investors are waiting for that $20-dollar psychological mark and they have waited for more than a decade. Plunging gas prices has fueled higher demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). After an ugly 2014, this year was supposed to be the year automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) drives to $20 per share. Investors are waiting for that $20-dollar psychological mark and they have waited for more than a decade. That's not likely going to happen this year, however. Next year seems more probable. But that doesn't mean there isn't money to be made by holding Ford stock. While shares of the U.S. auto giant might have gotten dented in the past 12 months, Ford has boosted its dividend into high gear , making Ford stock one of the best dividend-payers on the market with an annual yield of 3.90%. That's almost double the average yield paid out by stocks in the S&P 500. Ford shares closed Friday at $15.77, up fractionally. The stock is up 1.74% on the year to date, trading in-line with the broader averages. And in the past three years, that's been part of the problem with Ford stock. Sure, the dividend has been decent. But to get investors excited about the stock, Ford has to deliver better than just average gains. In the last three years, for instance, Ford stock has gained 47%. It sounds impressive, until you compare it to the 55% three-years gains for S&P 500. So ahead of Ford's first-quarter earnings results Tuesday, aside from the boost in its dividend, investors want to know how Ford stock can drive their portfolios higher in the years ahead. The shares are still down 13% since Ford stock hit a multi-year high of $18.12 in July of last year. And that $18 mark or what represents a 14% climb from Friday's close is what investors should be focusing on first. At $15.77, the stock is trading at just 10 times this year's earnings estimates of $1.59 per share and Ford trades at just 8 times 2016 estimates of $1.87 per share. By comparison, the S&P 500 trades at a forward P/E of 17, more than twice the forward P/E of Ford. And this supports why Ford is a likely candidate to trade at $20 next year, given the operational improvements that are not yet factored into the company's earnings estimates. For starters, plunging gas prices has fueled higher demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This is an area where Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker by revenue, has a considerable advantage over competitors like General Motors (NYSE: GM ). What's more, the billions worth of investments Ford has made to develop more fuel-efficient cars will begin to pay off. Its redesigned F-150 pickup truck is one example. While the F-150 has always been a best-seller, Ford has worked to make its flagship vehicle lighter, using an aluminum-bodied frame to make it the vehicle more fuel efficient. And this is likely to have a long-term effect on Ford's future sales. Not to mention, the dozen or so other new vehicle models Ford has launched globally that will help it grow market share in various geographies. Not only can this offset the market share Ford has lost in areas like Europe, combine it with the growth it continues to enjoy in areas like China, Ford stock is looking more and more like a sure bet. And it starts with Tuesday's earnings results. For the quarter that ended March , Ford is expected to earn 26 cents per share on revenue of $33.92 billion, marking a 4% year-year-year earnings increase, while revenue is projected to be flat. For the full year, ending in December, Earnings of $1.59 per share calls for a 37% year-over-year increase, while revenue of $142 billion is expected to be up 5% above last year. In short, Ford still has plenty of value to deliver, despite the -- seemingly -- uninspiring activity in the stock. What's more important to focus on are the improvements Ford is making within its operation -- that's where the value is. Accordingly, investors would do well to take a position in Ford stock and hold it for 12 to 18 months. At some point, $20 will be in rear-view mirror.
