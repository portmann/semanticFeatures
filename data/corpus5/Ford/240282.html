What Can Pull Ford Stock Out Of Neutral? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking , Get Smart, Get Wealthy (238 clicks) Year over year auto sales in the United States remain strong but Ford has had trouble delivering similar results overseas. Ford's decision to invest in Russia as GM was exiting could prove to be a profitable move or it could lead to additional losses. Ford has lost money in Europe for several years but improved auto sales in the region could finally return the company to profitability in the area. Ford (NYSE: F ) seems to have enough going for it to suggest that the company's stock should be a buy. The auto sector continues its recovery pushing sales to their highest levels in over a decade. U.S. vehicle sales are up double digits year over year. The remodeled F-150 pickup truck remains popular. The stock has a dividend of over 4% and a forward P/E ratio of under 8. Yet the stock is at roughly the same level that it was back in the beginning of 2010. I bought Ford back in the beginning of 2015 based on the premise that the F-150 would help deliver strong results and its valuation would help provide a floor for the investment. Needless to say, I've been disappointed. So why isn't this story playing out any better? There are a few likely causes. Oil prices and interest rates seem to be headwind macroeconomic factors. Cheap gas is making consumers feel more comfortable putting lots of miles on their cars while low interest rates helps financing deals look that much more attractive. While oil prices could stay low if North American and Middle Eastern oil producers continue to try to outproduce each other, the low interest rate environment looks to be ending soon. Higher interest rates could not only start squeezing the consumer's budget but also make new vehicles relatively less valuable. Another reason is likely that Ford has no one to blame but themselves for their troubles. Ford's rollout of the new F-150 has been less than smooth as manufacturers have had to spend time and money get their assembly lines prepared. That delay cost the company sales that are only starting to pick up again. The F-150 delays actually led to Toyota (NYSE: TM ) outselling Ford earlier this year. Ford's overseas activity could very be a bigger culprit. The company's investment in Russia could prove to be fruitful in the long term but right now it looks like a sunk cost. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) exited Russia which could pave a smoother path for Ford but GM likely left Russia for a reason. Sales growth in China has also trailed that of GM and Europe has been a trouble spot for Ford for a while now. Sales in Europe have improved recently but the company is still recovering from years of losses thanks to the region's economic crisis. Ford is expecting better results in Europe in the coming year but Q3's disappointment could suggest that we're not quite there yet. So what needs to be done to move the stock price up again? It seems the answer is to execute overseas. Ford needs to see a return on its investment in Russia and it needs to see continued sales growth in the rest of Europe. Sales results seem initially encouraging but Ford has lost billions in the region over the last few years and that needs to turn around. Ford also needs to clean up some of its manufacturing issues. The F-150 seems to be a success on a high level but the production delays seem to have muted some of the positive impact. Things look fairly good on the domestic front but it's going to be the company's ability to execute profitably overseas that's going to finally lift the stock out of the doldrums.
