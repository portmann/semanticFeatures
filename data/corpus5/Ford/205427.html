Ford Is Going To $17 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is going to $17 at least, and my estimate is on the low side. This target gives a minimum 13% upside in the near term with the added bonus of 4% annual dividend yield. Ford (NYSE: F ) is going to $17 and this estimate might be on the low side. The good news is you don't have to take my word for it. The average of 21 analysts recommendations is buy/overweight with a price target near $17.50. Low estimates is $15, current prices, high estimate is closer to $23 providing a potential 53% upside. The stock is already up 15% over the past three weeks so what could possibly power this move? For starters sales trends and earnings expectations. The US auto market recovery is key to Ford's success. US auto sales hit an 18.17 million annualized rate in September, well above expectations for the month and the year, making the 7th year of expansion and historically high levels. This is a 16%year over year increase with US sales expected to continue rising into 2017 as predicted by the National Automobile Dealers Association. In the most recently released monthly sales data Ford reported a 23% YOY increase in global sales, 23%. This is an industry leading figure, above analysts estimates and further evidence of the ongoing recovery in US auto sales. It's also the best month for Ford since 2004. Within the September reports were several positive factors, including evidence of the expected European recovery in Ford's sales figures. On the domestic front Mustang sales had their best year since 2007. Sales of the iconic sports car jumped 199% from last year at this time and are fast on the way to becoming the top muscle car in America, shouldering out the Charger and Camaro. Sales of trucks was also up. The company reported a 25% increase in sales of light trucks, 16% in the top selling F-Series. September US Retail Sales data echoes the strength seen in the auto sales figures. Total US retail sales increased 0.1%, slightly below consensus, but declined by 0.3% ex-auto. Auto sales jumped roughly 1.75% from August, and 8.8% from the same period last year. In the EU sales were up more than 8%, led by small cars. The company reported increased sales in more than half of the EU markets with an average gain of 10% YTD. In terms of brand recognition it is the #1 commercial brand and the #2 passenger brand. Top markets were Ireland, Turkey, Germany, Spain and the UK where it led the market. Here is a quote from the company press release.... Ford closed a strong September and year-to-date across many markets in Europe. . . Ford was market leader in total vehicle sales in the UK in September and year-to-date, in Ireland in September and in Hungary year-to-date, and achieved market share improvements in 12 of its 20 traditional European markets, including Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and Poland, plus at its Turkish joint venture, Ford Otosan. Not only are sales strong and outpacing expectations the company is regaining market share at home and abroad. The company reported increased market share in 12 of the 20 EU regions with an average 8.9% for the month, 8.1% for the year to date period. This up from the 7.7% reported in January . In the US market Ford is also recovering from declining market share, with bottom hit earlier this year. Since then the company has been able to reclaim its number two spot and is still increasing share. September 2015 share is 15.3%, up nearly a half percent from August and a full percent from 14.4% in September of last year. On a year to date basis market share is flat from last year, 15.1%, with expectation for that to improve into the end of the year. Ford's sales are strong on their own but there is a tailwind. . . labor trends. Both auto sales and labor trends have steadily on the rise, the one no doubt influencing the other and both key to overall US recovery. Labor trends have been on the mend since 2010 with most metrics revealing labor market health. Jobless claims are trending at historic lows, unemployment levels are fast approaching pre-financial-crisis lows, job creation is trending at +230K on a TTM basis, job openings are historic highs and the quits rate is healthy. The one negative that sticks out is the participation rate but that can be explained away by demographics; retiring Baby Boomers and maturing Millenials. Altogether, the basket of 24 labor market indicators tracked by the KC Fed Labor Market Conditions Index show activity trending higher with positive momentum. This month's reading shows a small increase in activity with small decline in momentum. Sales data is one thing, earnings expectations are another and they are positive. Current quarter estimates are in the range of $0.41 to $0.54 with consensus near $0.48. This is flat from the last quarter but more than double the comparable quarter last year with significant chance for upside surprise based on sales data. Next quarter is also expected to see growth, consensus is near $0.52 per share, also with significant chance for upside surprise because the average analyst estimates have barely budged over the last 3 months, all while Ford has been excelling in the US and abroad. According to data from Yahoo!Finance only 1 estimate has been raised in the last 30 days while 2 have been lowered. On a full year basis Ford is expected to earn near $1.70. This is up $0.59 or 53% from last year with growth expected next year as well. Current consensus for 2016 earnings is near $1.93, an additional 13.5% growth and well ahead of the broader market. Full year earnings growth for the S&P 500 is only 9.7% as last reported by Factset . On a P/E valuation basis Ford is looking good. Trailing P/E stands near 12X earnings at current prices near $15. On a forward looking basis this drops down to only 8.88, providing a near 30% up relative to current valuation. Compared to the broad market, which is trading near 16X forward earnings the stock is undervalued on a trailing and forward basis. A couple of positive factors have developed over the past few weeks as well. For one the company has announced a new $1.8 billion plan to enhance R&D in China and Asia. The program is scheduled to unfold over the next 5 years and is aimed at enhancing value in that region. In the meantime the company is planning on launching two new hybrid models in China where large scale efforts to shift to electric are underway. In the US output of the new aluminum bodied F-150 has reached sustainable levels. The truck was rolled out last year but a slow ramp-up to full production and strong demand combined to put pressure on inventory levels. In his article on Brent A. Miller says full production has been reached and that the new design is key to the companies future . Risk factors include slowing, slow, global growth and how that might affect the US economy. So far there is little sign of a global economic boom and while GDP estimates remain positive they have been reduced several times this year. The risk of fall-out hurting the US economy is present but as yet not seen in the data relating to auto sales. China is the biggest worry. Ford has seen sequential declines in month to month to sales in the country but so far sales growth remains positive for the year. Full year industry wide sales growth in China is expected to come in around 3%. Summing it up, Ford is undervalued with positive earnings expectations and a screaming buy. The company is riding a rising tide of US sales with strong company sales in domestic and foreign markets. Market share is also growing, at home and abroad with new initiatives to increase over seas sales in China at least. Earnings growth is strong with growth projected into the next quarter and next year, and with a 4% dividend to boot. The average analyst estimate is overweight/buy with consensus target more than 15% above current price levels. On a technical basis the stock is moving up from support at the bottom of a 12 month range. Momentum is bullish and strong with price action recently breaking a previous support/resistance level. Near term target is near $17 with additional upside potential to $18, well within the consensus range. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
