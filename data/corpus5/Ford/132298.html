Ford: Exceptional Value In An Overbought Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Despite dirt cheap valuations, domestic automakers have been poor performers in the market during 2015. They are one of few deeply undervalued sectors in what I consider an overbought market. Ford stands out for a growth and value play at cheap valuations. The company just delivered standout results. The stock is compelling given growth prospects and an over four percent yield. It's time to purchase this core value play. Ford (NYSE: F ) is one of the more unusual names in my income portfolio. The shares yield north of four percent at current levels as domestic automakers have continued to underperform the overall market, which I consider overbought . The stock has done basically nothing for over a year. I believe this will start to change in the second half of the year as investors focus less on the challenges in Europe and emerging markets and embrace the results a very strong domestic vehicle market is driving. This can be seen in Ford's solid quarterly earnings report this morning. I think this could be the beginning of the recognition by the market of what a compelling growth, value and dividend play this American manufacturing icon is at current levels. I expect a strong performance from these shares through year-end and beyond as their value is recognized. Revenues for the quarter came in almost $2 billion over expectations at slightly over $37 billion. Overall operating margins were up 60 basis points to 7.2% as the company is making progress to get to 10% operating margins as its most ambitious new model rollout in its history takes hold. North America accounted for over 60% of total revenue with $23.3 billion in sales and $2.9 billion - both figures are all time records. Asia/Pacific region, primarily China, saw some $2.4 billion in quarterly revenues and operating margins move up an impressive 230 basis points to 7.8% The company continues to post small losses in Europe where a strong dollar and an auto market just bouncing off recessionary lows are headwinds. Revenue came in at $7 billion for the quarter. Ford also continues to lose money in emerging markets in the Middle East and South America which is got just under $2.5 billion in sales this quarter. This is in line with a much faster growing and profitable Asia/Pacific region. There is a lot to like about Ford at this point in time despite challenges in Europe and some emerging markets. First of all, it should see accelerating revenue growth in 2016 in the mid-single digits as its benefits from the largest new model rollout in the company's overall 100-year history. Earnings are on an impressive ramp up. Ford posted profits of just $1.16 a share in FY2014. The range for this year's earnings is roughly $1.50 to $1.70 a share - after today's report it is likely to hit the top end of that range. The consensus currently has ~$1.88 a share in the black for FY2016. Europe is slowly getting better as auto registrations have drifted up since the European Central Bank initiated its own version of quantitative easing in March. In addition, the company is benefiting from low gas prices at home. The share of overall vehicle sales accounted for a much higher margin (trucks and SUVs) that's at its highest level since 2005. Ford's all new and market leading F-150 truck series will continue to benefit by that shift. An investor can now pick up Ford with its 4.2% yield and likely 20% annual earnings growth over the next couple of years for around 8 times next year's likely profits. This is approximately half of the overall market multiple with the average stock not possessing Ford's likely profit growth over the next few years and not anywhere close to its income yield.
