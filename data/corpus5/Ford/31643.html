Ford Shines In Shanghai - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford introduces the redesigned Taurus overseas. The Taurus, once American commonplace in the world of automobiles, is looking to make a comeback in densely populated China where there's a demand for American luxury. "Large sedans being sold in China today are luxuries and there is a gap there between luxury brands and popular brands. That's where we're aiming this car at," - Ford China Chairman and CEO John Lawler ( source ) The legacy of the Taurus goes back years. It was once the sedan to own in the U.S. before it was dethroned by the Camry. If you don't want to take our word for it, flip on a couple of old episodes of any 80's or 90's TV show. Tauruses were everywhere. They were also the vehicle of choice of most bad guys; a true sign that you've made it big and have become the "generic" option for your country. We're once again focused on the Taurus not because we think it's going to dominate again in the U.S., but because of what it could possibly do for our investment in Ford (NYSE: F ) by becoming popular overseas. This works into the same plan that we laid out as to why Ford could be trying to push the Lincoln Continental overseas. We think it marks the continued rebirth of the Ford name and brand to a number of younger generations. While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it, the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up. We think it's going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles. While GM's (NYSE: GM ) Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it, especially because of its ageless logo and "cool" factor, Buick and Lincoln haven't done well to keep American luxury on the map. Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle, but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels. Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider "luxury" to only be European. This can help Ford, obviously, but it can also help the U.S. domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas. Over the weekend at the Shanghai Auto Show, Ford debuted its new Taurus sedan. The days of the gas guzzler are slowly fading here in the U.S. While in the U.S. bigger cars like the Taurus and the Lincoln Continental have fallen out of favor and been replaced by gas friendly smaller vehicles and luxury SUV's, "big cars still need lovin, too" and they're getting it in China. Here's the stats on that, from a Reuters article , According to research firm IHS Automotive, China's market for large sedans has overtaken the United States, with sales of around 4 million last year, topping the 3.6 million sold in the U.S. By 2020, IHS expects that gap to have widened to 5.3 million large sedans in China and 3.7 million in the U.S. A number of our past pieces have speculated that Ford is going to find success with the Lincoln luxury brands and bigger vehicles in China. This represents killing two birds with one stone for Ford: they're breathing new life back into American luxury vehicles and they're entering the globe's most densely populated country in doing so. The target audience in China is going to be upper class citizens who seek American luxury and business people looking to travel with a conservative design in spacious quarters. So far Ford has been meeting the goals its setting for itself and investors in China. They met expectations in 2014, And have continued to show promising results. You can read more about the company's auto sales domestically and internationally by looking through our catalogue of articles over the last few months here . There's also such a huge opportunity for growth in the Asia Pacific market, this chart from 2014 shows you how meaningful growth in either Asia, South America, or Europe could truly be for the business. These profit centers, when Ford gets them working, will be what bring the stock up over the $18.50 resistance area the stock is holding. At a 3% yield, we have all of the patience one would need to wait for Ford's plans to play out. China just represents one part of Ford's business that's going to continue to expand via global footprint. We think coupled with the company's new investment in Mexico and continued brand prestige in the U.S., good things are ahead for Ford. Recently, we wrote about Ford's continued investment in itself and innovation. Ford makes conventional and hybrid Ford Fiestas, Ford Fusions, and Lincoln MKZ models in Mexico. We were happy with the company's plans to continue developing in Mexico. Mexico is a big part of Ford's business. They started investing there in 2008, where its central Mexico plant was pumping out Ford Fiestas. The advantages of doing business in Mexico are the cheap labor, trade agreements, and no need to cross oceans to get there. Over the weekend, those plans were finally confirmed by the company. We are long Ford ( F ) and consider the stock to be very undervalued in both the short and the long-term With a yield of 3%, we don't mind keeping Ford in our portfolio while we wait for the catalysts that we think are going to drive it higher. The stock has been a futile exercise to be invested in, but we think that's all going to change when Ford gets things going globally. The Taurus unveiling, combined with investments in innovation overseas, show that Ford is on the right track. We like the dividend yield, but would be remiss if Ford was focusing too much on giving back to shareholders here. We want them reinvesting in the business. The new F-150 is going to show shareholders and Ford followers exactly what innovation can do for a business. As we've repeatedly said, we know that the bottom line is going to suffer in the short term. But we trust that the rising capex is going to be indicative not of a short term pop, but of a long term reestablishment of Ford as a global presence; hopefully one that will help Ford continue to be a sound investment for lifetimes to come, not just the near future during a market top. We added Ford to our dividend portfolio two weeks ago. We don't mind collecting the company's attractive 3.8% yield while we wait for the rest of the market to see the value we see in owning the stock. Disclosure: The author is long F.
