Ford Motor Is Attractive Below $15 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Ford fell, along with the rest of the market, during last week's sell-off. Ford still has a low valuation and strong dividend. The recent drop makes both more attractive. Shares of major automakers fell hard last week largely due to concerns over the Chinese market and the crisis in Greece. But there is a bright side to these developments. Shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) are now available at cheaper levels and with a higher dividend yield. Although I tend to focus on fundamental rather than technical analysis, I see the value in long-term trading ranges on the psychology of market participants. In the case of Ford, the automaker's have been trapped in a long-term range between $14 and $18 per share. Since mid-2013, shares only fell below $14 for part of October 2014, and only edged above $18 a few times. With shares currently trading at $14.48, Ford is now available near the low end of its range, which positions investors well if shares continue to move within the range. In a previous article , I asked investors to consider buying Ford for its 4% dividend alone. But with shares lower today, the dividend yield has become even more attractive now yielding 4.2%. For income investors, this yield is highly attractive producing more than twice the income of the S&P 500 average dividend yield of 2.0%. The dividend also helps to keep investors' money growing even if shares remain trapped in the $14 to $18 trading range. Much of the sell-off in major automakers last week came from concerns over slowing growth in China. While these concerns have existed for a long time, the recent drop in Chinese stocks helped magnify the concerns by threatening to curtail the economy's wealth effect. China has long been billed as a major growth outlet to drive earnings of the Detroit Three automakers. But while Ford would still be hurt by a drop in Chinese demand, it is not as dependent on the country as rivals. In the case of General Motors (NYSE: GM ), the automaker is a major player in China with a 14.8% market share compared to Ford's 4.5%. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ) only has a 1.0% market share in China, however, the automotive group needs significant growth in the country to achieve its five-year plan. Towards the end of last week, the Chinese stock markets started to rebound, but only time will tell whether or not this is the end of the dip. Overall, I consider Ford the best positioned of the Detroit Three to weather a downturn in Chinese auto demand. With the recent drop in Ford's shares, they now trade at rock-bottom valuations based on forward earnings. At 9.0 times est. 2015 earnings, Ford shares trade at roughly half of the S&P 500 average. Additionally, the automaker trades at only 7.6 times est. 2016 earnings and 6.8 times est. 2017 earnings. While I don't expect Ford to match the S&P 500 valuation due to the capital-intensive and cyclical natures of the industry, I do see some room for the gap to narrow. For Ford trade at the top end its range, it would only need a valuation of 11.2 times est. 2015 earnings and 9.5 times est. 2016 earnings. Attaining this level would provide a 24% gain to shareholders buying in at $14.48, and I see such a gain as reasonable over the next 12 months if Ford continues to perform fundamentally. Again, it would not even require shares to break out of their long-term range. The slide in Ford shares puts them near the low end of their long-term trading range, while providing a higher dividend yield. For risk-tolerant investors, Ford is now providing an attractive entry point with capital appreciation upside and a large dividend to collect while you wait.
