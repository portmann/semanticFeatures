One of the many books I've read on investing was the classic by Peter Lynch, "Beating the Street", published back in May of 1994. For those who need a reminder, Peter managed Fidelity's Magellan fund (MUTF: FMAGX ) from 1977 until 1990. He took a $20 million dollar fund to $14 billion while beating the S&P for 11 out of those 13 years. His average annual return, just north of 29%. Throughout "Beating the Street", Peter outlined his "Principles" of investing. In chapter 8, he outlines his #14 principle, "If you like the store, chances are you'll love the stock." So, like Peter, many years before me, I headed to the mall, putting Peter's "favorite" source of investment ideas to the test.. This time to a new mall that had just opened... I never did write about that experience or do much more than a little digging into some stores that I had never seen. That was about a year ago so I decided to revisit the mall and put Peter's Principles to the test in today's market. The Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota is an 880k sq. ft., two story mall jointly owned by Taubman Centers, Inc. (NYSE: TCO ) and privately held Benderson Development. It bills itself as a "world-class fashion and dining destination." It is surrounded by other Benderson developed properties on the county border between Manatee and Sarasota counties in Florida, in one of the fastest growing master planned communities in the country, Lakewood Ranch. The anchor stores are Macy's (NYSE: M ), Dillard's (NYSE: DDS ), and Saks Fifth Ave., a subsidiary of Canadian firm, Hudson's Bay Co. ( OTC:HBAYF ). This is not like many of the traditional malls seen around the country. This is upscale from the start...from the location to the retail choices, this is not the mall from twenty years ago! In addition to the three anchor stores, there are 67 stores (out of the 149) owned by public companies. Grouped by industry and then parent company (ticker) and stores the public companies are listed below. · Moleskine SpA ADR (OTCPK: MOSKY ) has a store.

With that in mind, although it's an ambitious project, I've chosen to divide the companies into six groups. As the most numerous stores are apparel related, in this first part, I will look at two related industries (Source:Yahoo): The Services sector-Apparel stores and the Consumer Goods sector - Textiles - Apparel Clothing. In part 2, I will present the Consumer Goods sector's Personal Products and Textiles - Shoes and Accessories industries. Part 3 will address the diversified companies that are the anchor stores and Apollo Global Management, in the Financial sector - Diversified investments industry. Next will be the hard(er) goods - jewelry, home furnishings, shoes & accessories. Part 5 - Tech - Tesla (If it looks like a duck...), Apple, Microsoft and T-Mobile. Part 6 will be Food and Drug - Restaurants, Specialty Eateries and Drug stores. We'll start our review by looking at the size of the operations both in retail outlets and revenues. Lynch categorized his stock picks into a "story", encouraging his readers to know the story of a particular company down to the local level. He felt larger companies could not grow as fast, so first, he suggested categorizing by size. Below is a chart of the clothing/apparel stores in the mall and their gross store counts and revenue numbers for the most recent quarter at the time of the mall opening and the current most recent quarter. *1 Acquired by Ascena Retail Group in August 2015; Ascena has yet to report a full quarter including the Ann, Inc. results. Both ANN and ASNA will be excluded from this analysis. Future updates of this analysis will include results from ASNA. *2 In August 2015, Chico's FAS announce they would be selling their Boston Proper Brand, an impact of $47,990,000 in Sales (MRQ) *3 LUX and SAFLY trade as ADRs, Sales Revenue converted to USD by author. Source: oanda.com *4 HNNMY trades as ADR, Sales revenue converted to USD by author based on rates for 5/31/14 and 5/31/15 Source: oanda.com Right away we are able to see companies that won't make the cut based on their size and/or lack of growth. Of the 6 companies with declining store counts, only American Eagle Outfitters , had increased sales. Conversely, of the 12 companies with increased store counts, three companies, the Gap , Luxottica and Hennes & Mauritz had decreased sales. The Euro based ADRs, LUX and SAFLY, as well as the Swedish krone based HNNMY all showed increases in their native currencies but showed declines when factoring in the currency exchange rates. These results then narrow the focus to the next challenge to just AEO, CHS, EXPR, FRAN, GCO, LB, KATE, KORS, LULU and OXM. BEBE, DEST, PSUN and SAFLY are eliminated due to declining sales and store count. GPS, LUX, and HNNMY are eliminated due to size and declining revenue. Lynch looks to determine reasonable value by taking into consideration a number of fundamental values related to a company's performance. He suggest further analysis of a company by reviewing the earnings trends. As in most of retail, in this particular group of companies, this is not as straightforward as it would seem due to the cyclical holiday earnings. In the chart below, starting with the most recent quarter reported, I show the trailing twelve month earnings per share for the last five years. (Source: company SEC filings) Based on this chart, trends appear that show two companies out in the lead. Both LB and KORS have had continued upswings in EPS. A third company, LULU, recovered from the slump of one year ago to post higher TTM EPS than before that slump. Five others, (AEO, CHS, EXPR, FRAN and GCO) also went through the same slump of a year ago but did not recover higher than the 2 year ago mark. In fact, FRAN slumped even further. Two others, KATE (formerly Liz Claiborne) and OXM, raise concerns as they were the only companies to slip in the most recent TTM period. For this Lynch measurement, we'll narrow the focus further to just three: LB, KORS and LULU. Lynch's other parameters for analysis include the Price Earnings Growth ratio, the current Price Earnings ratio relative to the historic P/E and Industry P/E's. (source for PEG and Industry P/E is Yahoo). Lynch employed an evaluation of the PEG ratio to determine if the current price was a good entry point. PEG's below 1 were good. Above 2, bad. (Source for PEG is Yahoo). Stocks trading with a PE less than industry average (source: Yahoo) could indicate other issues born out through the previous analysis. This chart shows LB out of the range of acceptable PEG and a higher than long term average P/E. While not in an ideal entry point range, (under 1), both KORS and LULU are in an "acceptable" range. As another plus, both KORS and LULU also are trading well below their historic P/E as well as their industry P/E. Another linchpin (coincidence? I think not!) in Peter's stock selection criteria is the dividend analysis. He preferred growth over income but would take income as long as the payout ratio insured that the dividend was safe. We've all seen the way the market handles dividend decreases and it's usually a big hit to any capital growth for at least a short time frame. Only CHS, LB, and OXM pay dividends in our group of 10 stocks. The payout ratios for these three are 145%, 95% and 49%, respectively (Source: Seeking Alpha), making only OXM the only "safe" bet from a dividend payout standpoint. In the next two charts, as Lynch suggests in his stock picking, are the debt to equity ratio, cash position, Inventory position/change and Revenue change. He preferred low debt, a strong cash position and inventory positions in line with their sales growth. (Source: SEC filings, MRQ, Yahoo) With regard to the Debt to Equity ratio, our two leaders, KORS and LULU, did not disappoint as they have the two lowest D/E ratios. KORS continued to impress with its cash position, in the 4th place position but just 0.35% off the lead. LULU did disappoint as its cash position was 7th although it did finish above the average of 7.02% cash to price. But when we look at the inventory positions, both of these companies fell straight to the bottom of the list, posting the largest gains in inventory. LULU , also posted the largest gain in revenue but this 58.9% inventory gain still just didn't seem right to me. I decided to perform another evaluation and see where this group falls with regard to inventory to sales ratio. After all, we are looking at competitors. So even by this metric, LULU's jump in inventory seems to stick out as an abnormality. Factoring in the 24.4% gain in store count still doesn't justify this number. This then would appear to eliminate LULU, leaving our cautious winner utilizing Peter Lynch methods to analyze these industry groups to be Michael Kors . There are as many different ways to analyze stocks as there are people and opinions. Find the one(s) that work for your situation. In addition to adding KORS to my future purchase list (not anytime soon due to previous plans), I would add lululemon athletica to a watch list to see if the inventory situation improves. Likewise, I would add AEO to a watchlist to monitor the results of their turn-around. Happy investing!
