Ford And GM: Consensus Remains Both Stocks Significantly Undervalued - Can U.S. Override Non-U.S. Drag? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha US auto operations continue to perform well for both companies. It is the Non-US operations of both companies that continue to be a drag. August auto sales expected above 17 million (again). Both stocks are cheap on many different metrics. The dividend yields and free-cash-flow are particularly compelling. Growth stocks, which typically trade at a lofty valuation premium, typically require long-term revenue and earnings growth trends to continue, to sustain the premium valuation. It is safe to say Ford (NYSE: F ) and GM (NYSE: GM ) are value stocks today with the China yuan turmoil and the slowing economic data in China - the latest shot across the bow that has knocked down both the shares of both auto giants. GM is trading down from its late 2013 high of $41.85, while Ford's multi-year high is $18.97 from early 2011. For Ford, the reason for the sudden outperformance in 2010 in the stock, and then subsequent swoon is pretty clear: in 2010, Ford earned $1.91 per share on roughly $120 billion in revenue, which was the year prior to Europe falling into its own recession. In 2015, Ford is expected to earn roughly $1.60-$1.70 per share on $138.6 billion in revenue, thus the auto OEM is scheduled to earn less in EPS five years after what was peak-2008 EPS on better revenue today. GM is a little harder to figure: the stock peaked at just over $40 in late 2013, a year in which GM earned $3.18 in EPS on $155 billion in revenue, while the company is "expected" to earn $4.55-$4.60 in earnings per share this year on $151 billion in revenue. Thus, GM is expected to earn substantially higher EPS on less revenue. Basically opposite metrics, and yet the stocks heading the same direction. So what is happening to cause the latest disinterest in the shares ? 1.) Monthly auto sales: August monthly auto sales are due out Tuesday, September 1, 2015, and are expected to come in over the 17 million SAAR (seasonally adjusted annual sales rate). In July '15, monthly auto sales rose 5.3% and at a 17.55 million annual rate. This was the 5th or 6th consecutive month of better than 17 million run rate, but the problem or perception is that there are some worries that this sales rate can continue. Personally, the improved state of consumer balance sheets today, particularly in terms of the average consumer's ability to service debt like mortgage and auto loans, is better today than at any point in the last 10 years. Car sharing and such have put doubts into the industry as to whether a 17 million plus SAAR is sustainable. 2.) Non-US operations: For Ford, the US or North America segment is 66% of total revenue but basically all of Ford's pre-tax income, as of the 2nd quarter 2015, thanks to the regional crises that have impacted Europe, South America and now China/South-east Asia. The problem in 2011 and 2012 for Ford was Europe which cost the auto giant $0.50 in EPS in 2011 alone, but in Q2 '15, Europe lost just $14 million on a pretax basis. Asia Pacific was the only region in the black in Q2 '15, and you have to think now with China wobbly, that might be an issue. Europe is 20% of Ford's total revenue. With Greece now moving to the background, and some of European economic data improving, Ford's European operations, which have been a chronic drag on pre-tax income (to the tune of $4.7 billion the last three years), might start to improve. GM's US operations are 65%-69% of total revenue, but EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is 88% of GM's total EBIT as of the 2nd quarter, 2015. GM's "IO" or international operations, which according to the 10-Q is China to a large extent, were profitable to the tune of $349 million in Q2 '15 and had been showing steady improvement. "IO" was the only non-US operation that was profitable for GM, and you have to think after the last 6 weeks, the shorts are pounding GM for just that reason. Like Ford, GM's Europe operations are 13% of Q2 '15 revenue thus a little smaller in size relative to the total, but the EBIT loss, like Ford, has been improving. Europe lost just $45 million for GM in Q2 '15, versus a $239 million loss in Q1 '15. Those European pre-tax income trends must continue for both companies to help ease the pain of China, if that pain should occur. 3.) Union pension contributions: Although the auto giants are carrying a less-onerous pension burden post-2008, thanks to the VEBA trusts, which as I understand it, allowed the auto OEMs to offload a significant chunk of the UAW healthcare liability (and I'm not sure if this is current healthcare costs or post-retirement), but the burden appears to be lessened. However, persistently low interest rates, and the flat equity market in 2015 are a "double-negative" for the pension liabilities, while a year like 2013, which saw the S&P 500 +32% and Treasury yields substantially higher was a "double-positive", for example. While higher interest rates might crimp auto borrowing by increasing the cost of auto loans, higher interest rates (as I understand it) reduce the present value of the defined benefit plan pension liability, and thus reduce plan expense, and would contribute positively to EPS for both companies. The point being that post-2008, you would think a stronger equity market and expected higher interest rates (which haven't materialized) continue to be a mixed bag for the PBO (or post retirement benefit obligation). Using Q2 '15 and current consensus, here is a key valuation metric comparison between the two companies: Calculations made with stock price as of 8/28/15 close The Financial Services arms (Ford Motor Credit and the old GMAC or what is now Ally(?)) somewhat distort cash-flow data. I'd prefer to look at cash-flow of just the auto operations, which Ford segregates, but I didn't see the same easy compare for GM. Here is a quick summary of the above valuation metrics: EPS growth: Both Ford and GM expecting a huge year of EPS growth in 2015, and yet the stocks stay punk. Auto OEMs typically trade at half the multiple of the SP 500 which is clearly how the auto stocks are being valued today, at least on a PE basis, even though both Ford and GM are seeing record North American pre-tax auto margins. Because of that I think both PEs have a little room to expand. Revenue growth: Ford is a little stronger than GM this year. GM is expecting negative revenue growth now for 2015. Cash-flow valuations: Even without the Financial Services arms, cash-flow and free-cash-flow is plentiful for Ford and GM. Stocks are at a sweet spot in the cycle, in that regard, with little credit issues in my opinion. Dividend yields: very enticing with plenty of free-cash-flow. Unless a reader thinks the US is headed for a recession, these dividends are very safe. Intrinsic value estimates: Ford is trading at a roughly 43% discount to intrinsic value, while GM is trading at a roughly 37% discount to intrinsic value. Unless you can be a very long-term investor in the Energy or Basic Materials sector, it is hard to find steep discounts like this to intrinsic value in Consumer Discretionary or the other major sectors. Analysis/conclusion: Ford and GM have been owned for clients for years, with Ford far longer than GM. The stocks have under-performed and my pounding the table on the names has not helped Seeking Alpha readers very much as this article , and this article detail. In my opinion, both OEMs are making a higher quality car, and when I see the cars on the road these days of both manufacturers, I like the look and the style of the new models. Ford is waiting for the F-150 aluminum truck to catch on, and the big issue with GM continues to be the numerous recall issues and ignition scandal, although I think all of that and the China worry are discounted in a $29-$29 GM stock price. I'd like to see Ford stay above $14 and GM, trade back above $30 technically. The last two weeks were nasty in terms of the market decline, so we took advantage of it in these two names for clients. In terms of which OEM I like better, I still give a slight nod to Ford, although with Alan Mullaly leaving, staying with Ford upon the departure of an "iconic CEO" is a break from investing strategy. I do think Mary Barra has a chance to permanently transform the GM culture if she has the spirit and the time. For a 1-2 year holding period, I think investors will be rewarded.
