Ford Motor: Strong Sales Performance In July, But The Shares Are Still Languishing - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released excellent U.S. sales figures for the month of July on Monday. Ford's U.S. vehicle sales grew 4.9% year-over-year. The auto maker benefits from volume AND price growth. An investment in Ford Motor yields 4%. It's that time of the month again when auto manufacturers report their sales figures for the previous month. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) also reported July sales for the U.S. market on Monday and they were excellent. According to Ford Motor's monthly sales report, Ford Motor sold 4.9% more vehicles in July than a year ago and had the best July sales performance since 2006. Last month, Ford sold a total of 222,731 vehicles, which compares against 212,236 vehicles the company said it sold in the same month last year. On a year-to-date basis, Ford Motor sold 1,516,352 vehicles, 2.3% more than a year ago when it sold 1,482,268. Total car sales reached 66,004, which is less than the 68,702 cars sold in July of last year. Utility sales were 73,632, up 13.4% compared to last year when Ford sold 64,951 utility vehicles. Truck sales rose 5.7% year-over-year to 83,095. To sum up: Ford's sales are on fire. What's more important, volume and price growth are underpinning the auto maker's sales growth, and there is every reason to be optimistic about earnings growth in the second half of 2015. According to Ford Motor's press release : "We continue seeing even stronger demand for our newest products, especially F-150, Explorer, Edge, Mustang and Transit," said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. "With continued improvement in inventory, F-Series retail momentum continued building in July. Customers truly value the new F-150's capability, performance and fuel efficiency." F-Series retail sales are up 13 percent, providing the best July retail results since 2006, even with continued all-time record transaction pricing - up $3,200 versus a year ago. Once more, Ford Motor reported rising (and record) transaction prices, lending credibility to the claim that demand for the F-Series is red-hot. And unit price growth bodes well for earnings surprises in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. Further, lower oil and gas prices could boost pickup sales even more in the quarters ahead. It is all looking good for Ford Motor, but what about the stock? Holding Ford Motor as an investment has been a frustrating experience. There are more than enough reasons -- low valuation, volume growth, rising average transaction prices, a red-hot U.S. auto market, low gas prices -- for the stock to move towards $20, but Ford Motor is stuck in the $14-$15 price range. The fundamentals favor Ford Motor, but the market simply doesn't. It is what it is. Ford Motor sold almost 5% more vehicles than a year ago in the United States in July. Volume and average transaction price growth show that the U.S. auto market is on fire. Lower gas prices could further fuel auto sales, especially in the pickup segment, in the second half of 2015. Though Ford Motor's stock hasn't done much for shareholders lately, other than paying a good dividend of course, I think it is worth staying the course here. Ford's fundamentals are looking solid and the valuation is a low as ever. Analyst upgrades in the second half of this year could be the much needed catalysts to get Ford Motor's shares moving in the right direction again. Long F after excellent U.S. sales in July.
