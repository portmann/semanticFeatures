Ford Motor Company: Buy For The 4% Dividend Alone? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Much of the bullishness on Ford centers around undervaluation and growth potential. These factors are important, but so is Ford's hefty dividend. Other contributors have done an excellent job explaining the growth and value cases for shares of Ford Motor Company ( F ), but I believe the automaker's dividend alone makes it a worthwhile investment. With shares now trading just above $15 apiece, Ford currently yields nearly 4%, making it attractive alongside other income plays. With the average S&P 500 yield being just under 2%, Ford's dividend seems out of place at roughly double the yield. But unlike some other high yielding companies, Ford's dividend is backed by earnings and its payout ratio remains reasonable. Consider that the S&P 500 average P/E ratio sits at 21.7 times while Ford's normalized P/E sits at 12.9 times. With the market assigning Ford a lower valuation, it allows shares to yield far more even sticking with a payout ratio of 66%, or 51% using normalized earnings. But earnings growth over the next few years should help the automaker to lower its payout ratio to safer levels. Of course the automaker may choose to raise its dividend, but current forecasts do not present a threat to the current dividend going forward. By no means Ford the only dividend pick I like today, but it is one of my favorites. Since the shares are not fixed-rate securities like most preferred stocks and bonds, they escape much of the interest rate risk and potential negative reactions as the Fed moves to raise rates. Dividends from Ford can also benefit from the qualified dividend tax rate, unlike bonds and my favorite REIT picks. Ford also occupies a special position in the dividend value area by carrying value and offering a large dividend. As my readers know, I am bullish on major North American airlines for the value propositions they offer. But unlike Ford's 4% yield, most of these airlines yield around 1% making Ford the clear winner for those seeking income. Paying out such a large dividend allows Ford investors to make money while they wait in contrast to airline investors, who are relying on market performance to see gains. For both Ford and airlines, the market is waiting a long time before awarding higher valuations but the difference is that Ford investors get paid more for their patience during the wait. With such a large dividend yield, Ford has also become one of the largest income plays in the industry. While it runs neck-and-neck with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) for the top spot, it handily beats Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Honda (NYSE: HMC ), and Volkswagen (OTCQX: VLKAY ). For those such as myself who are bullish on the automotive industry, Ford represents the way to generate the most income. This is not to say the other automotive companies will underperform the market, but income investors who like this industry should consider Ford being an above-average dividend payer. Unlike some high-yielding companies, Ford's dividend appears sustainable and its payout ratio (based on its current dividend rate) should fall significantly over the next few years giving investors reasonable dividend security. Ford has also shown strong management skills over the past several years giving me confidence in the automaker going forward. Perhaps best known as the only major American automaker not to reorganize during the financial crisis, Ford has continued to push ahead of GM by avoiding the issues of recalls the hurt GM last year. Ford also has the advantage of having a newly released pick-up on the market compared with the older versions of rivals. This should help keep demand and pricing strong in a key high-margin area for the company, contributing to its ability to grow profits and dividends. As with all investments, Ford is not without risks. I see the primary risk facing the company being an economic downturn. Since auto sales are cyclical and can be put off when consumers have less cash, Ford's sales and profits would take a likely take a hit, possibly resulting in a dividend cut. During the 2008 meltdown, Ford survived without reorganization, although it did mean a drop in its share price and a temporary dividend suspension. A slowdown in China could also negatively impact Ford's growth going forward. However, having 4.5% market share in China compared to GM at 14%, Ford is likely to be less affected than GM in this event. Although I certainly see the argument for investing in Ford for capital appreciation, I see the automaker as a strong income play as well. A reasonable forward payout ratio coupled with strong growth and management make Ford among my top dividend picks for the next couple years. Source: Ford Motor Company: Buy For The 4% Dividend Alone?
