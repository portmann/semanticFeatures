Ford And e-Bikes - More Important Than Investors Might Think - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford introduced a third prototype e-Bike last week and will enter the market for e-Bikes soon. Mobility behavior is changing very fast, so car manufacturers need to diversify their business. The market for e-Bikes looks very promising as bicycles are taking over the cities. The combination might not be the most obvious, but car manufacturer Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) will be selling bicycles some time soon. Ford already introduced a prototype of its MoDe:Pro e-Bike during the Mobile World Congress in March of this year (source: digitaltrends.com ). Last week, the company introduced another e-Bike, the MoDre:Flex. The introductions were part of Ford's broader attempt to adjust to changes in mobility behavior of its customers. Investors might tend to consider the introduction of Ford's new e-Bike as another pilot that is doomed to fail. However, in this article, I will argue that Ford entering the market for e-Bikes is more important than investors might think. As Ford traditionally sells cars, changes in mobility behavior are probably the most important threats to Ford's business model. Namely, fewer people driving cars results in fewer people willing to buy a new car. The way we approach mobility is changing fast. Just consider the popularity of car sharing services like Uber. No one thought this would be successful ten years ago. Therefore, the market for selling cars is likely to shrink in the long term. Several other trends influence the changes in mobility as well. Increased attention for corporate social responsibility is one of these trends. Corporate social responsibility is not just a buzzword, it is here to stay (source: theguardian.com ). Reducing pollution is likely to become even more important in the future. As cars are still major polluters, an easy way to reduce pollution is reducing the use of cars. Another threat to Ford's long-term business model. Not surprisingly, Ford is taking actions to deal with these changes in mobility behavior. Last week the company announced several focus areas for its mobility solutions. Ford now focuses on two key areas: flexible use and ownership and multimodal urban travel solutions (source: ford.com ). More specific, Ford introduced a car sharing service called GoDrive, an e-Bike called MoDre:Flex and a smartphone app called MoDre:Link. MoDe:Flex is Ford's third, most versatile eBike yet - easily reconfigurable for different customer needs. The bike's center frame assembly includes the motor and battery, while the frond and rear assemblies and wheels can be configured for road, mountain or city driving. The bike folds and stores inside any Ford vehicle - where it can be charged while stowed. In this article, I will discuss the introduction of Ford's e-Bike and smartphone app. An e-Bike is not an ordinary bicycle. An e-Bike's electric battery offers pedal assistance to its users in order to reduce the effort needed to pedal. Not only does pedal assistance reduce the level of effort, it also increases speed. As a result, e-Bike users get to their destination faster with less effort. Ideal for busy businessmen working in urban areas. Ford's e-Bike offers another nice feature. The company managed to link the level of pedal assistance to the user's heart rate. The real-time data is sent to a smartwatch app. The app is linked to the e-Bike. Therefore, pedal assistance can be modified based on the user's heart rate. Pedal assistance goes up in case the heart rate crosses the preset line. This is a really cool feature because now users are able to choose the level of exercise during their ride. So, Ford is entering the market for (e)bicycles. Is it just my fascination with bicycles or does it really matter for Ford's investors? In my opinion, the introduction of e-Bikes is really important for Ford's long-term business model as the changes in mobility are real. Further, the market for e-Bikes is very favorable in the long term. Through Ford's attempt to diversify its products, the company should be able to benefit from the booming market for e-Bikes. According to Market Research Store, the global market for e-Bikes is likely to grow at an average growth rate of 3.42% in terms of revenue and 4.35% in terms of shipments in the period 2015-2019 (source: cmo.com ). These are solid growth numbers. However, I strongly believe actual growth numbers for the global e-Bike market are much higher than the research report by Market Research Store suggests. Just consider the largest bicycle market in the world in terms of bicycles per capita: Holland. In Holland, there are as many bicycles as there are people (source: top10hell.com ) and e-Bike sales are booming. Total e-Bike sales increased 16.1% in 2014 compared to 2013. Although many expected sales to ease in 2015, e-Bike sales rose an astonishing 23.5% in the first four months of 2015 compared to the same period of last year (source: bike-eu.com ). Germany is another large and important bicycle market. Sales of e-Bikes tripled in the period 2007-2014 (source: falkirkherald.co.uk ). Further, European Union Commissioner for Mobility and Transport stated on June 2, 2015, that we underestimate the potential of cycling (see quote below). This supports my conclusion that e-Bike sales will grow much faster than the report by Market Research Store suggests. However, the potential of e-Bikes is not limited to Europe. In 2014, almost 32 million e-Bikes were sold - 85% of these in China. It is fair to say that China is in the lead in terms of absolute e-Bike sales. Allianz ( OTCQX:AZSEY ) published an interesting report stating that e-Bikes are taking over cities all over the globe. Naturally, this is caused by a changed mentality towards mobility. According to Allianz, bike-sharing is already an environmental-friendly alternative in 700 cities. Allianz also mentioned that global sales of e-Bikes up to 25 km/u is likely to grow to 40.3 million, or 27.1%, in the period 2014-2023. The report used data of Navigant Research (2014). The average annual growth rate is in line with the research report of Market Research Store. However, the report did not take into account that more and more e-Bikes offer pedal assistance for above 25 km/u. Therefore, I expect total e-Bike sales to grow at a much faster pace. Considering the information in this article, it is evident that Ford's focus on e-Bikes is important for investors. Consumers' mentality towards mobility solutions is changing fast. One after the other car and bicycle-sharing programs are being introduced limiting the number of potential car buyers. Further, bicycles are more and more accepted as the primary urban transport solution (e.g. businessmen). Overall, I expect the market for e-Bike sales to grow very fast in the upcoming years. Therefore, Ford's attempt to enter this market could not be better timed. In my opinion, Ford proved to be serious about a sustainable business model in the long term next to the company's traditional car manufacturing business. This should improve investors' confidence for Ford as a solid investment.
