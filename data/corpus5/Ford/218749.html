What Will Get Ford To Break Out Higher? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford reported another great quarter yesterday with all major metrics improving. But the stock continues to languish despite terrific results. I would like to see Ford buy back a significant amount of stock to get shares to break out higher. Ford (NYSE: F ) has been a tough long for the past few years. This is a company that came back from the brink during the financial crisis to be stronger than ever and selling a lot of cars but the market seems not to care. Shares continue to languish in a very tight range as Ford can't seem to catch a break from market participants despite what I consider to be obvious signs of strength. The company's 3rd quarter earnings report showed that Ford's momentum has carried through towards the end of 2015 but shares were punished yesterday despite pre-tax profit nearly doubling against last year's third quarter. Does that mean that Ford is a hopeless long position? After all, what will make this stock go higher if terrific results aren't enough? I've been bullish on Ford for a long time now because of two main points. First, the company's fundamentals seem to improve every quarter. Ford went through a very dark period for a number of years during and after the financial crisis but those years are well and truly behind the company. Further, the American new car market continues to boom as consumers with extra cash to spend are spending it on large trucks and SUVs as fuel prices remain low, vehicles that are right in Ford's wheelhouse. In other words, the fundamental picture is very strong and has been for some time. In addition, Ford has just been cheap. I love a stock with strong fundamentals that is also cheap because they are hard to find in today's market. There are many very expensive stocks with poor fundamentals so to find the opposite is a real gem. The problem is the only real way to capitalize on a stock being cheap is for it not to be cheap at some point but for Ford, that has proven elusive. Ford's third quarter really had quite a bit to like in it if you're long. Operating profit nearly doubled to $2.7B during the quarter as North America had its best quarter ever. Ford has been a North America story for as long as I can remember as the other regions the company competes in basically cancel each other out. Marginal or nonexistent profitability in all of Ford's other regions eat up some of North America's profits each quarter. The numbers are small in terms of total losses but in order to understand Ford, you just need to understand North America. Since the other geographical segments really don't matter, this slide from the press release will give us an idea of just how excellent Q3 was. We can see that NA saw every single major metric improve during Q3. Units were up, revenue was up, operating margin was much higher and pre-tax profits almost doubled. I and others have been saying that Ford's new model lineup for NA including the Mustang and F-Series would drive higher sales in 2015 and that has certainly turned out to be the case. Ford's products have absolutely resonated with consumers and it is showing up in the company's sales numbers. With the F-Series continuing to shine we'll continue to see huge NA sales numbers in Q4 and into 2016. Comparing against 2015 will make 2016 a bit more challenging just because this year has been so strong but I expect we'll continue to see more improvements next year. Recall that Q1 and Q2 were soft this year because of supply issues and the launch dates of some new model lines in the US; those quarters will look very strong for Ford in 2016 due to soft comps. Importantly, we also continue to see Ford Credit continue to chug along and produce ~$500 million in pre-tax profits per quarter. Ford has done a great job of extending prudent credit and it is showing up in its excellent profit numbers. Nothing much has changed here and I expect we'll continue to see steady profits from Credit in 2016 but that it also may not be a source of significant growth. Heading into next year Ford is still in a great position to succeed. I mentioned soft comps for Q1 and Q2 and I think Ford will produce excellent growth rates during those quarters, similar to what we just saw for this year's Q3. The F-Series is at full capacity production and with it flying off of dealer lots, that will produce a nice boost to the next two quarters' top and bottom lines. The Mustang is also doing quite well although volume is much lower there than for the F-Series. If Ford can continue to see improvements in Europe - which is currently its biggest headwind to earnings - we could see Ford's results improve materially. Europe saw much better volumes in Q3 and pre-tax profits improved substantially but it also still posted a sizable loss. Operating margins continue to improve and strength in the commercial lineup will get Europe back towards breakeven in 2016. The other three major geographical segments basically cancel each other out so I really don't care what happens there; we just need Europe to get out of the way of North America's results. Ford continues to produce huge FCF numbers - $2.8B from the automotive business in Q3 alone - and that allows it to pay its prodigious dividend. That 3.8% yield is certainly enticing and combined with Ford's 7.7 times forward earnings multiple, the stock still has the makings of a terrific value play. Of course, this has been true for a long time but we continue to see shares languish. To be honest, I'm not sure what will cause Ford to finally break out of its slump and trade higher because it continues to post tremendous results but to no avail. Patient shareholders are being paid handsomely to wait for higher prices but in the interim, I'd like to see Ford take the gloves off and do something about its low share price. Ford has the balance sheet and FCF numbers to support a substantial share repurchase program. It is only distributing about $600 million per quarter via its dividend but its FCF is much stronger than that and in excess of capex needs. Even if Ford borrowed the entire amount it could issue debt at rock bottom rates - lower than the cost of its dividend payment - and buy back perhaps 10% of the float without undue strain on the financials. I think an announcement like that would go a long way towards enticing people to buy the stock because exemplary results don't seem to be enough. I still like Ford here but I'm growing tired of great quarters not being enough for shareholders. The stock is still ludicrously cheap but that has been true for a long time. The yield is still great but that has also been true for a long time. I'd really like to see Ford take the share price into its own hands and announce a large scale buyback to get things going. Great results haven't been enough for Ford so perhaps some old-fashioned financial engineering would do the trick. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
