Why SM Energy Is Primed For More Upside After An Impressive Run So Far - SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) | Seeking Alpha SM shares have outperformed the market so far this year even though the company's financial performance has taken a beating due to weak energy prices. However, SM's acreage in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken areas will help it make a strong recovery as these carry robust internal rates of returns despite weak oil prices. SM's drilling, completion, and service costs have dropped at a rapid pace, indicating that the company will be able to improve its margins going forward. By using stack/stagger laterals in the Eagle Ford, SM has reduced its well costs by 25% and achieved an IRR of 35%. It is surprising to see that SM Energy (NYSE: SM ) has appreciated close to 17% on the stock market in 2015. The company, which gets 46% of its revenue from natural gas, 31% from crude oil, and the rest from natural gas liquids, has seen a consistent drop in its financial performance over the past year. This is clearly shown in the following chart: SM Revenue (NYSE: TTM) data by YCharts Additionally, the company's bottom line performance has not been up to the mark either in each of the last four quarters. Even in the recently-reported quarter, SM missed the bottom line estimate by $0.10 per share and the revenue estimate by $166 million. Thus, the weakness in oil prices has taken a heavy toll on SM's performance. But, what is it about the company that has kept investors' faith intact, as SM has beaten the overall market by a big margin this year despite financial weakness? Let's find out. SM's core acreage is spread across economical assets such as the Eagle Ford, the Bakken/Three Forks formation, and the Permian Basin. For instance, in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the cost of extracting oil from newly-drilled wells is as low as $33 per barrel across the state, as per Institutional Investor . In fact, in certain counties, oil can be extracted in the range of $28-$29 per barrel. More importantly, at the existing 11,000 wells in North Dakota, the cost of extracting oil is just $15 per barrel. Considering these numbers, it is not surprising to see why SM's cash flow from operations has started recovering slightly, as shown in the chart above. Additionally, even when oil prices were around $50 a barrel, SM was able to generate an internal rate of return of over 10%. Now, as oil prices currently hover around $60 WTI, the company's IRR is hovering around the 20% range in the North Eagle Ford (shown on the left) and the Bakken's Raven/Bear Den shale (shown on the right) areas as shown below: Thus, as oil prices continue improving going forward on the back of an improvement in demand and supply conditions in the industry, it is likely that SM Energy will be able to generate higher returns. Now, there is a distinct possibility that oil prices could improve going forward. This is because the production of crude oil in the U.S. is expected to decline from now till early 2016, as per the EIA. This is not surprising, as the rig count in the U.S. has declined at an aggressive pace over the past couple of months, and this is now leading to a drop in production, as shown below: The idling of rigs in the U.S. is also bringing down crude oil stockpiles, with oil inventories in the U.S. down for seven straight weeks now. Last week, crude oil inventories dropped another 2.7 million barrels. This is good news for oil prices, as the drop in production will help decrease the oversupply situation to some extent. Another reason behind the drop in crude oil inventories in the U.S. is strong demand. For example, the EIA is of the opinion that oil demand will rise by another 20,000 barrels per day this year to 1.25 million bpd as compared to its earlier forecast. Hence, on one hand, demand for crude oil is rising, while on the other, supply is gradually coming down. This will allow SM Energy to record higher internal rates of returns at its wells as oil prices continue improving. In a low oil price environment, SM Energy has done the right thing by reducing costs. For instance, its lease operating expenses in the previous quarter declined 3% year-over-year. More importantly, SM's drilling costs have dropped in the range of 10%-20%, while completion costs have declined between 20% and 25% as compared to last year. Also, the company has significantly reduced its service costs to the tune of 15% to 20% from last year. The following chart clearly shows the progress that SM has made at its key Eagle Ford asset with respect to cost cuts. SM's production in the Eagle Ford play was up 6% in the first quarter on a sequential basis. Looking ahead, it is highly-probable that the company will continue increasing its production in this area. In fact, SM is trying to improve inventory in the Eagle Ford by stack/stagger laterals , while optimizing spacing. The company has identified over 200 locations in its operated Eagle Ford South area to implement this strategy. More importantly, SM can bring these wells online at low costs. The well costs at 8,000 feet laterals are expected to be $6.1 million, down 25% as compared to last year. Also, these wells have an internal rate of return of 35% and offer net present value of $4.3 million. The graph below shows the stack and stagger testing road map in the Eagle Ford Shale. Thus, driven by its new investments in the Eagle Ford, SM should be able to enhance its margin performance going forward as oil prices improve. Given the points discussed above, it is not surprising to see why investors have faith in SM Energy's prospects and its shares have gained so far this year. Looking ahead, as oil prices continue improving, investors can expect the company's performance to improve further. As such, I would advise investors to hold on to their long positions in SM Energy as it can deliver more upside.
