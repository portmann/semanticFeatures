Ford: Should Bullish Investors Leverage Shares? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Bullish Ford investors call for significant upside potential. Risk-tolerant Ford bulls ready to put their money where their mouth is should consider LEAPS which carry slim time premiums. Bullish Ford (NYSE: F ) investors are calling for big moves in the automaker's shares citing strong sales, low valuation, and growth potential. While most investors focus on common shares, those willing to forgo the dividend can get about 3-to-1 leverage on Ford shares via LEAPS for a very small time premium. Shares of Ford have been beaten down in 2015 along with much of the auto industry but there is still a lot to like with the company's shares. Shares trade at only 8.6x est. 2015 earnings, 7.5x est. 2016 earnings, and 6.8x est. 2017 earnings giving the company a valuation more appropriate for a struggling company. The company is also strong at a fundamental level reporting a 5% increase in U.S. August sales despite a later Labor Day this year. This is partly due to newly refreshed models and partly due to a fall in gas prices boosting sales of higher margin SUVs and pickup trucks. Ford shareholders also collect a 4.2% dividend which among the highest in the auto industry and only slightly behind that of General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Bullish investors have made cases for Ford shares rising to $20 once investor confidence returns and performance continues to improve. While such a gain is ambitious, it would only require Ford shares to earn a 10.3x earnings multiple for its est. 2016 earnings or 9.3x est. 2017 earnings. Such a valuation is well below the market average and could be reached if investor confidence builds around Ford. Despite the potential for strong gains, Ford's in-the-money LEAPS trade with very small time premiums. The $10 call for January 2017 trades with an ask of $4.45 giving it a time premium of only 1.2% based on the Friday close at $14.28. Between now and the expiration date of the January 2017 LEAPS, Ford will also pay $0.75 per share in dividends assuming the current rate continues. If Ford increases its quarterly dividend at the beginning of the year by $0.025 per share as it has done in 2014 and 2015, Ford would be expected to pay $0.85 per share in dividends by the expiry of the previously mentioned LEAPS. In a bullish scenario where Ford shares reach the $20 mark by January 2017 the common shares would provide a gain of 46% with dividends included. But the $10 January 2017 LEAPS would gain 125% providing nearly three times the returns of the common stock. Even if Ford shares only make it back to their 52 week high hit last September 19 the LEAPS would gain 52% while the common shares with dividends factored in would provide gains of only 23%. With a high target price of $23.00 and an average price target of $17.41, analysts also view these levels as reachable during the course of the January 2017 LEAPS. Ford faces risks for being a cyclical company tied to the economy and profits could take a hit in a downturn. While Ford has less exposure to China than GM, a slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit Ford's growth opportunities there and reduce overall sales growth. Ford LEAPS carry additional risks. While they could provide much greater returns for Ford bulls they also carry more risk than the common shares. If the share price stagnates over the next year LEAPS holders would lose the time premium and miss out on the dividends. If Ford shares slide, the leveraged nature of the LEAPS would also compound losses and the LEAPS would face a 100% loss if the share price is below the strike price on the expiration date. Ford bulls are calling for a lot of upside to common shares yet LEAPS still trade with thin time premiums. In my opinion, this makes them an attractive investment for risk tolerant Ford bulls looking to capture greater returns from this automaker. At the same time, Ford common shares still offer attractive upside and are worth considering for dividend value investors.
