Ford: We Are Liking This Trade - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Like Ford but nervous about buying here? Selling puts could be right for you. Our recent article on Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) generated a passionate comments stream. Some readers just couldn't believe that the stock went down even after posting good numbers, while some suggested making use of pullbacks to collect "fat dividends" as the yield is more than 5% now. Some of these comments are shown below with names redacted. We agree that buying high yielding stocks on dips is generally a sound strategy. But given the negativity around Ford's stock, not too many investors might be comfortable buying the shares outright. The strategy described below should appeal to such investors. You are taking a bullish position on the stock, contrary to the misconception that when you do anything with "puts" you are being bearish. You get a premium in your account right away for the obligation to buy the stock at the price you want on the date you want. So, you decide the date and the price you want to buy and they pay you for it. But you are taking a "risk" in that if the stock drops well below your strike price, you still have to buy the stock at the price you chose, not the current market price. You believe a stock will not drop below a certain level, and if it does, you want to be a buyer. An Example: Below is Ford's option chain that expires on Jan. 20, 2017. Let's pick the $10 put for example. For selling one contract (one contract = 100 shares), you need to have a cash balance of $1,000 in your account. The premium on this particular put is 72 cents per share, that is $72 for a contract. #1: Ford is well above $10 at the time of expiration. Your option expires worthless and you net a cool 7.20% for about a year for your willingness set aside $1,000 on this contract. Remember, your $1,000 is not locked up with Ford beyond this point. This trade gives you a higher return, 7.20% vs. collecting dividends outright for shares. This trade also gives you some downside protection as explained below. Risk: If Ford really rockets up from here, your option returns will be lower than the stock returns. This doesn't look all that likely given how range bound this stock has been and how it goes down even on positive news. #2: Ford is at or below $10, you are obligated to buy 100 shares at $10. Remember, you already netted 72 cents per share when you sold the put. So, your cost basis is essentially $10-0.72 = $9.28. As long as Ford is above this $9.28, you will have a net positive return when this option chain expires. Risk: The risk in this scenario is that if Ford really tanks in the next 11 months and trades below $10, you will still have to buy your shares at $10. With Ford trading at $11.45 as of this writing, $10 would represent a further 12% fall in price. That doesn't look impossible but Ford should start appealing more to value investors and funds more if that happens. The $10 price will represent a yield of 6.00%, assuming Ford maintains the current dividend. As shown in the chart below, Ford has never had this yield level since reinstating dividends. Although estimates are subject to revisions, the current EPS estimate for 2017 stands at $2. That would mean buying Ford at $10 in January 2017 would represent a forward multiple of 5, which is about half of the company's average PE of 9.53 over the last five years. Ford has started 2016 with a bang in China, reporting record-sales in China. Changan Ford Automobile, Ford's joint venture in China, also broke sales record in January. This trend is likely to continue over the new few months at least as the whole industry is coming of a great 2015 and the momentum is likely to continue. China is not the only growth prospect for Ford. As reported in our previous Ford article, Ford had YoY gains in pretty much every single unit. The company is also targeting to double its production capacity in Mexico . Such actions and the results that typically follow show that the company knows what it's doing. Ford is a good 40% away from its mean price target of $16.25. Even the lowest estimate for 2017 EPS stands at $1.82 as of this writing and this gives the stock a forward multiple of 6.30. If you are current shareholder, you could sulk all you want about how Ford is undervalued but the only prudent thing to do is to reinvest your dividends when shares are depressed. One reader commented in our previous Ford article that "Ford the company is alright but the stock isn't". Broken stocks of good companies are the ones that would provide good returns in the long run. If you are not a current shareholder but wish to buy later, consider selling puts. Conclusion: While we don't own Ford yet, we are keenly watching the options chain in particular. We typically like to buy shares outright but if the trend is not in favor of the stock in question, we like selling puts at a level we are comfortable with. The strike mentioned in the article would either give us a) A 7.20% return if the option expires worthless or b) Ford shares at a 6% yield. Both prospects look better to us than what the market is currently presenting.
