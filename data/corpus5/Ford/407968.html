Ford Is All About The Dividend - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's stock price just will not climb into the $20's. The company had a great 2015 and an impressive first quarter of this year, yet the stock price is actually down. THough I've been against it, this company is starting to seem like a good dividend play at 4.5%. As long as you give up on price growth aspirations. I have been a negative sour puss about Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ). The stock is almost impervious to positive news . The company made $7 billion last year, and the stock hasn't breached $16. Chalk it up to lack of trust (2008 was a bit of a traumatizing experience for everyone) or something that I'm missing, but this stock just will not take off. In the last five years the price has remained in this $14-18 range. Being an American car fan, I'd like to buy Ford but I don't want a stock with a track record of boredom. The last two quarters were solid beats on earnings per share and yet the stock is actually down versus the first quarter of 2015 when the company missed estimates! What gives? The fact that the company dished out $1.58 billion in dividends in the first quarter of this year could have something to do with the stock price not reacting as much as I would like to their good financial situation. I prefer emphasis on building the stock rather than paying out yields, but you know what? Screw it. All my grumpy negativity aside, the stock is flirting with $13 a share which has increased my interest. Ford is paying a 4.5% dividend. They have been for quite some time, and it doesn't seem like they aim to change it. We might as well jump on the bandwagon. The company started the year with nice sales as SUV's and trucks gained momentum. Granted this might not continue through the year, but it's certainly a good start. I would buy some Ford stock if the price were to get down around $12. Since the exponential moving average seems to be around $14 or just below it as of late, I think $12 would be a nice entry point. That way I can play for a 16% price gain at $14, with a nice dividend. Technically it would work if you bought now at $13.30 since the stock seems to jump up to $16 quite a bit. As a whole though, you'd have to be buying this stock for the dividend because it clearly just doesn't have the support to go on a tear. Consider the fact that the companies net income in 2014 was $1.2 billion while 2015 brought income up to over $7 billion. Yet the stock price carried a much better average in 2014 than 2015. The stock just plain old confuses me. Earnings per share of Q1 2016 were double the same quarter last year. The stock price...down 9% over the past six months. You just can't buy this stock expecting massive gains. You have to buy it for the dividend. If anyone has any ideas about anything that may finally get this stock to $20 please let me know because based on their history it doesn't seem likely . This is just a short and simple idea about how to get a cheap stock with a nice dividend.
