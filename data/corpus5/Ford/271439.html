Has Ford Finally Cracked This Emerging Market? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford was struggling in India in the first seven months of the year with sales down 23%, which was bad news for investors considering this market’s potential. Ford, however, has made a terrific comeback in India in the past four months with its sales taking off after the introduction of two new models in popular categories. Ford’s market share in India has gone up from 1.99% in July to just below 4% in November, indicating that it is moving in the right direction. Ford should continue its growth trail in India as the two new models are priced competitively and carry a host of segment-first features. In an article back in August, I had focused on how Ford (NYSE: F ) was doing in India. At that time, Ford's performance in India was taking a beating, as its sales had declined just over 23% in the first seven months of the year and its market share had dropped to 1.99%. Now, the revenue potential of the Indian car market is in the range of $150 billion-$200 billion and it is expected to exceed 10 million units in annual sales in the coming years, as shown below. This is why even though Ford had sold just 36,477 units in India in the first seven months of the year, which is a small speck of its global sales, the importance of the country for Ford cannot be denied for a long-term perspective. As such, Ford's declining fortunes in this market didn't paint a good picture of the company's long-term prospects as India will turn out to be a key growth frontier in the long run. But, the good thing is that Ford has now made a terrific comeback in India of late on the back of two key models that target two high-growth segments in the country. Let's see what they have done for Ford and whether they can help the company get better in the long run. The Ford Figo Aspire was introduced in India in August 2015. In the three months through October, the model achieved domestic sales of more than 15,000 units, averaging 5,000 units per month. In October, 30% of Ford India's total sales of 10,008 units came from the Figo Aspire, which is not surprising given its technological advantage, powerful engine, and variety of trims offered to customers. The Figo Aspire comes in eight variants: five petrol and three diesel variants. Its manufacturing is being carried out in Ford's newly set up facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Ford's new sub-4 meter sedan is competitively priced in the range of INR 4.90 to 8.25 lakh, (approx $7,400-$12,500), and is equipped with several segment-first features such as dual airbags standard across all trim levels, an option for six airbags on the top trim, a dual-clutch automatic transmission, hill start assist, and an electronic stability program, among others. Packed with these features and competitive pricing, the Figo Aspire has really made a mark in India and has given tough competition to established sub-compact sedans from Suzuki, Honda (NYSE: HMC ), Hyundai, and Tata (NYSE: TTM ). The next-gen Ford Figo was launched in India in September 2015, a month after the Figo Aspire. This all-new version of the Figo offers is also priced quite competitively, ranging from approximately $6,500-$11,200. More importantly, Ford believes that the total cost of ownership of this vehicle will be around 20%-22% less than its rivals. At the same time, Ford has loaded this car by introducing certain segment-first features such as dual airbags that are standard even on the base trim, while the top trim carries six airbags. As a result, the Figo's sales went up from 1,547 units in September to 3,534 units in October, and then settled at a rather robust 2,790 units in November. Due to these two new models, Ford reported a 55% increase in domestic sales in India for the month of November. Its sales climbed from 5,661 units in the month of November 2014 to 8,773 units in the same month this year. Additionally, Ford's exports from India rose 18.51% from 7,101 units to 8,416 units year-over-year in November. The total increase in the year-over-year sales of Ford India was 34.78%. The increase in Ford's sales is attributable to the product-driven transformation strategy, and the following chart clearly indicates what the two new models have done for Ford in the past four months. More importantly, the increase in Ford's sales in India has helped the company increase its market share, as seen above. Though Ford's market share in India is not much and is in the low single digits, the introduction of the Aspire and the new Figo has boosted the company's performance. The market share of Ford in July was just 1.99%, which means that it has gained more than 150 basis points to 3.76% in November. All in all, the Aspire and the new Figo have definitely helped Ford make a comeback in India. The company has priced its products correctly and is offering a host of features to customers that are first in the segment. Thus, these two models should help Ford climb the market share ladder in the fast-growing Indian market, and this is good news for investors from a long-term perspective.
