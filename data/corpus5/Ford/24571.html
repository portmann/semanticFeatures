Rosetta Resources - Operating Within Means And Holding The Core Acreage Are Long-Term Drivers - Rosetta Resources Inc. (NASDAQ:ROSE) | Seeking Alpha By changing proppant type and adopting other measures, Rosetta Resources will be able to reduce all-in inclusive total well costs by 20% to 30% this year. Rosetta will hold its core acreage in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin in order to take advantage of the low cost of production in these areas. Rosetta will operate within its means by not taking any more debt, while an increase in cash flow and a drop in capex will strengthen its balance sheet. Rosetta's Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp assets will achieve break-even at $30 and $45 a barrel, respectively, allowing the company to keep its margins intact in a low price scenario. There is a lot of uncertainty regarding oil prices right now. There are certain bright spots, such as an expected increase in global demand. For example, Saudi Arabia has increased crude pricing for its sales to Asia for May, citing increased demand. But, at the same time, there are some concerns as well, such as the probability that Iran will be allowed to export crude oil after reaching a nuclear agreement. In such a scenario, it is best to remain cautious regarding crude oil pricing, and keep a close watch on those oil companies that are successfully reducing their costs in order to remain competitive. In my opinion, Rosetta Resources (NASDAQ: ROSE ) is one such company. Although the stock has taken a massive beating in the last year, losing over 57%, its revenue and earnings have increased at an impressive pace as shown below: Thus, Rosetta's top- and bottom-lines have accelerated at a terrific pace despite the massive drop in crude oil pricing in the past year. The company's development and delineation of the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin are driving its results, as these high grade assets are capable of delivering returns even in a low oil price environment. For instance, its Eagle Ford assets can achieve break-even at a price of $30 a barrel, while the Wolfcamp 'A' horizontal wells are expected to remain at break-even at a price of $45 a barrel. More importantly, Rosetta is reducing its service costs in order to strengthen the economic returns of these assets by adopting various measures. For instance, Rosetta has implemented a new stimulation design that is based on changing the proppant type ceramic to sand, apart from trying out higher proppant loadings. As a result, the company will be able to reduce its drilling and completion costs. Also, at the Lower and Upper Eagle Ford areas at Gate Ranch, Rosetta has recently initiated staggered pilot programs. This program, along with its new stimulated design, should help Rosetta reduce costs going forward. In fact, Rosetta expects its all-in inclusive total well costs to drop in the range of 20% to 30% in fiscal 2015. Additionally, the company has taken a smart decision by cutting down its capital expenditure for the next two years. It expects to spend approximately $350 million in 2015 and 2016, a 70% drop over its capital expenditure in 2014. Rosetta plans to spend nearly 80% of its capital budget on drilling and completion, while the remaining 20% will go to other corporate costs, leasehold, and other facilities. Looking ahead, Rosetta plans to hold its core acreage positions in the liquid-rich areas of the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. The below table illustrates its core acreage position across its different assets. For example, Rosetta has recovered nearly 30% of the reserves in the Gates Ranch Far South area in two years, generating about 50% of the present value. Hence, its decision of not drilling too many wells in a low price environment is a good one. The company will lose some acreage as a result, as reflected in two-year change column below, due to continuous drilling obligations. But, considering the concentration of its assets in the Eagle Ford and Permian, Rosetta should be able to accelerate production in the long run. All in all, Rosetta should be able to reduce its costs at a good clip going forward. This is a smart strategy in the current crude oil environment where there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the future direction of oil prices. More importantly, Rosetta's cost cuts will allow it to operate within its means, i.e. the company will not take on additional debt and operate using its cash flow. This is a good initiative, since Rosetta has a very high level of debt at $2 billion, and a debt-equity of close to 120. But, the company's cash flow has trended positively in the past year and stands at almost $650 million as shown below: ROSE Cash from Operations ( TTM) data by YCharts Thus, by operating within its means, Rosetta is following the right strategy. Moreover, since the company's assets are in key shale plays such as the Eagle Ford and the Permian, it should be able to scale up production when the market conditions permit. Hence, despite its huge drop over the last year, Rosetta can make a comeback in the long run.
