Why Ford's Comeback In China Is Set To Continue - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Having struggled in the first 10 months, Ford has made a strong comeback in November in China and looks set to end the year with 1 million units in sales. Ford’s comeback is driven by the Chinese government’s favourable policy of slashing the sales tax in half on certain vehicles and this trend will continue next year. Chinese consumers can enjoy the tax cut until the end of next year and this is expected to double auto growth to 5%-7% from 3% this year. Ford is done with the introduction of 15 new models in China, which will allow it to benefit from the growth in vehicle sales next year. Ford is making investments to introduce more technology, increase localization, and bring new EVs into China, which will allow it to make the most of this market going forward. Auto sales in China were struggling a few months ago due to a weak economy, but they are making an impressive comeback of late. In fact, last month, auto sales in China clocked the fastest growth rate in the past two years by increasing 23.7% from last year to 2.2 million vehicles. As compared to October, vehicle sales rose 13.3%. This is good news for Ford (NYSE: F ), as China accounts for almost 20% of the company's global sales, and the weakness in this market was weighing on Ford's performance earlier this year. In fact, the recent surge in vehicle sales in China has created a positive impact on Ford's sales, as discussed below. Driven by the recent improvement in China's auto sales, Ford is likely to cross the 1 million unit sales mark in China for the full year 2015. Through November this year, the company had sold 990,356 new vehicles in the country. In the month of November itself, it had sold 106,283 vehicles. This is indicative that November was the best month for Ford this year and signified the company's comeback in this market. In fact, Ford's growth in sales for the first 11 months of the year stood at a negative 1.7% as compared to last year's 1,007,425 units through November. In contrast, the year-over-year growth for just the month of November stood at an impressive 9%. More importantly, this recent upswing in China's auto sales is set to continue going forward due to favorable government policies. Next year, it is expected that the Chinese auto market will grow in the range of 5%-7%, which is double the 3% increase forecasted for 2015 at the mid-point. This improvement in vehicle sales in China next year will be driven by the government's policy of reducing the sales tax in half on vehicles with small engines until the end of next year. Thus, the Chinese government's strategy of pushing auto sales in the country is working, and this will allow Ford to sustain its recent growth in this market next year. More importantly, Ford is well-positioned to tap further growth in the Chinese market on the back of its strong product portfolio and infrastructure investments. Let's see how. Ford is fifth among the top foreign manufacturers in China, but the company is taking aggressive steps to make the most of this market. As a part of this ambition, Ford has completed the launch of 15 new vehicles in China in the current year, beginning with the launch of its flagship Taurus sedan at the Guangzhou Auto Show. More importantly, the company is adjusting its products as per the Chinese market's needs as it is making modifications to its U.S.-based models before bringing them to China. This is another reason why Ford has seen an improvement in sales of late and is primed to do well in this market going forward. At the same time, Ford is giving Chinese consumers new technology that will increase the attractiveness of its cars. In this direction, the automaker announced in October that it will invest 11.4 billion Yuan ($1.8 billion) over the next five years in research and development. As a part of this R&D exercise, Ford will focus on increasing smartphone connectivity, introducing autonomous driving, and other car features to its cars in China. Moreover, in order to tap the growing EV market in China, Ford will launch two new energy vehicles next year: the Ford C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and the Ford Mondeo hybrid electric vehicle. The Chinese government is increasingly creating an environment conducive for new energy vehicles. In fact, due to the government's favorable policies , new-energy vehicles are gaining momentum in China. The sales of new-energy vehicles have jumped 290% to 171,100 units through October this year, and the trend will continue in the long run as the country aims to deploy "12,000 EV charging stations and 4.5 million charging points by 2020," which will be a remarkable improvement from just 30,000 charging points last year. Keeping the prospects of the growing EV market in sight, Ford has decided to make a $4.5 billion investment in electrified vehicle solutions by 2020 to enhance its portfolio. China's auto market has made an impressive comeback of late, and as discussed above, this trend is going to continue. More importantly, Ford is on track to benefit from the growth in the Chinese auto market as it has completed the roll-out of the new vehicle portfolio. Moreover, by delivering more technology to Chinese customers and rolling out new EVs, Ford is moving in the right direction in China. Thus, considering that Ford gets almost 20% of its sales from China, the resurgence in this market will have a positive impact on its financial performance.
