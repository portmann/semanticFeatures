Carrizo Oil & Gas Holds Promise Despite Weak Q1 Results - Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRZO) | Seeking Alpha Carrizo Oil & Gas saw a sharp drop in its revenue and earnings last quarter due to weak energy prices, even though its production increased at a terrific pace. Carrizo, however, looks well-positioned to combat the oil price drop as it has hedged over 70% of its 2015 oil production with $50 floors and $67 ceilings. An increase in demand and a falling rig count in the U.S. will support the recent recovery in oil prices, enabling Carrizo to improve its performance going forward. Carrizo enjoys strong economies of production in the Eagle Ford, so it will continue drilling in this play going forward to take advantage of better pricing. Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ: CRZO ) has performed exceedingly well in the current oil environment, gaining around 25% on the stock market so far this year. But, Carrizo's first-quarter results, released on May 6, were below expectations. Still, it is highly-likely that the company will be able to sustain its momentum going forward due to smart operational moves and an improving oil environment. Carrizo reported a massive increase in production in the first quarter of 2015, particularly from its Eagle Ford assets. In fact, its oil production rose 42% to 21,373 Bbls/d, while its total production, including gas and natural gas liquids, increased 30% over the first quarter of 2014. The Eagle Ford play alone delivered approximately 18,700 Bbls/d for the quarter. However, weak oil and natural gas prices created a huge impact on its financial performance. Carrizo witnessed a massive drop in its earnings for the first quarter of 2015, driven by a sharp decline in revenue. It reported revenue of $100 million, a drop of 36% from the prior-year period. Also, its earnings came in at $0.14 per share, significantly lower than $0.51 per share in the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, Carrizo outpaced consensus estimates on the bottom line. Wall Street was estimating earnings of $0.03 per share, but due to its key assets in the Eagle Ford play where the company can extract more oil at lower prices, it was able to beat expectations. Had the oil and gas price environment been strong, Carrizo would have reported strong numbers. Sadly, oil prices have dropped steeply in the past year, and this weighed on Carrizo's performance. However, Carrizo has prepared itself for such volatility by hedging its production, which is why it expects to realize approximately 91% to 93% of the NYMEX price for its oil revenue, apart from 72% to 80% for its gas and NGL revenue in the ongoing quarter. In fact, Carrizo has hedged more than 70% of its total production for the balance of the year. This consists of 15,800 barrels a day with $50 floors and $67 ceilings. For 2016 as well, Carrizo has hedged 4,000 barrels of oil per day so far with a $77 ceiling and a $50 floor. As such, the company has made a smart move by hedging a substantial amount of its production as this will help it mitigate the weakness in oil and gas pricing to a certain extent. In fact, as a result of its recent crude oil hedge transactions, Carrizo has been able to lock an extra cash flow of $119 million for the remaining quarters of 2015, along with another $45 million for next year. Thus, the company has a good-looking hedge book that will allow it to cushion further falls in energy prices. Now, it is well-known that the oil market is oversupplied, and this has kept crude oil prices under pressure. But, the good thing is that demand is returning to the market, while a drop in rig count is leading to supply cuts. For instance, the U.S. rig count dropped for the first time in 17 weeks recently. As reported by MarketWatch : "The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday said crude-oil supplies fell 3.9 million barrels for the week ended May 1. That was the first decline since the week ended Jan. 2, even though oil-rig counts have been falling since December, based on data from Baker Hughes. At last count, as of May 1, the number of active U.S. oil rigs stood at 679." Concurrently, demand is also rising. This is indicated in the following graphic, which indicates that the International Energy Agency expects oil demand to increase at a faster pace of 1.1 million barrels per day this year: Now, a decrease in supply and an improvement in demand will support the recent surge in oil prices, and this is good news for Carrizo. As a result, the company is improving its production in more profitable areas such as the Eagle Ford, where 80% of its wells can deliver returns even at a low crude oil price of $44 per barrel. Now, the current WTI price is a shade under $60 a barrel, which means that a majority of Carrizo's production in the Eagle Ford is currently profitable. Currently, Carrizo's Eagle Ford portfolio has about 210 gross or 184 net wells, along with three drilling rigs that are running a frac crew round the clock. Carrizo recently drilled about 14 gross or 12.2 net operating wells, and completed 16 gross or 14.5 net wells during the first quarter due to the economical production in the Eagle Ford. Looking ahead, the company is on the verge of completing 23 gross or 19.9 net operating wells in the Eagle Ford shale. These wells are expected to come online in the current quarter and will add more than 7,500 barrels of oil production per day, which will help Carrizo strengthen its margins. Carrizo's recent results might have been weak, but the company could improve going forward due to its smart hedging, economical Eagle Ford production, and the oil recovery. Thus, investors should look beyond Carrizo's recent results and instead focus on its long-term prospects that are still intact as its bottom line is expected to increase at a CAGR of 26% for the next five years.
