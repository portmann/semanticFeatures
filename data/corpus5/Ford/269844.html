ETF Hub Dec 19 2015, 11:08 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Star Wars: The Force Awakens is tracking toward a $246M to $254M opening weekend, a mark that stands above many forecasts from Wall Street and Hollywood. An even better sign for movie theater chains is the extremely high ratings given to the film by moviegoers. The hard-to-land  A from CinemaScore  indicates Star Wars is likely to bring in repeat visitors just like the original in 1977, and some that skipped the last round of lower rated Star Wars movies (episodes 1-3). Disney (NYSE: DIS ) had a rough day on Friday, down almost 4% off a stinging BTIG downgrade.  Shares could get a boost if the $250M projection plays out. Previously: Star Wars arrives amid sky-high expectations (Dec. 18) My cousins allergists optometrist saw Star Wars and was shocked to learn that Vader, who is evil, is Luke's father. Also, I read on the interweb that Harrison ford has an embarrassing drinking problem. Do they watch this movie in Asia too? The aforementioned optometrist says that Asian is the most beautiful language she has ever heard. I went to see it. Theatre was packed, once movie was over there was already a lineup for the next showing, and tons of people dressed up. I think it was playing in like 10/16 theatres. It will break every record. Same in our area.  Theater packed.  I drove by the mall mid afternoon and all parking was packed included the extended parking area surrounding theater with more cars stalking people leaving.  When an old character was introduced during their first scene (Hans Solo & Chewy, Princess Leah, R2D2, C3PO & Luke Skywalker), the theater erupted in applause.  This horse will have strong staying power. Over a month ago, Fandango reported largest presale ever for a movie.  During the last month, the record has been padded further. Just watched it. There's only literally 4 people in the cinema watching it. This is saturday night, 9.30. I am a bit surprised as I expected it to be packed. I just got back from a 9 AM showing. It wasn't a full house, but most of the seats were filled. Saw it loved it,  going back to see it in 3D this time.  The wife who doesn't really care about SW,  said she loved it and wants to come back for 3D.   That tells me a lot,  enough said.  Long DIS. Daaa 51, saw it with my 18 year old son. My 20 year old saw it on Premiere. Really liked  it. Better then the last 3 easily.  Saw it at 10:10 Friday. Probably 700 seat theater, running 3 screens, and about 8 screens in town (250,000) running it. Theater over half full, but people were lined up to get good seats and it was on 3 screens. One in 3d, one in 2d and one in xd. So lots of options. Movie is doing great. The BTIG (Institutional Trading Prime Brokerage Firm) downgrade was a set up to create an entry point for their clients into the stock. Check out the intra day trading in DIS on Friday.  There is a MASSIVE GIANT volume bar at the close of trading when the price was near the bottom of the day.  I wonder how many of their clients were buyers at the close taking away stock from all the suckers who sold at the bottom based on the BTIG downgrade. Really to bad with ESPN sports dragging down the stock. Mr. Co. Needs to get his ---- together. He also was completely surprised by this. The toy companies DIS switched back to made toys before with one mold for all characters - junk. A few problems here but can't wait to see the event. I have been a shareholder of Disney for several decades and would never even consider selling it.  Disney has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term.   Disney has always been a buy and hold forever stock. What were those folks at BTIG thinking when they downgraded Disney to a SELL?  If a financial adviser ever suggested that I sell Disney, I would wonder what he had been smoking. Cord cutting trends being what they are,  there remains the fact that Disney content will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future.  Period.  A brand new generation of Disney fans is being minted even as I write.  Long DIS. All the way. @B&H, the analysts at BTIG work for the people who pay them. Publicly announced upgrades/downgrades are at best worthless. At worst, they are actively misleading. BTIG got exactly what they wanted by dropping this bomb on opening day. Their name is everywhere and their clients get to pick up the stock at a discount from the sheep. And let's not forget that Shanghai is scheduled to open this spring.   The folks at BTIG must be attempting to orchestrate an entry point.
