Nothing but confidence from Mark Fields on Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Apr  7 2016, 10:51 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor The sale of Ford ( F -1.2%) shares by CEO Mark Fields is due to the approaching expiration date of options, a communications exec tells Seeking Alpha. Fields is confident in Ford's business plan and continues to invest. His holdings of common stock have actually increased significantly. As for commitment, Fields has worked at Ford since he was in his late 20s and recently stated that he sees the company becoming one of the world's leading automotive and mobility players. I should never question you when you comment on the sale of Ford shares by F executives. I really thought you were off base re/the reported sale by Mark Fields. Once again you nailed it! You go great one! That is the understatement of the decade.....he epitomizes the old Ford and is resorting to all the old school games. He and his leadership team are in way over their heads. Well, Mark Fields, if everything is so fabulous, and the news does sound good, why is our share price being hammered so badly this month?   Perhaps the decision to build an unnecessary plant in Mexico might signal the UAW may be brewing up a stink, or is that a strike?   Just when we had a bit of traction, you idiots seem to know how to make the non-slip/traction control features deactivate themselves! Don't hit the freaking bridge abutment, Mark.   You need to step up your game, and show some "Bold Moves" as you put it, and inspire confidence in our once-excellent products. Clean up our dismal showing with Consumer Reports, and show some leadership.   Alan Mullaly is gone... pick up the ball, and take it to the bloody hoop, Ford! Yikes, Ford is a for profit enterprise not a government sponsored enterprise like GM or Tesla? Why should Ford build all it's vehicles in US with overpriced UAW labor? US auto workers are lucky Ford still manufacturers all it's 2016 Mustangs in the USA.  Ford, like many other US enteprises, makes vehicles for international consumption and needs to pick it's manufacturing locations to maximize return on capital not the UAW. this was apart of ford's new agreement with their union. compact cars will be moved to mexico to increase their profitability, while ford promises to add more vehicle production to factory in wayne michigan thus preserving American jobs. "The sale of Ford (F -1.2%) shares by CEO Mark Fields is due to the approaching expiration date of options, a communications exec tells Seeking Alpha." The above link states the options were scheduled to expire in March of 2017 .... that's quite a stretch of the use of "approaching". When you first get out of bed in the morning, is dinner "approaching"? Of course it is, but you don't go out and fire up the grill yet. Sheesh! Great post Feckless. It is absolutely typical of Fields and Ford since the departure of Mullally. There isn't an ounce of credibility in the entire management team. There are a lot of ways a guy like Fields can raise money to pay taxes. If he had real conviction in the stock he would not sell such a large position at these levels. There is very little confidence in Mark Fields from the Ford rank and file.  Not a surprise this stock continues to languish for years now since Fields has taken over the CEO role.  He was not the guy to run this company.   I said it back then and I say it now.  Just look at the F chart since his promotion to CEO and that proves my point. Ford and the UAW ratified their pact back last fall so there is zero possibility of a strike over the next 3 years.  As for Mexican factories...... it's not rocket science here as there is no way to profitably build small cars using super expensive UAW labor.  The UAW doesn't care as long as the US facilities are converted to build SUV's and the like.
