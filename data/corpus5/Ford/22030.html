Ford Motor: Should You Be Worried? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor reported a 3.4% year-over-year drop in total U.S. vehicle sales for the month of March on Wednesday. This comes after Ford announced a 1.9% year-over-year decline in U.S. sales in February. However, Ford beat the consensus estimate, which called for a 5.4% decline in sales. F-150 retail sales momentum keeps me optimistic for 2015. Ford Motor is not a 'Sell' just because sales declined on a year-over-year basis. Ford represents a good deal for shareholders nonetheless. Is Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) worth investing in or not? If you looked at the automaker's latest U.S. sales results, the answer would probably be no. Last month, Ford Motor released its February sales numbers, which were very disappointing - to say the least. In February, Ford Motor sold 180,383 vehicles in the United States, which was about 2% lower year over year. Further, Ford Motor missed the consensus sales growth estimate of 5.2% by a wide margin, whereas General Motors (NYSE: GM ) did much better than Ford in the same month. I contended that Ford's sales decline was not a major issue at the time, because February is usually not the strongest month for car sales and adverse weather conditions can have a dampening effect on sales volumes. Fast forward one month, and Ford released another set of weak U.S. sales numbers. So, is it time to revisit the Ford Motor investment thesis? Not so fast. Let's first look at the numbers to get a feel about how Ford Motor was doing in the month of March. In March, Ford Motor sold 235,929 vehicles, which compares against 244,167 vehicles sold in March of last year. That's a decrease of 3.4% year over year. Ford's car sales declined 11.6% from 86,791 last year to 76,765 in March 2015. Sales of utility vehicles declined 2.1% from 70,998 in March of 2014 to 69,494 vehicles in March 2015. Decreases in car and utility sales were partly offset by growing truck sales. The truck segment has been doing much better lately for Ford Motor and March wasn't an exception for Ford: Truck sales grew 3.8% year over year to 89,670, which compares against truck sales of 86,378 in the year ago month. Despite the overall weak performance in March, it is noteworthy that Ford Motor does have segments of strength, which gives reason to be optimistic. Much has already been said about Ford's F-150 truck and its potentially very positive influence on Ford's 2015 truck sales. The bottom line here is, that Ford Motor will likely see more sales momentum in the truck segment throughout 2015 and beyond, thanks to its new aluminum-bodied F-150. In addition, as weak as Ford's U.S. sales in March were, Ford did beat the consensus estimate. Analysts were expecting Ford's U.S. sales to decline 5.4%. Put differently, Ford has outperformed sales expectations by posting a lower-than-expected decline in U.S. vehicle sales in March. While I certainly agree with investors that a 3.4% year-over-year decline in sales isn't a reason to bring out the champagne bottles, things are not as bad as they seem. According to Ford Motor's press release, Ford "posted its best U.S. retail sales in nine years." U.S. retail sales increased 1% year over year. Ford's F-series even saw a retail sales increase of 10% in March adding to expectations that 2015 will be the stellar year of the F-150. Sometimes, investors just need to be patient. Just because Ford Motor had another weak month in the U.S., on a total vehicle sales basis, doesn't mean Ford is becoming less of an attractive investment. Quite the opposite is true: Ford Motor is remarkably cheap for the value it brings to the table and the company could generate some promising catalysts in 2015, which may very well support the share price. My advice here would be to not lose patience in Ford just yet because of lighter year-over-year sales in March. Ford is doing well in Europe, growing market share and outpacing industry sales growth . Since Ford Motor can also be bought with a sizable margin of safety and with a 3.74% dividend yield, the case for Ford Motor is as valid as it was before the company released sales results on Wednesday. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and an investment in Ford Motor is likely to put investors' patience to the test. Ford has a lot going for itself though: It is cheap, has a stellar product lined up to ignite truck sales in 2015, and returns a nice dividend to shareholders. The positives outweigh the negatives by a mile. Long-term Buy. Source: Ford Motor: Should You Be Worried? Disclosure: The author is long F.
