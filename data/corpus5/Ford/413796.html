Your General Motors Shares Trade Below Fair Value: Here's Why - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha For most of 2016, General Motors shares have been range bound. Some investors believe the stock is woefully undervalued; others think it's a value-trap. This article presents a comprehensive overview and analysis in an attempt to determine GM's fair value estimate. I believe good investing revolves around 2 major components. The first is determining if a company is well-managed, has a sound balance sheet, owns a strong franchise, earns its profits in cash, and is shareholder-friendly. For a moment, let's assume we agree General Motors (NYSE: GM ) meets the requirements outlined under the aforementioned first premise. Using a single valuation approach is unlikely to provide superior results. Typically, comparing multiple methodologies help to paint a better overall picture; or at least confirm core premises. For a capital-intensive business like GM, I like to emphasize cash flow (or free cash flow) valuation metrics versus simply focusing upon straight price-and-earnings analysis. As goes the old saying, "Garbage In, Garbage Out," so goes any fair value analysis. Therefore, let me recap some of the GM raw data input assumptions by which the proceeding ratios were based. Earnings: non-GAAP "operating" earnings were used, as provided by General Motors management. Cash Flow: obtained via actual, consolidated "net cash provided by operating activities" from 10-K filings. Free Cash Flow: derived by subtracting "expenditures for property" from cash flow. Intentionally, "Purchases of Leased Vehicles" was excluded. I gave GM credit for cash flows generated by its General Motors Financial arm. Capital expenditures were limited to direct capex consumed by the Automotive, GMF, and Reclassification segments. Enterprise Value: EV is calculated by adding market value, debt, minority interest and preferred equity; then subtracting cash and marketable securities on hand. When computing General Motors' EV, I used automotive debt only. Including GMF debt distorts the calculation. The financial group borrows a lot of money, but turns around to arbitrage the cash on collateralized loans for autos. We are interested in the valuation of the overall ongoing business enterprise. Figures used were year-end for the specified date, unless stated otherwise. Shares Outstanding: The valuation metrics utilize diluted shares outstanding. Past years' figures are actuals. 2016 estimates assume the share count will remain flat to 2015 actuals. F.A.S.T. graphs offers a chart depicting General Motors total shares outstanding since 2011: GM management has stated the Company will repurchase $5 billion in stock this year. No 2016 share reduction was recognized in the fair value estimates. A note on EBITDA: While popular in many circles, especially among the bankers' debt/leverage folks, I am not a proponent of using EBITDA multiples in a stock valuation analysis. None are used in this article. Clearly, this data illustrates GM is undervalued. Over the past 5 years the average, normalized P/E ratio has been 9.8x. The current ttm P/E is 5.6x. Based upon current estimates, the forward operating P/E is only 5.4x. Since 2016 EPS estimates indicate good growth, there isn't a compelling reason to premise multiple compression. S&P 500 IQ analysts forecast General Motors will earn $5.68 operating earnings per share in 2016. This was harmonized by GM management estimates. CEO Mary Barra presented the following from the January 2016 Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference: We see the multiple has expanded modestly over the period. The jump in 2014 was largely due to lower cash flow resulting from the ignition recall tragedy and associated fines. A straight, 5-year average P/CF ratio is 4.6x. Removing the 2014 figure as an aberration lowers the multiple to 4.2x. Premising General Motors will generate $13 billion operating cash flow this year (that's conservative - S&P 500 IQ analysts suggest $13.4 billion 2016 CF), and the Company realizes no reduction in the share count, GM could be expected to make $8.67 cash per share. Note the FCF multiple has contracted over the period. Similar to operating cash flow, and as may be expected, free cash flow dropped markedly in 2014. The 5-year average P/CF ratio was 15x. Dropping the 2014 marker lowers it to 14x. Looking ahead, GM management indicates free cash flow could be $6 to $8 billion a year through the 2016 to 2018 period. It's important to recognize this is an adjusted figure. Another slide from General Motors as shown at the Deutsche Bank Auto Conference slide deck offers some color: Accepting the lower end $6 billion objective, but "unadjusting" the number; one may plausibly premise 2016 FCF to be $4.5 billion or ~$3.00 a share. This is equivalent to a 35% cash flow-to-free cash flow conversion rate. That's in line with recent years' actual CF/FCF conversion rate. Placing a 14x multiple on $3 offers a ~$42 fair value estimate. Compressing the multiple to 12x still suggests a $36 stock. Reviewing EV/CF and EV/FCF are just other ways of evaluating GM share price. Instead of a per share function, we check cash as a function of Enterprise Value. Conceptually, Enterprise Value may be thought of as a theoretical takeover price. Generally, an acquirer would have to buy up the equity, take on the company's debt, but could pocket the balance sheet cash for itself. On balance, EV/CF valuation has revolved around an approximate 3.1x mark. If we exclude 2014 from the EV/FCF average (pointed out earlier to be a bit of an aberration), the ratio has averaged about 9.5x. Looking forward, if we stick with our 2016 cash flow forecast of $13 billion and utilize the current EV ($35.6 billion), the EV/CF estimate is 2.7x, clearly lower than recent multiples. We find a similar story when substituting free cash flow: the EV/FCF forecast is 7.9x. Therefore, on an EV/OCF and EV/FCF basis, GM is undervalued by 15% and 20%, respectively. One can determine the corresponding fair value estimates are about $35 and $37. The P/S ratio can be useful. I tend to use it as confirmation ratio versus stand-alone. Proponents of this metric like to state earnings are most-easily manipulated by slick accounting, while sales revenues are harder to fudge. I accept that view as reasonable. We see the recent "sweet spot" appears to be 0.3x to 0.35x. The current P/S ratio is 0.32x. For 2016, it is reasonable to forecast sales returning to 2013 and 2014 figures. This is based upon continued overseas sales improvement and increasing domestic ATPs, offset by reduced U.S. rental fleet sales. The bottom line expectation is $156 billion net revenue. This represents a 2.4% uplift versus 2015 actual. Following is a valuation metric comparison between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ). As noted, the table reflects forward 2016 multiples based upon recent management and/or Street forecasts. Enterprise Value ratios utilize current EV and forward cash flows. The P/S ratio is expected 2016 results as aligned with recent historic actuals. Ford valuation ratios were determined through the use of F.A.S.T. graphs, financial information found on the Ford web site , and Street forecasts. GM compares favorably with Ford on P/E and P/S. Ford appears cheaper on P/FCF and EV multiples. On a price-to-cash flow basis, the firms stand roughly equal. These numbers suggest a plausible case for owning Ford shares. However, fully understanding the underlying business narrative is just as important as the numbers. For example, General Motors expects to generate significantly more cash and free cash flow in 2016 versus last year. On the other hand, Ford expects these figures to decrease in 2016. In addition, General Motors offers current investors a secure, 5% dividend yield. Ford stock sports a healthy, but lesser 4.5% yield. Using a P/E valuation may NOT be the best approach. The $56 fair value estimate appears to be an outlier. Other approaches provide a tighter pack FVE in the $36 to $37 range. A $36.50 price target on today's bid offers prospective 16% capital appreciation. This does not include the current 5% dividend yield. If one subscribes to the view General Motors can maintain its upward financial momentum, as aligned with management's expectations, GM common shares represent a significantly undervalued security.
