ETF Hub Oct  3 2015, 11:02 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor An UAW union repping workers at a Ford (NYSE: F ) plant in Missouri reached a tentative agreement with the company. Workers still need to vote on the deal which covers employment conditions, not wage levels being negotiated on a national level. The development is crucial for Ford as the Kansas City-area plant is a major producer of the new F-150. Any slowdown in production would create a ripple of worry with F-150 sales continuing to ramp up. Overall F-Series U.S. sales were up 16% to over 69K units in September. The F-Series has delivered over 564K U.S.  YTD. Wow!  This is great news.  The reason F did not take off on the Sept sales figures is that this was overshadowed by the vote down of the Chrysler-Fiat UAW deal. Please, not out of the woods yet....."tentative"...... on national level.....I am long F and want to get this over and done with, but it is not, by a long shot....life is interesting and sometimes, frustrating....cheers Unions protect workers.  Without collective bargaining, the middle class is ruined and the only beneficiaries are those who have unions of collusion in the corporate world.  Ford reaching terms with the UAW is good news.  There can be a win-win other than a winner take all or loser take nothing.  Good Americans know that.  Ideologues would have us beggar they neighbor, a game no American worker can win, in which all Americans lose.  No American can live on what a Mexican or Chinese worker makes.  Good for Ford and the UAW. Almost every Ambulance in this United States is a Ford I asked a ambulance driver why almost every ambulance is a Ford and his comment was..".We want to make sure they run" From what i see..Fords advertisement lacks Unions protect the mob or the boss goes the way of Jimmy Hoffa. Nonetheless, it is a good thing to have this tentative agreement. I hope they can finalize this and come to terms on wages soon.
