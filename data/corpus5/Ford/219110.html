This Doesn't Make Any Sense...Is Ford Motor Dead Money? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released strong Q3-15 results on Tuesday. Despite excellent results in the U.S. and reaffirmed profit guidance, shares are tanking. Just when you thought Mr. Market is finally treating Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) a bit more kindly, he falls back into old habits. Ford Motor released excellent third quarter results on Tuesday, just like General Motors (NYSE: GM ) did last week, but Mr. Market would have none of it. Ford's automotive revenues jumped from $32.8 billion in the third quarter of last year to $35.8 billion in the last quarter, while the auto maker's operating margin improved from 2.5% to 6.5%. If you thought that wasn't good enough, take note of Ford's Y/Y increase in automotive pre-tax earnings: They jumped from just $686 million a year ago to $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015; a $1.5 billion Y/Y increase. At the end of the day, Ford Motor said it earned a total of $0.48 per share in the last quarter, which was $0.27 per share more than what it earned in the third quarter of last year. That does not sound too bad, does it? Ford Motor's red-hot U.S. business drove a 129% increase in Y/Y-per share profits. In my book that's pretty darn good. Once again, Ford's third quarter results underscored the auto maker's dependence on the U.S. market. In Q3-15, North America was the only geography that was solidly profitable for the company -- although Ford was able to squeeze out a $20 million pre-tax profit in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, Ford Motor's third quarter results were driven entirely by its American operations. In terms of revenues, operating margins, and pre-tax earnings, Ford Motor has had great success last quarter, which was largely expected. Ford's management itself could not contain its excitement over the company's success this year...just read Ford's press release : The Ford team delivered an outstanding quarter - with record third quarter profit, best quarter ever for North America, higher wholesales, higher revenue, higher market share and improved margin. We are delivering a breakthrough year. ~ Mark Fields, Ford President and CEO Ford Motor did not only release respectable financial results on Tuesday, but management also reiterated its earnings guidance for this year, encouraged by a more than robust Q3-15, which is an expression of confidence in Ford Motor's present growth trajectory. For the full-year Ford Motor reconfirmed its ambition to pull in $8.5-$9.5 billion in pre-tax profits, before special items. Sounds quite good, right? Source: Ford Motor Investor Presentation Wrong. Though Ford Motor reported billions in profits, record earnings in North America, growing sales, F-150 production on track, and reaffirmed its profit outlook, investors would have none of it, a theme that has become way too familiar over the last few years. No matter how good Ford's results are, Mr. Market always finds a reason to beat down the stock. This time: Ford's adjusted EPS of $0.45 missed the Street estimate by two pennies due to slightly higher taxes. Yawn. An investment in Ford Motor more and more appears to be dead money simply because Mr. Market doesn't care how good Ford's results are. Ford Motor has seen record profits in North America, still by far the company's most important geography in terms of sales, but the Street just doesn't have much love for the company. Frankly, I am about to lose my patience here, not with Ford, but with Mr. Market. A 129% Y/Y increase in earnings and sales going through the roof, and the stock goes down 5%?
