Ford Looks Very Well Positioned For 2016 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long F. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Ford's December sales numbers came in under expectations but still with nice gains. Total volume growth seen in 2015 will be hard to replicate in 2016 but cause for optimism remains. Margin growth should continue as sales rise in 2016 and at just 7 times forward earnings, Ford is very cheap. Automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) is a company I've been pounding the proverbial table on for a long time. I think the company's momentum with new models as well as its huge dividend and stock that is cheap is a terrific combination. However, thus far, I've been proven wrong by Mr. Market. Ford shares continue to languish despite what I see as obvious evidence that the company's fortunes are improving. Ford reported full-year sales yesterday and the results were very strong (again). As we enter 2016 I have to think Ford is due for some buying but analysts for the auto industry aren't quite as sure. Ford reported that December sales rose 8% for the best December in over a decade as the entire industry continues to roll on. Ford's momentum has been due to the continued runaway success of the new F-Series and other, smaller roll-outs like the Mustang. Passenger car sales languished for Ford but it has never been a passenger car story; Ford is all about its utility and truck vehicles and that was readily apparent in December's numbers as well. Car sales fell more than 4% but as Ford's smallest segment, cars aren't particularly important. Utilities and Trucks rose 13% each which accounted for the 8% gain overall as Ford continues to exploit its market leadership position in that space. I don't like seeing car volume fall but it's not a huge deal either as long as the company's trucks keep moving and they are doing just that. In addition, volume rose 5% for the year, capping a year of terrific execution from Ford and - as I mentioned earlier - the roll-out of some really powerful new models. Ford has a deep reliance on its trucks for success and ordinarily, I wouldn't like a company that is so heavily concentrated on one product set. But when the one product is as good and as popular as the F-Series, I'm willing to make an exception. Even as Ford saw volume gains in 2015 it maintained higher ASPs as well, with Ford seeing pricing 2% higher on average. Really, what more could you ask for? Heading into 2016, Ford looks very well positioned to continue to see sales gains. While the initial flood of F-Series orders is behind us, the fact that it sold more than 85k units in December alone should put to rest any fears that F-Series was a flash in the pan in terms of higher sales. 2016 should see very strong F-Series sales once again if recent history is a guide and that bodes very well for the company's sales and margins this year. In general, sentiment on the automaker group is horrible. The big three are all trading at 6 or 7 times forward earnings despite the fact that all of them had great years in 2015. But the market is unforgiving and undoubtedly pricing in a significant slowdown in the sector in 2016. However, the data points suggest that a slowdown is not in the cards and that means Ford is once again cheap after selling off to under $14. Analysts are looking for just under 5% sales growth for Ford in 2016 and that seems about right. While I expect pricing momentum will remain due to the continued success of F-Series, it may be tough for Ford to replicate volume gains made in 2015. Indeed, after a year where the entire industry saw strong sales, Ford's 5% volume gain is probably not realistic for 2015. However, I do think it can hit 4.5% to 5.5% in total sales gains based upon both volume and pricing growth. That implies that analyst targets are probably about right in my view, meaning that upside from earnings surprises will likely be muted if they happen at all. However, that does not mean the stock can't be owned. Ford's forward PE of 7 is ludicrous (indeed, the entire group seems very cheap) as the company is producing mid-single digit sales growth and much larger EPS growth. Ford continues to see leverage on its cost base, producing margin growth in excess of sales growth. It is important to note that analyst EPS forecast for 2016 haven't budged in the last few months despite the fact that the stock has been hammered once again. The company's performance in the marketplace is not the problem; Ford's problem is sentiment on the stock. And that is where the opportunity presents itself as December and full-year volume numbers suggest that Ford's strong momentum is alive and well heading into 2016. That bodes very well for a stock trading for a headed-for-bankruptcy multiple and a ~4.3% yield. I recognize that sentiment changes in Ford (or any other automaker) will be hard to come by but the yield and the trough valuation mean that downside is likely limited from here barring a wholesale meltdown in the broader market. But upside is certainly achievable as nine times forward earnings is not out of the question should the company surprise to the upside in 2016. That would be something like $17 and on a base of less than $14, that's significant. Ford's future looks very bright and the stock's valuation is beaten down so I think now is the time to consider Ford. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Consumer Goods
