Carrizo Oil And Gas Shows Why It Has The Best Assets - Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRZO) | Seeking Alpha Even at $45 WTI, funding gap will be minimal. With crude oil prices as they are, drilling activity in much of North America's shale plays is no longer profitable. In its 2015 Analyst Day, Carrizo Oil and Gas (NASDAQ: CRZO ) CEO Chip Johnson quipped that, at these prices, he "didn't know how" companies in the marginal shale plays would be able to "make it." To get an idea of what Johnson was talking about, take a look at average breakevens in some of the more marginal shale plays.

Even in the strongest plays, drilling activity would need to be in the 'above average' areas, or the 'sweet spots.' Like all shale-focused E&P names, Carrizo has been effected by the bear market in crude oil, but the company has one fantastic trump card that many other E&Ps would love to have right now; the Eagle Ford Shale. While Carrizo isn't the amazing growth story that it was (no E&P company is), the company can definitely weather through this bear market. Unlike some of the increasingly distressed names in this space, Carrizo will not have to put any assets up for a "fire sale." Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations Since 2011, Carrizo made the decision to dump shale gas properties and acquire shale oil properties. Four years later, and despite a crash in crude oil prices, management still doesn't regret the decision. Today, Carrizo owns significant assets in the dry gas-rich Marcellus, the NGL-rich Utica, the oily Niobrara and finally the oily Eagle Ford. Of the four, the Eagle Ford continues to provide the highest returns by far. Let's briefly go over the company's other positions. Carrizo is essentially done drilling in the Marcellus due to low gas prices and a wide spread between dry gas in Pennsylvania and that of Henry Hub. Neither the Niobrara nor the Utica are very profitable with crude oil at this level, and Carrizo has minimized drilling in both of these plays. Fortunately, the requirements to hold mineral rights on these properties are minimal, and Carrizo sees no danger of losing land rights in either location. This year, Carrizo will run one single rig in the Niobrara. Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations. Eagle Ford Returns near 20% in the case of 20% cost reduction. In the Eagle Ford, Carrizo has every reason to continue drilling. The 'rule of thumb' for profitable drilling is a minimum return of 20%. With that in mind, have a look at the chart above. Carrizo has already achieved a 19% cost reduction in drilling and completion this year. Therefore, returns in the Eagle Ford should be somewhere around 20%, even with WTI at $44 per barrel. Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations In 2015 Carrizo is bringing its capital expenditure down from $858 million to $495 million, a decrease of 42%. Unsurprisingly, the Eagle Ford receives the lion's share of capital spending. Carrizo will have three rigs operating in the Eagle Ford this year. For most shale E&Ps in 2015, a 42% capex cut would not be enough to close the 'funding gap' between operational cash flow and capital expenditure. But Carrizo will outspend operational cash flow by only $100 million in 2015 (based on $50 WTI). Even most of that 'funding gap' will go away by 2016. Also, net debt to EBITDA will increase, but not by too much. Have a look. Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations This chart shows net debt to EBITDA declining over the last few years. With the collapse in crude oil prices, net debt to EBITDA has begun to climb again. Keep in mind, however, that most mid-cap shale E&Ps are expecting net debt/EBITDA levels of five or even six times. Carrizo does not expect debt to EBITDA to rise above four times until at least the end of 2016. Hopefully, prices will have recovered by then. Carrizo is one of the E&P stocks that didn't stay down for long. Already the EV/EBITDA ratio is back up to almost five times, though that number will be increased by much lower EBITDA over the next couple quarters. Is it a buy right here? Well, first of all, Carrizo is no longer a big growth play, although I suspect that it will be if WTI gets up to around $70 or $80 again. In the mean time, there is no dividend to tide you over. Buying Carrizo means picking up a prime piece of the Eagle Ford, but at a relatively high price. Remember, most other shale-focused E&P names have not recovered like Carrizo has. Because I don't believe WTI is going to significantly recover anytime soon, I believe that Carrizo will be 'sideways money' for awhile. Still, this name is definitely worth keeping on your radar. This company is definitely not going to face the turbulence that most other mid-cap shale players will.
