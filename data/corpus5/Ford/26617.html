Brighter Days Ahead For Ford's F-150 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford F-Series sales dropped 1.3% in 2014 as the company was busy retooling two plants for the 2015 F-150. Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickups have gained market share when Ford was struggling with F-Series inventory in 2014. Demand for the 2015 F-150 is very strong, and Ford expects to have adequate inventory to serve the demand by the second quarter. Ford's (NYSE: F ) U.S. sales volume took a beating of 1% in 2014 mainly because the company was retooling two of its key F-Series facilities for the new aluminum-bodied 2015 F-150. The F-150 has been America's top selling vehicle for more than three decades now and the F-Series makes up for more than 30% of Ford's U.S. sales. No wonder the 1.3% drop in F-Series sales in 2014 (first decrease since 2009) had a bearing on the company. In 2015, the F-Series' supply hasn't yet reached the optimum mark and sales of the pick-up truck has been down in both February and March. While Ford ramps up production to cater to the demand, rivals such as General Motors' (NYSE: GM ) Chevrolet Silverado and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE: FCAU ) Ram are gaining ground. Let's take a closer look at the reasons behind the dull F-Series numbers, how competition is shaping up, and the prospects for the new F-150. F-Series sales have expanded 13% on average since 2011. However, in 2014, F-Series sales dropped as Ford was retooling the Dearborn, Mich., plant for 2015 F-150 production. Retooling the plant not only drained millions out of Ford's pockets (around $359 million) but also ceased production at the facility for around 10 weeks. Ford sells more than 62,000 of these light trucks a month. It's said that the Detroit automaker lost approximately 90,000 units of F-Series sales due to the shutdown. After the Dearborn plant, Ford's Kansas City plant went into idle time from December 2014 until the first half of March. As a result, though F-Series started on a fantastic note in January with sales up 16.8% to 54,370 units (the best January figure since 2004), its supply couldn't keep pace with the strong demand and sales slipped more than 1% in February and 4.6% in March . Ford's VP of U.S. marketing, sales and service Mark LaNeve said the company had limited inventory for nine months that resulted in an overall sales slump. Out of the 16 models launched by Ford in North America last year, the aluminum-bodied 2015 F-150 is the most critical. Pickups are extremely popular among Americans, and the segment has been exploding - the top three best-selling vehicles in North America are pickups. In 2014, F-Series was as usual at the top , selling 753,851 units, followed by Chevrolet Silverado and Ram. While the F-Series sales figure is way ahead of competition (a lead of more than 42% and 71% over Silverado and Ram in 2014), Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickups made big gains in 2014 at the cost of F-Series, which was struggling with tight inventory. In September 2014, Silverado's market share rose 6.87 percentage points to 29% and Ram's improved 2 percentage points to 21.15%. In contrast, the F-Series' market share plunged 6.5% to 34.58%. For 2014, Silverado sales jumped 10.3% to 529,755 units and Ram sales improved 23.6% to 439,789. The first two months of 2015 also have been quite impressive with Silverado sales rising more than 24% and Ram at 10%. Silverado has been gaining market share consistently. Both General Motors and Fiat Chrysler are watching Ford's move toward aluminum closely. The demand for the 2015 F-150 would be a good indicator for the two companies to decide whether or not to follow suit. Ford's 2015 F-150 seems to be the most revolutionary and crucial makeover on the pickup so far. The extensive overhaul at the two F-Series production facilities shows how important the project is for Ford. Replacement of the steel-bodied truck with light aluminum alloy would cut the pickup's weight by around 700 pounds, improving fuel economy and enhancing hauling capabilities. It will help Ford comply with U.S. fuel economy regulations through the end of this decade. The all-new F-150 may cost $3,000 more. Ford's bold update to the F-150 is being viewed skeptically by many against the backdrop of falling fuel prices. This concern can be dismissed as response for the new pickup has been so overwhelming that Ford is adding 1,550 jobs at the Kansas City and Dearborn plants. The new F-150 is spending an average 18 days at dealerships before sales. This is almost negligible compared with an average of 105 days other light-duty trucks stay on \dealers' lot. For January, the F-150 was for just 12 days at the showrooms. Ford lost some market share due to lack of sufficient inventory. Company VP for marketing, sales and service Mark LaNeve has said that the F-150 would be adequately stocked by the end of second quarter (April-June). This will help the F-Series regain whatever little market share it lost. The F-Series is America's favorite - it's the best-selling truck for 38 straight years . From the initial response, the light-weight all-new F-150 seems to be a big hit with customers. Once Ford gets its supply to the mark, 2015 might usher in a new era of growth for the F-150.
