Ford Pricing In 0% Long-Term Earnings Growth - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford shares have languished in recent years. I think the recall and monthly sales issues are transitory. Automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) has been a hotly contested stock in recent years. The company continues to make lots of money during the bull cycle in auto sales but for some reason, investors aren't showing the stock any love. The company's shares have languished in a range for years now and are currently just above the midpoint of that range in the mid-$15s. I've been a bull on Ford for a while as I believe the new models Ford has launched as well as its very cheap valuation are catalysts for a move higher. That hasn't happened so far so in this article, I'll take a fresh look at Ford in order to see if it is still worth holding or if perhaps it is time to abandon ship. To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! , dividends, which I've set to grow at 15% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 8%. We can see the model has produced a fair value that is very close to the current price but in this instance, that is on purpose. I've taken Wall Street analyst estimates for 2015 and 2016 and entered them into the model but if you look closely, I've manually entered in Ford's EPS growth rate after 2016. The point of this exercise was to work backwards into whether or not Ford is worth holding at this point so instead of working out a fair value like I normally do, I decided to figure out what is being priced into Ford shares right now. That can then give us an idea of whether or not those expectations seem reasonable. As you can see, Ford shares are pricing in absolutely no EPS growth after 2016 at present. Basically, even with a risk premium of 8% - which is very high for a stock like Ford - shares are currently pricing in flat EPS after 2016. I find that to be ludicrous and as such, I still think Ford shares are very cheap. I can't see a reasonable scenario where this could happen and that is why I think those holding Ford should keep the faith. So if Ford is so cheap, why isn't it moving up? I think there are two things that are holding the stock back right now. First, the company's sales numbers ( May and April ) have been rocky. The fact that automakers' sales numbers come out every month instead of every quarter means investors have more real-time information but it also means the stock lives and dies on the numbers each month, introducing undue volatility. Ford has posted some very nice sales numbers in the past few months but it has also disappointed investors at times as well. I think focusing on each month's numbers is a little short-sighted when the longer term picture is so bright. The new F series is selling very well and Ford is showing strength across the board. I'm not worried about a month or two that aren't quite as strong as perhaps they should be since the ramp up in new models is still happening. The overall outlook for Ford's sales is very good and focusing on short term returns on the massive investments Ford has made is imprudent in my view. Over time Ford's sales will normalize at a higher level and that should remove this negative catalyst from the stock. The other problem Ford has is that it is issuing an enormous amount of recalls of late. In fact, just in the last month it has issued no fewer than seven new recalls ( here , here and here ) and that is never good for any company. Automakers issue recalls all the time as it is part of doing business but Ford has been recalling cars at a very rapid rate. This has caused some angst among investors as recalls all carry a cost but apart from that, those of us that are long Ford worry about the perception of quality among consumers. Recalls tend to elicit a negative reaction from consumers - as they rightfully should - because you want your car to be safe and reliable and constant recalls erode that confidence. This is something Ford must improve going forward if it is to reach long term sales targets. That said, I still think those two issues are transitory and that investors are focusing on the wrong issues. Ford's sales momentum is still solidly higher and it is making lots of money. It is slated to grow EPS at a double digit rate and yet the stock is trading for 8 times forward earnings. That is a ludicrous multiple for a stock that has so much going for it from the long side since 8 times earnings is usually reserved for companies that are shrinking. Ford is a very long way from that and if you think Ford can beat 0% long term EPS growth, perhaps it is for you. And by the way, the stock is now yielding 3.8% so you can get paid a very large dividend while you wait; that sounds pretty good to me.
