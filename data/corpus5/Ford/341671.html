Ford: The Long Thesis Is Very Weak - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The relationship between sales growth and share price is not very clear with Ford. Ford might have reached the point of growth where shareholder value gets destroyed. Management has a large impact on shareholder returns. Considering the current circumstances, I foresee no reason to invest in Ford. Ford (NYSE: F ) is an automotive manufacturer based in Dearborn, Michigan with operations and distribution in six continents and a financial services arm called Ford Motor Credit. Ford is a monster house, a true force of nature. Yet, from an investor's perspective, Ford hasn't always lived up to its expectations. In this article, I will explain what I believe those expectations should be. In specific, this article will look at prediction markets (a topic often neglected), how Ford performed during the previous crash, the relationship between sales and share price, and management and shareholder return. The world of Prediction Markets : the role of a Ford expert Prediction markets are often a little bit more unknown to common investors, yet an interesting concept to follow. They are virtual stock markets which can be used to leverage the thoughts of crowds, used for political elections for example. In case of businesses, one can use prediction markets to leverage employee knowledge. The question is: "is this useful?" This paper examines the efficiency of corporate prediction markets at Ford Motor Company. Ford employs experts to forecast weekly vehicle sales and the article shows that contemporaneous prediction market forecasts outperform the expert forecast. Make no mistake, the forecast of sales is an imperative task at an automaker: for production as well as procurement, this to minimize outlandish inventories. Yet, as we all know, these kind of forecasts are difficult and from an investor's perspective, one should even think about whether or not sales and share price are related. The initial findings of this article is that forecasts from prediction markets outperform other forecasts available to management, including, in the case of Ford, sales forecasts that are taken "extremely seriously" as quoted by the article. The important take-away here is that Ford performed 5 times better than Wall Street Consensus had anticipated while 2 times it was worse than expected. The other take-away is that Ford has the tendency to massively over-deliver with regards to results: The graphs above clearly prove the point that sales at Ford are highly cyclical which in turn makes them difficult to forecast by analysts. Ford: How does it hold up during a recession? How does Ford hold up during recessions in contrast to some of its peers? This is of interest considering the 'likeability' of a stock. The mortgage crash had Ford plummeting as follows: It's clear that Ford had a much stronger burn and rise story than its peers. On the other hand, the internet bubble tells a different story: Both recessions saw Ford plummet significantly, yet, only during the mortgage crisis, Ford was able to climb back up. Could management be a key driver here? Another factor worth investigating is management and shareholder returns. Let's look at the current and previous CEOs of Ford . Alan Mulally: September 5, 2006 to July 1, 2014 William Clay Ford, Jr.: October 30, 2001 to September 5, 2006 Return since inception is the share price return since the CEO took over. By looking at the numbers, it's clear that management plays a large role in shareholder success. It's interesting to see that both William Clay and Mark Fields shared similar appalling results. Rather than looking at the current fundamentals, which clearly point towards a cheap valuation ( with a P/E under 10 and a yield above 3%), let's look if profitability is a driver of returns. There is definitely some scientific background to growth, profitability and shareholder returns, but as this article points out, every firm eventually hits a point where additional growth destroys shareholder returns. I normally tend to ignore technical analysis, but sometimes it's worth having a look at the other side of the table, that is, the fundamental side. The price line underneath shows that from time to time, the share price moves in line with profitability, while after it seemed to already expect this continuous rise in profitability, yet that didn't happen. Lately, the share price has been declining while the same happened with profitability. If we extend this thought to analysts' expectations of Ford, there is not much to be happy about. Expected profit margins are not looking to improve much over the coming years: One thing investors sometimes forget is that blue chip stocks are mostly driven by larger institutional players and not driven by cheap valuations. This means that even though one large firm might have solid fundamentals, when an overall slump on the market is happening, every stock in the sector will drop, regardless of its fundamentals. Like, for example, during the last mortgage crash: Recent data tells us that most car manufacturers move together when there is a massive shock (like October 2015) which is fully ignoring the 'who is the better car manufacturer' firm. Furthermore, it seems that Fiat (NYSE: FCAU ), Renault ( OTCPK:RNLSY ) & Peugeot ( OTCPK:PEUGF ) seem to move much more in line with each other (on the positive side) while Ford, Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and Honda (NYSE: HMC ) seem to be paired on the negative side. Source: Orange Peel Investments Ford Article This obviously calls for some more investigation. Might there be some relationship between sales and share price? If we look back in time, that's hardly noticeable. Revenue actually remained relatively on par for almost 8 years while share price continued to drop: I am glad I didn't hold Ford between 2000 and the bottom of the mortgage crash. Moreover, I think it's fair to say that price and revenue are not a strongly correlated argument for a long-investment thesis in Ford. Sales growth is not a reason to touch Ford. On the other side, solid management is. The appalling figures presented by management (and presented to the management of Ford by form of prediction management) offset any potential gain through dividend. Even though a declining share price might make Ford a yield chaser, there are enough variables which should act as a potential resistance. Based on the last 15 years, I foresee no reason why Ford will become a cuddly stock for investors. This is typically one of those stocks which should be avoided in the case of an imminent recession, and depending on management might be a golden goose when we enter another bull market. Under current circumstances, this is purely a trading stock and not a value nor long-term investment.
