Seriously - Who Doesn't Like Ford? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's first-quarter 2016 performance set a number of records, and its auto sales pace in June was reassuring. The company continues to do well in China, and while concerns over Brexit and challenging conditions in Brazil and Russia remain, we think Ford is on solid ground. Our fair value estimate of Ford is $16, but there is upside to the high end of our fair value range. At 7 times 2016 EPS, it's certainly a consideration. Its cash balance is in excess of its auto-related debt, and liquidity remains robust. Bankruptcy risk at this time is minimal. Is the market too punitive on shares? We recently wrote on our website about some of the red flags we were witnessing in the US auto industry, including our concerns about the subprime segment of the auto-loan industry, but the automakers have still come a long way from the depths of the Financial Crisis. Ford (NYSE: F ), in particular, is a much wiser company since then, in our view, and frankly, it's hard not to like the company's product line-up and continuous drive for efficiency. First-half 2016 sales across the industry weren't bad (June was particularly good for Ford), and even the company's performance in China remains resilient in the face of uncertain economic conditions in the country. We like this automaker...a lot, and recent news was very welcome given somewhat concerning May performance. Ford set records almost across the board during its first-quarter 2016 results (see image above), released in April, and especially in the areas where it counts. Record company pre-tax profit and auto operating-related cash flow were solid during the period, and Ford more-than-doubled net income, operating earnings per share and its auto operating margin. Clearly, Ford is doing a lot of things right, and while we fully acknowledge the company is a cyclical industrial that is tied to fickle consumer demand, it may not be as levered to the boom-and-bust characteristics of its past--i.e. those that put GM (NYSE: GM ) and FiatChrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) into bankruptcy some years ago. Brazil and Russia remain under pressure, and the fallout from Brexit hasn't been fully realized yet, but Ford remains on solid ground, in our view. Here's the kicker. Shares are trading at ~7 times 2016 operating earnings per share (see below), and the company's cash at the end of the first quarter of 2016, ~$24 billion, significantly exceeds its automotive-related debt of $13 billion. Liquidity of more than $35 billion suggests bankruptcy risk is also arguable the lowest its been in memory. Is it time for shares of Ford to catapult -- or is the market still too jittery for consumer-driven, industrial cyclicals? What gives? We're keeping a close eye on the company, in any case. • Ford has been around since the turn of last century and produces and sells automobiles. The company also engages in other businesses, including financing vehicles. Recent performance has been its best since 2006. Sales in China have also been fantastic in recent quarters, though global economic concerns will always be present. • US auto sales have experienced a strong run as of late. 2015 was a record year for the industry in terms of sales, and Ford was not left out of the growth as it continues to capture pent-up demand from the Great Recession. Average selling prices have increased due in part to improved product mix. • Ford continues to implement its 'ONE FORD' plan successfully and accelerate development of new vehicles customers want. The company continues to have success driving operating margin improvement and has reduced North America's structural costs by more than $9 billion since 2005. • Though Ford has seen turnaround expert and former CEO Alan Mulally leave, we think COO Mark Fields is highly capable of running the automaker as the chief executive. The middle to late portion of the decade is looking quite bright for Ford Motor Company. Market share in China and sales of the F-150 are worth watching closely. • We like the firm's ability to generate strong automotive cash flow while reducing pension obligations. Ford now boasts an investment-grade credit rating and expects to maintain it through the course of the economic cycle. The best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Ford's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 4.1%, which is below the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of POOR. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Ford's free cash flow margin has averaged about 4.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Ford, cash flow from operations increased about 55% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 9% over the same time period. We think Ford is worth $16 per share with a fair value range of $12.00 - $20.00. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.2%, which is above Ford's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $16 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Ford. We think the firm is attractive below $12 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $20 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. We estimate Ford's fair value at this point in time to be about $16 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Ford's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $19 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $16 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.
