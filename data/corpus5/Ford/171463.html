Will Technology Growth Negatively Affect Future Earnings? | Seeking Alpha Advancement in technology, on whole, has always in the past served to improve living standards. Recently, advanced information technology and robotics have started to replace traditional service jobs. It is possible that future IT, robotics, and computing power advances will obviate the need for most human labor. Machines don't need an income and have no need to buy "things". There are two quotes attributed to the Ford family that serve as a preface for this article. The first quote is attributed to Henry Ford himself. In 1914, Henry Ford doubled the wages of the assembly line workers in his new, state of the art, automobile assembly plant to $5/day. This was about double the prevailing wage for similar jobs at the time. When asked why he did this, Ford supposedly responded, "The workers we employ to assemble these automobiles should be able to afford to buy one." While the exact language of the quote and even whether it was the rationale for the wage raise has been debated but the point of the quote is pertinent to this article. The second quote is attributed to both Henry Ford II and the then head of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union Walter Reuther as they were both touring a new robotic assembly line. Ford asked, "Walter, how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues"? to which Reuther responded, "Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars"? I also need to preface this article by "coming out of the closet" to borrow an overused phrase. I generally hold very conservative views with respect to politics, economics, labor, and most things financial. I would not have tumbled to the subject of this article were it not for a book I recently read as many of these issues fit squarely in a liberal progressive playbook. The book is titled "Rise of the Robots" by Martin Ford (2015). The book is a good read and covers a number of possible impacts of continued advances in IT and robotics including the possible negative impacts on continued economic growth. In the balance of this article, I'll summarize the main points from the book that long term investors may want to consider in selecting companies for long term growth. Wages for typical hourly workers in production and nonsupervisory roles peaked at $767 per week in 1973 after adjusting for inflation. A full 40 years later, that same worker group earns an inflation adjusted $664 per week, a decline of about 13%. This is in stark contrast to the 34 year period prior to 1973 where median household income roughly doubled from $25,000 per year to $50,000 per year. The chart below makes the point in terms of growth in compensation versus productivity growth. Source: Lawrence Mishel, Economic Policy Institute. (Readers will note that the chart above is more recent than the chart in the book which ends in 2013.) Despite productivity growth continuing on a fairly constant trend from 1948 to 2015, hourly compensation has not kept up with productivity growth after about 1973. Had wages kept up with productivity, the average annual income for a typical production worker would be about $85,000/yr versus the current $52,000/yr. While this outcome is good for corporations and investors in those corporations, it doesn't do much to maintain the purchasing power of those typical production workers. Fewer Jobs Created, Longer Recoveries, and More Long Term Unemployment Over the last 50 years, the US economy has created fewer and fewer jobs. It is important to understand the definition of "jobs created" means additional job numbers over last year or last decade. The decade of the 1960's created 33% more jobs than existed in the decade of the 1950's. The 1970's created 27% more jobs than existed in the 1960's . The following chart shows this trend through 2013. Job Creation Since 1960(click to enlarge) This graph might seem surprising given that the US Labor Department reports for the last couple years indicate that the US creates roughly 200,000 new jobs per month. While that statistic is true, in order to have a positive bar on the chart we would have to first recover all the jobs that were lost in the 2009 recession. The chart above only goes out through 2013. If the chart included data through 1st half of 2015, we would see a small bar in the 2010 decade. But, the point made by the author is still valid; job creation has slowed dramatically in the last 20 years. In addition to fewer jobs being created, the length of time necessary to recover the jobs lost during recessions has increased significantly. The chart below shows the number of months required to recover the losses in subsequent recessions. It is taking longer with every recession to replace lost jobs. This results in longer periods of unemployment for those who lost jobs, makes it more difficult for people entering the job market to find jobs, and pushes more people into the ranks of the long term unemployed. All of this results in slower economic recovery from recessions and anemic GDP growth during the recovery period. In the book, Martin Ford devotes a lot of pages to the issue of income inequality. Ford comes down on the side that income inequality is a significant problem now and likely to be in the future. Ford attributes the fewer jobs created following recent recessions and the longer periods required to recover lost jobs after recessions, in part, to automation and advances in IT. Additionally, Ford makes the case that automation and advances in IT have, in part, contributed to income inequality in the US and other advanced economies. The future argument Ford offers is that if income inequality continues to grow, the US could end up with a very skewed wealth and income distribution with most income being earned and wealth owned by the top 1% of the population. Ford's thesis is that continued growth in IT, robotics and automation is one of the potential drivers for worsening income inequality. Examples that Ford provides in the book include the automation of many types of manufacturing including heavy machinery and automobiles, mail sorting, packaging and shipping, harvesting of crops and lumber, and even flipping burgers. Today, most burgers are flipped by people. Based on Ford's thesis, the future of fast food preparation will require very little human input with preparation, packaging and sales all performed by machines and computers. Ford's conclusion is that, at some point as automation progresses, there will not be sufficient numbers of jobs (manufacturing, industrial, or service) for those that want or need one. When that happens, there will be negative impacts on employment, GDP and corporate earnings for many companies. Technology Growth Impacts to Earnings It has always been the case that growth in technology, IT, and automation has in the long run been beneficial. Income and living standards have increased steadily since World war II at least up to the 2009 recession (or 1973 if you buy Ford's analysis). However, Ford's argument is that, because a large percentage of US GDP and corporate earnings are dependent on personal consumption, we must have a healthy middle class with growing earnings to support our economy. If we get to the point where the vast majority of wealth and income is owned by a very small percentage of the population, aggregate corporate earnings will drop and GDP will drop. Wealthy people don't spend as much of their income or wealth, in percentage terms, as do the middle class. One could make the argument that, because we live in a global economy, there will always be a growing middle class somewhere to buy the products and services produced in the US. China probably comes easily to mind. Today, the single largest buyer of automation equipment and manufacturing robotics is .... China. Automation and robotics allow companies to produce better quality products faster and cheaper. Machines only require maintenance and repairs, they don't take vacations, they don't need medical/dental insurance, they don't need a retirement plan, they don't go on disability, and they won't take legal action against the company for being abused or harassed. Ford makes the case in his book that automation and advances in IT and robotics is a global phenomena not limited to the US or the G7 nations. Everyone is competing on a global basis. In the Introduction to this article, I said that I would not have thought about the potential negative economic consequences of widespread automation and robotics were it not for reading "Rise of the Robots" by Martin Ford (2015). After reading the book, thinking about the potential impacts and talking to a few colleagues, I think it is worthwhile for every long term investor to consider. To be successful as investors, I believe one has to have a good understanding of the pros and cons of any major trend that could impact the investments you hold. In the future, if Ford's thesis has any validity, consumer discretionary spending could soften and fall. I'd definitely want to be in front of that type of economic change rather than behind that curve.
