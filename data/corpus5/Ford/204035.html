Ford: Market Dislocation Creates Extraordinary Opportunity - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is being pummeled because of fears about China. But at just a fraction of sales, China doesn't matter nearly as much as investors think it does. Over the last few trading days, like most any other stock in the US, Ford (NYSE: F ) has been absolutely pummeled. The culprit has been a purported slowdown in China and a commensurate crash in its stock markets. Of course, the company is involved in selling vehicles in China, and investors have indiscriminately sold Ford shares as a result. But I'm here to challenge the reason behind the sell-off as a way to justify a much higher valuation for the company. As a note, all data for this article was extracted from Ford's most recent 10-Q . Below is a chart included in the Q that shows the Asia-Pacific region for Ford, which, of course, includes China. We can see that revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, and that as operating margins rose, so did pre-tax profits. One could assume that since China is slowing down, some of that revenue and profit is now at risk, and while that conceptually makes sense, I think the fears are overblown. Does a stock market crash mean people will stop buying cars? Perhaps it will on the margin, but for people who need a vehicle, they have to buy something. The same fear was present during the financial crisis here, which proved to be overblown, and while I agree that Ford needs to be revalued, I'd argue the revaluation should have been a fraction of what we've seen. Asia-Pacific (AP) provided $2.4 billion in revenue during Q2, which is just 6.4% of Ford's total revenue for the quarter. In addition, AP provided a tiny fraction of operating profits. That means that even if the company were to just exit China right now, the maximum drawdown should have been 6% or so. If we assume Q3 and Q4 will be rough in China, even if we assume a 50% volume reduction, the operating loss would still be moderate in comparison with Ford's total operating profits. North America provided $2.6 billion in operating profits in Q2 in comparison to the $200 million AP provided, so while a slowdown in China could be painful, the idea that the stock should lose a third of its value or more is ridiculous and reeks of panic to me. The thing is that China gets a lot of press and attention from investors in Ford, but there is no reason for that to be the case. Why do we care if the company loses 200 or 300 bps of revenue and a fraction of its operating profits? I don't want a slowdown any more than the next Ford long, but the reaction to China's slowdown has been asinine. I believe this market dislocation has created a fantastic opportunity in Ford, because when it reports Q3 results, we're likely to see a small drop in operating profits in the AP region, and perhaps then investors will understand just how cheap the stock is once more. The company's forward earnings multiple of 6.7 is likely lower than what it will actually end up being, but even if we write off China, Ford is still in the 7.5 range or so in terms of forward earnings. That sounds pretty cheap to me. The fact is that Ford has always been - and will always be - a North America story, and that region is plenty healthy. Sales numbers continue to favor Ford for the long term, despite a noisy but nearly meaningless slowdown in AP. Investors dumping shares at $12 and change because of China don't understand the company's business, and I think we'll see the stock higher into the year's close.
