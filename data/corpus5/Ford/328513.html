Credit Suisse sours on the Blue Oval - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Feb 24 2016, 08:50 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Credit Suisse downgrades Ford (NYSE: F ) to Underperform from Neutral. The investment firm assigns a price target of $13 to the blue oval. "We believe North American EBIT guidance is at risk on overly optimistic implied volumes and global inventories that have fallen meaningfully out of step with demand, while recent pricing/mix gains from new product launches in NA have been fully offset by material cost increases," reads the analyst note. The take from CS could underestimate the cost savings and momentum in the U.S. for Ford seen by many other industry watchers ( see the long case on Ford from SA contributors ). "new product launches in NA have been fully offset by material cost increases" This makes absolutely no sense. Aluminum, copper, steel and energy prices have gone the other way. ATP's are up. Where is the data? How can you have gm as a buy and F as a  downgrade. At the VERY bottom is a little statement. "The firm favors GM". That says it all. Make it up if you have to.
