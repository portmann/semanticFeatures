Ford Will Be Fine In Both The U.S. And China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha U.S. auto growth appears to be leveling off. Through selective and very moderate incentives, Ford should be able to maintain current sales growth in the U.S. Concerns about China's impact on companies doing business there have been widespread over the last week as the Chinese government moves to devalue its currency for the third day. Some estimates are claiming that U.S. auto sales are beginning to peak, but we're not concerned yet about that. Nor are we concerned about the domestic demand for Ford's (NYSE: F ) vehicles. As we've shown in our previous articles, demand for the company's flagship F-150 continues to be robust. We have a long-term long position in Ford, and as we've said, "we're not betting on the company having a great year this year, we're betting on the company's meticulous selection of capital allocation into select investments to fuel its growth globally over the long term." We continue to believe that Ford is a win/win because: 1. We have a very long-term time frame in holding the company, and 2. in the meantime, we're collecting the company's yield of almost 4%. We've been covering all of the news that comes out of the auto maker to see how it stacks up with our bull case on the company. Recently, we wrote about the continued demand for Ford's F-150 domestically, a sign that the company's "backbone" of sales remains firm. The question of U.S. auto sales leveling off has come up several times, and we think the company can handle this leveling off with incentivized selling if necessary (which it may not be). We are also happy to see the company's continued confidence in the long-term plan in China. Expanding from firm sales here in the U.S., most of our position is a bet on Ford's ability to move itself globally and position itself to major populous countries like China. Our argument is that the company's investments in these areas would help out in the future in the form of bottom-line improvement. Concerns about China's impact on companies doing business there have been widespread over the last week, as the Chinese government moves to devalue its currency for the third day in a row. We were happy to see Ford's executives this week stating that they remain confident in the long-term game plan in China and that they haven't seen any signs of worry. Ford Motor Co's head of global purchasing on Wednesday said the company remains "bullish on China " despite a drop in auto sales recently. "Longer term, we're still very bullish on China," said Hau Thai-Tang, head of global purchasing for Ford. Speaking at an auto industry conference in New York, Hau Thai-Tang said that Ford adjusted for expected lower volumes ahead of the recent downturn. But if there is a "prolonged period of recessions" in China, the company will make moves to balance supply with demand, he said, adding, "we don't see anything like that at this point." Our last article on Ford went on to detail some of the steps the company is taking in India to tap into the vein of compact vehicle sales. The company is playing into a tried and true strategy of lower cost engineering to help drive profit. Domestically, we'll take a plateau over declining sales any day. If the U.S. holds steady and Ford continues to execute globally, that's still a prescription for profitability. Profitability and the bottom line are the only two things that we've identified as catalysts for Ford's stock to finally start to march upward again. This reiterates what CEO Mark Fields recently said on the company's conference call: "There's a lot of discussion around the market being at a peak, but I really term it a plateau. When you look at what's driving the market, it's really around replacement demand. In any mature market, about 80% of the industry in any given year is driven by replacement demand." Selective discounting is a tool that auto dealers use in the same way the Federal Reserve uses lowering interest rates. When selectively used and not abused, it can provide bursts of stimulus to sales when markets begin to cool off. If abused, it destroys margins. This is still a tool Ford very much has at its disposal, hasn't used yet, and is still available. We continue to believe that as operating leverage begins to take hold, the narrowing losses and eventual bottom-line growth from Ford's international markets, backed by strong domestic sales, will be the catalyst that drives its shares higher.
