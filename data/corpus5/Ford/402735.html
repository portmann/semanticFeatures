Ford: Critical Investment Or Burning Cash? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford invested a little under $200 million in Pivotal. Unlike GM's investment in Lyft, I believe that there is some synergy. Pivotal provides the tools so Ford can go forward with its tech ambitions. This investment increases Ford's bet on tech. At a time when the company is trading for 6x P/E, is this the right move? The auto industry is a competitive space, and the focus seems to be shifting. The focus on efficiency is fading, instead, executives are all looking for the next big thing. As I mentioned in my article about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), innovation is the key to growth for technology companies. It would appear that in today's day and age, auto executives believe that innovation is what will drive their companies forward. At the start of the year, GM invested $500 million in Lyft, a partnership which I regarded as foolish and one-sided. Not only did GM throw away $500 million on an easily replicable business, it was also getting almost nothing in return ( Why General Motors Lost $500 Million ). This past Thursday, Ford (NYSE: F ) announced that the company invested $182 million in Pivotal , a software company based in San Francisco. Is this just money down the drain like GM's investment? You probably have never heard of the company, but I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that Pivotal isn't just some upstart that got lucky. Pivotal's origin can actually be traced back to the software giant EMC (NYSE: EMC ), which spun off the company back in 2013. If EMC owns it, then you know that there is at least some value, however speculative. So what exactly does Pivotal do? Pivotal is a "cloud-based software company," per the press release. However, it is not just your typical SaaS company (software as a service). Rather, it belongs in a fairly new service category called PaaS (platform as a service). If we think about the developers on one end and the end product on the other end, then PaaS is right in the middle (i.e. as a tool to make software). According to Pivotal's history of funding, the company has been very successful, having also received funds from Microsoft and GE. Pivotal is attractive to Ford because Ford (and the broad industry) is trying to marry car-making and technology. With the establishment of Ford Smart Mobility , the management clearly believes that embedding new technologies into cars will make them sell. From that standpoint, the Pivotal investment makes sense, as it would allow Ford to quickly ramp up software development by utilizing Pivotal's platform. Unlike GM's investment in Lyft, which I believe was an overwhelmingly negative event, I am currently impartial towards this move. Let's look at the positive first. While Pivotal's business is outside of Ford's comfort zone, Pivotal's business model does moderate Ford's downside somewhat. There is a saying in the business world that you should sell pickaxes during a gold rush rather than mining for gold. This is analogous to how car companies today are all chasing for a miracle app to boost sales (the gold) and Pivotal is providing the tools to them (the pickaxes). Because Pivotal's success is not dependent on whether its customers make a good software or not, it's business model is actually fairly low risk. As long as there is a general positive sentiment towards tech in the market, Pivotal will make money. Clearly the business environment is very good today, as we are seeing industrial "dinosaurs" trying to reinvent themselves by pouring money into tech. But is this a good use of the company's cash? If we continue with the gold rush analogy, Ford itself is no doubt a big buyer of pickaxes as management redoubles tech efforts. In a sense, Ford is getting a discount on the money that it spends on Pivotal (not the investment, but the ongoing costs), as some of the earnings will flow back to equity holders like Ford. However, given the company's low P/E ratio (~6x TTM), one could argue that this is not a good use of cash. If the management truly believes that the company is undervalued, why continue to pour funds into speculative ventures like Pivotal when your own business is on sale already?
