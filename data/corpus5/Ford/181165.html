Buy Ford As Volkswagen Struggles - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha News that Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ) deliberately hid software in its diesel cars to defeat emissions testing sent its shares lower, but creates a positive catalyst for other automobile makers. The reason is simple: VW will pay a big fine, but its reputation will take months, if not years, to repair. The distraction for management will benefit its competitors. Volkswagen admitted it cheated on emission tests in the United States. The financial costs are high: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") may fine the company up to $18 billion. This represents 33.6 percent of the beleaguered car company's market capitalization. The EPA will likely re-check diesel-fueled cars produced by General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ). The share price of both GM and Fiat fell steadily in the last year despite making progress in that time. Fiat reached a labor deal (tentatively) with the union on September 16. This removes an uncertainty for the company. Further, Fiat's sales in August grew by 13.9 percent, a strong year-over-year improvement. Shares of Ford (NYSE: F ) are struggling, too, but it is showing progress in improving sales. In Europe, where Ford struggled in over the last few years, sales actually grew 8.3 percent in August. The positive number is consistent with its outlook provided on the July conference call for its second-quarter results. Ford Credit in Europe will probably exceed break even again in the current quarter. The company also has new products in the region: We've had several new products launch in the first-half including the all new S-Max and the new Fiesta in Russia. And in Asia Pacific, we fulfilled our promise of 10 new plants with the 10th plant opening during the second quarter. Since VW's reputation of having fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars is damaged, this makes Ford's EcoSport more appealing. Ford tailored the EcoSport for Europe and India. It offers 4 of the 10 models with a diesel-fueled engine. In the trucking segment, Ford might finally report better sales for its redesigned F150. J.D. Power already rated the pick-up truck as an award winner. Ford experienced respectable sales in the second quarter, but it was still in the launch phase. This is why its wholesale units fell by 25,000 year over year. When Ford reports results on October 27, the company may surprise investors with good F150 sales. Ford's stock trades in a narrow trading range between $14 and $16. Looking ahead, problems at VW, ongoing low oil prices, and strong F150 sales are all catalysts that will push F's stock above $16. Low energy prices will entice consumers to buy Ford's big SUVs and trucks. Budget-conscious consumers interested in fuel-efficient models will consider Ford over VW. As sales improve for Ford over the next few quarters, investors will also earn 4.19 percent waiting.
