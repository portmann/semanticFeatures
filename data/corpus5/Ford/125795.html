Ford: Don't Worry About The F-150 Discount - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford seems to be losing momentum at the top of the U.S. light truck pyramid as its rivals are closing in. Investors might be thinking that Ford is offering discounts in order to extend its lead over GM, but there is more to the story that we need to know. Ford's discount offering has been blown out of proportion as its promotional spending is way lower than rivals, while the F-150's average transaction price has increased robustly. Ford's low truck sales are due to supply constraints, but the F-150 is now turning up twice as fast on dealer lots as compared to other half-ton pick-up trucks. At first, it might appear that Ford's (NYSE: F ) pick-up trucks are struggling. This is evident from the fact that the company is offering at least $10,000 in discounts to customers on the flagship F-150 pick-up truck. Now, this doesn't come as a surprise, since Ford's F-series of pick-up trucks are losing momentum at the top of the U.S. pick-up truck market, helping General Motors (NYSE: GM ) make a comeback of sorts. But, is Ford really struggling in the pick-up segment? Let's find out. Ford's F-Series has a long history of rivalry with Chevrolet's Silverado pickup utility truck. But, Chevy is closing the gap with Ford in the pick-up truck market, which is bad news for Ford investors as this vehicle category accounts for nearly 54% of total light vehicles sold in the U.S. by volume. The F-Series accounts for about 8% of the Light Truck sales in the U.S. More importantly, for Ford, it accounts for nearly 28% of the company's sales volume and 42% of its total light truck sales as shown in the following charts: This indicates that the F-Series pick-up is an important product for Ford. However, this year, the F-series has brought disappointment for the Blue Oval. Its sales have been lower than last year on an year-over-year basis for the last 5 months . As a result, sales of this product line have dropped 2.4% over the first half of 2015 as compared to the same period last year. In comparison, sales of the Chevrolet Silverado pick-up have climbed 14.6% during the same period, outpacing the overall pick-up truck market's growth of 10.3%. The following chart shows that weakness has crept into Ford's F-series this year: Ford seems to be the only one that's losing ground in the pick-up truck segment. In comparison, its nearest rivals are reporting steady growth and cutting Ford's lead in the segment. In this segment, Chevrolet is the closest rival of Ford. Chevy's Silverado has found a total of 275,822 buyers this year to date. At number 3 comes Fiat Chrysler's RAM truck followed by the GMC Sierra. The key thing to note here is that the sales of its nearest three rivals has increased, while Ford's pick-up segment is in the negative this year as shown below: Well, at first, the fact that Ford is offering huge discounts to move its F-series trucks, coupled with declining sales of the product line in 2015, indicates there is trouble. However, a key thing to note in the above table is the huge gap between Ford and rest of the players, indicating that the company will keep its place at the top of the ladder. As far as the sales drop so far this year is concerned, it is not a result of declining demand. Instead, the loss of sales of the F-Series this year is largely attributed to the tight inventory caused by the conversion of its two plants to build the all-new F-150 trucks with an aluminum body. The company estimated that both the factories were down for about 12 weeks, causing a loss of 90,000 units of production. This stopped Ford from supplying enough F-150s to match actual demand, which helped its rivals gain some ground. Thus, investors the low sales figure in the first half for the F-series trucks doesn't reflect the true picture. Looking ahead, it is likely that Ford will gain its lost momentum once again as the conversion of its plants is complete. Ford's factories are back to speed, and the company should have full inventories of its new trucks soon. In fact, in its June sales report , the company stated that the all-new F-150 is turning up twice as fast on dealer lots as compared to the industry average for half-ton pick-up trucks. Thus, Ford is aggressively building the stock of its F-150 at dealer lots in order to satisfy increased demand. Also, the F-Series' average transaction price has reached an all-time record of $44,000 per truck, up $3,600 from last June. This means that as more F-Series pick-up trucks hit dealer lots and sales increase, Ford will see an increase in its margin performance as well. Moreover, there is another story behind Ford's latest discount, and investors should not read too much into this. Ford is offering promotional discounts up to $10,029 on certain higher versions of the new F-150 to make up for the sales lost in the first half of the year and appease customers. But, the overall incentive provided to customers is down from last year as the truck is selling at the highest transaction price in the segment. Thus, in effect, Ford is spending less in terms of incentives as compared to last year, which is why investors shouldn't be making a big deal out of this. Additionally, Ford has cut 16% of its spending on marketing promotions in the first half of 2015. Ford's first half average promotional spending was just $2,736, while that of General Motors was $3,427 and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE: FCAU ) was $3,277. Despite this lower spending, demand for the F-150 has increased through the period under consideration. The problem was entirely on the supply side. In a tight supply situation, Ford gave first priority to its most profitable customers: retail buyers who look for loaded trucks. Instead, it kept the commercial fleet buyers waiting. This gave General Motors a big opportunity to tap into the void left by Ford. As a result, GM delivered 20% more vehicles to commercial-fleet customers in the first half of 2015, and its deliveries of full-size pickups to government-fleet customers "more than doubled" last month versus a year ago. Contractors, mining companies, oil-field services companies, and cable companies are the major commercial fleet customers who buy most of their pickups from Ford and GM. When Ford was not supplying, the entire share went to GM. Thus, it is not surprising that the gap between the two narrowed last quarter. But, as Ford's production is back to speed, the gap should start increasing once again. The transition from a steel-bodied version to aluminum has cost Ford market share. But, going forward into the second half, Ford expects its volumes as well as market share to grow on the back of strong demand and a superior product. For instance, the aluminum bodied F-150 is 700 pounds lighter, with the fuel economy increasing by 29%. Thus, driven by a better product and improving production, Ford should be able to improve the performance in its pick-up segment going forward.
