Ford Is Speeding Ahead In This Key Growth Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s sales in China have accelerated this year as the company has focused on key growth segments such as SUVs and luxury vehicles to drive growth. At the current pace of growth, Ford’s Chinese sales could exceed 1.1 million units this year, thereby topping 2015 sales. SUV sales in China are expected to triple by 2020, while the luxury market is anticipated to grow at 12% a year, which is good news for Ford’s strong line-up. Ford is on track to benefit from EV growth in China as 25% of its models will be EVs by 2020 since it plans to introduce 13 new electric vehicles. Although Ford (NYSE: F ) generates most of its revenue from the U.S. market, the ability of the stock to move higher depends on its prospects in other high growth markets like China and India. Since I have already covered Ford's India prospects in one of my previous articles, I will be focusing on China now. Last year, Ford crossed 1 million units in sales for the first time in China, with sales rising 3% over the preceding year. This means that China accounted for 15% of Ford's overall sales in 2015 as the company sold a total of 6.6 million units. Hence, it is evident that China is an important market for Ford, especially as auto sales in the country are expected to touch 30 million units by the end of the decade as compared to sales of less than 22 million units last year, growing at a CAGR of 7%. As such, it is important that Ford continues to make further inroads into China so that it can capture a growing share of this pie. More importantly, Ford is already making the most of the Chinese opportunity as its sales in the country this year have trended higher. Ford and its joint ventures in China saw a 5% jump in sales in the first half of 2016 over the same period last year to 564,647 vehicles. Ford's June 2016 sales were 85,105 units, or 3% higher than June 2015. Including the Lincoln brand, the Ford group's first half sales in China were up 6% to 577,097 vehicles. This clearly means that Ford is well on track to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year. More specifically, Ford's sales in China are being driven by its SUVs and luxury cars. The combined sales of the Ford EcoSport, Kuga, Edge, Everest, and Explorer, along with the Lincoln MKC, MKX, and Navigator saw a 27% increase over the first half of 2015, surpassing 150,000 vehicles. Among the individual achievers were the Ford Edge and the Explorer. Ford Edge saw sales of more than 50,000 units during the first half, while Ford Explorer sales increased nearly 50% over last year to 6,884. This impressive growth in Ford's SUV sales in China is not surprising as customers in the country are heavily favouring SUVs. In fact, by 2020, it is estimated that SUV sales in China will triple , recording annual growth of 13% a year. This is the reason why Ford has been focusing aggressively on its SUV line-up in the country. "Even as the pace of growth slows and the market matures, customers continue to respond well to our products, particularly our world-class SUV line-up.", said Dave Schoch , Ford's group vice president and president of Asia Pacific. Additionally, customers are also responding well to Lincoln's luxury sport utility vehicles. In fact, Lincoln saw an almost three-fold increase in sales compared to the first half of last year and surpassed even its full-year sales of last year in just the first six months. The luxury brand has sold 12,450 vehicles in China year to date, while it had sold just 11,630 vehicles in all of 2015. Again, the growth of Ford's luxury sales in China is not surprising either as demand for luxury cars in the country is anticipated to increase at the rate of 12% a year until 2020, indicating that the growth will be greater than the overall car market. Ford is moving ahead aggressively in the race to win over the Chinese market by modifying its vehicles to meet consumer preferences. The company made its intention clear last year by making its $1.8 billion investment plan for China public. All that money is going to fuel research and development in China over the next five years. The good part is that Ford has been able to impress Chinese customers already by modifying its vehicles to meet consumer preferences, and its investment in the country will lead to further growth in the long run. More specifically, Ford has been investing in the key growth hotspots of the Chinese market. For instance, it is directing its resources toward building a range of electric vehicles, particularly for China. This move on Ford's part is not surprising as the Chinese car market has the ability to adapt to new-energy vehicles faster than any other market in the world. A recent report from Renew Economy estimated that 3.8% of cars in China will be electric in 2020, up from 0.4% in 2014. Hence, Ford is planning to rapidly to capture this market. As a part of its strategy to capture the Chinese EV market, Ford intends to push up the EV mix in its portfolio to 25% in China by 2020 by introducing 13 new models. The company will kick-off its new EV models in China by introducing the Mondeo Hybrid later in 2016, with the C-Max Energi plug-in set to arrive early next year. Hence, it is clear that the major items in Ford's pipeline or its strategy are aimed at offering exclusive, "made for China" products. In my opinion, this is a smart strategy from Ford as it will allow it to maintain robust growth in the country. Ford has had a decent first half this year in China. Moreover, Ford's plans for China seem to be on the right track. The company is targeting the three key segments over here - electric vehicles, SUVs, and luxury vehicles in order to improve its performance. The strategy has worked so far in 2016 and as the market continues to grow, Ford could further improve its sales in China in the long run.
