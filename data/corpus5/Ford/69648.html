Ford: Africa Expansion Continues To Validate Our Long-Term Outlook - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Our long term bull case for Ford expanding globally remains in tact and we believe they are the clear choice for going long a U.S. auto maker. We wrote an article just two days ago talking about why we were invested in Ford (NYSE: F ) instead of General Motors (NYSE: GM ). The condensed version of the story is that Ford continues to invest in itself, rather than returning capital to shareholders in excess while its business remains "status quo" Ford doesn't have the major question of the ignition switch recall in the air Ford's valuation, while not as ridiculously cheap as General Motors, is still attractive to us. F PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts In addition to their low multiples, the market hasn't been able to aggressively move either equity to the upside (or the downside, for that matter) anytime recently. To put it another way, both companies' stocks are in a holding pattern. Ford is in a holding pattern because investors are waiting to see if the company's large overseas expenditures reap a reward. GM's shares are in a holding pattern while all of its contingent liabilities are sorted out. When it boils down to Ford specifically, we like that the company is spending its cash increasing its global footprint and trying to drive profits in its segments other than North America. The company's investments in countries like China and Russia, where it has built out infrastructure, are forward thinking moves by the company's management. They may cost a significant sum and burden the stock now, but as Ford once again grows into a global powerhouse, these foundations of infrastructure will allow the company significant operating leverage going forward. When we see an announcement like we saw this week, stating that Ford is going to continue to build out its operations in North Africa, we feel good because we know the company is pushing the ball forward. This in turn validates our continued long term bullish thesis on the company. Tuesday morning's news was that Ford had announced it will expand operations in North Africa with new offices in Morocco. In addition and according to Seeking Alpha, Ford stated it had "plans to launch seven new vehicles in the region this year and build out a local supplier network" and that "13 retail facilities are also slated to be opened in North Africa in 2015."

This article from early May details the progress they've made, Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday reported record sales and market share in South Africa, driven by a slew of new products and renovated dealerships. The Dearborn automaker said it sold 6,483 vehicles last month, up 24.5 percent compared to the same time a year ago. Sales through the first four months of the year are up 12.1 percent. Ford also posted a 16.3 percent market share and ranks second among all automakers who sell there. Three years ago, Ford's share was between 7-8 percent. "It really boils down to having great products and great dealers," said Jeff Nemeth, president and CEO of Ford South Africa. "We've really been broadening our product lineup." Ford has planned to introduced 10 new products in South Africa this year, and has already introduced the Transit, Transit Connect, Ford Fiesta and Fusion, Nemeth said. We have called an investment in Ford a win/win in the past. We've stated that we see Ford's future, as its valued today, to hold one of two of these win/win scenarios, They can either continue to execute their business plan slowly and steadily, the market will notice, and the stock will respond. We'll collect dividends in the meantime. The company can continue to move its chess pieces into place across the globe, as they've been doing, and wait for the proper moment to pounce and announce surging profitability across many segments other than the U.S. We are pleased with the progress the company continues to make globally. We are also hopeful that once Ford does begin generating substantial amounts of cash from its global operations, that it will start to deleverage its balance sheet. Once capex comes down and the company gets to this point, we can then ask the question of whether or not the company should be freeing up more cash for shareholders. For now, aside from the dividend, we're glad that question isn't on the table. As we've stated in the past, we think Ford is still at a jumping off point for global profitability and with the equity priced at just 9x of what Ford is expected to earn next year, Ford continues to look like a nice place to have some capital. In the face of the company's continued global expansion and the recent news that the company has moved into North Africa, Ford continues to be our preferred way to invest in the U.S. auto market.
