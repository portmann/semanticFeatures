Boeing's Segment Revenues Helped By Commercial Planes - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha The company increased revenues overall from last year by 11%. Commercial planes, which account for nearly 69% of total revenues, increased by 18% from last year. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) reported second quarter earnings before the market opened on July 22nd, and on the surface the results were great with the company reporting earnings of $1.62 per share (beating estimates by $0.25) on revenue of $24.5 billion (beating estimates by $320 million). The stock increased 1.3% after it reported earnings. Before I begin to parse through an income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement I like to check out how the segment revenues did and see if there was anything glaring. Below is a table on how the company did during the quarter compared to last year. Overall revenues were more by about 11% because of strength in the commercial airline portion of the company. The commercial portion of the business is growing globally due in large part to record airplane deliveries of 197 units. Commercial planes account for approximately 69% of the company's total revenues and it should come as no surprise that the strength of the company was witnessed because of this segment. The future continues to look bright at the company as $13 billion in net orders were tallied during the quarter with nearly $431 billion in backlog. The Defense, Space and Security portion of the company lagged by 3% from last year overall because the company was only able to deliver 54 aircraft and two satellites. During the quarter the company was able to procure contracts for their C-17 cargo planes from the countries of Australia and Qatar in addition to being awarded a contract from NASA for the first ever human space flight mission on the account of a commercial company. The international portion of this revenue segment accounted for nearly 33% of the revenues, signaling strong demand from foreign countries, specifically from the Middle East and Asia. The backlog in this portion of the company remains at $58 billion. Although the company reported revenues and earnings which beat estimates, it also lowered guidance. But that bit of news didn't seem to sway investors into negativity as the stock shot up 1.3% before the market opened. The company did buy back about $2 billion worth of shares during the quarter with approximately $7.5 billion left on their previous authorization. Overall I believe it was a solid quarter that the company reported but the defense side of the house needs some tender loving care. The company did lower the 2015 guidance no thanks to a KC-46 Tanker charge that it announced earlier in the month. Boeing is definitely accustomed to working under pressure to get new products out for delivery a la The Dreamliner. This is definitely a stock worthy of consideration for a portfolio but I don't think I will be adding it at this time as I feel the overall market is getting shaky.
