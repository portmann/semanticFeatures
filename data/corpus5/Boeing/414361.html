Get A 7% Income Yield With Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha A lot of cash is returned to the company's owners. High dividend yield and high dividend growth rate make Boeing attractive for income seekers. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) offers high shareholder returns to its owners, mainly through share repurchases, but also with its dividends yielding 3.4% right now. By utilizing an option strategy, investors can increase the income they derive from their Boeing shares further. Boeing's shareholder returns are high due to the fact that the company generates huge amounts of cash flows - this allows the company to pay out massive amounts of cash to its owners. Over the last five years, Boeing's operating cash flow has grown from $4 billion to $10.5 billion, free cash flows grew to $7.9 billion over the same time. Since Boeing's market capitalization is only $82 billion, this means that the company's shares trade at a price to operating cash flow multiple of only 7.8, Boeing's price to free cash flow ratio is 10.4. This means that Boeing's shares offer an operating cash flow yield of 12.8% right now; the company's free cash flow yield is 9.6%. What does a free cash flow yield of 9.6% mean? It means that Boeing is able to return 9.6% of the current share price to its owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases without accessing debt or the current cash position. When we include a small cash draw from the current cash pile ($8.4 billion), the company can easily pay out a 10% shareholder yield (dividend plus share repurchases). Right now the majority of Boeing's shareholder returns are stock buybacks ($7.8 billion in the last year), but dividends are paid as well ($2.6 billion over the last year). The fact that Boeing is reducing the share count at a fast pace is a positive for those looking for capital appreciation (obviously), but also for those looking for dividend growth: A smaller share count means the total dividend payments are divided over a smaller number of owners, thus the dividends per share increase at a faster pace. The effect of the declining share count (and thus a growing dividend portion for each individual share), as well as a rising total dividend payout can be seen when we look at how fast Boeing's dividend has risen over the last five years: A rise from $0.42 per share to $1.09 per share means a 160% increase in five years, or an annualized dividend growth rate of 21%. In combination with a 3.4% dividend yield, this high dividend growth rate makes Boeing an attractive income stock. By utilizing an option strategy, one can increase the income derived from Boeing's shares further: Selling call options on Boeing's shares one holds, the option premiums then serve as a second source of income. When we look at Boeing's option chain , we see that the June 2017 call options with a strike price of $150 are currently trading for $3.90 per share. Let's look at an example of how this can improve an investor's yield: Let's say you own 100 Boeing shares, which, using the current share price, means an investment of $12,700. With a quarterly dividend of $1.09, you can expect $436 in dividends over the next year (not factoring in any dividend increases). If you sell one call option contract (which means call options for 100 shares), you would receive an additional $390 right now, when using the above call option (expiry in June 2017, $150 strike price). Your total income over the next year would thus be $826, roughly twice what you get from dividends alone. Based on your $12,700 investment, you would receive an annualized income yield of 6.5%. The downside to this strategy is that your maximum gain is limited: If Boeing's shares trade for $170 per share by June 2017, you could not sell them for that price, but would be forced to sell them for $150. Your maximum gain, however, is still very sizeable: $4.36 in dividends over the next year, $3.90 option premiums and a share price gain of $23 would allow for a total gain of $31.26 over the next year (or an annualized return of 25%). Since the maximum capital gain is capped, this is a strategy that is primarily interesting for those who are looking for income from their investment. With the ability to roughly double the income generated from their Boeing investment, selling covered calls is a viable option for those investors. Boeing offers attractive shareholder returns, thanks to its huge cash flows, the company is able to pay a high dividend and repurchase a lot of shares. The dividend growth rate and the yield make this stock attractive for income seekers. By selling covered calls, investors can increase their income yield further, a seven percent income yield is possible, the only downside is that the return over the next year is capped at 25% (which would still be very attractive, I believe).
