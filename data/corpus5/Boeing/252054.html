Boeing: The Order Battle In October - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha October was a good month for the Boeing 787-9. Older Airbus A330ceo saw order inflow from China. The order battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) is one of the ways for Boeing and Airbus to flex their muscles, next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite the fact that the orders (in terms of value) are in no way a reflection of financial performance it is important to have a look at the order inflow, since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount, comfort, slot availability and efficiency. In this article I will have a look at the order inflow during October and have a look at their role in the narrow and wide body market. In October Airbus and Boeing, together, hauled in 90 orders compared to 127 in the previous month. Looking at the division of the orders Boeing can be marked as the 'winner'. Boeing received 59 orders, while Airbus received 31 orders. For Boeing as well as for Airbus October showed strong order inflow for their medium wide body products: Boeing sold 27 Boeing 787-9 airframes to Qantas, Norwegian Long Haul and El Al In October order inflow between narrow and wide body airframes was split 55:45. Wide body aircraft accounting for 45% of the order inflow is a strong sign and also bodes well for investors as wide body aircraft bring in more cash on a per unit basis. Airbus on the other hand received 31 orders: As part of a mega order CASGC finalized an order for 30 Airbus A330ceo aircraft Aviation Capital Group ordered 1 Airbus A320neo In October Airbus received orders from just 2 customers, but the jet maker will be very pleased with the order inflow for the Airbus A330ceo. The order means 3 months of production for the A330ceo and also signals an attractive mix of performance, capacity and discounts for customers in Asia. Figure 1: Infographic Orders October (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In October Boeing narrowed the gap with Airbus a bit, but the gap still is significant. Year-to-date Airbus booked 40% more orders than Boeing. Boeing received 647 orders, while Airbus secured 910 orders. After cancellations Boeing booked 568 orders, while Airbus is leading the way with 850 orders. With only 2 months left I do expect Airbus to win the annual order battle, but when it comes to deliveries Boeing is still way ahead. Boeing and Airbus saw satisfying order inflow for their medium wide body product No big orders for Airbus' narrow body family in October Airbus is likely to 'win' the annual order battle, but when it comes to deliveries (where most cash comes in) Boeing is still leading, making it an attractive stock.
