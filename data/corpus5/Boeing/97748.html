Boeing Cuts Rate For The 747 Yet Again, But It Is Not Time To Discontinue Production - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Rate cut is a sign of weakness of the current order book, but long-term prospects remain bright. Air cargo traffic is expected to have an annual growth rate of 4.7%. In one of my previous articles , published in December 2014, I wrote about the announced rate cut for the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 747-8 and concluded the following: In almost three years Boeing has cut the production rate for the Boeing 747-8 from two aircraft per month (24 aircraft per year) to one aircraft per month (12 aircraft per year), a 50% drop. The Boeing 747-8 depends on the freighter market, while the freighter market depends on global economic recovery. If recovery is not fast enough and order books are thin Boeing is forced cut back rates, as it did. The cut itself should not have a major financial impact, production rate are fairly low and the rate cut from 2 to 1 aircraft per month has been done incrementally. Boeing currently has 51 orders on file for the Boeing 747-8I, of which 33 have been delivered. This leaves 18 unfilled orders. At current and announced production rates this means there still is over 14 months of production for the Boeing 747-8I. There have been rumors that Arik Air, an African airline, converted its order for 2 Boeing 747-8I airframes to Boeing 777-300ERS. However, Boeing still has the order from Arik Air listed, so it is unclear what happened to this order but it is likely that the order has been converted . This means that there are 16 unfilled orders left. Russian airline Transaero has 4 Boeing 747-8 aircraft on order, but it remains unclear whether the airlines will take delivery of these airframes. In May it seemed Transaero would take delivery of their Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A380 aircraft, but in June Airbus confirmed that the airline is likely to defer those deliveries. If Boeing's 747-8I will suffer the same fate there are 12 unfilled orders left. So from the 18 unfilled orders a maximum of 6 orders might drop out of the order book. Korean Air will start taking delivery of the Boeing 747-8I later this year, which is a good sign for Boeing. For the freighter variant of the Boeing 747-8 there are a total of 71 orders of which 57 have been delivered, leaving 14 unfilled orders. At a production rate of 1 aircraft per month this is equivalent to 14 months of work. Combining the unfilled orders for both variants and excluding the doubtful orders there is still at least of 22 months of production in the order books. Including the letter of intent for 20 Boeing 747-8F , signed during this year's Paris Air show, there is still 3.5 years of work. The rate cut is necessary for Boeing, if the company wants to benefit from the growth that is expected in the cargo market for the coming years. The Boeing 747-8I has a unique payload-range capability, which means that as soon as cargo air traffic growth gets near the expected annual rate of 4.7% Boeing can expect orders for their Boeing 747-8I and Boeing 777. Additionally Boeing sold over 166 747-400Fs and those aircraft will be replaced at some point in the next decade(s) as well. So the long term looks good for Boeing and it is key to keep deliveries spread out over time to allow for order inflow to pick up pace. Rate cut is a sign of weakness of the current order book, but long term prospect remains bright Demand should materialize soon supported by growth in the air cargo market and replacement of the older Boeing 747-400F Boeing's rate cut has minor financial impact, but positions the company well to benefit from the upcoming boom in the cargo market.
