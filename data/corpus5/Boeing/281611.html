Boeing In 2016 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long BA. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. I finally bought the stock last quarter and so now need to focus on expectations and catalysts. I discuss recent performance but also a string of strong news in the last two weeks into the New Year. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) used to be a stock that I found myself constantly reflecting on and saying "why didn't I buy it THIS time?" On every meaningful pullback I considered a position, but never got in. Make no mistake, this aerospace and defense bellwether has created serious wealth for investors. It has provided capital appreciation and dividend growth and that is why I got in back in December . This was as the company raised its dividend and expanded its buyback. Both very positive for shareholders. But now was we enter 2016, we need to consider where the stock is going. The best way to do this, I think, is to have a look at recent performance as well as discuss any recent catalysts. The most recent quarter for which there is data is the third quarter , and this was a blowout for Boeing. The numbers simply crushed estimates. The company reported revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion on record commercial deliveries while core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52 as a result of massive success in most all segments of the company. The revenues beat estimates by over $1 billion and earnings beat by $0.30. Of course, we need to know a bit about segment performance to grasp this numbers, including expectations moving forward. The Commercial Airplanes segment saw third-quarter revenue increase 10% to $17.7 billion on higher delivery volume and mix, while operating margins were a strong 10%. Looking ahead for this segment, the company began final assembly and achieved power-on of the first 737 MAX airplane during Q3. In total, the 737 program has won nearly 2,900 firm orders for the 737 MAX since launch. It is important to note that the company's 777X program is on schedule for first delivery in 2020. Commercial Airplanes booked 166 net orders during the quarter. In the company's Defense, Space & Security segment revenue was a strong $8.4 billion with an operating margin of 12.2%. One of the key developments was that NASA extended Boeing's international space station contract in the quarter. The Global Services & Support Division was the only weak point in the quarter. Its revenue decreased to $2.2 billion due to timing of airborne control deliveries but its operating margin increased to 12.9 % on strong performance, so that is a plus. While the revenue is disappointing, for the longer-term the company was awarded a contract to develop and provide the next-generation communications system for the Australian Defense Force. Then, looking ahead, I want to know how the company is doing with orders and special contracts. In the last week there have been three real strong pieces of news. First, right before the Christmas holiday we learned that the company booked orders for 166 commercial jets in the week before the holiday, everyone for the company's 737 suite of jets. That is strong. Boeing, at that point had booked deals for 743 jets net through December 22nd. Then a week later on New Year's Eve, we learned that FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) committed to purchasing another 16 Boeing 777's. This is key, as the average selling price of each one is about $320 million. NICE. This totals more than $5 billion. This is a huge move for FedEx, as it already had 27 of the 777's dating back to an order for 31 made in 2006; 4 still remain to be delivered by 2019. The new order won't start to be delivered until 2020. Finally, just yesterday we learned that Boeing picked up another $855 million contract with the Pentagon. This contract involves upgrades and logistic support for the T-38C supersonic trainer aircraft, and this work will be completed in about a decade. This was key as Boeing beat out a competitor for this contract. All in all, it was a Happy New Year 2016 with this string of solid news. So what is the take home? I am very pleased with the performance from the last quarter. It was strong. That said, we care about the long-term. And we have had some great pieces of news on top of another dividend hike and expanded buyback. FedEx is a committed partner, and the Pentagon contract helps pad revenues. The long-term is where I am focused. I will revisit the name when Q4 earnings are released, along with year-end results. For the full year, core earnings per share guidance is going to come in between $7.95 and $8.15. Operating cash flow should be approximately $9.5 billion. Finally, revenues are to be between $95.0 billion and $97.0 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. I expect the company to come in at the higher end of these ranges. For 2016, expect the company to continue to chip away at its existing backlog and watch for continued orders to flow in. Note from the author: Christopher F.
