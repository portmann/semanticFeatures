Boeing's Long Run Prospects In China - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha China?s transition to a consumption-driven economy is contributing to surging tourist numbers. Despite a middle class population that is roughly the same as the entire population of the United States, China?s airline fleet is just one-third of the U.S. Boeing anticipates China to be the world?s largest commercial aircraft market in the future valuing China?s aircraft demand at almost US$ 1 trillion. Boeing expects China to triple its aircraft fleet over the next two decades, most of them single-aisle. Although Boeing is poised to profit from China?s growing aircraft demand, in the longer term, China?s COMAC could take market share in the single-aisle market. This article will look at Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) long term prospects in China. Please take note this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or non-attractiveness of Boeing as an investment and should not be used independent of other factors. With China's transformation into a consumer-driven economy, rising income levels and a swelling middle class have driven surging Chinese tourist numbers which are set to grow in the long run. Chinese airlines reported carrying 104 million passengers in the first quarter of 2015, a 13% increase from the first quarter of 2014. It is also the first time first quarter traffic exceeded 100 million. With the Chinese passport penetration rate standing at around 4% , there's good potential for further growth in Chinese outbound tourism. China is poised to overtake the United States as the largest airline passenger market by 2030 according to a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) . China's population is over three times the size of the United States, and its middle class population is roughly as large as the entire U.S. population , yet China's airline fleet is just one third the size of the United States', indicating ample room for growth in China's aircraft demand. China has about 2,310 commercial jets in-service whereas the United States has roughly 7,000; industry analysts predict Chinese airlines will add about 6,020 aircraft, mostly single-aisle over the next 20 years. Boeing projects China's fleet will triple by 2034 and expects China to add about 6330 planes to its fleet over the next 20 years. China is Boeing's largest international market accounting for about a quarter of airplane deliveries last year and China's importance is set to grow. Boeing expects China to be the world's largest commercial aircraft market in the decades ahead valuing China's aircraft demand at US$950 billion over the next twenty years. With solid growth potential in a duopoly-dominated industry with high-barriers to entry, the prospects for Boeing in China should be bright. Boeing and Airbus claim to have a roughly 50% share of China's in-service fleet. However, the dominance isn't expected to last . Boeing has expected competition from commercial aircraft manufacturers in Canada, Russia, China, Japan and Brazil. But Marc Allen, president of Boeing International and former president of Boeing China believes China's homegrown commercial jet made by China's state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) "is the best positioned to succeed" . The ARJ21 is a 70-90 seat, short-to-medium-range, turbofan powered, regional jetliner and COMAC has already built a backlog of over 250 planes so far from firms such as GE Capital Aviation Services, Shanghai Airlines, Lao Airlines, Air Congo and Myanmar National Airlines. Chengdu Airlines is expected to be the launch customer and is expected to take delivery of the first ARJ21 in late November this year and the plane is expected to enter service in February 2016. COMAC's C919 is a larger project and is a direct competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 single-aisle aircraft. A market outlook report by Boeing shows that 65% of the world's aircraft fleet was single-aisle and Boeing expects that share to rise to 70% by 2033. Of China's projected aircraft requirement of 6330 planes over the next 20 years, Boeing expects 4630 or about 73%, to be single-aisle planes. China's low-cost carriers account for about 8% of China's single-aisle aircraft demand and as the country's domestic air travel market grows that share is expected to rise to about 25-30% in 2034. The IATA's 20-year passenger forecast shows China will be the fastest growing domestic air travel market with a growth rate of 5.6% per year to 2034. For comparison, The United States is forecast to expand by 3.2% per year in the same period. COMAC's C919 has garnered a respectable 500 orders so far, mainly from local buyers such as Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, China Merchants Bank and China Industrial Bank. The foreign buyers include GE Capital Aviation Services and Bangkok-based City Airways . The C919 is expected to complete assembly this year but its maiden flight has been pushed back to next year, and deliveries of the C919 are expected between 2018 and 2019 . Hence, the C919 will not satisfy China's near term single-aisle aircraft requirements and even when the plane does enter service, it would need time to establish a reputation and build public trust over safety and reliability. Additionally, COMAC will have to develop its fleet support service infrastructure as well as be able to provide fleet support services from a distance; Boeing has decades of experience and a strong network in these areas. This suggests that while Boeing should enjoy solid benefits in China over the next five years, in the longer term, it is likely to face competition in the single-aisle segment and loss of some market share as COMAC gains ground. COMAC does not have a widebody aircraft and the company is currently working together with Russian aerospace and defense giant United Aircraft Corp (UAC) to develop a widebody jet. Under the terms of the agreement, first flight is expected to be achieved in 2021 and deliveries in 2024 . Overall, although Boeing may encounter competition and loss of potential income as a result of new entrant COMAC, given that China's market is valued at almost US$1 trillion, prospects in China are likely to be favorable for an established player like Boeing to capitalize on.
