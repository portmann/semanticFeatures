I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The fourth quarter was not kind to Boeing (NYSE: BA ). Shares sank as low as $115.05 on Wednesday morning in a knee-jerk reaction to their pre-market earnings release and they finished the day down just a hair shy of 9%. Both the bottom and top lines contracted compared to a year ago and there was a $569 million after-tax charge as 747 production will be slowed to a bimonthly event. The company had been producing 747's at a rate of 1.3 a month previously. That's a lot of money but in relation to Boeing, it doesn't move the needle much, just 84 cents a share on a stock that hasn't traded below $100 since 2013. There's a lot of reasons not to like these fourth quarter results, but let's be honest here: No single quarter will make or break Boeing. This is a company with a backlog that would take years to clear. They operate in a business that measures development times in years and an industry where product lifetimes are measured in decades. Looking at the full year, Boeing fared much better than the quarterly numbers suggest. Revenue set an all time high, rising 6% and free cash flow expanded 4.3%. The Commercial Airplane segment netted 768 new orders while making a record 762 deliveries, causing the segment's revenue to jump 10% over the previous year. For Boeing defense, earnings were up 5% on better margins while Network & Space Systems continues their work with NASA's Commercial Crew program. Still others cite the grim outlook when making sense of the sell off. Commercial airplane deliveries totaled a record 762 in 2015 but projected deliveries for 2016 are in the 740-745 range, which would mean an approximately 2.5% decline. Projected earnings per share were also much lower than the analyst average estimate of $9.43, coming in at $8.45 to $8.65. However, even the lower bound of that EPS range is good for a more than 12% expansion from the $7.52 earned per share in 2015. If you are disappointed with 12% earnings growth, perhaps your expectations need to be adjusted towards something a little more realistic. For 2016, revenue is estimated to be between $93 and $95 billion, which is a slight decline from 2015's $96 billion. Operating cash flow, on the other hand, is expected to grow around 7% to about $10 billion. Boeing's backlog is another reason not to fret over the future of the business. It measures in at $489.3 billion. With a "B." That's nearly half a trillion in revenue waiting for them with about 5,800 planes waiting to be delivered including nearly 3,100 orders for the new 737 MAX. If there's any question as to how Boeing will use all that cash, one only has to look to what the board did in December, approving a 20% dividend increase and authorizing up to $14 billion for share buybacks. Simply put, Boeing plans to shower investors with cash. When completed, those share buybacks could give a 20% boost to earnings per share. Repurchases could take two to three years according to management, but based on the current market cap of $78 billion at the time of this writing, that's enough to repurchase 18% of all shares outstanding. As for valuation, the recent slide has knocked Boeing's price to earnings ratio down to around 15 on a trailing basis, or less than 14 based on 2016 guidance. For comparison, the broader market is trading in the area of 20 times earnings. As for the top line, the price to sales ratio for Boeing has fallen to about 0.8 which is roughly half what the S&P 500 as a whole is trading at. Compared to the rest of the market, Boeing is cheap. The combination of positive earnings growth, dividend growth, share buybacks, relatively cheap valuations, and a stable business could give some longer sighted and more value-oriented investors cause to take advantage of any decline in the stock price.
