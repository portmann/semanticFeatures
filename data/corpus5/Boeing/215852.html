Boeing 787 Dreamliner - Backbone Of Norwegian Long Haul - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha 19 Boeing 787-9s orders by Norwegian have a market value of $2.7bn. Net orders for Boeing 787 increase 70% once deal is finalized. Norwegian Long Haul ( OTCPK:NWARF ) has chosen the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787 Dreamliner as the back bone for its long haul operations. The airline has won the 2015 World's best Low-Cos Long Haul Airline by Skytrax. Next to Scoot, a fully-owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, Norwegian Long Haul is the only low-cost carrier that operates the Dreamliner. Recently Norwegian has extended its order for the Dreamliner. In this article I will have a look at the order and how this influences Norwegian's fleet and Boeing's backlog. Norwegian ordered 19 Boeing 787-9 aircraft valued $5.0 bn at list prices. Additionally the airline has an option for 10 Boeing 787-9s valued at $2.6 bn. This would bring the total value of the order, when fully exercised, to $7.6 bn. After standard discounts the order value for 19 airframes is estimated to be $2.7 bn. Currently Norwegian operates 8 Boeing 787-8 aircraft, with the new order the airline now has 30 Boeing 787-9 aircraft on order. This means that once all airframes are delivered Norwegian's Dreamliner fleet will have increased a fivefold and can potentially even become 6 times as big when the options for 10 airframes is being utilized. The order shows Norwegian's confidence in its low-cost long haul operation and in the Dreamliner as a backbone of the long haul fleet. Year-to-date Boeing booked 52 orders for the Boeing 787, but had to scratch 26 orders leaving the jet maker with 26 net orders. Currently Aeroflot is looking for a way out of its contract with Boeing for the purchase of 22 Boeing 787-8 airframes and Air France is planning on deferring the delivery of their ordered 787-9 airframes. So although the number of net orders is positive for the year, there is some pressure on Boeing and the Dreamliner. Norwegian's order means a 73% hike in net orders for the Boeing 787 in 2015. Currently Boeing has 768 unfilled orders, of which 11 or 1.4% is destined for Norwegian. Adding the new order that yet has to be finalized to the Boeing's backlog means that the company will have 787 unfilled orders and would make Norwegian's share in the unfilled orders grow to 4%. In terms of production the order means an additional 1.5 months of production for the Boeing 787. If the option for 10 more aircraft is being firmed up this would give Boeing an additional 2.5 months of production. The order for more Dreamliners shows confidence in the Dreamliner for low-cost operation Order from Norwegian Long Haul is welcome, since Air France is planning on deferring deliveries and Aeroflot is seeking a way out of their deal with Boeing The order when fully exercised means an additional 2.5 months of production for Boeing Order inflow for the Boeing 787 has been low in 2015, but I do expect some additional order inflow in the coming months and expect net orders to pass the 41 orders of 2014. Every order that Boeing receives for the Boeing 787 now will return profit to Boeing. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
