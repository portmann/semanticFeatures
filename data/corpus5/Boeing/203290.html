Profit From The Rise Of Composites In Commercial Aircraft With Hexcel - Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) | Seeking Alpha Forecasted 9.12% CAGR for the demand of carbon fibre-reinforced plastics over the next 5 years. There is greater utilization of composite materials in modern commercial aircraft, over 50% of the weight of the aircraft in new Airbus and Boeing planes. The current combined backlog of Airbus and Boeing is 12,175 planes - a record level. Overview of the Market for Advanced Composites: A composite material, as the name implies, is made by combining two different materials possessing different properties together in order to create a material with specific characteristics that are not achievable by any one substance alone. A common example of a composite material would be carbon fibre - thin fibres of carbon atoms combined with a polymer resin (such as epoxy) to create a material with a very high strength-to-weight ratio. Using various manufacturing techniques, the material properties of a composite can be customized to suit specific requirements, depending on the application. As the understanding of composite materials has advanced, the potential applications for this type of material has grown significantly. The figure below shows the global demand for carbon fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) - from 2015 to 2020, the forecasted compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is 9.21%. The majority of this growth is coming from the aerospace and defence industry. Recent advances in technology as well as regulatory standards have allowed composite materials to become much more widely used in the construction of aircraft structures. Within this sector, the greatest market is in the commercial aircraft segment. With the push to make aircraft more efficient and to increase payload capacity, airframers such as Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) and Bombardier ( OTCPK:BDRAF , OTCPK:BDRAF ) are increasingly looking for ways to incorporate composite materials into their designs. The trend towards greater utilization of composite materials is clearly illustrated by the Boeing 787, in which 50% of the weight of the aircraft is derived from composites. The same story holds at Airbus, where composites now represent 53% of the weight of the A350XWB. The figure below, taken from an Airbus presentation, does a nice job of depicting the recent rate at which the use of composites in commercial aircraft has grown. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE: HXL ) is a leading advanced composites company that is well placed within the industry to take advantage of this trend. It is an international company with a presence in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Russia, with half of its sales coming from the US. There operations are divided into three main markets: Space & Defense: Focuses on military aircraft, satellites and space launch vehicles. Industrial Markets: This segment covers the automotive industry, wind turbines and recreational products, among others. The commercial aerospace market represents 66% of 2014 revenue, growing from 60% in 2012. This is illustrated in the below table taken from the 2014 10-K report: For each of these markets, the company separates its products into two segments: Composite Materials and Engineered Products. The 2014 Annual report describes these as: "The Composite Materials segment is comprised of our carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, resins, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, and honeycomb core product lines. The Engineered Products segment is comprised of lightweight high strength composite structures, molded components, engineered core and honeycomb products with added functionality." Airbus and Boeing, the two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers, are the largest customers of Hexcel, together representing 85% of 2014 Commercial Aerospace Revenues. Thus, the success of Hexcel is directly intertwined with the long-term ability of Airbus and Boeing to continue selling planes. As things stand, this is a good place to be positioned. The growth in the commercial aircraft market moving forward is expected to be strong. Deloitte, in its latest 2015 Global Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook , forecasts that annual production levels for commercial aircraft will increase by 20% over the coming decade. The current combined backlog of Airbus and Boeing as of December 31, 2014 is 12,175 planes - a record number, and roughly 9 years' worth of production time. Additionally, each new generation of aircraft increases its utilization of composite materials. The combination of these factors creates a strong tailwind for the advanced composite industry, and Hexcel is well positioned to capture this future growth.
