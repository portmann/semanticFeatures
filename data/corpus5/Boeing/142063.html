The Middle-Of-The-Market Jetliner's Merits - Boeing's 757 Replacement, Part I - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha The 2015 Paris airshow produced further insight on Boeing's pursuit of a new middle-of-the-market jet. Airlines are becoming ever more vocal in their need for a 757 replacement. Since the last 757 flew from the Renton facility in 2004, there's been a gap left in the medium-long haul market that is being slowly depleted by airliners with ever-widening operational flexibility. The resulting void is one that the current generation A320 and 737 families can't entirely serve and the A330 and Dreamliner can't serve efficiently. At the 2015 Paris airshow, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) announced that it is considering development of a middle-of-the-market (MoM) jetliner that can carry 220+ passengers up to 4,500nm. This initial article gives a top-level overview of the market opportunity that Boeing is considering pursuing with its next clean-sheet project, and summarizes key considerations for those considering long positions. Over the past 3 decades, major airframers have focused development on revenue-generating short-haul single-aisles and high-capacity long-range widebodies. Meanwhile, the expanse between these route sectors has largely been served by super-stretched narrowbodies and small, twin-aisles operating at the extremes of their efficient envelope. Boeing situated itself centrally in this window with the 200-seat, 7000-km range 757-200. Although unmatched in terms of operational ability, the aircraft's high capacity and thirsty powerplants worked against it as airport turnaround time became ever more critical and oil prices continued to rise. The post-2001 industry decline led the company to cease production of the 757, and no equivalent aircraft has entered service since. Since 2003, Boeing aircraft orders have increased six-fold [Figure 2], and a 757 replacement appears to be a project the company is considering once again. This would be a significant step for Boeing and a strong signal for investors, showing the airframer's drive to exploit new sector opportunities, as well as stand toe-to-toe with Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) on time-proven aircraft configurations. VP of Marketing Randy Tinseth has said the company sees a market for a 200-300 seat aircraft without the range requirements of the 787, placing the MoM concept at the base of the latest widebodies' efficient operating range and at the extents of the next-generation long-range single-aisle's capability. This is visualized in Figure 3, which shows a projection of aircraft availability in 2020. Figure 3 is based on personal research, and considers the efficient load factor to be 85-100%. Aircraft per-seat fuel burn, relative payload and max zero-fuel weight are used to estimate range limitations. The target market described by Randy Tinseth is well defined, dividing the aircraft families entering service between now and 2020. Head of Sales John Wojick stated that a Boeing MoM replacement would exceed the 757's range by 25% and its capacity by 20%. This correlates well with the 737MAX, which also achieved an average 25% range increase and a 15% capacity increase across the range in comparison to the 737 NG family, indicating an overall shift in market requirement, as opposed to changes in Boeing's concept of the middle of the market. The Airbus fleet currently being developed will serve regions of the middle of the market with the long-range A321neo and high-capacity A330neo. These aircraft have proved to be extremely popular, bagging nearly 1000 orders between them since their launch. However, for an airline such as Delta (NYSE: DAL ), which has placed a number of its 138 757s on transatlantic routes where passenger numbers are insufficient for a large airframe and the range requirement is outside of the A321's capability, the Airbus aircraft are inadequate. It's disputed if the A321neo can be stretched any further - the latest A321 can already seat 60 more passengers than the first A320 to enter service. The A330 can operate high-capacity medium-long haul routes very efficiently; however, its reliance on passenger numbers means it cannot match the diversity of the 757 and the A330's target market, which means there is insufficient fleet niche for Airbus to develop an MoM-specific aircraft just yet. It's difficult to predict demand for what is essentially a new aircraft entering a born-again sector. Airbus sees total demand for the MoM to be around 1,000 aircraft - not a long way from the number of 757s sold. What's interesting is that the combined Boeing/Airbus orders over the past five years are more than twice what they were in the five years running up to 2000 (the 757's prime). This trend doesn't appear to have extended to the middle of the market, and as a result, the relative demand for the aircraft has reduced. This could largely be due to the increasing versatility of the short-haul single-aisles and small twin-aisles that have entered service since the 757, and as a result, have contributed to airframers' hesitance to target this market. Boeing, however, seems to be indicating that a high share of the envisaged 1000 aircraft sales is worth the investment - particularly if development and technologies can be used as a precursor for the New Small Aircraft anticipated later next decade. If Boeing goes ahead with development of a 757 replacement, the project start and subsequent timescale will likely be driven by 777X project execution, developments in the company's New Small Aircraft concept and market response to the A330neo over the next 3 years. If the MoM jet happens, a long position executed before the 737MAX's entry into service could benefit from the high-rate 737 program, the long-term 777X program and the unchallenged MoM airframe over the course of a single decade. Figure 4 shows that Boeing's engineering teams have a busy 3 years ahead, where the 737MAX, 777X and 787-10 developments coincide; however, from 2019 onwards, the company's available engineering resource will be sufficient for the development of a new airframe. Some of the US's largest airlines and freight carriers, including Delta, United (NYSE: UAL ), FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ), all operate sizeable fleets of 757s, and the average aircraft age shows that the type maintains relevance in today's market, as well as security for airlines and investors in the airframe. Since the first mention of a 757 replacement, Air Astana, Air Lease Corp. (NYSE: AL ) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) have all been vocal in expressing interest in the concept. For a long-term investor, the MoM can be considered an aircraft with sufficient niche and demand for the next decade's market, from an airframer with engineering resources to utilize. My subsequent article will look further into the risk, potential design paths and anticipated performance of a Boeing MoM concept.
