Best Russell 1000 Industrial Stocks According To A Winning Ranking System: Buy Spirit AeroSystems - Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) | Seeking Alpha Ranking the top twenty Russell 1000 industrial stocks according to a winning ranking system. Explanation and back-testing of the "ValueSheet" ranking system. Description and a buy recommendation for the second-ranked stock of the system: Spirit AeroSystems. A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors. Portfolio123 has a ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems, I used one of them the "ValueSheet" in this article. The "ValueSheet" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; valuation ratios, growth rates, profitability ratios, financial strength, asset utilization, technical rank, industry rank, and industry leadership, as shown in Portfolio123's chart below. In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 16 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 6,651 stocks in the Portfolio123's database. The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 6,651 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the "ValueSheet" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown by the light blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 18%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 3.5% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 90-95 and 85-90) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful. After running the "ValueSheet" ranking system on all 127 Russell 1000 industrial stocks on July 20, I discovered the twenty best stocks, which are shown in the table below. In this article, I will focus on the second-ranked stock; Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE: SPR ). Spirit AeroSystems has been very successful in the last few years, and its stock has significantly outperformed the market. Year-to-date, SPR's stock is up 29.6% while the S&P 500 Index has increased 3.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 10.0%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2013, SPR's stock has gained an astounding 228.7%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 49.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 72.5%. However, considering its compelling valuation metrics and its strong growth prospects, shares could go higher. According to TipRanks , the average target price of the top analysts is at $61, a 9.4% up from its July 17, close price. However, in my view, shares could go even higher than that. Spirit AeroSystems is one of the world's largest independent producers of commercial aerostructures. Its core products include fuselages, pylons, nacelles and wing components. The company has long-term agreements in place with its largest customers, Boeing and Airbus. Other major customers include Bombardier, Rolls-Royce, Mitsubishi, Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter. I see high growth prospects for the company. Spirit has a strong backlog. At the end of the first quarter, the company's backlog was $46 billion driven by strong commercial aerospace demand. Spirit continues to drive the enterprise to find the most efficient and productive approaches for the rate increases on 737, A320, 787, and A350. In addition to investments to support rate, the company investing in automation projects of over $100 million. According to the company, these automation projects will return its investment in three to four years. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is the primary customer of Spirit. Commercial aircraft demand remains strong, and B787 and B737 production ramps. Boeing continues to benefit from strengthening demand in the commercial aerospace sector, as customers upgrade to more fuel-efficient and technologically advanced aircraft. In 2005, Boeing sold its Wichita Division and Oklahoma operations. The new company, Spirit AeroSystems, began the transformation from a single-source supplier into an independent global supplier with multiple customers and platforms. In connection with the Boeing acquisition, Spirit entered into long-term supply agreements under which the company is Boeing's exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita to Boeing prior to the Boeing acquisition, including products for Boeing's B737, B747, B767 and B777 commercial aircraft programs, as well as for certain products for Boeing's B787 program. These supply agreements cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. As such, Spirit will continue to benefit from the strong demand for Boeing's commercial aircraft. On April 29, Spirit reported strong first quarter 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by 0.08 (8.7%). Revenue grew 1% to $1.74 billion in the period, also surpassing Wall Street forecasts of $1.67 billion. SPR showed significant earnings per share surprise in the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.

According to 17 analysts' average estimate, Spirit is expected to post a profit of $0.97 a share, a 4% decline from its actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago. The highest estimate is for a profit of $1.07 a share while the lowest is for a profit of $0.86 a share. Revenue for the second quarter is expected to decline 4.8% year-over-year to $1.72 billion, according to 15 analysts' average estimate. There have been two up revisions over the last seven days. Spirit's valuation metrics are excellent; the forward P/E is low at 13.67, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 7.76, and the price-to-free-cash-flow is also very low at 14.83. Moreover, the PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.81. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.
