Summary FIA 2016: Boring But Meeting My Expectations... - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Order inflow declined sharply but met expectations. The bi-annual Farnborough International Airshow has started and traditionally the Paris Air Show, Farnborough International Airshow and Dubai Airshow are used as a stage to announce big orders. In this article, I will have a look at the order inflow on Day 4 of the air show and notable news items. In the coming days, I will be covering news and orders for Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ), COMAC, Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) and Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ). Boeing had no order news other than 2 orders for the Boeing Business Jet [BBJ] - the jet maker received an order for 2 Boeing 737 MAX 8 BBJs valued around $220 million. In total, Boeing received 181 orders and commitments valued at $25.7B. Boeing's reported figures are 182 orders and commitments valued at $26.8B. Market value likely is closer to $12B. Additionally, the UK Ministry of Defense announced a $2.3B deal for 50 Apaches and 9 P-8A Poseidons. If it was not for Boeing celebrating its centennial, this air show would not be one to go into the jet maker's history books. The order inflow was focused on narrow body aircraft, a thing that was to be expected. Little over 15% of Boeing's orders and commitments were for a wide body. More disappointing, however, is the absence of order inflow for the current Boeing 777. At the start of the year Boeing said it had 10-12 promising campaigns running for the Boeing 777, but none of those seems to have materialized yet. Airbus won business for 288 aircraft, 202 firm orders and 86 commitments. Airbus' reported figures are lower, but the values are the same: Around $35B. Aer Lingus ( OTC:AIRXY ) ordered 2 Airbus A330-300s Other news came from airlines upgrading their existing orders for the Airbus A321, showing the strength of the A321 model. Most surprising on the FIA'16 probably was the rate cut on the Airbus A380. Other than that, Airbus continued its trend of announcing mega orders. Changes made to previous order overviews. Arkia order for the Airbus A330neo that was first listed as firm has been corrected, since this a MoU. It is safe to say Airbus won this year's air show battle, closing the gap in the annual order battle. I am, however, not worried about backlogs seeing sharp declines. Figure 1: Order summary Farnborough International Airshow for Boeing and Airbus ( Source ) Airbus booked 70% of the orders, leaving 30% to Boeing. The Airbus orders are valued at $25.8B versus $13.9B for Boeing. Clearly, this was a win for Airbus. In terms of MoUs and LoIs, Boeing has won, securing over half of the order intentions. All with all, orders and commitments come nowhere close to 1,200+ orders and commitments during last year's air show. The order inflow during this year's show does meet my expectations and view on order inflow patterns. Order inflow is welcome, but for the troubled programs things did not get any easier after this year's air show.
