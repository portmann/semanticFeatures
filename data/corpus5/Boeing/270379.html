Amazon Is Squeezing UPS Out - United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital (544 clicks) Amazon is apparently in talks to lease 20 Boeing 767 jets for its own air-cargo business. This comes on top of Amazon purchasing thousands of truck trailers to transport goods across the country, announcing Amazon Prime Air, and rolling out Amazon Flex. It is becoming increasingly clear that Amazon plans to flesh out its own delivery system independent of UPS, and we expect this system to make significant strides in 2016. UPS will lose Amazon business at some point in time, and we believe that a large portion of this loss will happen in 2016. The threat of Amazon becoming a direct competitor with UPS for e-commerce delivery is a possibility considering Amazon's path with AWS. We recently wrote on why we feel the traditional package delivery market in the US is prime for disruption . Specifically, we detailed how portions of United Parcel Service's (NYSE: UPS ) business are at-risk as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) develops its own delivery system and the sharing economy provides a more efficient and quicker method for B2C intra-metro deliveries. Recent news suggests that this disruption may happen sooner than we initially expected. Amazon is apparently in talks to lease 20 Boeing 767 jets for its own air-cargo business. This comes on top of Amazon purchasing thousands of truck trailers to transport goods across the country a few weeks ago, announcing Amazon Prime Air (drone delivery) just a few days ago, and rolling out Amazon Flex (gig-economy-based intra-metro delivery system) in more than 10 metro areas throughout 2015. It is becoming increasingly clear that Amazon plans to flesh out its own delivery system independent of UPS. Considering the wealth of catalysts in the past few weeks, we believe that Amazon's delivery system is positioned to make significant strides in 2016. According to one cargo industry source , Amazon "expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a larger air cargo operation by the end of January". More or less, it looks like Amazon will launch quasi-full-scale air cargo operations by February 2016. This would make sense to us, and we think that Amazon will continue to squeeze UPS out of its delivery process at an accelerated rate throughout 2016. We think Amazon's delivery system will use a combination of Amazon-branded trailer trucks and airplanes to transport goods to and fro fulfillment centers and sortation centers, and Amazon Flex drivers to transport goods the final leg (to the customer's door). In essence, we see Amazon's delivery system being a hybrid of the traditional delivery system for intra-state cargo transport and a gig-economy-based delivery system for intra-metro package delivery. The infrastructure is largely there to support this sort of delivery to a significant portion of the US population, but some gaps in Amazon's current infrastructure create holes in the final leg of delivery in some regions. Amazon has an extensive network of fulfillment centers throughout the United States, and Piper Jaffray estimates that an Amazon fulfillment center is within 20 miles of 31% of the US population. While this is a strong network, it does leave some big blank spaces in the delivery process, namely all of Middle America. The Amazon Flex driver network will not support delivery of packages in states without a fulfillment center, so the final leg for rural deliveries is still something Amazon has to figure out. We think the most viable option for filling in these blank spaces is using Amazon trucks, but regardless of which route Amazon takes, we do strongly believe, given the company's recent moves, that Amazon will figure out how to get goods to states like Montana and Iowa without the assitance of UPS. At the current moment, Amazon's extensive fulfillment and sortation center infrastructure in the United States gives the company leverage in the initial steps of creating its own delivery system, especially in dense, metro markets. Beyond the infrastructure and capability, Amazon is strongly motivated to develop its own delivery system. Amazon needs to get a handle on its shipping costs as the company is scantily and erratically profitable. According to SA, leasing a Boeing 767F costs between $600K-$650K/month, while leasing a converted freighter jet costs $300-$325K/month. Going with the top-end in each range, leasing 20 freighter jets would cost Amazon $78 million per year, while leasing 20 Boeing 767Fs would cost $156 million per year. These are lease costs only and exclude fuel, labor, and other costs. Even if you throw more jets in there and add up all the labor and fuel costs, we do not see this total cost coming anywhere close to eclipsing the $8.7 billion Amazon spent on shipping last year. The motivations extend beyond just saving on long-term shipping costs. Two Christmases ago, UPS's inability to keep up with Amazon's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December 25 . This cost Amazon some money in the form of $20 gift cards , but more deeply, it affected Amazon's reputation (late Christmas gifts are never a good thing). A reputation hit at the hands of UPS likely inspired CEO Jeff Bezos to make creating an independent delivery system a priority. As a result, Amazon apparently began running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington, Ohio. Now, Amazon has (or will soon have) trailer trucks, planes, drivers, and drones at its disposal. It is no secret that Amazon is leading the e-commerce shift , so losing the Amazon business will hurt UPS both now and in the long-term as Amazon retail continues to grow. Although we think it unlikely to happen any time soon, the threat of Amazon becoming a direct competitor with UPS for third-party e-commerce delivery is a possibility considering Amazon's path with AWS. All things considered, Amazon leasing 20 planes is a big deal for UPS. UPS will lose Amazon business at some point in time, and we believe that a large portion of this loss will happen in 2016. The current valuation does not account for this lost business and the potential longer-running threat that the gig economy and drones pose, so we reaffirm our short position on the stock and believe 2016 will present several headwinds.
