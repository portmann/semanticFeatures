Verizon Communications Is My Favorite Idea That Everyone Knows, But That No One Understands - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha The market is bullish on Verizon: analysts say "Buy," funds are buying and the stock price is high. Bearish signals are being ignored: high Price/Book and high Debt/Equity. The saying is: "Go big or go home." So I am going after one of the big guys. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is part of the Dow 30 and it is on everybody's radar. - The analyst consensus recommendation for VZ is "Buy" - VZ is trading at 95% of its 52-week high and 92% of its 5-year high - Large value-oriented mutual funds are currently buying VZ. - VZ has a high dividend (DY > 4%) with a low Beta (.37) appealing to dividend seekers who think they are reducing their risk of capital loss Why the market is wrong about Verizon: - It is highly overvalued - the Price/Book is way too high! - It is carrying way too much debt - Debt/Equity is very high - The high dividends appear to be driven by a desire to boost the stock price rather than spending earnings on growth. The company is betting that interest rates will stay low. - Growth prospects for Verizon are not as optimistic as conventional wisdom supposes. Part 1. How does Verizon compare to its Dow 30 colleagues? Let's just look at the 14 companies on the Dow 30 list that analysts are currently recommending as "Buys." Let me introduce my personal formula for screening stocks. My approach, as a value dividend investor, is to initially look at the following four factors: 1. Dividend yield (DY). This is a key measure for people like me who want to maximize income. You can't get income with a low DY. Of course, DY has to be balanced with risk factors such as the following three ratios. I prefer a DY > 3. 2. Beta. A low beta is desirable (< 1 is best) since I want to sleep well at night and reduce the risk of capital loss. Some people use "Dividend Anchor Score" (which is DY/Beta) to screen for a high dividend payer with low volatility, but Anchor Score doesn't tell enough of the story. 3. Price/Book (PB). This is another key metric for me and I think PB is a better measure than PE of stock price inflation. I prefer a PB < 2. 4. Debt/Equity (DE). There are different ways to interpret DE. Some companies prefer to leverage their growth using debt, especially in these days of low interest rates. To me, that is a risky strategy, which only seems to work well for governments that print their own money. Again, I like to sleep well at night. I don't have debt so why would I want to invest in companies that do? I would rather invest in companies that pay for their growth with earnings. I prefer a DE < 1. Putting it all together, I use this formula. Stock Dividend Value (SDV) = DY/Beta/PB/DE Using my preferences, the minimum SDV = 3/1/2/1 = 1.5. Any stock with an SDV less than 1.5 doesn't make the cut. So let's look at the 14 stocks on the Dow 30 which currently have "Buy" recommendations. From the table, there are only 6 stocks that meet my SDV minimums: CSCO, JNJ, MRK, NKE, PFE and PG. By the way, I own shares in CSCO and PFE, but not the others. At the other end, there are a few stocks with truly dismal SDV's (less than 0.1): AAPL, HD and VZ. But before I slam all three, let's look at charts of Dividend Yield vs. the various ratios to see where these stocks fail. AAPL certainly sticks out with its high Beta, but so does VZ (in a good way?) with its high dividend yield and low Beta. So far it looks good for VZ. Now let's look at Price/Book. Verizon still sticks out, but so does Home Depot and Boeing. Now let's look at Debt to Equity. Now, only VZ sticks out. The charts of Dividend Yield versus the various ratios are useful, because they show where the differences are. Supposedly the Dow 30 stocks should be similar in these metrics. They are all big companies which should have evolved into similar valuations. For the various charts, there should be a cluster of points over a narrow range. Outliers should raise questions. AAPL is an outlier for Beta but is similar to its colleagues for other ratios. Home Depot and Boeing have high Price/Book values but are similar to the rest of the Dow for the other ratios. Only Verizon sticks out in all three charts. One in a positive way for its very high dividend yield (perhaps it's actually a negative) and two in a negative way for its high Price to Book and high Debt to Equity. Part 2. Qualitative evaluation of Verizon Since numbers are a snapshot and only tell part of the story, what is happening at Verizon that would explain the contradiction between the bullish sentiment and the bearish valuation factors? First, what do the numbers mean? Debt. Let's look more closely at the debt. VZ has a combined short- and long-term debt of $113 billion. Yes, that's right - 113 billion dollars! It's not as much as Greece, which has a $425 billion debt - but it is in the same order of magnitude! Is Verizon in danger if its creditors get tough or is Verizon too big to fail? The key question is - what are the prospects for VZ to service their debt? How reliable is their revenue stream? Stock Price. Stock price to book value is too high. Why is it this high? Is it because investors have a lot of confidence in the future of the company, or are they being led down the garden path? As per debt, the key question is, what will the future bring for Verizon? Dividend. Dividend yield is too high. Normally, I wouldn't complain about a high dividend, but since it is much higher than its colleagues in the Dow 30, we have to ask the question why? Why does Verizon feel the need to pay such a high dividend? Wouldn't it be better to use their earnings to pay down their debt or finance growth? The future for telecom and wireless companies is not certain. There are a lot of competitive pressures. Notably, the market for wireless plans is maturing and there will be more price competition as companies seek growth. Verizon has taken on a lot of debt to improve infrastructure. They currently have the money to service that debt with revenue of approximately $127 billion and an operating income of almost $20 billion. They have a net income of $9.6 billion of which $8.6 billion is paid in dividends (89% payout ratio). Management is expecting continued growth, but there are clouds (excuse the pun) on the horizon. In the last quarter (reported April 21, 2015), they had a net loss of 138,000 wireless phone subscribers, mainly due to lower priced competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. They had an overall gain in subscribers due to increased tablet registrations, but many industry experts think that the wireless market is close to saturation, with most people already having a phone and a tablet. Going forward, companies will gain customers by taking them from other companies. This will lead to price competition and the U.S. wireless industry could look a lot like the EU wireless industry where phone plans are half the price that they are in the U.S. due to high competition. Adding to the price decrease is the current pressure/trend in North America to reduce roaming rates. It is inevitable given the widespread availability of public Wi-Fi hot spots. So, there will be no easy route for Verizon to increase revenue! A revenue decrease is likely and it will not have to be very large in order to put pressure on dividends. To me, this is the most difficult thing to understand about Verizon. Why are they paying such a high dividend? The dividend yield is higher than their sector competitors and their Dow 30 colleagues. They seem to be using high dividends to push up their stock price. Why are they pushing up the stock price? Stockholders like it, but they usually don't decide what the dividend will be. Hopefully, the people that do determine dividends would be more incentivized by the long-term health of the company than by bonuses from short-term stock price increases.
