Boeing: Missed Opportunities - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha I share my story of missed opportunities. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) is a stock that I find myself constantly reflecting on and saying "why didn't I buy it THIS time?" On every meaningful pullback I consider a position, but never get in. Make no mistake, this aerospace and defense bellwether has created serious wealth for investors. It has provided capital appreciation and dividend growth. And I find myself once again in a situation that is all too familiar. I didn't buy when the stock was under $130, and this month the stock has started to come back on. On top of that, once again the company delivered a strong quarter. I would like to discuss the results and more importantly the outlook for this company. Is the stock still a buy even though its 7-8 points above where I last wanted to get in? Taken another way, how many times have I asked this question on the way up from $100, from $80, from $60? To answer the question we need to review the company's performance but also discuss where the company is heading. First off, the third quarter was a blowout. The numbers crushed estimates. The company reported revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion on record commercial deliveries Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52 as a result of massive success in most all segments of the company. The revenues beat estimates by over $1 billion and earnings beat by $0.30. Wow. Let's take a look at some of the sector highlights to get a feel for the outperformance. The Commercial Airplanes segment saw third-quarter revenue increase 10% to $17.7 billion on higher delivery volume and mix, while operating margins were a strong 10%. Looking ahead for this segment, the company began final assembly and achieved power-on of the first 737 MAX airplane during Q3. In total, the 737 program has won nearly 2,900 firm orders for the 737 MAX since launch. It is important to note that the company's 777X program is on schedule for first delivery in 2020. Commercial Airplanes booked 166 net orders during the quarter. Backlog remains strong with nearly 5,700 airplanes valued at $426 billion. In the company's Defense, Space & Security segment revenue was a strong $8.4 billion with an operating margin of 12.2%. But why? Well Boeing Military Aircraft performed exceptionally with third-quarter revenue increasing 15% to $4.1 billion primarily as a result of F-15 contract negotiations. The company saw some strong contracts in the quarter as well. The Network & Space Systems division saw revenue of $2.1 billion and its operating margin increased to 11.5%. One of the key developments was that NASA extended Boeing's international space station contract in the quarter. The Global Services & Support Division saw the only blemish in the quarter. Its revenue decreased to $2.2 billion due to timing of airborne control deliveries but its operating margin increased to 12.9 % on strong performance. While the revenue is disappointing, for the longer term the company was awarded a contract to develop and provide the next-generation communications system for the Australian Defense Force. Finally, like with the Commercial Airplanes segment, there is a significant backlog. Backlog in this segment was $59 billion, of which 40% represents orders from international customers. Commenting on the quarter Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg stated: "By continuing to profitably deliver on our large and diverse backlog, we are driving strong growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. Solid operating performance across our commercial and defense businesses during the quarter also supported our continued investment in innovation and our people, and our commitment to return cash to shareholders Three quarters of solid results and confidence in our continued operating performance enabled us to raise our revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year. Looking ahead, our teams remain focused on improving productivity and quality and delivering improved capabilities to meet our customers' expectations." I am very pleased with the performance this quarter. It was strong, and the stock should be moving higher on this news, but at the time of this writing shares are down 0.5%. That said, we care about the long-term. And the long term is where I am focused. With that, I feel like the market is discounting the fact that the company raised its guidance. Core earnings per share guidance for all of 2015 increased to between $7.95 and $8.15, up from $7.70 and $7.90. Operating cash flow guidance was increased to approximately $9.5 billion. Finally, revenues are now seen coming in $0.5 billion higher to between $95.0 billion and $97.0 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. Finally, the company is very shareholder friendly. During the quarter, the company repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion, leaving $6.0 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization. Year to date, the company repurchased 41 million shares for $6.0 billion. That is incredible. Further, Boeing also paid $0.6 billion in dividends in the quarter, reflecting an approximately 25% increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year. The stock yield 2.6% at its current price of $137.20. So what should I do? I'm going to buy. Even though I have missed my shot over and over, I think over a 30 year period, it won't matter if I initiate at $140 or $135. Note from the author: Christopher F.
