Boeing protests bomber award - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Nov  6 2015, 08:49 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) discloses it will formally protest the Air Force's award of the Long Range Strike Bomber to Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ). The company was debriefed on October 30 concerning why its proposal with team-mate Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) had not been accepted, but an internal review concluded there was extensive procedural basis for challenging the award and found the process "fundamentally flawed." I have always loved Boeing products. But when Boeing blackmailed this country over the Export-Import Bank, I lost all respect for Boeing and it's products. Another formally traditional, patriotic American company bites the dust.
