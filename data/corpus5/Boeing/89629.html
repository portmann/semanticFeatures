Production rates narrow body aircraft Boeing won over 200 orders for their Boeing 737 on Day 2, while this is a big number the orders only represent about 4 months of the production as Boeing is pushing the production rate beyond 50 per month in 2018. In order to maintain stable order books a book-to-bill ratio of 1 is required. This means that the order inflow matches the number of deliveries. With an expected number of deliveries of over 500 and about 300 orders booked this year, Boeing would need an additional 200 orders to maintain stable order books. In terms of value, Day 1 was the better day. The value per aircraft was $185 million, while on Day 2 the value per aircraft was only $112 million. This also shows that Day 2 was more focused on narrowbody aircraft. Day 2 was another good day on the Paris Air Show, especially for Boeing Over 90% of the orders went to Boeing and Airbus Most of the orders that were placed on Day 2 were from lessors Most of the orders that were placed on Day 2 were for narrowbody aircraft Aeroflot, that has been struggling lately, canceled its order for 22 Dreamliners The strong order inflow and market outlook also justify the higher production rates on the Boeing 747 Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
