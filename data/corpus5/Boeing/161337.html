ETF Hub Sep  2 2015, 16:39 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) reportedly delivered 14 of its 787 Dreamliners in August, exceeding its target of 10 per month for the second straight month and suggesting strong financial performance later in the year. The tally, likely to be confirmed by Boeing tomorrow, means the company has managed to deliver an average of more than 11 of the planes per month YTD, putting it on track to easily meet its target of 100 for 2015. The high delivery suggests Boeing likely is bringing in additional cash, since the bulk of payment comes when planes go to customers, and likely will please investors, who are closely watching Boeing's cash generation.
