Boeing's Dividend Boost: Another Compelling Catalyst To Consider Going Long - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing just bumped its dividend by about 20%. The company's first nine months of its fiscal 2015 are impressive. Valuations are reasonable, perhaps even more than reasonable if it finishes the year on a strong note. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) just upped the ante by announcing that it will be buying back up to $14 billion of its own shares, while simultaneously boosting its dividend by 20%. The company's stellar results so far this year add to the case for owning Boeing here. Valuations are reasonable as well, especially in an overall market trading north of 20 times earnings. The Aerospace giant has managed to grow sales by 9% for the first three quarters of its fiscal 2015. That's relatively impressive considering many other mega-cap multi-nationals have struggled to grow their top-lines this year. A very large backlog also gives some clarity into the future of the company's growth, and the future looks bright. I think the recent dividend bump re-affirms management's shared view of bright future prospects as well. Boeing provided guidance for revenues in the $95 billion-$97 billion range when it last reported at the end of October, with operating cash expected to be in the $9.5 billion range. It's also guiding towards $2.8 billion in capital expenditures, so free cash flow should come in at around $6.7 billion. That equates to free cash flow of roughly 7% of sales, which is inline with recent trends. Analyzing historical free cash flow trends and earnings quality I'd argue that converting 7% of sales into free cash flow isn't exactly exceptional, but probably average at best. Boeing's a company that operates in a relatively capital intensive industry, so this shouldn't come as a surprise. Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar Going back 10 years, we can see that the company has actually improved its ability to squeeze out more free cash flow from its growing sales over the last few years quite a bit. It's still not as abundant in free cash flow when compared to pre-financial crisis levels, however. Earnings quality is also adequate. Not only did operating income exceed net income last year, but so did free cash flow. Going back five years, this has been a consistent trend and I expect it to continue going forward as well. Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar While Boeing might not appear to be an above-average operation at first glance when judging it by its free cash flow, I'd like to examine it from another angle to illustrate why I'd argue that it's still a wide-moat franchise. Looking at Boeing's return on equity first, it clearly looks erratic over the last five years. Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar Asset turnover has remained relatively constant over the last five years, while margins have ticked up to around 6%. These two factors don't really explain the dramatic drop in ROE over the years, though. I'd chalk it up to financial leverage. Boeing's average financial leverage declined from almost 25 in 2010 to 11.45 in fiscal 2014. In other words, return on equity is still highly magnified by financial leverage, but not as much as it was in the past. Margins have actually improved, so I'd argue that the trend in ROE is actually towards improvement, despite initial appearances. Boeing Capital likely helps explain the high ratio. Boeing Capital is a subsidiary that provides asset-based leasing and lending services, and it comprised 27% of the company's overall debt (as of its most recent quarter). This debt isn't "core" debt and is attributable to profitable financing activities. Due to the high amount of financial leverage (and also the distorting affects of Boeing's recent buyback sprees), ROE probably isn't the best metric to look at in my opinion. I'd instead argue in favor of return on invested capital. We can see that the company's ROIC numbers are above average over the last five years and they likely easily exceed its cost of capital. Economic profits like this usually indicate an above-average, wide-moat company. Shares trade at around 18-19 times Boeing's guidance for 2015's GAAP earnings, and around 17.5 to 18 times what Boeing considers "core" earnings. Not exactly a steal, but likely reasonable. I especially think this is true now that the company has announced an extremely impressive capital return plan for shareholders. Shares trade at only 15 times expected 2016 earnings as well, and if the company continues on its current trajectory, I think the value case for shares now as a long-term investment can easily be made. Boeing also boasts a strong balance sheet, with roughly $9.4 billion in cash and only about $6.6 billion in core debt when stripping out debt from Boeing Capital and corresponding inter-company loans. The fast-growing dividend will account for roughly 55% to 57% of expected earnings, so that's well-covered too. Boeing is a special business, and despite its capital intensive-nature, it continues to generate excess returns and spread the wealth with shareholders. It also spends a lot on R&D each year (it's guiding towards about $3.4 billion for fiscal 2015), which continues to reinforce the barriers to entry that make it very hard for new competitors to enter its market to compete. I think that now's a good time to start layering in for the long term, especially if the company continues to post stellar results. The recently announced dividend bump should attract a lot of attention and could act as a catalyst for more investor interest, so I wouldn't be surprised to see shares continue to outperform the overall market going forward, either.
