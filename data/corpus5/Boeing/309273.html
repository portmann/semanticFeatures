Iran's Aviation Future | Seeking Alpha 16th January, 2016 marked a watershed moment for Iran, as the European Union (EU) lifted sanctions in return for Tehran's implementation of restrictions to its nuclear programme, as agreed in talks in July last year. Under the deal, negotiated between Iran and six powers - the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Russia and China - Iran is required to markedly trim down its nuclear activities and to remain under mandatory supervision for the next decade. It also include removal of thousands of uranium-enrichment centrifuges that are used to manufacture nuclear fuel, disabling the reactor core at its Arak plutonium facility near Tehran and shipping its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country. The lift in sanctions would release billions of dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets and re-open doors for global companies that have been barred from doing business in Iran. "The EU has confirmed that the legal framework providing for the lifting of its nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions is effective. The United States today is ceasing the application of its nuclear-related statuary sanctions on Iran," said EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, in a joint statement. Decades of sanctions, the earliest of which were imposed in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, have left the country with dilapidated aviation infrastructure and one of the world's oldest aircraft fleet. The age of the country's fleet, at an average of 23 years, is almost twice the international average. Air disasters have occurred with alarming frequency in the country. Since 1979, there have been 28 civilian aircraft crashes in Iran, with a death toll of more than 1,000. The lift in sanctions has prompted Iranian officials to start courting foreign investors and expertise to upgrade existing airports as well as conducting feasibility studies on new ones. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tehran is in talks with French airport operator, Aéroports de Paris, and French industrial conglomerate, Bouygues SA, to design and build a new terminal at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport. The imminent development would bring the airport's passenger handling capacity to 45 million passengers per annum. The country has also pledged US$250 million to modernise its air traffic management infrastructure. In the last few months alone, five new airspace corridors were opened, with more planned in the future. "Iran will buy a total of 80-90 planes per year from the two aviation giants in the first phase of renovating its air fleet," said Mohammad Khodakarami, director of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, at a conference in August 2015. "We will purchase planes from Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) in equal numbers." On 28th January, Farhad Parvaresh, Iran Air chairman and chief executive, signed an agreement with Airbus for the acquisition of 118 aircraft. The agreement, signed in the presence of presidents Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Francois Hollande of France at the Elysée Palace, is worth US$25 billion at list price and is the largest aircraft order by Iran since the 1979 revolution. The deal with the Toulouse, France-based plane-maker includes 21 A320ceo family, 24 A320neo family, 27 A330ceo family, 18 A330-900neos, 16 A350-1000s and 12 A380s. "Today's announcement is the start of re-establishing our civil aviation sector into the envy of the region and along with partners like Airbus we'll ensure the highest world standards," said Parvaresh. "The skies have cleared for Iran's flying public and Airbus is proud to welcome Iran's commercial aviation back into the international civil aviation community. Today is a significant step in the overhaul and modernisation of Iran's commercial aviation sector and Airbus stands ready to play its role in supporting it," said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus president and chief executive. Iran Air, the country's flagship airline, currently operates around 40 aircraft, with an average age of 25 years. These include several Boeing 747s as well as out-of-production models such as the Airbus A300 and the Fokker 100. The airline said it needs at least 580 new airplanes in the next decade, and 300 of those in the next five years. According to sources, deliveries of the Airbus order would begin as early as July this year. Despite its edge over rival Boeing in securing early aircraft orders, the Airbus deal would still require U.S licence approval, since more than 10% of its aircraft come from U.S. parts. Even though Washington has eased rules to allow US-based and foreign firms - Airbus included - to seek licences to sell civilian aircraft to Iran, so far Boeing and other U.S. companies have shown little initiative to take the plunge. Top aircraft executives have been quoted as being worried about the risk of sanctions being reintroduced if Iran fails to keep its promise to curb its nuclear activities, under a so-called "snapback" mechanism. If this happens, the status of deals negotiated during the interim becomes questionable. In general, companies in Europe have been more optimistic about the lift in sanctions than their U.S. counterparts. "In Europe it is 'Yes, unless...' and in the U.S. it is 'No, unless'," said Brian Mulier, partner of law firm Bird & Bird. "Europe dialed restrictions down from an eight to a four, while the U.S. went from a 11 to 9 on a scale of 10," said Christopher Swift, former U.S. sanctions official and lawyer at Washington-based Foley & Lardner. It was unclear how soon a deal with Boeing could be agreed. "We are open to buying from Boeing," said Iranian transport minister Abbas Akhoundi shortly after the sanctions lift. On the other hand, the Everett, Washington-based aircraft manufacturer is allegedly still trying to sort out an arrangement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control Rules regarding its dealings with Iran. "There are many steps that need to be taken should we decide to sell airplanes to Iran's airlines. For now, we are assessing the situation" said Boeing in response to the lift in sanctions. "The Iranian aviation market is open," said Ahmadreza Bayati Doosti, deputy for international cooperation at Iran Airports Co. In future, would Iran's aviation industry flourish and prosper, rivalling its Gulf neighbours such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, or would it flounder due to lack of investments despite the sanctions relief? Many with vested interest would look on with anticipation. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
