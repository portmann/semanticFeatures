Boeing: Are Low Oil Prices Providing A Tailwind To The 777 Instead Of The 787? (Part 2) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha United Airlines used a flexible fleet program to swap orders. UAL received almost $90 mln in discounts for its order. In Part 1 of this article, I made 2 comparisons to determine whether the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777-300ER really is being ordered as a replacement for the Boeing 787-9. The rather obvious answer is, "No". The Boeing 777-300ER has a larger floor space, and seats more passengers. The first 2 comparisons were extreme cases, using a really high and a really low seat count on the Boeing 777-300ER. In this article, I will make one comparison that better reflects the way United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) uses the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787-9. The ticket price for Economy Plus has been estimated. The prices for the other classes have been rounded off. Additionally, it should be noted that the Boeing 787 in service with United Airlines does not have a First Class. Comparison 3: Both airframes operated at a certain percentage of their capacity Manufacturers typically provide a fairly high "typical" configuration for their aircraft, so they can make the fuel economics of their aircraft look better. United Airlines has configured its Boeing 787-9 with 252 seats, while Boeing specified 280 seats. So United uses about 90% of the specified capacity. Figure 1: Seat division for the Boeing 787-9 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai ) Using these figures, the following results are obtained: It can be seen that the Boeing 777-300ER has higher revenue and profit, due to its higher capacity. On a per-seat basis, the Boeing 787-9 is at an advantage. The Boeing 777-300ER consumes 3.2 L per 100 passenger-km, while the Boeing 787 consumes only 2.7 L per 100 passenger-km. Figure 2: Financial performance of the Boeing 777-300ER relative to that of the Boeing 787-9 at 90% of the typical configuration (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) So again, the discounts that United obtained when it purchased the Boeing 777-300ER are not related to offsetting a lower profit. In fact, the profit is almost $62,000 higher for the Boeing 777-300ER. Assuming 1.5 flights per day and operations 48 weeks out of 52, per year the profit is $31 mln higher for the Boeing 777-300ER. Adding the $9 mln lower pricing of the Boeing 777-300ER to that makes for a $40 mln higher profit. United Airlines also uses its Boeing 777-200ER at 90% of the specified configuration, which shows that comparison 3 is the valid one. Based on the 3 comparisons made, we can conclude the following: The Boeing 777-300ER is too big to act as a direct replacement for the Boeing 787-9. The purchase of the Boeing 777-300ER has nothing to do with the fuel economics of the Boeing 787-9. United Airlines made good use of its flexible fleet program, and at the same time, received an extra discount on the Boeing 777-300ER. Boeing and United Airlines both seem to be happy with the deal. Boeing got another 1.2 months of 777 production, and United Airlines received almost $90 mln in discounts on 10 Boeing 777-300ERs that will help the airline increase capacity. In Part 3, I will approach the matter slightly differently by looking at the impact of lower fuel prices on the fuel economics of the Boeing 777-300ER.
