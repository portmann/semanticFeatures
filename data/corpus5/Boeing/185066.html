ETF Hub Sep 28 2015, 12:48 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing's ( BA -1.4%) first fully equipped KC-46A refueling plane completed its first flight on Friday, a milestone for the $49B program that has run into cost and schedule issues in recent years. It was the first flight of a fully-configured plane, although the first test aircraft in the U.S. Air Force program, a modified 767, first flew last December and has completed 150 hours of test flight since then. The KC-46A program now will run air stability tests, flight controls of the boom, and test the  plane's aerial refueling pods, which is expected to take four months. The Air Force is supposed to make a final decision next April; under the terms of the contract, Boeing needs to deliver the first 18 planes to the Air Force by August 2017.
