Boeing vs. Airbus Q1 statistics - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Apr 11 2016, 08:37 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor LOL! Airbus sucks, always has always will. Been on numerous planes of both types and prefer Boeing all the way. Funny how Airbus always seems to get more orders but Boeing provides more deliveries...goes to show you Airbus orders are pulled more often than from Boeing. Plus who wants to support an organization propped up by European countries...USA USA USA!
