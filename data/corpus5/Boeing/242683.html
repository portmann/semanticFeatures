Airbus's $1 Trillion Backlog: Why Bigger Isn't Always Better - Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSF) | Seeking Alpha Investors continue to be amazed by Airbus Group's tremendous backlog, which now stands at more than 6,700 orders. However, a huge backlog may actually be harmful for both Airbus and its arch rival Boeing. The two companies need to focus on delivering these planes and increasing their production rates, rather than just piling on new orders, which at last count will take more than a decade to work through. Over the past 52 weeks the Airbus Group SE ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) has seen its share price climb by more than as the company saw its backlog balloon to a record 6,741 orders as of 31st October. The European aircraft manufacturing giant is constantly battling its American rival Boeing (NYSE: BA ) in a contest many deem as the greatest duopoly to have graced the world markets. After a patch volatility in Boeing stock specifically over the past 6 months there are many investors who choose to side with Airbus stock, citing its mammoth orders backlog as a justifiable factor to stand behind the company. This is where I have to disagree with most investors because I can't help but notice that the company is severely underperforming despite what it shows in its balance sheets, and here's why. In their 9-month earnings disclosure Airbus reported a 35% jump in profits, year over year, to €1.902 billion for the 9 month period ended on 30th September, leaving an EPS of 2.42. What made this all really impressive to the average investor was that the Netherlands-based company boasted a $1 trillion backlog which showed no signs of slowing down as new orders kept piling on. On the other hand Boeing's backlog of approximately 5,700 orders is overshadowed by Airbus' figure. In other words, both these companies have enough work to keep them busy for another decade at their current production rates. What bothers me is that Airbus' earnings disclosure so far this year is not an accurate representation of the company's operating performance. Earlier this year the European aircraft builder sold its 17.5% stake in Dassault Aviation , the French fighter jet manufacturer, for approximately $1.8 billion. Through this transaction alone the company managed to recognize a net capital gain of €748 million which it incorporated into its income statement for the year and which I believe skews the market perception of Airbus stock. When we factor out this €748 million capital gain we get a true picture of Airbus' operations, which paints a gloomy picture for the European industrial giant. The fact is that Airbus has not only managed to deliver far fewer planes than Boeing but even with its capital gains incorporated in its net earnings it still has worse profit margin than its American counterpart. Deliveries are where aircraft manufacturers actually realize the majority of their earnings from a deal. More importantly a huge backlog is not necessarily a beneficial factor for either company since adverse macroeconomic conditions can bring about setbacks in deliveries which may significantly erode net earnings. Even if demand for planes slows down Airbus is at a greater disadvantage than Boeing because of stricter labor laws and unions in Europe which will hamper any downsizing or cost reduction programs. Of course Boeing itself isn't immune to the fury of its own labor unions, which was especially evident earlier this year when the Chicago-based company agreed to open a plant in China only to have the head of its largest union vowing step up confrontation over the new Chinese plants if it meant cutting jobs back home in Washington. Things did eventually calm down once Boeing's chief executive assured workers that Chinese facility would not bring about any related job cuts in the US. While both companies continue to pile on orders, only one of them is seriously focusing towards improving its production rate. Unfortunately it's not Airbus. Boeing is on track to deliver 755-760 planes by the end of this year, having sped up its production process at the Seattle factory where the company automated the process to develop wings for the 737 which reduces manufacturing time by 30%. This new automated process will turn out to be a blessing for Boeing and its foray into the highly competitive single aisle plane market with its 737 series. Up till now, Airbus' A320 Family is the world's best-selling single aisle product line with over 12,200 orders since the launch and more than 6,500 aircrafts delivered to various operators worldwide. But like I said, deliveries matter as much as the order's backlog as uncertain macroeconomic conditions can turn this boon into a bane over time. *Production rate to increase to 52 planes a month by end of Fiscal 2018 The graph above illustrates Boeing and Airbus' single aisle plane production rates at their current and forecasted rates (according to the companies themselves). For the benefit of understanding the outcome I've simply taken into account the most optimistic yet achievable numbers for the forecasts. At the same time this chart excludes any new orders the two companies might take up post 2015. So at current forecasted rates five years from now Boeing will have cleared its 2,900 orders, and some more. In the same timeframe Airbus will have only reduced its A320 backlog by a mere 30%. This huge remaining backlog of 8,592 planes by the end of 2020 is going to be a burden on Airbus' shoulders if the company fails to materialize any significant hike in delivery rates. Both companies will obviously take on new orders in the coming years, especially considering the fact that China is going to be massive source of demand for single aisled planes. Whichever company manages to scale up their production rates will also end up reaping the benefits of economies of scale, which when applied to the colossal aircraft manufacturing industry turns out to be worth billions of dollars. As of 31st October Airbus delivered 491 planes this year to 81 different customers while Boeing's deliveries as October stand at 638. This race needs to be reevaluated by long term investors who consider getting into aerospace stocks, focusing more on deliveries and operational efficiency instead of just looking at the bottom line.
