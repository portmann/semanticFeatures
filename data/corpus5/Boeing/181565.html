Boeing As A Value Play - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is seen strong demand as a result of population growth in Asia especially. While the tanker issue hit EPS fairly hard, it looks like a temporary issue. While there are few certainties in global macro-economics, there is one demographic trend on which we can pretty much count: in Asia especially, it is likely that population growth will continue. This benefits a large number of industries, including transportation. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has shown its ability to effectively capitalize on this demographic trend, and is selling lots of airplanes to customers across the continent. Combined with quite reasonable multiples, the stock looks like it offers a lot of value at the moment, especially to investors looking for exposure to Asian population growth. A brief look at Boeing's press releases over the last few months shows where demand for its airplanes is coming from. Countries like Korea, Thailand and China especially are all scaling up purchases of airplanes, with the fuel-efficient 737 especially seeing very strong demand on domestic as well as international routes. According to Boeing, Chinese demand alone could top $1 trillion. This strong demand is translating into healthy and sustainable top line growth for the American plane maker. Between 2010 and 2014, Boeing saw revenue increase by around 41%, and net income rise by nearly 65%. Whereas other big US industrial firms like Caterpillar are currently struggling with slowing demand as a result of weakness in commodity markets, Boeing seems to be so far unaffected by the Chinese slowdown. For its latest report, backlogs remained solid at around $489 billion on 5,700 commercial orders, although the figure was down a bit compared to the beginning of the quarter. Revenue continued to march higher, up 11% to a record high of $24.5 billion and beating the analyst consensus. Meanwhile, last quarter's negative $486 million free cash flow was bent into a positive $2.61 billion. However, not all was rosy in terms of bottom line performance. Q2 GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS fell by 29% and 33% respectively for the period, largely as a result of a $536 million or $0.77 per share charge related to the KC-46 tanker. After edging out Europe's Airbus for the contract, the program ran into considerably higher than expected costs, as things like wiring and fuel systems proved problematic for the new air force tanker. This led Boeing to also adjust its guidance for the year down, now expecting to make between $7.60 and $7.80 per share versus a previous range of $8.10 to $8.30 per share. Operating margin is now seen at around 9% versus a previous 9.5%-10%. Still, this looks like a temporary problem, and Boeing still intends to make about $50 billion off the new tanker from US air force demand around $30 billion from international demand. At the moment, Boeing trades at 18.5 times trailing earnings, considerably lower than the 35 industry average as well as the 21.4 sector average, according to Reuters. It also sits fairly comfortably between its 5-year P/E high of 22.88 and the low of 13.76. The price-to-sales paints a similar picture, fairly low at 0.97 and certainly lower than a 4.13 industry average. Meanwhile, the forward P/E of 14 looks enticing indeed. While the PEG ratio of 1.58 is slightly higher than I would like to see it, it is again below that of competitors, while the stock generally offers a decent dividend yield currently at 2.67% at a 44.55% payout ratio. In summary, Boeing looks fairly inexpensive at the moment compared to the continued growth we can expect as a result of population growth in Asia. Boeing is benefiting from an expanding population in Asia especially, which is driving demand for transportation. China alone might be good for $1 trillion in business. The company's 737 model especially is being snapped up at a solid rate, and we can expect this trend to continue as population growth in many parts of the continent ticks higher. Although the bottom line took a hit as a result of charges related to the company's new tanker program, this seems like a temporary issue, and the stock's valuation leaves more room for upside on multiple expansion as well as future EPS growth.
