China's Fast-Growing Airliner Market: Airbus Or Boeing? - Airbus Group SE ADR (OTCMKTS:EADSY) | Seeking Alpha China is the fastest growing market for airliners worth $1000B. Boeing and Airbus divide the market, but Airbus has the advantage for now. China will play Boeing and Airbus against each other. Future orders and developments will indicate who will become market leader. The Chinese airliner market will grow into the largest in the world. Although the U.S. and Europe are still the biggest markets now, the fastest growing is China. Replacements and new orders will be worth $1000B over the next 20 years. Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) divide the market. Fleet age and connections with China's state-owned aviation industry indicate that Airbus has the advantage for now. But China will play Airbus and Boeing for its own advantage. New orders and developments will indicate who will become the future market leader. Important indicators are: What will the state-owned airlines order? What will the Low Cost Carriers order? Will the capacity of new airliners grow? Airbus A321 versus Boeing 737 MAX 200? In absolute numbers the U.S. and Europe are still the largest markets for air travel. China is increasing but is a distant third. The relative numbers tell a different story. China is growing much faster than the other regions. The rise in the Arab world is the hub-strategy employed by the United Arab Emirates (Emirates) and Qatar (Qatar Airways) to become a transfer hub for the rest of the world. Europe is increasing slightly but the U.S. market has hardly grown during the last decade. The U.S. and Europe are large but will become mature markets in the next decades. The main battlefield for Boeing and Airbus will be China. China has a quarter of the world population and China is growing fast. Boeing - Current Market Outlook 2015: Over the next two decades, fast growth in China's domestic market will make it the largest domestic market in the world, and traffic within Asia is set to become the largest travel market. China is the latest region to embrace the LCC model, with a large increase in the number of entrants in the past two years. Although the vast majority of this activity has been in short-haul markets using single-aisle airplanes, the region is beginning to see joint ventures flying widebody airplanes on medium-haul operations in response to strong traffic growth. It is expected that by 2021, passenger travel between China and the United States will triple. This growth will drive a need for at least 1,500 new widebody airplanes, valued at $450 billion. Included in this number is a demand for 190 widebody freighters, valued at $60 billion. Airbus - Global Market Forecast 2015: On the other hand, within or between developed countries, the gap in terms of product offering and business models between legacy carriers and LCC's has narrowed in recent years. The PRC however is an exception to this trend, where LCC's have captured above 10% market share intra-regionally and less than 5% domestically. There appears therefore to be opportunities for further development in LCC operations from, to, and within China, this would also serve to increase the connectivity between growing population centres within China and with the rest of the region. However, in terms of growth rates Western regions will experience higher rates within the next decade. This movement of economic activity westwards should be mirrored by aviation development, as cities in the centre and west grow and need improved transportation and connectivity with the rest of China and Asia. Aviation has demonstrated in the past that it is ideally suited for this purpose, being more cost and land effective than other mass transportation modes, not to mention the benefits of speed which are unmatched. Airbus doesn't focus on the domestic market and existing international traffic flows alone, but also views the regional growth. The growth potential of Africa - which is the world's fastest growing region - and its strong connections with China is taken into account. The market share of the airlines operating specifically in each sub-region has followed a similar pattern, with airlines domiciled in the PRC increasing their market share from 26% of Asia-Pacific's total Available Seat per Kilometre (ASK) in 2004 to 33% in 2014. Over the period 2003-2013, international origin and destination traffic between Africa and China has grown more than ten times with nearly 1.5 million monthly O&D passengers traveling by air between the two. Airbus predicts a much larger market demand for China, which can be attributed to the international/intra-regional vision. The Airbus very large widebody (the A380) estimate however is unlikely high and optimistic. Airbus and Boeing share the market. A more detailed view is created by looking at the average age. Hong Kong is excluded as well as orders. The backlog is huge and orders might be delivered many years from now. Fleet age reflects the present situation and shows the average age. Airbus and Boeing dominate the Chinese market. Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ) ( OTCQX:BDRBF ) and Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) have a small share in the smaller airliner segment. Split into narrow body (single aisle) and widebody Boeing leads with older single aisle airliners and Airbus leads with newer widebody airliners. Changing the Status Quo: what is important? Looking at the current data Airbus has the advantage over Boeing. Airbus airliners in use are on average younger and Airbus has more extensive links with the Chinese aviation industry. Boeing will open a 737 Completion Center in China. The interior will be finished and the airliner painted. This is a first step to strengthen the hold on the Chinese market. China will demand more transfer of activities such as a Final Assembly Line as the next step. Airbus is strategically Asia-oriented. Asia-Pacific is the first region in the outlook showing the importance. Airbus considers Asia-Pacific as the growth region for the 21th century. This is also visible in the large cooperation between China and Airbus. China will get a second Final Assembly Line for narrowbody airliners in 2017 and an A330 widebody Completion & Delivery Center is under construction. Airbus also owns 5% of AviChina ( OTC:AVIJF ) and is the largest foreign shareholder. AviChina is one of the daughters of the AVIC, which is a state-owned aerospace and defense company. AVIC is one of the largest companies in the world. Future orders, deliveries and developments will determine which company will benefit from the growth. China will use the competition between Boeing and Airbus to its own advantage. The A330 widebody Completion & Delivery Center could become a Final Assembly Line. If this happens it would be a major development with major consequences for Boeing. In Airbus Going For Growth Boeing's ability to produce more widebody aircraft is shown. The A330 is a cash-cow for Airbus (as a competitor for the Boeing 777) and an extra FAL would help speed up the 1100 plus backlog. The successful A330 multi role tanker transport has also nibbled production capacity away over the years. Another option could be the A350, but that doesn't make sense. Airbus Composite Materials is 20% owned by AviChina and HAIFEI (which in part is majority owned by AviChina). This indicates China's interest in composite materials, although they probably will be used for the COMAC C919. What will the state-owned airlines order? Air China, China Eastern (which is the parent company of LCC China United Airlines) and China Southern are government owned. Although it is unlikely that they switch to a single manufacturer and they will use orders as bargaining chips for international policy or access to technology. Both Airbus and Boeing see growth in Low Cost Carriers ( LCC ) in China. LCC often use a single aircraft type to reduce maintenance costs and negotiate a better discount. China United Airlines [Boeing], Spring Airlines [Airbus] and West Air [Airbus] are the largest LCC's. 9 Air, Ruili Airlines and Urumqi Air are smaller and have all chosen Boeing. At the moment Airbus leads both in numbers and in age. Chart by Confero based on Chinese airline fleet data Click to enlarge Will the capacity of airliners keep growing? Most of Chinese airspace is military and strictly regulated. This limits both available landing and take-off slots as well as the time-window available for these scheduled flights. Frequently flights have to return to departure airports because the time-windows cannot be reached anymore. This severely limits increasing scheduled flights and indirectly forces airlines to order airliners with more capacity. Airbus A321 versus Boeing 737 MAX 200? Narrow body airliners are getting bigger in number of seats. The A321 airliners are the youngest narrow body in use and can carry 220 passengers. The Boeing 737 MAX 200 is Boeing's equivalent and almost equals the A321 with 200 passengers. Boeing will have to sell these to Chinese airlines to keep pace. Selling these to LCC's would be a good segment for this. The A330 regional is designed for domestic and regional use with a lower take-off weight. It was designed for the Asian market (India and China). It could be a good candidate for a first widebody Final Assembly Line in China. The average age shows that the Airbus widebody airliners are a lot younger than the average Boeing widebody. This could indicate that older Boeing widebody aircraft will be replaced by new aircraft and Boeing 787 Dreamliners are entering service now but Boeing lags in numbers and average age. This could indicate a shift towards Airbus. Conclusion: who will become market leader? Decision making and policy in China is often a black box. In most cases there is a strategic long-term vision involved. Even non-state actors depend on (tacit) approval from the Chinese authorities. The Chinese long-term is counted in generations and not in years. When new orders are announced or news is published on Chinese commercial aviation they often contain valuable information on the direction. The questions above can be used as indicators or triggers for the direction that will be taken. The average age and composition of airline fleets are a snapshot of the current situation. Combined, they will provide insight if Boeing or Airbus will become the market leader in the fast-growing Chinese airliner market.
