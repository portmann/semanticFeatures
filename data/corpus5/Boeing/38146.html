Boeing Misses On Revenue Expectations: Why It Makes Sense To Hold BA Stock - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing has reported first quarter fiscal 2015 results that missed on top line expectations but beat on the bottom line. Boeing shares have sold off by a small margin as a result. The companyâ€™s growth is, however, good when viewed against its recent historical performance. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is one of the latest companies to report results during the current earnings season. Like many companies in the S&P 500 that have reported their first quarter results, Boeing was a mixed bag as well. The world's largest aerospace company reported revenue of $22.15 billion, representing an encouraging 8.2% year-on-year growth, which nonetheless failed to meet analysts' expectations of $22.63 billion. Boeing, however, was able to handily beat on bottom line expectations by posting net income of $1.34 billion, or EPS of $1.87, representing a healthy growth of 37% and topping analysts' expectations for EPS by $0.06. 8% revenue growth for Boeing is actually a good result when you consider that just a year ago top line growth had plunged to as low as 1%. Boeing results continued being a tale of two diametrically opposed segments as usual, with the company's commercial airplane segment performing well by growing both revenue and earnings while the defense segment recorded deep slides on both counts due to the ongoing defense budget cuts. Boeing said that its good overall results were mainly driven by a surge in new aircraft deliveries--Boeing fulfilled orders for 184 airliners during the quarter compared to 161 during last year's comparable quarter. Major airlines have been increasing their aircraft orders as they continue to realize record profits helped by strong fuel savings occasioned by the prevailing low oil prices. Boeing investors seemed rather undecided on what to make of the results, and Boeing stock slid 2.5% after the earnings call. The shares are, nevertheless, still up 18% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500 which is up a mere 2%. There are a few reasons, however, that persuade me to believe that Boeing is set to deliver even more impressive results in the coming quarters namely: Even though oil prices have risen by more than 10/bbl over the last 30 days, this appears to be just another sympathy rebound and they are facing severe resistance around their current $58/bbl level meaning a full recovery might take much longer. Boeing's loss-making flagship 787 program booked another large loss of $793 million but is expected to narrow down its losses and eventually turn cash-positive in 2016. Boeing's order backlog swelled to $495 billion from $440 billion last quarter, which gives the company enough business to last more than 8 years at current production rates with two-thirds of deliveries coming from its profitable 737 jets during the quarter The gradually lessening impact of the company's underperforming defense segment One of the biggest reasons most major airlines are doing so well, and in turn ordering more airplanes, can be chalked up to oil prices which have remained depressed for what seems like an eternity now. There is a recent article that I published on Seeking Alpha wherein I made the argument that oil prices are likely to fully recover with time. I, however, did not offer any concrete timelines of when a full recovery is possible. By a full recovery, I mean prices at or above the 3-year pre-crisis average of around $100/bbl. Oil prices have shot up by nearly 25% over the last 30 days, and are currently hovering around $58/bbl, but facing severe resistance at that level. Unless the oil markets throw us a curve ball, maybe in the form of a surge in Iranian oil exports (which is does not seem very likely at the moment), then my estimates are that we are not likely to see a full recovery before 12-18 months are over. Some analysts are even skeptical that we shall ever see a full recovery before five years are over. Oil expenses account for about 30% of the operating expenses of many major airlines. With prices cut in half, the savings can be huge indeed, and these mostly trickle to these companies' bottom lines. Even with oil prices around $80/bbl, an average airline with an unhedged fuel position would still be able to enjoy cost savings of around 7% compared to what it would pay with oil around $100/bbl-$110/bbl with an almost similar margin expansion. All those extra billions that would have otherwise been spent paying for oil are now available for buying more of Boeing's fuel-efficient airliners which is good business for the company. Boeing has been investing a lot of money in wide-body airplanes such as its 787. This seems like a strategic decision because the company estimates that close to a quarter of the airplanes to be delivered over the next two decades will be wide-bodied planes. Boeing enjoys a significant advantage over archrival Airbus in the wide-body segment where it expects to dominate the market due to its better wide-body airplane portfolio. But, Boeing has been booking huge losses in its 787 program, with losses clocking in at $793 million during the last quarter. This is perhaps because the company has been amortizing its huge development costs over several years. The company, however, said during its latest earnings call that losses from the segment will contract considerably during the remaining quarters of the year, with the segment finally turning cash positive in 2016. Even at break-even point that would mean a healthy 50% bump on Boeing's net income, assuming it holds steady at last quarter's reading. In other words, we can expect to see a significant growth in the company's net income as the quarters roll on. Boeing's order backlog has continued to swell, and currently sits just shy of half a trillion dollars-worth of business. Those are enough orders to keep the company's production plants busy for not less than 8 years at current production run rates. The good thing is that a lot of those new orders are for its popular 737 workhorse which is already solidly profitable. Boeing's defense segment has acted as major drag on the company's top and bottom line growth for a long time. During the quarter, the company's commercial aircraft segment managed to grow revenue and earnings by 21% and 8%, respectively. In contrast, Boeing's defense segment recorded a revenue growth of -12% and earnings growth of -4%. This is a trend that has been ongoing for quite a few years and does not seem about to reverse. The good thing, however, is that Boeing's commercial aircraft segment is twice as large as the defense segment, contributing two thirds of revenue and profit. The decline in the defense segment appears to have hit a plateau and might continue at the current rate going forward. Assuming that the scenario unfolds this way, the segment will fall below 20% of the company's revenue in about 2 years, at which level its negative effect on overall growth will be much less felt than the current situation. Investors seem to have been alarmed a bit by Boeing failing to meet top line expectations. But, the company's results are actually good when viewed against its recent history, and are moving in the right direction. Most of the tailwinds that have been fueling this growth remain intact which provides the company with good growth runways for the coming quarters and years.
