The Coming Bubble In Single-Aisle Orders - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) (EPA: AIR ) and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) have plans to increase production of their single aisle aircraft. Production of these aircraft have already been increased. Both firms reason demand is strong and backlogs very high. At current production, customers still have to wait years for their aircraft. But the chart shows what happens to the backlog when oil prices move down. There are far fewer orders and the backlog drops as deliveries outpace new orders. We are in the midst of a historic decline in oil prices. The demand for the new Airbus and Boeing aircraft was driven by rising oil prices. The slowing of orders started in 2014. The market was already anticipating a drop in oil prices. If the past is prologue, then Airbus and Boeing are going to see a big change in their backlogs. Customers are going to delay deliveries. This has already started with WestJet ( OTC:WJAFF ) (TSE: WJA). Almost certainly others will do the same. With low oil prices, airlines are under far less pressure to acquire newer, more fuel efficient aircraft that have been priced at a premium. Delaying deliveries means a drop in payments as the largest aircraft payment occurs with delivery. Airlines have no compunction in forcing delivery delays. Airbus and Boeing continue to speak confidently about the industry. It might be a good idea to hedge your bets.
