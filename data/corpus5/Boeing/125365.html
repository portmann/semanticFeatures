ETF Hub Jul 22 2015, 19:30 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) Q2 earnings beat accompanied by a surge in operating cash flow and a strong outlook for full-year cash flow was good enough to notch a 1% gain in today's trade, and CEO Dennis Muilenburg says in the earnings call that "we like the path we're on." Boeing cut its 2015 profit guidance to reflect last week’s announced charge for the KC-46 Tanker contract, but if that cut were stripped out, it would have boosted its EPS view by $0.27 . Helping last quarter was "record commercial airplane deliveries," the CEO said as "strong operating performance across our commercial- and defense-production programs partially offset the tanker charge." The company would not feel near-term financial pressure if Congress fails to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank in coming days, Muilenburg says, noting "there are multiple commercial credit sources available today." The CEO downplayed the risk of pressing ahead with building the KC-46 tankers while conducting flight tests, saying the parts it was making were "well understood," and building the planes now "allows us to... have  high confidence in the production program." Boeing is  90% finished with testing non-fuel tanker elements, a   stage at which problems are rare, but "they're not  naive  about the challenge," Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel says; "there's no margin for error going forward," warns Canaccord's Ken  Herbert.
