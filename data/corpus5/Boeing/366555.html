Spirit AeroSystems: Fasten Seat Belt Sign Is On - Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) | Seeking Alpha The restructuring story of the last few years seems over. Boeing, the largest customer, is facing issues and the relationship with Boeing is also changing. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE: SPR ), since my last Bullish note , has worked well, thanks to the operational improvement and restructuring thesis that was covered in the note working well, but now the fundamentals are changing (some may call deteriorating) fast and investors might be served better by turning cautious. The company has been a great restructuring story, with most of the senior management changed and improved productivity metrics, while top customers - Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) delivering a record number of aircraft. Even now backlog (almost $47 billion) represents almost seven years of sales visibility and there are recent reports of the company winning the contract on the Long Range Strike Bomber that Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ) will be building for the U.S. Air Force. Overall, most backward-looking indicators, including the cheap valuation based on historical earnings, look impressive, but with the comeback thesis played, the catalysts for the next leg of growth seem difficult to comprehend. The company may have come a long way, but going forward, issues faced by the biggest customer (Boeing) and the growing uneasiness in the relationship with the biggest customer are things that are worth tracking closely and bound to create doubts, thus capping the upside potential of the stock. The incrementally positive reports related to the new military contract or the ramp of A350 (with Airbus) are good, but still not big enough to move the business in a meaningful way, at least not enough to ignore issues with Boeing. As a spin-off of Boeing's division, the company is one of the largest independent non-OEM manufacturers of commercial aerostructures (structural components, such as fuselages, propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft) in the world, and one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to Boeing and Airbus. Three major product segments - Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems, and Wing Systems - have continued to be the same, but the big promise was always to enable the business to bid for work with other plane makers, but it still relies heavily on Boeing. The company has high exposure to Boeing and the problems faced by Boeing may continue to stalk Spirit as well. Boeing provided a disappointing 2016 guidance, whether one looks at the delivery schedule, margin or EPS. One top of that the company is grappling with accounting investigations , low oil and the general expectations of demand in a rising interest rate environment. From a product standpoint, total unit deliveries for BCA (Boeing Commercial Airplanes) are expected to be 740-745 airplanes, below the widely expected 765-767 forecasts, which works out to down 2% from the number of shipsets delivered by Spirit to Boeing in 2015. Besides a generally weak 2016 forecast, Boeing also announced production rate cuts to the B777, widely expected by most Street analysts, but for Spirit, which supplied 102 shipsets of B777 in 2015, it is a negative nonetheless. If history is any guide, expecting a smooth transition to B777X may be asking for too much, especially considering the weak order book for 777s in general. With a weak demand for wide-body airplanes and shrinking opportunities to improve pricing, Boeing may be under increased pressure. Stable airline traffic growth, improved earnings, decent cash generation and benefits associated with operational improvements may not matter much if the market starts looking at the peak demand and cyclical downturn scenarios, a sentiment that is bound to flow down to major suppliers like Spirit. It is never encouraging to see hostility with suppliers or customers, especially if the other party happens to be one of your biggest customers. Recently, Boeing ended a licensing agreement with Spirit and taking away manufacturing of some spare parts used in aircraft repairs, which Spirit shrugged off as financially limiting in nature. But the development is noteworthy on many counts, be it the high profitability that is usually associated with the spare parts business (especially aircraft spares) the fact that the program covers various components used in a variety of aircraft or the strategic importance of the business, considering the help it might offer to Spirit with supplying their own repair operations with replacement parts. Not to mention that this is probably one of the first times that Boeing has taken back something from Spirit, never an encouraging sign. Financially, cash flows should start to attract increased attention A lot of attention is given to the company's strong adjusted EBITDA of close to a billion dollars, rightfully so, given the improvement from just a couple of years ago, but with the increase in capital expenditure, which increased to $360 million last year from $220 million in 2014, and expected (guidance) cash flow from operations of $575-675 million, down from 2015, free cash flow might come under increased scrutiny. Mid-February, the company announced the lowering of its free cash flow guidance, which some believed to be related to the company's winning a contract on the Long Range Strike-Bomber that Northrop Grumman will be building for the U.S. Air Force. But that is not the only development that may put pressure on the cash flows, the weak outlook of the B777, pricing pressures, the expected ramp of the A350, which usually has a significant impact on working capital, and shrinking advance payments are all worth tracking closely. At the time of the previous note, the growth offered by the business was higher than peers with a potential to improve margins and now the growth expectations are higher than the biggest customers and margins highest in years. The name may look cheap on earnings, but then most cyclical businesses do at the peak of the business cycle, when measured on the historical earnings basis. The company continues to be active with a share buyback, but the same has done little for the earnings improvement. The balance sheet is decent and the market volatility may throw off acquisition opportunities, but the valuation, i.e. low price to earnings, may restrict the use of stock as a currency. As the stock starts trading more like a cyclical stock than a comeback story, valuation multiples may also come under increased scrutiny.
