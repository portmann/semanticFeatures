So How Deep Is The Hole That Boeing Dug For The Dreamliner? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Deferred costs likely to rise to $29 bn. Q3 Deferred costs were in line with expectations. With a bright market forecast there should be no problem for Boeing to return program profits on the long term. In a previous article I had a look at how deferred costs for the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787 program developed. I concluded that Boeing is still losing $23 million per airframe, but breaking even on the program within the first 1100 deliveries seemed achievable. Since Boeing is currently heavily discounting the Boeing 777 and will reduce production rate for the current generation Boeing 777 it is important for Boeing to make the Boeing 787 production profitable. Figure 1: A Boeing 787-9 during a flight display on the 2015 Paris Air Show (Source: youtube.com ) Break-even on production costs was expected in 2015, after which the deferred costs would start declining somewhere in 2016. At some point, Boeing said it did not expect deferred production costs to rise above $25 bn. In Q2 2015, deferred production costs rose to $28.3 bn, a $577 mln increased compared to last quarter. In this article, I will have a look at how costs per airframe have developed since 2012, and how they might develop in the future. Figure 2: Boeing 787 Deferred costs (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 2 shows quite well that deferred costs rose sharply since Q1 2012, but at the same time, it can be seen that from Q3-Q4 2013 and onwards, the rate of cost growth started declining. This can be seen as a first step on reaching break-even on production. Previously AeroAnalysis estimated deferred costs to rise to $28.335 bn in Q3 2015, the figure reported by Boeing is $28.309bn. So Boeing did a slightly better job cutting costs than was anticipated. The decelerated cost growth is better visualized in Figure 3: Figure 3: Boeing 787 quarterly increase in deferred costs (Source: AeroAnalysis) As can be seen in Figure 3, deferred costs per quarter started declining since Q1 2014. Compared to Q2 2015, the growth rate of deferred costs declined quite a bit. To get a better view it is key to relate the increase in deferred costs to the number of deliveries in a particular quarter. Figure 4: Loss per produced Boeing 787 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Figure 4 gives a clear view on the development of deferred production cost per unit. It can clearly be seen that the costs have been declining and currently are around $15.6 mln. So in Q3, Boeing lost $15.6 million per produced Boeing 787, which is a 33% improvement compared to the previous quarter and a 70% improvement year over year. Using a conservative 10% reduction in growth rate per quarter, deferred costs will grow to $28.7 bn in Q1 2016 and hit break-even around the same time. By Q1 2016, Boeing will have delivered approximately 420 airframes and has accumulated almost $29 bn in deferred costs. If Boeing needs to break even on the program with its expected backlog of orders, it needs to make $41.5 mln profit per airframe. As increasing profitability per airframe is a gradual process, profit per airframe needs to be slightly higher to compensate for lower profit on the first few profitable airframes. So the $41.5 mln is an average. The Boeing 777-300ER currently (at high discounts) has a profit margin of 23%, but this used to be as high as 35%. A 35% profit margin on the Boeing 787 would mean a $47 mln profit per aircraft (whereas $41.5 mln in profits per airframe is needed to break-even). This indicates that breaking even on the program with the current backlog does make sense, but it has to be noted that a lot depends on how fast Boeing will be able to increase profit on the production of the Boeing 787. According to my calculations Boeing could return profits on the entire program within the first 1100 deliveries, which is a figure that Boeing already estimated 4 years ago and are now being confirmed by my own calculations. With demand for medium and small wide body aircraft topping 8000 airframes in the coming years, the future looks bright for the Dreamliner. Reaching break-even by year-end without investing in the production process is a major challenge Using a 10% reduction in growth rate for the deferred costs, I expect break-even somewhere after 420-450 deliveries and a deferred production cost close to $29 bn Depending on how fast Boeing will be able to increase profit, the jet make could see profit on the program within 1,100 deliveries The hole that Boeing dug for the Dreamliner is deep, but increases in efficiency, production rates and strong demand should give the Dreamliner strength to fly out of that hole. The strong cost reduction in Q3 2015 is a good sign for Boeing investors. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
