Boeing showed significant earnings per share surprise in its last eight quarters, as shown in the table below. Boeing's cash flow surged during the second quarter, with the 787 Dreamliner pacing record jet deliveries as the company profited from an order backlog stretching into the 2020s. I see strong revenue and earnings growth prospects for the company. In order to confirm my premise, I have gathered from Boeing's quarterly reports the following data for the last sixteen quarters: The value of the entire airplanes ordered I have calculated the compound annual growth rate [CAGR] for these parameters, and I found out that Boeing's backlog has increased 10.9% annually from $323 billion in the second-quarter of 2011 to $489 billion in the second-quarter of 2015. In addition, its total commercial airplane orders have increased by annual rate of 14.6% from 3,300 airplanes in Q2-2011 to 5,700 in Q2-2015, and the value of the total airplanes ordered has grown by 13.3% annually, from $262 billion to $431 billion, as shown in the table below. These impressive growth rates in the last sixteen quarters lead me to the conclusion that Boeing will continue to prosper, and I expect double digit growth for the company. Boeing's valuation metrics are good; The forward P/E is low at 15.72, the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is also low at 10.42, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is high at 12.38%. Boeing has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1962. The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.49%, and the payout ratio is at 40.6%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 22.2%, over the past five years was at 13%, and over the past ten years was also high at 13.8%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and Boeing's performance has been good in this respect. During the second-quarter, the company repurchased 14 million shares for $2.0 billion, leaving $7.5 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization which is expected to be completed over approximately the next two years.
