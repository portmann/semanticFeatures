Zuckerberg downplays Facebook/Google rivalry - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Mar 26 2015, 18:59 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Though Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) are squaring off more than ever following yesterday's Facebook F8 conference product launches , none of it is intentional, insists Mark Zuckerberg in a Wired interview . Zuck: "To the extent that we are doing measurement and Google did measurement, that’s just because Google is smart and they also realize that measurement is valuable ... Same on the video front ... we are not thinking about how we are competing with YouTube. We are thinking about how are we going to make it more useful for people to share stuff on Facebook." Facebook's launch of a mobile ad exchange (competes against Google's DoubleClick, leverages Facebook data) and embedded video support (YouTube dominates video embeds) has led to more than a few headlines declaring Facebook is out to take Google's lunch. The companies already compete in multiple ad markets. On the mobile ad exchange front, at least, the competitive overlap might be less than some think. As Foreester's Jim Nail observes , DoubleClick's exchange, much like Google search, focuses on intent-based advertising (i.e. ads for items users have recently expressed interest in), while Facebook's natural strength is targeting based on a user's historical likes. Other Facebook F8 news: 1) Facebook has provided details about Aquila, a solar-powered drone that will have a wingspan similar to a Boeing 767, and be used lasers to beam Web access to underserved regions. Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace last year. 2) Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash promises big things for virtual reality, once tech challenges are resolved. "Virtual reality -- done right -- truly is reality as far as the observer is concerned ... It's clear that VR has the potential to change almost everything about the way we live." The future will see unbelievable changes , I know some think i am nuts ,but i believe Teleportation is in our future , not mine because of my age but will happen. FB simply declaring they are and will be on the cutting edge of new technologies. Doing it step by step and NOT BE Beaten by anyone else.
