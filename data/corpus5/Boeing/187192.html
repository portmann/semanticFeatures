China's Orders To Help Boeing Soar In The Years To Come - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha China signed a $38 billion deal with Boeing for an order of 300 jetliners. The lucrative deal was met with much skepticism as many believe the American airplane manufacturer was ruining its own future. The deal saw workers back home in Washington getting uneasy about any possible job cuts related to the new plant BA has vowed to set up in China. Last week Seattle was visited by Chinese President Xi Jinping in what was to be an official state visit to the US, during which he signed a massive $38 billion deal with Boeing (NYSE: BA ) for an order of 300 jetliners. Despite the seemingly lucrative nature of the deal there was a good deal of criticism floating around once the deal was confirmed and some even believe that China is fool's gold especially for large companies like Boeing. So I believe looking into some of these major criticisms will really help us understand Boeing's long term prospects as well evaluate any short term happenings. Let's look at the deal first. Boeing announced the finalization of orders for $38 billion worth of airplanes at list prices which include the following: 50 widebody jets to be bought by Chinese airlines (neither have been names) 190 single-aisle 737s to be bought by the same group of airlines 60 more 737s for leasing companies ICBC Financial Leasing Co. and CDB Leasing Co. What you need to know is that many of these planes are not all new orders and many have been entered into the company's order book under previously announced firm orders. Secondly, and what is brewing trouble back home, is that the deal also includes Boeing opening up airplane completion and delivery centers in China for the very first time. The head of the largest union at Boeing pledged to step up a confrontation over the new Chinese plant if it meant cutting jobs in Washington. However after a meeting with the company's Chief Executive Dennis Muilenberg, he was reassured that the China facility would finish and paint narrowbody 737s planes built at its Renton, Washington Factory while there would also be no related jobs lost in the United States. Unfortunately as elections are coming up you can expect certain politicians to use this as an example to fuel the fire. A plant in China was long overdue for Boeing especially with the backlog battle it has been playing with Airbus. Boeing currently has 5,710 planes stuck in backlog of which nearly 75% are 737s. Getting rid of this backlog is no easy task and Boeing repeatedly points out how it plans to increase production to 47 airplanes per month in 2017, 52 planes per month in 2018, and a further secret plan after that which should take the production output to 60 planes per month. The company showed its commitment to increasing output by introducing a new automated process which reduces manufacturing time by 30% while at the same time taking less than half the floor space. What makes matters far more interesting is that this production efficiency is slowly but surely paying off since by the end of August this year Boeing had made 503 deliveries in comparison to Airbus' 397. Deliveries are where these airplane manufacturing companies tend to realize the bulk of the revenues from these orders. Even though the proposed plants in China are going to focus on the finishing of the airplanes it marks an important step for Boeing and the largest country in the world as it signifies the start of a long term commitment. Analysts at Boeing have reiterated their strong belief that China will need 6,330 new planes over the next two decades at a total cost of approximately $1 trillion, and I won't go into the details of whether such a forecast is valid and reliable since I have discussed it in my previous articles quite a fair bit. However there are those who believe the deal came with string attached. They specifically talk about this partnership with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) with whom they are going to open the completion centers since China's ambitions of developing a homegrown airplane are well known. The Comac C919 is to be the flagship plane of the Chinese commercial airline industry but constant delays have made it abundantly clear that it is a still a work in progress. So Boeing's long term commitment to China is more than just a business deal, it's also a training session for the Chinese aviation industry. Regardless of the intentions of the Chinese, $1 trillion is a lot of money to go between 2 or 3 companies, and given that Boeing has a very strong set up and a history of successful jets it is more than likely that the Renton, Washington based company will walk away with a sizable share. However in good measure we cannot rule out the introduction of the Comac C919 which will signal the initiation of China's ultimate goal of breaking Airbus and Boeing's Duopoly. So why would Boeing willingly try to sink its own ship? Well Airbus already has a plant in Tianjin and as far as Boeing is concerned the die has already been cast so they might as well still compete with their European rivals for the largest market in the world. So you might be wondering why the company stock is suffering despite such promising prospects and why can't we see any short term gains from it? Well the fact is there is no decision on actual timing and locations of deliveries as of yet, which ultimately means that there won't be any near-term impact on Boeing's numbers. Couple that with the fact that the American airline manufacturer is still going through withdrawal symptoms from the death of the Ex-Im Bank and you have a stock which is currently suffering. But Boeing still represents a healthy investment opportunity with its strong dividend history . The shares have underperformed the S&P 500 by 2.4% during the past week but BA has outperformed the index in 4 weeks by 1.26%. The company stock currently trades at 128.24.
