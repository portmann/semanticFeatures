Airbus raises the pressure on Boeing - Airbus Group SE ADR (OTCMKTS:EADSY) | Seeking Alpha Jan  3 2016, 09:28 ET | About: Airbus Group SE ADR (EADSY) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) is likely to have ended 2015 with more orders for new aircraft than rival Boeing (NYSE: BA ), marking the third consecutive year the European planemaker has emerged on top. According to the latest tallies, Airbus had 1022 net orders by the end of December, while Boeing had 743 (final results will be published in several days). The main reason for Airbus's continued dominance appears to be its re-engined A320neo short-haul aircraft, which has outsold Boeing's 737 Max in this category. Oh the humanity. Airbus is going to beat Boeing in orders again. Pity. It's remarkable how the attention is focused on the order taking aspect when it's really the deliveries that makes the companies money. You see, any one can take an order. Question is can you hold on to it long enough until time of delivery. http://bit.ly/1O3xeVE Please understand that it's no coincidence that Boeing has been been delivering more metal than the chaps across the pond. That is the metric that makes the OEM the top manufacturer in the world. Good day. Airbus could have 2022 orders by year end but if they can only deliver  743 (Boeing's order sheet), or less,  what value is it? Airbus will be able to reduce backlog dramatically once its new plant in Mobile gets up to speed. The plant in China will be upgraded as well. I cant believe some people dismiss the fact that more orders means more share, more income and yes....more DELIVERIES eventually. Airbus is eating Boeing's lunch and in a few short years you will see just how badly Boeing dropped the ball I see the "quality" on a daily basis, do you?
