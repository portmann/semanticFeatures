ETF Hub Sep 10 2015, 19:12 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) likely could find strong demand if it decided to go ahead with producing a new midsize, medium-range jetliner, Bank of America analysts say. Boeing has said it is considering a new jet that would fit a niche between its single-aisle 737 and long-range 787 Dreamliner, and the BofA analysts find "a strong case" for Boeing to go ahead, estimating a market for ~2,700 planes from airlines to replace older planes or swap in for inefficient, long-range jets that they are currently using for medium-range flights. However, the analysts say Boeing's ability to recover its cost of capital on the program would depend on executing a more cost effective production method than the 787, which has struggled with high production costs building the mostly carbon-fiber composite jet.
