Boeing's $847M Dreamliner charge/reclassification a surprise, Barclays says - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Jul 22 2016, 15:45 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing ( BA -0.2%) shares are still lower but have recouped big earlier losses after revealing yesterday that it will take a $2.1B Q2 charge related to its 787 Dreamliner program and other initiatives it has had to reassess. Barclays analysts say that while they expected a charge on the KC-46 tanker delays, and were only mildly surprised at the writeoff on the 747 program, given the current weak state of the freight/cargo market and the fact that the program is in its twilight era after nearly 50 years in production. However, the firm was caught off guard by the $847M charge and reclassification on the 787 program decision, but adds that "a walk around the tarmac in [the] Everett factory would reveal more than just these two aircraft still awaiting re-work and delivery, some eight years after their initial construction." Barclays says it is difficult to spin the bigger than expected charges as a positive, but believes "expectations for Boeing’s Q2 were already quite low, and ths revelation may actually serve as a modest de-risking."
