Is Boeing Losing Grip On The Passenger Wide Body Market? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha In a previous article I discussed the order inflow for narrow body aircraft in 2015 and concluded that the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 737MAX is not going to win market share for Boeing. In this article I will have a look at how the order inflow for Boeing and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) passenger wide body aircraft stack against each other. Figure 1: Passenger wide body order inflow for Boeing and Airbus in 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) What can be seen is that the very large aircraft (VLA) have a very low contribution to the order inflow, fully supporting my view that airlines are favoring the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A350. Boeing received 42 orders for the 777, while Airbus received 16 orders for its Airbus A350. The reason for the higher order inflow for the Boeing 777 is the fact that Boeing is currently heavily discounting the airframe to fill up delivery slots. A similar thing is happening to the Airbus A330. The Airbus A330 outsold the Boeing 787 in 2015, primarily due to attractive pricing of the Airbus A330ceo. If all passenger wide body orders are summed, Boeing ends up with 141 orders while Airbus ends up with 169 orders. So looking at the ordered units it seems Airbus is on the winning hand. AeroAnalysis estimated the market value of the Boeing orders to be $21.4bn and the value of the Airbus aircraft to be $20.4bn. On a per unit basis this translates to $151.8 mln for Boeing and $120.7 mln for Airbus. On one hand this reflects the lower list prices (due to lower costs for Airbus), on the other hand it reflects the higher discounts for the Airbus A330ceo. During the year Boeing received 28 cancellations for the Boeing 787, while Airbus received 34 cancellations. Net orders for 2015 stand at 113 for Boeing and 135 for Airbus. Table 1: Gross order division old/new per family Although Airbus seems to be having the lead, the European jetmaker received just 66 orders for their newer aircraft while Boeing received 119 orders for their newer models. The majority of the Airbus order inflow is for the older discounted A330ceo. While for the narrow body order battle it was clear that Airbus was having the lead, it is harder to point out a 'winner' for the wide body battle. In terms of units Airbus was in the lead in 2015, but whereas Airbus relies on order inflow for discounted models Boeing relies on order inflow for the new models. This also reflects in the value of the orders. In 2015 net orders for the new A350 even were a negative 3. On the other hand, Airbus seems to be doing a better job offering attractive pricing for their A330ceo. So I think it is safe to say that neither Boeing nor Airbus is losing here, it is more like a drawâ€¦ I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
