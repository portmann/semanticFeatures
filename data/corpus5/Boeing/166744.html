ETF Hub Sep  9 2015, 03:51 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yigal Grayeff , SA News Editor A British Airways Boeing 777 (NYSE: BA ) caught fire late yesterday as it was taking off from Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport. The pilot was able to abort the takeoff and all 172 passengers and crew escaped, although 14 people were taken to hospital. A preliminary investigation shows that the plane's left engine, which was made by GE (NYSE: GE ), burst into flames as the plane started to accelerate on the runway. Lucky and glad it was before they actually took off. Though it may be more GE on this, still a Boeing plane. Going to be some explaining that needs to be done.. Boeing doesn't make the engines. The 777 is one of the safest plane in the World. Next time lead with GE engine catches fire. Let's wait for the investigation. The engine, a GE90, also has an excellent safety record. The event could have been maintenance or even FOD related. The root cause will certainly be determined.
