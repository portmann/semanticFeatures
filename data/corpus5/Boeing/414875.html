Was Goldman Sachs Right About The Boeing 777 After All? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Using the annual order trend, a significant gap remains. Annual trends are not the correct way to estimate order inflow. The Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777 gap has been subject to some of my articles. In my previous article A Negative Trend For The Boeing 777 , I concluded that order inflow has been trailing the multi-year average and order inflow in 2015 was below my expectations. In a bearish note analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) explained why they see a further drop in production rates in 2018 and 2019. In this article I will have a look at the annual order inflow and based on that I will look whether closing the gap can be achieved with the current negative trend of lower order inflow. First of all, it is important to explain why I am not using the long term trend. The long term trend was impacted by the 9/11 attacks that put the airline industry in a deep crisis and it took about 5 years before order inflow picked up pace again. I am not actually interested in this impact and therefore it is better not to look at the long term trend. If you wish to read about the long term trend and the various factors that impact order inflow, I can recommend you reading my series of articles covering each subject extensively. Besides that, the global financial crisis resulted in lower order inflow as well. The lower oil prices do have impacted order inflow for the Boeing 777, but there is no way to cut out that impact by chopping off another piece of the dataset. In the end, I do expect oil prices to rise again in the years to come. Figure 1: Annual order trend Boeing 777 ( Source ) Figure 1 shows that, given the current annual trend, order inflow is likely to fall to 32 units this year, followed by 22 in 2017, 12 in 2018 and 1 unit in 2019. Now, what is important to note is that the order inflow shows a zig-zag pattern, which is something that the annual trend does not take into account. However, given that Goldman had a bearish note on Boeing, sparked by the 777 it is still interesting to look how this annual order trend plays out. Figure 2: Production gap including annual order trend Boeing 777 ( Source ) Figure 2 shows that using the annual order trend, the gap up until 2019 is 65 units and another 27 units for 2020. So this does suggest that a further rate cut is required to bridge the gap. Figure 3: Required production rate including annual order trend Boeing 777 ( Source ) Using the annual order trend without taking into account the zig-zag pattern the required rate in 2018 is 4.3 aircraft per month and 2.25 aircraft per month in 2019. To some extent this reflects Goldman's view, but it has to be noted that their view on the gaps are significantly different. Coming to more or less the same required production rate might have been mere luck. For 2020, it has to be noted that the remaining gap of 27 units could as well be filled by the 777X, making Boeing's task to fill the gap a bit easier. In this article I had a look at the required rate using the annual order trend and concluded that using the annual rate the production rate will have to come down to 3-4 aircraft per month. Which is in line with what Goldman Sach's analyst team expects. However, the way I came to this conclusion differs significantly from the way Noah Poponak and his team got to it . Additionally, I do not think the annual order trend is a good measure of order inflow, since it does not include the zig-zag pattern that jet makers often see. Therefore, in the following article I will be using the bi-annual average which in my view better reflects order inflow for the coming years.
