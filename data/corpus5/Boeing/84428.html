Boeing: The Cut Is Coming... But Later Than Predicted - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing finally admits that production rates will be cut. The rate cut will lower revenue by $1.6 annually. In some of my previous articles, I dealt with the discounts and performance upgrade package on the Boeing 777 (NYSE: BA ), which should help the company close the production gap it is facing on the Boeing 777 program. The discounts will put a bit of pressure on margins for the Boeing 777. In the article from December 2014, I had concluded that a production rate cut is likely, despite company management claiming otherwise. Boeing recently "admitted" that the rate will be cut . The company will cut the production rate of the Boeing 777 from 8.3 per month to 7 per month, starting in 2018. This means that the jet maker will deliver only 88 Boeing 777 airframes per year instead of 100. The current discounted value of the Boeing 777-300ER is $130 mln. So starting in 2018 until probably until the end of 2019/start of 2020, the company will generate a $1.6 bn lower revenue on the Boeing 787 program. Although it is good news that Boeing has finally admitted that it has to cut production rates, the way they did come out with it is disturbing. Boeing 777 Vice President Elizabeth Lund said the following: "[we/Boeing] will feather in with some blanks" This basically means that there would be some production slots left unoccupied, these slots will be used to start production on the 777X parts, but what the VP said next raises some questions: "Yes, you would deliver one less airplane the month that you get to delivery, but that is not a rate break" In terms of the allocation of workforce, this is indeed not a rate cut, but in terms of production and delivery, it is certainly a cut, and the Boeing VP seems to be extremely unwilling to admit this. Since the jet maker is basically cutting production and delivery for the current Boeing 777, the VP's statement that there would be no rate changes is unsettling. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney also acknowledged there would be a little dip, but claimed this dip was not related to low demand for the Boeing 777, but instead, was related to the transition from the Boeing 777 to the Boeing 777X. So, Mr. McNerney does acknowledge the rate cut, but denies that Boeing cannot fill the empty slots. Although I think the words from Mr. McNerney have a bit more truth in them, they are different from his previous statement ( during the Q1 results presentation ), when he said he was confident about maintaining production rate and bridging the gap: "I mentioned the production skyline in '16, '17 and '18 and it's beginning to firm up. So we're increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge and it's important not only commercially and to keep the rate going..." The way I see it, Boeing is having a hard time admitting that a rate cut is required due higher slot availability than demand for the airframe. It is indeed necessary, and will result in a lower revenue and profit on the Boeing 777 program, starting in 2018. Boeing seems to be trying to trick investors and analysts by denying the rate cut, calling it out as standard procedure when switching production from one model to the other. Although this is partly true, the fact that no Boeing 777Xs will be rolling out of the factories until 2019-2020, and that only 7 Boeing 777s will be produced (instead of 8), will make this a rate cut. Boeing first claimed it would be able sustain current production rates for the Boeing 777 until the Boeing 777X enters service in 2020. The fact that the company will slash production in 2018 poses question on how many orders it is expecting to fill the remaining slots after the rate cut. The good news here is that the cut comes 2 years later than I expected it would. Source: Boeing: The Cut Is Coming...
