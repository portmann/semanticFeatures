Boeing: Capital Returns Trump The Wall Of Worries - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,698 clicks) Boeing continues to run into a multitude of worries from the investment community. The company offers strong capital returns to back any investment at the current levels while the competition struggles to even get planes into the air. Despite record backlogs, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has traded mostly sideways for the last two years. The stock started 2014 quickly moving above $135 to now trade at only $144. The end result is a meager capital gain though shareholders do collect a decent dividend. The combination of customer claims of an over supplied commercial aircraft market and new entrants into the airplane manufacturing market clearly have investors holding back on the stock. Is now the time to load up on Boeing as the company delivers large profits while the market builds a wall of worries? For a long time, Boeing and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) have had a virtual duopoly on the commercial aircraft market. Any disruption to this market situation would naturally hurt orders and future profit margins. Naturally, the big profits of Boeing, forecasted travel growth in Asia, and the record backlogs are leading to new competition. Building a commercial aircraft is now easy task. My previous investment research took on the fears of over supply in the market. This article will focus on the worries of new entrants into the passenger plane market from Japan and China. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( OTCPK:MHVYF ) is a 70-90 seat regional jet with reportedly 400 planes on order. The airplane similar to all other commercial attempts around the globe is seeing big delays. The latest news is that the first delivery won't take place until 2018, if even by that date. The airplane isn't a direct competitor for Boeing planes, but a quality plane could encourage carriers to move back to more regional jets. The more important competition for Boeing at the present is the Chinese plane targeted at the narrow-body commercial airplane market. Boeing is seeing substantial orders from carriers around the world including those in China. Similar to the MRJ, the C919 made by Comac has a history of failures and delays. The plane was originally launched back in 2008 and has yet to take its maiden voyage needed before moving into a lengthy production timeframe. Naturally, most carriers outside of China will hesitate to purchase a Chinese plane. The issue though is the majority of future airplane demand will come from this country and the region. The claims of over 500 orders will eventually dent demand for Boeing in years beyond 2020 if Comac actually gets the plane into production. Noteworthy is that President Xi Jiping recently signed large deals with both Boeing and Airbus with the intent of assembling more airplanes within China. While the competition keeps talking about delivering planes sometime in the distant future, Boeing is utilizing cash from actually delivering planes now to reward shareholders. The company recently increased the dividend by 20% and raised the buyback authorization to an incredible $14 billion. With a market cap approaching $100 billion, Boeing is far too big to play games with cash. If the commercial airplane manufacturer saw a realistic threat in the future, the company wouldn't be repurchasing shares at these levels. Boeing spent $6.75 billion on buybacks last year so the company is clearly not blowing smoke on the intent to utilize the available cash to retire up to $14 billion worth of additional shares. Maybe most interesting is that the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.09 brings the annual yield above 3%. With a stock buyback yield of 7%, Boeing now offers a 10% net payout yield to investors. The best part about buying Boeing at these levels is the ability to buy stock knowing the company is repurchasing shares to protect the downside. Keeping one eye on competitive threats is always wise for investors. Not acknowledging the possibility that competitors from afar will eventually take market share isn't financially responsible. For this very reason, one shouldn't ever over pay for a stock like Boeing. Though ignoring the strong market position, massive backlog, and strong cash flows isn't prudent investing either. The recommendation remains to use the current stock price and any dips to load up on this top airplane manufacturer.
