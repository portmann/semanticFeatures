Does A $7 Million Boeing 777-200ER Compare To A Brand New Dreamliner? (Part 2) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha The Boeing 787-10 has the operational advantage. Cost advantage still is in favor of the Boeing 777-200ER. In my previous article , I had a look at the difference in ownership costs for a second-hand Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777-200ER and a new Boeing 787-10. As was to be expected, the ownership costs for the Boeing 777-200ER are much lower, and over a timeframe of 7 years, the ownership costs are almost $120 mln lower. On the other hand, I also looked at the annual revenue and concluded that the Boeing 787-10 has a significant advantage, which makes it interesting to have a look at other costs such as maintenance costs, crew costs, and landing and navigation fees. Figure 1: Comparison of annual maintenance costs of second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) One of the most important decisions that affect the financial performance of the Boeing 777-200ER is the moment the aircraft is taken out of service. For an aircraft that is 10 years old, a good moment would be right at the moment when the aircraft would need a cost-intensive heavy maintenance. This would occur somewhere about 7 years from now. So the aircraft would be 17 years old when it is taken out of service. With aircraft typically having an economically viable life of 15-17 years, this seems to be reasonable. It has to be noted that aircraft can be used as long as 25 years. Compared to the Boeing 777-200ER, the Boeing 787-10 has significantly lower maintenance costs per flight hour. Per annum, the Boeing 787-10 could save an airline more than $3 mln. Additionally, the second-hand Boeing 777-200ER has a heavy maintenance just before it will enter service. Costs are expected to be $3.5 mln. Figure 2: Comparison of annual crew costs of second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) With the cruising speeds of both aircraft being almost similar, I am assuming the crew costs are almost similar, with the only exception being cockpit crew of the Dreamliner having slightly lower wages and needing 2 more flight attendants. This would give the Boeing 777-200ER a $0.25 mln advantage per annum. Figure 3: Comparison of annual navigation and landing fees of second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) The navigation costs and landing fees are a function of maximum take-off weight and differ per country. With the Boeing 777-200ER having a higher certified maximum take-off weight, the advantage is for the Dreamliner. Per year, the landing and navigation fees are about $0.62 mln lower for the Boeing 787-10. With the information that has been gathered in the first article and this one, a graphical representation of the costs advantage for the Boeing 787-10 can be made: Figure 4: Advantage second-hand Boeing 777-200ER over Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) What can be seen is that the initial advantage is about 97 mln, which is the difference in market value of both aircraft minus the heavy maintenance costs for the Boeing 777-200ER, and this advantage decreases to $90.5 mln in the last year. So when we solely consider the costs, clearly the advantage is for the Boeing 777-200ER, but the advantage decreases due to the Boeing 787-10 having favorable operating costs. Figure 5: Advantage Boeing 787-10 over Boeing 777-200ER (Source: AeroAnalysis) What can be seen in Figure 5 is that the Boeing 787-10 has a disadvantage in the first years, but in the years after, the higher revenue potential offsets the higher costs (this excludes any fuel costs). When the Boeing 777-200ER is taken out of service, it would have had a $26.4 mln disadvantage. Whereas the capital costs and market value gave the Boeing 777-200ER a significant advantage, the lower maintenance costs and landing and navigation fees narrowed this advantage. However, taking into account the revenue, the advantage shifts towards the Boeing 787-10. In a following piece, I will implement the fuel costs as well. For now, it can be concluded that the only reason Delta (NYSE: DAL ) prefers the second-hand Boeing 777-200ER over a new one is the advantage in purchase price and capital costs. A reason not to choose the Boeing 787-10 is the availability; the airframe is not available until 2018. Delta has not been a big fan of the 777X and the Boeing 787, so choosing for a second-hand Boeing 777-200ER is actually a step that was to be expected. Delta has the maintenance facilities to make a second-hand aircraft work. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
