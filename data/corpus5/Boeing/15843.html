Very Large Aircraft Market Analysis: Why Mini-Jumbos Are Closing In On Superjumbos (Part 4) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing 777-9X poses biggest threat to Airbus A380ceo. Airbus A380neo will combine capacity as well as luxury that the Boeing 777-9X cannot achieve. In the previous parts ( Part 1 , Part 2 and Part 3 ) I analyzed various airframes and had a look how they compare to the Airbus (OTCPK: EADSF ) A380. In this Part I will add a final conclusion that should give somewhat of an idea why things are not working for VLAs in general. First of all it is noteworthy that the superjumbos do have superior figures for revenue and profit per seat. This is caused by the fact that the superjumbos are bigger and carry a relatively large number of business and first class passengers, which increases revenue significantly. In my previous articles I tried making a fair comparison between the airframes by using a normalized seating. This was necessary since the seat counts that Boeing (NYSE: BA ) provided hold for configurations with very low seat pitches, which decreases passenger comfort. Figure 1 shows the five (numbered) aircraft in normalized configuration. The red dotted line shows the profit per seat of the Airbus A380neo and the black line shows the revenue per seat. What can be seen when looking at the corrected configurations is that only the Boeing 747-8I is able to perform better than the Airbus A380. This however does not mean that the Boeing 747-8I is better. The Airbus A380 has a larger cabin area which allows for the addition of luxury facilities such as bars. Additionally the Boeing 747-8I can carry up to 467 passengers in uncorrected configuration. This is a difference of 88 revenue generating seats with the Airbus A380neo, which should be able to carry 555 passengers. In corrected configuration this difference is as high as 150 seats. So the Boeing 747-8I and the Airbus A380 are not direct competitors, but demand for the Airbus A380 that occupies the high end of the VLA market is bigger than demand for the Boeing 747-8I which occupies the lower end of the market. So the Boeing 747-8I is not preferred because: It does not have the cabin area available that allows for luxury facilities Its carrying capability is significantly lower compared to the Airbus A380neo, placing it at the lower end of the VLA market where high density Boeing 777s are eating away orders for the Boeing 747-8I. Without decreasing passenger comfort it cannot compete with the Airbus A380 in terms of absolute profit. Some airlines are having difficulty filling the Airbus A380. One would think that for such airlines it would be more attractive to order the Boeing 747-8I. This does not seem to be the case. Airlines are preferring the Boeing 777 instead of the Boeing 747-8I since the Boeing 777 can transport an equal number of passengers but has a lighter airframe. Figure 2: Relative fuel burn per seat (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 2 shows the relative fuel burn seat. It can be seen that only the Boeing 777-9X is able to beat the economics of the Airbus A380neo. Currently however the Airbus A380neo has not been announced and only Emirates has shown interest in the airframe and has been pushing Airbus to come up with the Airbus A380neo. Figure 3: Relative fuel burn per seat (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 2 quite clearly shows why Emirates is pushing for an Airbus A380neo: All widebody airframes shown in the figure have a lower fuel burn per seat. The Airbus A380 is a heavy airframe with a dated propulsion system that cannot match today's or tomorrow's competition. Figure 4: Empty weight per seat (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 4 clearly shows the higher weight for the Airbus A380,. The weight has been expressed in structural weight per seat to account for the fact that in order to carry more passengers a heavier structure is required. Dividing the structural weight by the number of seats gives a fair measure of the structural efficiency. While all airframes stay below the 500 kg mark for their "design point," the Airbus A380 goes as high as 527 kg per seat. An empty weight per seat of about 475 kg seems to be more appropriate for a design point. The high OEW for the Airbus A380 can be explained by the fact that the wings of the Airbus A380 are able to lift the stretched version of the Airbus A380. So far we have concluded the following: The Boeing 747-8I lacks capacity and cabin area, therefore you cannot see it as a direct competitor of the Airbus A380 The Boeing 777-9X and Boeing 777-300ER are eating orders away for the Boeing 747-8I; airlines are preferring a twin-engine jet over a 4-engine jet. The absence of competition for the Airbus A380 does not mean it is safe. The design is already quite old, heavy and inefficient. Additionally airlines are having a hard time filling the 525 seats on the airframe. The combination of a low occupancy rate and a heavy structure makes the Airbus A380 vulnerable and an undesirable fleet member for airlines. More and more airlines have a tendency to add seats to the Boeing 777. This poses a threat to the lower as well as the higher side of the market for the Airbus A380. With the Boeing 777-9X coming up, the superjumbo could be losing its position as most profitable airframe as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: Profit for the analyzed airframes (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The figure shows that in terms of absolute profit the Boeing 747-8I performs best, but there are no airlines operating the airframe in a "typical" 467-seat configuration. For the Boeing 747-8I the corrected case is a better reflection of the actual case. The Boeing 777-9X is matching the Airbus A380ceo in terms of profit and additionally even has more LD3 containers available for revenue generating belly freight. The Boeing 777-9X has more potential than the Airbus A380ceo and could even threaten the Airbus A380neo, but again that's comparing a comfortable 555 seat aircraft with a less comfortable 406 seat airframe. The Airbus A380 itself is not a bad aircraft. The airframe offers superior cabin area, which allows for luxury facilities, and Gulf carriers are also using this. However, for other airlines such as Asian and European airlines it is hard to fill the superjumbo. The A380 fits the luxury standard of the countries in the Gulf area, but outside of that area the attractiveness of the Airbus A380 fades rather quickly. One of the things that make the Airbus A380 unattractive is the fact that the design is quite old. When the aircraft was being designed it featured revolutionary technology. Years later technological advancement leaped, leaving the Airbus A380 as a heavy design with dated engines. Especially for airlines that operate the Airbus A380 with low seat counts the airframe is particularly unattractive as it has low revenue and high per seat costs. Not a lot of airlines want to operate a heavy aircraft that's hard to fill when they have the possibility to buy a Boeing 777-9X that's more efficient, easier to fill and can generate the same profit. The Airbus A380 is too big and has not been sized properly, leaving the airframe vulnerable to the Boeing 777-9X. If Airbus would have analyzed the market a bit better they would have come up with a VLA that carries less passengers and had been sized down for its mission. Airbus thought that so-called mega airports would rise for which big aircraft were needed. This has not been the case and Airbus did not take proper action to make the Airbus A380 more attractive. Now, with the Boeing 777-9X coming up, Airbus can either come up with the Airbus A380neo or hope for a change in the air travel market that will require on-board luxury facilities. The high-end market of the Airbus A380 does not need to fear the Boeing 777X. The Airbus A380 offers a combination of comfort and capacity that the Boeing 777-9X can never achieve. The low end market of the Airbus A380 that seats slightly less than 500 passengers has to fear a bit more as the combination of low occupancy rate and belly freight weakens its position.
