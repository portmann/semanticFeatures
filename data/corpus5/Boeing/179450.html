Tesla's Apple Problem - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha An article in the Wall Street Journal claims Apple is committed to a 2019 target ship date for its electric car. A closer look at the claims in the article make it appear that Apple can achieve this target, which would put it in direct competition with Tesla. Tesla will be unable to compete with Apple because of Apple's deep pockets, talent, and an established network of manufacturing expertise. Since Tesla's current share price is reflective of massive projected future sales, any serious competition from Apple could quickly deflate its share price. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) just received troubling news that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) electric car project has a target ship date of 2019. Back in February when initial reports suggested that Apple was planning on building an electric car, very few details about the project were revealed. At that time, we found out that Apple had approved the project and put veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky in charge of it. The project was code-named "Titan" and has been secretly in production since last year. The latest revelations provide additional details about the project. The most significant point is that Apple is committed to a 2019 target ship date. Other revelations from the article are: In May, Apple employees met at a secure testing facility for autonomous vehicles in San Francisco. In August, an Apple lawyer met with California Department of Motor Vehicles officials to discuss autonomous-vehicle testing rules. Apple does not plan to make its first electric vehicles fully autonomous. If Apple can effectively break into the electric vehicle market this will be a game changer. Tesla will have to face a corporate behemoth with deeper pockets, more talent, and an established network of manufacturing expertise. Given Apple's strategic advantages over it, this may be the most significant problem Tesla has ever faced. Tesla faces a myriad of challenges from Apple with the most salient being its deeper pockets, stronger talent, and established network of manufacturing expertise. Apple has much deeper pockets than Tesla. According to Apple's latest quarterly report , it has $203 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Although 90% of this is housed overseas, it still has over $15 billion in the US. Its aggregate total cash on its balance sheets is the largest of any company in history. Apple has deployed its cash to increase its competitive advantage. It spent $6bn on research and development in fiscal 2014 alone, indicating its strong commitment to continuous innovation. On top of all of this, Apple is incredibly profitable, raking in a massive $10.7 billion in profits last quarter. Compare this to Tesla's financial situation. It has spent $1.1 billion in the first half of this year and has had to resort to selling additional shares to raise capital. After initially suggesting it would aim to raise $500 million to help fund its growth, it eventually raised $783 million by issuing a little more than 3 million shares. Tesla is hoping to ease its tight financial standing through high sales of the Model X and preorders of the Model 3 next March. It needs to raise as much capital as possible, especially since it lost $4,000 on every car it sold last quarter. Telsa expects to spend $1.5 billion in capex and research and development this year alone. While its understandable to spend a lot on the front end in order to achieve high returns on the back end, it remains an open-question mark about when Tesla will actually be profitable. This is one of the most problematic issues and Elon Musk has suggested that Tesla will not show profitability until 2020. In terms of talent, one could make the argument that both Tim Cook and Elon Musk are incredibly talented CEOs. But Tim Cook only has to manage Apple, while Elon Musk manages Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX. Although Musk's Ironman-like management of multiple companies is unparalleled, it means that he is not entirely devoted to Tesla at all times. This means that his deputies have to play a larger role in ensuring Tesla's overall success. Cook also has deputies to manage Apple's electric car project. Looking at who he has in charge highlights an additional advantage for Apple over Tesla. Steve Zadesky is an incredibly talented leader and is in charge of Apple's Titan electric car project. He received a BA in mechanical engineering from U.C. Berkeley and an MA from Stanford in mechanical engineering. Zadesky worked at Ford as an engineer for three-years before moving to Apple in 1999. At Apple, he first worked on developing the iPod and then shifted over to help develop the iPhone. He worked on both projects from their inception and these products have been incredibly profitable for Apple. These products are arguably two of the most successful personal electronic devices in the past fifteen-years. With a leader like him in charge of a 1,000 person team, it is likely that Apple's electric car is on track for success. While Musk centralizes a significant degree of power over Tesla's direction for himself, his Chief Technical Officer and co-founder, Jeffery Straubel, plays a significant day-to-day role in Tesla's operations. Straubel got his education from Stanford and received a BA in Energy Systems Engineering and an M.S. in Energy Engineering. Prior to working at Tesla, he worked for Boeing and co-founded a company called Volacom that specialized in high-altitude electric aircraft. Since working at Tesla, Straubel has worked on expanding Tesla's development of its own batteries and also helped set up the supercharger system. He is a talented leader that is hoping to reduce the cost of batteries in order to make the Model 3 affordable and attractive to the average consumer. There is no doubt that these two leaders are innovative and have the skills necessary to succeed. However, Zadesky already has two game changing pieces of technology under his belt, while Straubel is hoping that cheap batteries and high consumer demand will lead the Model 3 into the mass market. While a reasonable argument could be made that both these leaders have the potential to be successful, what matters most is who will be able to put their respective companies on top. In my estimation, I believe Zadesky will be more successful than Straubel. This will likely be the case not only because of Straubel's track record of prior success, but also because Apple can help bankroll the poaching of additional automotive talent to add to his team. In fact, this is exactly what Apple has been doing and hired Doug Betts, who led global quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ), in July. Apple will continue to hire and attract the best and brightest, which will ensure the long-term success of its electric car project. Tesla, meanwhile, will have to continue to deal with the problems of attracting talent because of an overzealous CEO. As Straubel pointed out: I try really hard to back away and put my ego aside. Elon is incredibly difficult to work for, but it's mostly because he's so passionate. He can be impatient and say, 'God damn it! This is what we have to do!' and some people will get shell-shocked and catatonic. It seems like people can get afraid of him and paralyzed in a weird way. This is not an ideal work environment and there is no doubt that Apple has an advantage over Tesla on this point. The other major advantage Apple has over Tesla is its established network of manufacturing expertise. Apple does an excellent job of finding contractors to do its manufacturing. For example, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (a.k.a. Foxconn) is the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds most of Apple's iPhones. It does so in an efficient, cost-effective, and streamlined manner. Although building a car is considerably more complex than building a phone, it is possible that Apple could reach out to Fiat Chrysler for help. With the recent hiring of Doug Betts from them and ties that senior Apple executive Eddy Cue -- who is on the board of Ferrari which is owned by Fiat Chrysler -- has as well, it is possible a partnership could develop. Alternatively, Apple could bankroll the creation of a car factory, which would only set it back a little more than $1 billion. It could then use its deep knowledge of supply-chain management to ensure that all of the parts and equipment necessary can be procured and used to build its electric cars at this facility. The bottom line is that Apple has multiple options it can pursue to build its electric vehicle, whether it be through subcontracting, a partnership, building its own capacity, or some combination of the above. On the other hand, Tesla continues to spend an enormous amount of capital on constructing its gigafactory, which remains an untested experiment on a massive scale. Tesla will cover $2 billion of the $5 billion total cost of the gigafactory. The factory will be built in segments and the latest videos show some progress in its development. However, it will not reach its potential full capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery production for its projected 500,000 cars a year until 2020. Yet the entirety of Tesla's future growth and profitability is contingent on the success of this unproven gigafactory. Suppose Tesla is somehow able to garner enough demand for 500,000 cars by 2020, it is unlikely that the gigafactory will develop exactly as planned. As this is Tesla's first attempt at building such an expansive and complex facility, there will undoubtedly be challenges in the developmental process. Tesla has already experienced developmental challenges with all of its cars so far and it will likely face additional challenges with the gigafactory. Depending on the severity and types of challenges Tesla runs into with the gigafactory, its ability to respond to them will determine its overall success or failure. While Panasonic will no doubt help and it is likely that the gigafactory will reduce the cost of batteries, bringing the factory to scale without setbacks is a near impossible task. Given the fact that Tesla has nowhere near the manufacturing expertise, knowledge in supply chain management, or prior experience in managing large scale projects compared to Apple, this will add to Apple's advantage over Tesla in the long run. Tesla faces a serious challenge from Apple. Although Elon Musk has welcomed Apple's foray into the electric car business, he is welcoming a competitor that could far surpass Tesla's capabilities. While I've outlined numerous problems with Tesla in the past , its Apple problem could mark the biggest challenge yet. Tesla investors should be wary of Apple's plans to develop an electric car. It is unlikely that Tesla will be able to compete with Apple in the long run because of Apple's deep pockets, talent, and its established network of manufacturing expertise. Additional details concerning Apple's electric car plan are needed in order to fully assess the extent of its challenge to Telsa. But based on what is currently known, it is clear that Apple has a number of key advantages over Tesla. As Tesla's current share price is reflective of massive projected future sales, any serious competition in the future from Apple could jeopardize these sales and quickly deflate its sky-high share price.
