A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In October - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing received orders valued in excess of $10 bn. As part of my monthly look at orders and deliveries for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) and a comparison between both monthly order books, in this article I will deal with the commercial orders and deliveries in October. Figure 1: Boeing orders (up until) October 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In September, Boeing booked 29 orders, with 27 orders for its single-aisle product and 2 order for a wide-body aircraft. In September, Boeing booked recovered from a weak September month and booked 59 orders. The orders were a healthy balance between wide- and narrow-body aircraft. At list prices, the orders are valued at $10.7 bn, but after discounts the orders have a market value of $5.6 bn: Oman Air and GOL Airlines ordered 29 Boeing 737MAX aircraft, while Boeing sold 1 737MAX business jet and received 1 order for the 737MAX from an unidentified customer. The orders are valued at $3.5 bn at list prices October was a good month for Boeing, selling 27 Boeing 787-9 aircraft to El Al, Norwegian Air and Qantas ( OTCQX:QABSY ) ( OTCQX:QUBSF ). The orders have a combined value of $7.1 bn and show the importance of the Dreamliner for Boeing. As can be seen, orders for the Dreamliner accounted for almost 50% of the orders, but are twice as valuable compared to the narrow-body airframes. Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) October 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Boeing's delivery of 77 airframes exceeded expectations. Deliveries were a mix of narrow-body aircraft (70%) and wide-body aircraft (30%). The estimated market value of the deliveries is $4.4bn. Boeing delivered 4 airframes less than expected Deliveries for the Boeing 777 fell short of expectations by 2 units Deliveries for the Boeing 787 fell exceeded expectations by 1 unit Deliveries for the Boeing 737 fell short of expectations by 3 units Delivery volume was slightly lower than expected, but I expect this to be compensated in December, which tends to be a strong month for Boeing since airlines want to take delivery of aircraft before year-end. During October, Boeing booked 59 orders and delivered 58 units, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of .98. For the full year, this ratio is .89 (excluding order cancellations). Boeing's full-year target is to receive 1 order for each delivery. So Boeing still has to add about 200 orders to the order book to achieve its desired book-to-bill ratio. Boeing had a strong month, booking 27 orders for the Dreamliner Deliveries were slightly lower than expected, but I expect a strong December month to compensate for this. During October Boeing had a book-to-bill ratio of .98, very close to the target for the full year. To reach this target, Boeing needs about 200 orders. I expect Boeing to meet its delivery target, which should also reflect in strong Q4 quarter results.
