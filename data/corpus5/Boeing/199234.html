ETF Hub Oct 12 2015, 19:11 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) says it expects to sell 150 more of CH-47F Chinook helicopters to foreign countries  through 2022, with the helicopter drawing strong interest from new countries outside the 19 that already operate it. Steve Parker, Boeing's VP for cargo helicopters, says news is possible before year-end about additional foreign orders for the twin-rotor heavy lift helicopters, through direct commercial sales and government-to-government foreign military sales. There are 874 Chinooks in service around the  world, Parker says, including ~100 CH-47 D-models, some of which  could be upgraded to the current F-model used by the U.S. Army. The helicopter is such an interesting piece of equipment,  it is absolutely priceless in certain circumstances and yet to expensive to justify except for the most wealthiest among us.
