I Haven't Fallen Out Of Love With Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Future earnings projections are more reliable than most, given a $489 billion backlog, stretching well in to the next decade. With the recent pull-back, the stock is now reasonably priced. This year, I have been desperate to add to my position in The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ), but the stock has been expensive, up nearly 50% since 2013, and then climbing to $158.31 in early 2015. However, with the recent pull-back to $132, the stock is now trading at ~14x 2016 earnings, a much more appealing valuation for the long term investor. There are a number of factors setting Boeing on a course to reach new heights in the not too distant future; I have already mentioned the $489billion backlog, consisting of nearly 5,700 commercial aircraft ( source; Boeing Q2report ), meaning Boeing could operate at full capacity for 5 years without receiving a single order. Lower oil prices over the last 2 years have been increasing airline profits (fuel costs generally make up approximately 1/3 of an airlines' total cost), allowing these airlines to upgrade and expand their fleet. A fast-growing Chinese middle class is increasing demand for international travel, which I explain in more detail later in the article. Profit margins are increasing as commercial deliveries continue to set new records, which when coupled with an increase in revenue, is a recipe for much higher earnings. $7.5 billion remains of the buyback allocation, which is due to be completed 'approximately over the next 2 years' . Boeing is in a strong financial position. As of the end of Q2 , Boeing had $9.6billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $9billion in debt. Revenue was $24.5 billion, up an impressive 11% compared to the same period last year, thanks to increased commercial deliveries. Operating cash flow was $3.3billion, compared to just $1.8billion in Q2 2014. Once again this was helped by increased commercial deliveries and higher productivity. Lower EPS guidance was due to a one-off $536 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 program. In addition, 14 million shares were repurchased in Q2, totaling $2 billion. Boeing will fall short of a 1:1 'bill to book' ratio in 2015 (ratio of new orders to deliveries). A strong dollar, weaker global demand, uncertainty in the US and a Chinese slowdown are likely to blame. Commercial deliveries totaled 197 for the quarter, 8.8% higher than the 181 deliveries in the same period last year. The 'book to bill' ratio is falling simply because Boeing is delivering aircraft quicker than airlines are ordering them. $18 billion worth of aircraft were ordered in the second quarter, suggesting a small fall in the value of the order book is not due to a lack of demand for Boeing's airplanes. The backlog for the 787 is a very impressive 5 years, and this is lagging compared to the 747, 767 and 777. By the end of the decade, Boeing will produce 52 737MAX aircraft per month, the fastest commercial jet production rate in history! There have been a number issues regarding a shortage of components, but will be resolved as suppliers increase production to coincide with Boeing, and is therefore unlikely to have an adverse effect on long term profitability. As for the long term , Boeing predicts 100 million new passengers will enter the Asian market every year 'for the foreseeable future', contributing to the growth of the jet fleet from 5,850 aircraft in 2014 to 16,180 in 2034. Between now and 2034, Boeing predicts the worldwide market for airplanes will grow from 21,600 in 2014 to 43,560 in 2034. Boeing predicts 38,050 new Airplanes will be delivered in the 20 year period, accounting for the growth in the market and replacement of existing aircraft, totaling $5,570billion! The 787 program will see another rise in 'deferred production costs' this quarter, and then Boeing say the number will start to fall. The 'deferred production costs' balance totals $27.7 billion, which will slowly be returned to shareholders as the average unit cost of each airplane will decline throughout the 1,500 airplane program. There is of course some downside risk with Boeing. A Chinese slowdown will likely lengthen the timescale for achieving the 2034 target. Although The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics claim 7% GDP growth was achieved in 2014, many analysts think China's actual GDP is closer to 4%, far below the double-digit growth they've enjoyed over the last 2 decades. But isn't this part of the usual economic cycle? No economy has been able to sustain high growth for an extended period of time without some kind of slowdown or recession to follow. China's middle class is still expanding, and these are the new customers that Boeing will profit from over the coming decades. Let's not forget Buffett's ~$32billion purchase of Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP ), a long term bet on aerospace, which he paid a very un-Buffett like 17.5x earnings for. Given that PCP is predominantly a supplier to airplane makers (72% of revenue is from aerospace), the acquisition shows Buffett's confidence in the industry. And Boeing's stock is attractive all by itself , at 14x next years earnings and a near 3% dividend yield, I think the recent pullback is a great opportunity to add Boeing to your portfolio.
