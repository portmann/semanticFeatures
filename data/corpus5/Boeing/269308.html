Why Is Delta Air Lines Still Trying To Kill The Boeing Party? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,674 clicks) Delta Air Lines continues to tell anybody that will listen the purchase prices for used 777s. . Along with a downgrade, Boeing is down sharply on the news. . The recommendation is for investors to continue focusing on the order book for narrow-body planes and ignore the noise generated by a customer looking for cheaper planes. . In an interesting news twist, Asia's largest carrier agreed to purchase 110 Boeing (NYSE: BA ) airplanes, yet the market appeared more interested in the cost of one used plane. The news bits continued a spate over the last several months regarding a glut in the airplane market and specifically the wide-body jets. See my original research on the issue here . The suggestion that the market is oversupplied with aircraft is naturally a negative for Boeing. With the stock flat to down this year, Boeing approved another large-scale buyback and dividend hike to take advantage of the massive order book. Is this story anything other than an airline looking for a discount on planes? For some reason, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ) took to apparently every media outlet that would listen to gloat over purchasing a 777-200 airplane for only $7.7 million. The following tweet capped off the promotion of this feat. The news follows the Q3 earnings call in October were Delta's CEO went on the offensive to proclaim a bubble in the 777-200s that were approaching 10-years old. Richard Anderson proclaimed the ability to buy planes at a fraction of the original cost at a suggested price of $10 million. The original news was bizarre because it is rare for an business man to proclaim to the world of this great deal that might attract a bidding war. Even more interesting is the apparent fact that nobody else wants the wide-body planes that aren't in high demand these days due to a market shift towards narrow-body airplanes. The news though smacks of inconsistent with market demands with China Southern Airlines ordering 110 Boeing jets at a listed value of $10 billion. The airline though purchased several versions of the narrow-body 737. With the expected travel growth in China, the country is forecast to need to add considerably to fleets. Common sense suggests that 110 new planes would trump one old plane. Wells Fargo though downgraded the stock sending Boeing's stock down over $5 for the day. As my research highlighted in the previous article, the 777 is only a small portion of the unfilled backlog. The narrow-body 737 that is the focus of the largest Chinese airline accounts for the vast majority of the orders on the books. At the end of September, Boeing had 5,656 unfilled orders that included only 541 orders for the 777 model in question. As of the end of November, the unfilled orders were stable at 5,648. The unfilled 777 orders were down to only 530, or roughly 9.4% of backlog number. Naturally, the wide-body 777 has a listed price of nearly triple the very popular narrow-body 737, but any glut in old wide-body planes is unlikely to impact the backlog and production schedules of Boeing. The more telling story is that Delta placed a recent order for 40 planes that includes 20 737-900ERs. For an airline suggesting that gluts exist in the industry, Delta sure is buying a lot more newer planes than old ones. Slide 35 of the Investor Day presentation holds the likely truth to the story. In essence, Delta is attempting to use the weakness in the used commercial aircraft market to gain better economics from the recent and future deals with Boeing. The key takeaway remains that Delta is trying to work the market for all the discounts possible. With a virtual duopoly for aircraft needed by commercial airlines, the fears of a glut probably provide the best opportunity to grab a discount. At the end of day though, analysts continue to ratchet up the EPS estimates at Boeing for 2016. The forecast is now up to $9.44 per share placing the stock at a value of 14.8x those estimates. The stock isn't overly cheap, but the giant backlog and large stock buybacks provides plenty of support for higher earnings in the future.
