Boeing: Stock Looks Cheap, Revenues Could Beat - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing (BA) is set to announce earnings on Wednesday, and we believe the stock looks good prior what we believe will be a strong quarter for BA. Using a Gordon Growth DDM with a $3.64 forward dividend, 7.4% WACC discount rate, and 5% dividend perpetuity growth rate, the fair value for BA is just over $151. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is set to announce earnings on Wednesday, and we believe the stock looks good prior what we believe will be a strong quarter for BA. All things considered, we believe BA is attractively valued. The stock trades at 15.74x forward earnings on expectations of 8.90% growth, giving the stock a 1.77 forward PEG. While this isn't attractive on its own, we believe BA is trading at discounted multiples relative to its peers. BA is trading at 1.10x trailing sales, versus Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) and Northup Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), which trade at 1.40x and 1.36x trailing sales, respectively. Many justify NOC and LMT's richer valuation by saying the two are focused in the high-growth defense space while only 30% of BA's business MRQ was defense; however, BA grew revenues 8% MRQ while LMT saw topline slip 5% and NOC's revenue grew a mere 2%. BA is also in a more solid financial position than both LTM and NOC, with a much more favorable cash-to-debt ratio. LMT and NOC, though, do have higher ROAs. Boeing could also be a solid dividend portfolio investment. Boeing has a forward dividend yield of 2.50% and an annualized forward dividend rate of $3.64. Considering long-term investors have doubled their money since 2012, this 2.50% dividend yield is particularly attractive and offers investors a nice cushion in what has been a relatively flat stock in the past 5 months. LMT has a lower dividend yield, but NOC's dividend yield is 3.10%. NOC's payout ratio, though, is 51%, which we believe is bordering dividend-cut territory. BA, by contrast, has a 39% payout ratio, so we believe dividend hikes could outpace income growth in the near future. Using a Gordon Growth DDM with a $3.64 forward dividend, 7.4% WACC discount rate, and 5% dividend perpetuity growth rate, the fair value for BA is just over $151. Operating cash flow took a hit in Q1 on a YoY basis. While the company generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow last year, Boeing generated less than $100 million in operating cash flow this year, despite earnings increasing YoY. This decrease was driven largely by a $500 million difference in accounts payable from a year ago as well as a $400 million difference in customer financing. Because capital expenditures actually picked up year over year, Boeing was actually free cash flow negative in Q1 with -$486 million in FCF. This is only slightly troubling for BA, considering the company has $8.66 billion in cash MRQ and has historically generated lots of FCF. The current investments should promote FCF growth soon. The company has solid expansion growth prospects in its defense and military segment, along with continued strong growth prospects in its core commercial segment. Boeing is forecasting rising demand for commercial airline pilots and technicians on the order of more than 500,000 new pilots and 600,000 new technicians by 2034, and this news comes on top of commercial revenues growing 21% MRQ. Military revenues were down in Q1, but contractual backlogs were flat or up in all defense and military segments. The combination of an attractive valuation, good dividend yield, strong FCF growth, and solid revenue expansion constitute BA as a solid investment, even just short of these all-time highs. We are also projecting a revenue beat this week. We are modeling for revenues of $24.24 billion quarter, above estimates of $24.19 billion. We believe Boeing's commercial segment will do $16.35 billion in sales for the quarter, a 14% YoY increase driven by a more favorable plane product mix. Boeing already reported that Q2Fy15 deliveries were up 9% YoY to 197, and provided the breakdown as follows: We can see that the plane delivery mix has shifted in favor of 787 and 747 this year, and away from 737. This is a favorable product mix for Boeing, since the 787 and 747 are more expensive planes than the 737. In Q2Fy13, Boeing made roughly $80.6 million per delivery. In Q2Fy14, that figure dropped to $79 million due to a lower mix of 747. We expect that this figure should be upped to $83 million in Q2Fy15 due to a higher mix of 747 and 787 than the year prior. Multiplying this $83 million by 197 deliveries gives us roughly $16.35 billion in commercial revenue. In Q1, military aircraft contractual backlogs grew 0.7% YoY, network and space contractual backlogs grew 6.2% YoY, and global services and support contractual backlogs were flat. Assuming these backlogs are spread equally, then we are modeling for 0.7% YoY revenue growth in military aircraft, 6.2% YoY revenue growth in network and space systems, and flat YoY growth in global services and support. These assumptions lead us to total defense and military revenue of $7.89 billion for Q2. Assuming Boeing Capital and Eliminations roughly offset one another per historical guidance, we arrive at just over $24.24 billion for the quarter. We believe the company will beat on revenues this week, and also believe BA is attractively valued heading into this potential beat.
