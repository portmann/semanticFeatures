A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In April 2016 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha As part of the annual order and delivery battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF / OTCPK:EADSY ) I provide a monthly overview and analysis. The March report can be read here . In this article, I will have a look at the orders and deliveries in April. Figure 1: Boeing deliveries up until April 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In March Boeing booked 69 orders. April saw lower order inflow: Boeing received 34 orders, 16 wide body orders and 18 narrow body orders. FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) ordered 1 Boeing 777, likely an option that has been firmed up Unidentified customers ordered 18 Boeing 737-800 aircraft At list prices the orders are valued $6.0bn, but after discounts the market value is closer to $3.0bn. Compared to April 2015, order inflow remained more or less stable. During the first 4 months of 2016 Boeing received 173 orders versus 153 orders in the first 4 months of 2015, a 13% increase. Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) April 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis) For 2016 Boeing guided slightly lower, reflecting lower production rate on the Boeing 747 program and the transition towards the Boeing 737MAX. In April Boeing delivered 54 aircraft valued at $4.1bn: Deliveries decreased by 17 units, compared to last month Split between narrow- and wide body deliveries was a 65-35 split, which also shows in the estimated market value of the deliveries. Lower delivery volume is caused by lower delivery volume for the Boeing 737 (7) and 787 (2) 10 Dreamliners were delivered, 8 of which were Boeing 787-9s. It can be concluded that the Boeing 787-9 will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries, which bodes well for Boeing as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash. Delivery volume was well below the monthly average. In order to reach its delivery target Boeing will need 63-64 deliveries per month for the remaining months this year. Just like in 2015, Boeing is targeting a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. In March Boeing booked 34 orders and delivered 54 air frames, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of .63. Year-to-date the book-to-bill ratio is .75, a modest decline compared to March. As order inflow tends to be soft in the first months of the year, .75 is quite a good figure but there still is a lot to do for Boeing's marketing team.

In 2015 Boeing achieved its book-to-bill target at the very last moment. Despite lower anticipated deliveries in 2016, I expect Boeing to be facing a challenge to achieve its book-to-bill target. In April 2015 I published an article in which I said that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles, but should decline at some point. In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now. With oil prices having declined ever since, chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first. With Boeing just barely meeting its target last year, 2016 might be the year in which Boeing will not achieve its book-to-bill ratio.
