Why Boeing's Strong Results Are Disappointing, But Offer A Nice Buying Opportunity - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing's EPS (strong beat) and revenue (slight miss) are not the reasons for Boeing's shares being down. The cash flow is the sole reason for the stock being down. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) published Q1 2015 financial results on 22nd of April before the opening bell. In my view, the results are mixed and have a negative undertone. In this article, I will explain why I am not really satisfied with the results, but why I think this is a nice buying opportunity. I will do so by looking at the analyst estimates, forecast (provided by Boeing) and analysis of the most important financial parameters. Boeing has quite a good record of beating analyst estimates, both on EPS and revenue. However, EPS and revenue are not the cause of major movement in the stock price. The underlying results as well as news about the tanker program, and cost and production efficiency on the Boeing 787 have a higher impact on the stock price. In one of my previous articles , I already pointed out that the Q1 outlook provided by Boeing as well as the consensus were conservative. The core EPS of $1.97 beat the analyst consensus of $1.81 by $0.16 or 9%. The EPS beat is quite strong and also shows Boeing's strong record of beating the consensus. Boeing's record on breaking the revenue estimates is slightly worse, but still strong. Boeing reported a revenue of $22.15 bn, $340 mln lower than the consensus. So Boeing missed on revenue. Figure 2: Revenue Boeing Q1 2015 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) As can be seen above, the beat on core EPS is quite strong, but Boeing missed on revenue. So the results are a bit mixed. The results are mixed, but this is not the only and primary reason for the lower share prices post earnings. To see what really disappointed investors, it is important to have a more thorough look at the other financial results. Therefore, I will have a look at the YoY (Year-over-Year change) and forecast. Figure 3: Relative results Boeing Q1 2015 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 3 and Table 2 show that all results, except for cash flow, showed growth supported by higher deliveries. Operating cash flow, however, declined by 92%. The operating margin fell by 0.6 points, reflecting higher Dreamliner deliveries that have a dilutive impact. Deferred production costs rose to $27 bn, showing declining growth in deferred production for the Boeing 787. All results look quite good, except for the operating cash flow that fell by 92%. Boeing always used the cash flow as a key measure to show strength and is failing to deliver a strong operating cash flow. Last quarter the stock jumped because of that very same cash flow. Boeing seems to be having a bit of a love-hate relationship with cash flow. In Q1 2015, the free cash flow was an outflow of $468 mln compared to an inflow of $615 mln last year. Timing is to blame for the poor cash flow, but to show progress on making the Boeing 787 production more cost efficient, Boeing always pointed at the cash flow and is now basically falling in the hole that it dug for itself. Although the cash flow is disappointing, I don't think there is reason to worry. Figure 4: Quarterly cash flow Boeing (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Looking at the cash flow pattern (Orange for the cash flow and blue for the quarter-over-quarter growth), quarterly cash flow grows as the year progresses. The annual cash flow looks steady at a level of >$9 bn, which is in line with Boeing's guidance for 2015 that remained unchained. Boeing has been very conservative with its guidance the past few years. The fact that it reaffirmed its guidance despite the disappointing cash flow shows that the coming quarters should be significantly better with quarterly cash flows in excess of $3 bn. Combining growing quarterly cash flow with the fact that Boeing reaffirmed its 2015 outlook for operating cash flow to be in excess of $9 bn and the annual cash flow pattern (Figure 4), there is a strong signal that Boeing will deliver solid cash flow over the next 3 quarters Boeing's EPS (strong beat) and revenue (slight miss) are not the reasons for Boeing shares being down. The cash flow is the sole reason for the stock being down. Although Boeing reported very disappointing cash flow, I see chances here. With the reaffirmed cash flow, the cash flows in the remainder of the year should be robust with an average of $3 bn. Despite the disappointing results, I think this is a nice moment to invest in Boeing shares. Results in the remaining quarters are expected to be robust judging from Boeing's reaffirmed guidance. Also, for the longer term, this should be a nice entry point: The Boeing 787 is getting closer to going cash positive on production. Increases in production rates in the coming years will boost revenue and value for shareholders. With higher production rates, a maturing Boeing 787 production and streamlining the Defense unit, the operating margins should increase. So, the current pullback offers a nice opportunity for the short as well as the longer term investors to buy Boeing shares.
