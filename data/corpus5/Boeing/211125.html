ETF Hub Oct 21 2015, 12:48 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing ( BA +2.1%) powers higher following better than expected Q3 results highlighted by a quarterly record 199 commercial deliveries, and higher full-year guidance for earnings, revenues, operating cash flow and jet deliveries. Boeing bears "could pick at the implied weak 4Q guide and sub-1x book-to-bill... but the beat, better cash and good 787 should drive stock outperformance," Citi's Jason Gursky and team say in an upbeat analysis . In its earnings conference call, Boeing gave the strongest indication yet that it is ready to cut production of its 777 mini-jumbo jetliner, according to Reuters, as the company voiced more confidence in the ability of its 787 Dreamliner to reach profitability; it also said it is still considering an increase in production of 737s, its other main cash cow.
