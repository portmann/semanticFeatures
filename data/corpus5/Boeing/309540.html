Boeing: In Spite Of An Earnings Beat, Here Is Why I Would Still Not Go Long - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Boeing (BA) beat earnings estimates, but earnings overall have dropped since the previous year. While the 737 MAX is expected to be delivered ahead of schedule, the Airbus A320neo will still be delivered faster. Boeing has seen a significant downturn in the cargo and defense markets. In my last analysis of Boeing (NYSE: BA ), I had given a personal view that the stock may remain rangebound for some time as a result of a potential decline in widebody aircraft demand going forward. In this context, I had made the recommendation that investors should wait for the Q4 earnings release before deciding whether or not to take a long position in the company. In spite of earnings meeting estimates, I am still skeptical as to the company's potential performance this year. With Q4 earnings having beaten estimates, the company has also met my forecasted earnings target. I had predicted that on the basis of projected earnings growth for 2015, Boeing's earnings should reach $7.71 given a 7% discount rate. With a $7.72 EPS for 2015, earnings are on target assuming a 10 percent growth rate for subsequent years: Moreover, Boeing has just raised its dividend per quarter to $1.09, which on an annualized basis will meet the $4.37 dividend target for 2016. While earnings have beaten analyst estimates, EPS overall has fallen by roughly 10 percent since 2014. In this regard, while EPS has beaten estimates, I stand by my assertion that Boeing should be seeing growth in dividends and earnings to the tune of at least 10 percent or above to justify long-term growth. Previously, I had mentioned that competition from Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) in the narrow-body aircraft market could pose a competitive threat to Boeing in this regard. This is particularly since the industry has appeared to increasingly favor utilizing smaller aircraft on long-haul routes in recent years, and this trend could be set to continue. Nevertheless, Boeing has kicked off 2016 with somewhat of a positive surprise, since the company is expected to fulfill deliveries of the 737 MAX model earlier than expected. According to the Wall Street Journal , Boeing will deliver the first model to Southwest Airlines in Q3 2017, and the aircraft is said to be at least 14 percent more fuel efficient than previous models. Should Boeing succeed in early deliverance of the aircraft, this will be quite a significant success since the 737 has accounted for just under 45 percent of the company's overall operating profit. Moreover, with an order commitment of 100 737 MAX planes by European low-cost carrier Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY ), the aircraft is set to see significant demand going forward. While this is positive news for the North American and European markets, Asia tells a different story. Much of Boeing's success will hinge on how effectively the model can compete with the Airbus A320neo, which is set to deliver 650 aircraft by 2016. In this context, Boeing could face a significant hurdle in that an earlier delivery by Airbus has highly appealed to Asian carriers such as AirAsia ( OTC:AIABF ), which rely significantly on short-haul routes. Therefore, Boeing has been losing significant ground in the Asian market due to an inability to keep up with Airbus in the narrow-body market. Moreover, while Boeing's 737 MAX does hold some promise for the company, other business lines have been declining. I had previously made reference to the fact that a significant rise in the cargo market would be needed to ensure higher sales of the 747-8 . However, this does not show signs of materializing and the company is set to scale back production of the 747-8 from 1 per month to 0.5 per month. Additionally, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division has also seen losses, with net earnings of $5.17 billion in 2015 representing a 5 percent decline from that of the previous year. Moreover, the company projects that it will fall short of the $97.2 billion in revenue expected by analysts, instead coming in between $93 billion and $95 billion. To conclude, Boeing still faces significant risks in the narrow-body aircraft market, and the cargo and defense business lines are on the decline. In this context, I am still not convinced that a long position in Boeing is sustainable at this time.
