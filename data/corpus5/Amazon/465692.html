Amazon tiptoes into banking with student loans - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Jul 22 2016, 03:27 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Stepping into the student-loan marketplace, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has entered into a partnership with Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) in which the bank will offer interest-rate discounts to select "Prime Students." The offer, which will shave a half a percentage point off WFC's student interest rates, will be accessible to Amazon shoppers who want loans to attend college and those who want to refinance existing loans. Not really, they are not lending money. It's just offering a coupon off prime membership. Students already get prime at a discount, so this is another added discount... My comment was vague. I find it interesting that they are going after their target market through a loan provider. I'm not sure how effective this will be, but I'm sure long range plans are in motion.
