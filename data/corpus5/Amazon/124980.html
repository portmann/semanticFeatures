How Vulnerable Is Amazon To A New Attack On 'Prime' From Jet.com? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Is Amazon Prime going to take a big hit from lower-cost competitor Jet.com? Why it won't matter in the next several years whether Jet makes money, as far as its possible effect on Prime. Why Amazon already has a built in moat to fight this off, but could be vulnerable under certain economic conditions. Following in the footsteps of the successful launch of diapers.com, which was eventually acquired by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Marc Lore is taking his ambitions to the next level, now launching jet.com to compete directly with Amazon Prime and other online retailers. While I'm not impressed with his given strategy, the fact he has already attracted $225 million in investment , with a lot more to come, shows that others are impressed with his strategy, or at least his proven prior ability to produce a business that can compete with the big retailers on the Internet. He is bypassing general retail sales to anybody in order to offer a subscription online retail model, with the purpose of being the low-cost leader in that sector. Early tests show Jet is able to beat competitors' prices by 10% to 15% at this time, although a lot of that is because of its willingness to take a loss on numerous items in order to fulfill its promise. In other words, the threat to Amazon isn't that it can compete on price directly with it, but that it's willing to take huge losses in order to do so. This is the loss leader of all loss leaders, and the question appears to be whether or not Lore can continue to raise enough money to scale to the point where he won't have to continue to lose huge amounts of money on each purchase. We'll now look at how Jet.com plans on competing against Amazon. First, as mentioned, it is offering access to its low-price items via an annual $50 subscription fee. That of course is half of what Amazon Prime subscribers must pay, although they're of course far better value. On the sales side, Jet asserts it won't be making any money on the sales of items, but revenue will come solely from its subscriptions. As of this writing, it has 100,000 subscribers, albeit none of them are paying anything for the service in the first three months. We'll have to get a feel for what type of churn the company experiences to see how sticky competing on price is. Talking to the Wall Street Journal , Lore estimates it'll cost about $100 for each new customer to sign up for the service, which with a goal of signing up 15 million by 2020, would bring total marketing costs to $1.5 billion. That's an average of about $300 million annually. One very dubious practice being engaged by the company is to acquire products from other online vendors it doesn't have available to sell itself. That will of course significantly cut margin and earnings, although the company asserts it will make its money only through its subscription service. Over time, it has plans to lower its dependence on that practice, but that won't happen until millions of dollars are spent in selling those products at a loss. At this time, the company only offers 4.5 million products for sale. In a short time that is expected to jump to about 7.5 million, and not too long after that, to 10 million. That may sound like a lot, but in fact, there are numerous holes in the product lines offered. That means Jet, for a long time, will continue to buy products it doesn't have access to and resell them at a loss, while having them delivered to the customer. The only reason this is even a story, with this atrocious business model, is the amount of money being thrown at the company. We'll talk later why Jet is attracting investment in light of the headwinds facing it, and why that's a real potential threat to Amazon Prime. With the obvious and stated purpose of Jet.com competing on price against all of its online retail competitors, we need to take a look at whether that's an area of concern for Amazon. My initial thought is this isn't really a game changer at all. If it were to have any impact on Amazon, I would think it would be with its non-Prime customers. They may be attracted by the lower subscription price in the beginning (you can't beat free unless you pay for the customer to join), but that would only be the case with those shopping based only on price. Concerning Amazon Prime's higher subscription price, I don't see it doing much to attract its current members. Prime itself is built to keep customers based upon real and perceived value. They aren't there for the main purpose of buying at the lowest price. With nothing in the works at this time to hint at customer retention, I see Jet as struggling in this part of the battle. Why would a Prime member want to pay an additional $50 per year in order to get an occasional bargain on what they're buying? This is where it gets interesting to me. It's possible Jet may not be attempting to compete directly on price, even if that's the stated model. It could be it is lowering its subscription price to position itself as a secondary service to complement Prime. That way it may be able to win some of the non-Prime membership, and then be part of the overall buying experience of existing Prime members, meaning, they would hold Jet and Prime subscriptions. But when taking into consideration streaming videos and gaming, among other perks, it's hard to see why saving a few dollars would be the attractant for Prime members to change to Jet. Where Jet could potentially make significant headway against Amazon Prime isn't so much on its low-price guarantee. That will attract some people of course, as any low-price promise will do. Rather, it's that low-price guarantee when tough economic times come that will be the greatest potential for the company, something we are going to experience again. In the Great Recession, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) did well, even attracting customers with more disposal wealth than they had in the past. If Jet can brand and position itself effectively before the next recession that could be a positive catalyst possibly bringing about the type of growth it's hoping for. That could be an economic environment that does break the value hold Prime has on it subscribers. To battle that Amazon will have to add more value than it already has, which will cost it to do so, or will have to continue to offer a variety of sales as it recently did to keep consumers' minds off of upstarts like Jet, and even Wal-Mart with its new Shipping Pass service, also built to compete directly against Prime, and of course companies like Jet as well. This reaffirms to me the online retail industry is looking to subscription services as a way to build more loyalty. With Amazon's Prime customers spending much more than non-Prime members, it shows those willing to pay for a subscription are more apt to spend more. As far as low-cost prices, I would look more to economic circumstances that lead people to find the best bargain. If Jet survives for a period of time, it could just be the company to do so. Jet.com has stated it will only generate revenue via its subscriptions. I think that's the reason it priced its subscription service at $50.00. That way if it runs into trouble like Amazon has in regard to shipping costs cutting into earnings, it has room to incrementally bump up the service without it causing too much concern for its customers. After time, assuming it can maintain its business model, it could do other things to add value to its customers. The obvious problem there is it would have to pay more for them, and it must face the same market forces Amazon faces, which is you have to deal with the costs associated with creating the extra value. Having said all of this, I don't see any of that being why Jet is a potential danger to Amazon. The reason why it is a danger to Amazon, is the Amazon business model itself, which has shown you don't have to generate a lot of profits in order to get a giant market cap, and to get a consistent, long-term upward trajectory of your share price. For the most part, Amazon hasn't focused on the earnings side of its ledger. Recent moves by Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) show that tech investors want more out of the more mature companies than the typical scaling strategy and promises of future earnings. They don't mind the companies spending on future growth, they just want it done in a disciplined manner and not just throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick. The point is Jet.com and its investors have to see the patience investors have had with Amazon for a couple of decades, and have concluded, whether the company makes any type of profit for years, they will be rewarded if and when it does an IPO. If not, it's almost certain the only other purpose behind the extraordinary funding is a big player would acquire it. That's the obvious two end plays to me. As for how that has an impact on Amazon Prime, if Jet is able to get the type of backing it appears it will get, it will operate with huge losses for at least five years, and possibly more. That means it will hold the prices at 10% to 15% below what Amazon charges. It will do that no matter what type of economy it operates in. If it takes longer for a recession to come, that would be a huge obstacle to the future of Jet, if it starts running out of money. If not, Amazon is still likely to grow its Prime membership, while trying a variety of tactics to make Jet look like a low-quality alternative. To me a recession is the real concern here. That's where the low-cost retailers thrive, and if they do it right, it will add some value to customers in order to keep them coming back for more. Amazon will need a plan in place to counter that scenario. Source: How Vulnerable Is Amazon To A New Attack On 'Prime' From Jet.com?
