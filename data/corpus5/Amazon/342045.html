Forget Amazon, Fast Retailing Is The Best Fast-Fashion Investment - Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:FRCOY) | Seeking Alpha There has been a lot of talk of Amazon moving into the fast-fashion business. While we love Amazon, we don't think it will trouble the big fast-fashion retailers. We do however think ASOS shareholders should be worried. Fast Retailing, UNIQLO operator, has ambitious expansion plans that we believe will be hugely successful. As part of its quest to take over the whole retail world, there has been a lot of talk recently of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) moving into fast fashion in 2017 through its Amazon Fashion Private Label unit. Fast fashion is a hugely lucrative industry and in our opinion the future of apparel retailing. But we feel there is a much better fast-fashion investment that investors could make today, and that is UNIQLO operator Fast Retailing ( OTCPK:FRCOY ). The report of Amazon potentially moving into fast fashion comes on the back of news that it has quietly launched seven in-house clothing brands . We don't feel fast-fashion retailers such as Fast Retailing, H&M ( OTCPK:HNNMY ), Zara ( OTCPK:IDEXY ) or Forever21 will have much to worry about, though. While online is clearly a meaningful segment for any fashion retailer, especially with click and collect, we feel bricks-and-mortar is the key for fast fashion. The proof is perhaps in the most recent annual report for Fast Retailing, which saw online sales account for just 4.2% of its $14.3 billion total sales. We put this down to a number of reasons, but the main one is that we, like many other people we know, use fast-fashion to satisfy an immediate need. It could be to pick something up to wear for an event in a few hours' time, or due to a sudden change in the weather. We know we can go to H&M, Zara or UNIQLO and pick up something that is both cheap and fashionable, as well as try it on to ensure it fits. ASOS ( OTCPK:ASOMY ) on the other hand could be in trouble if Amazon moves into fast fashion. We think of them as being the leader in online fashion retail and could see Amazon taking a large bite out of their $1.8 billion revenue. Another advantage that bricks-and-mortar fast-fashion retailers have, and something we really like, is the rapid rate at which these retailers release new stock. H&M actually releases new clothing every day. By doing business in this way, shoppers know that every time they pass one of these retailers' stores there is potentially something new and exciting on offer. Traditional retailers which release a new line with each season risk seeing shoppers just once per season. We see Fast Retailing as being a great investment, especially at the current price. As you can see on the chart above, the share price has taken a huge dive in the last year, making the shares extremely attractive right now. The company has incredibly aggressive growth plans which we are confident will be a great success. As of the end of the last financial year the company had 1,700 UNIQLO stores operating around the world. This is still a fraction of the size of Zara and H&M which boasts total store networks of 6,683 and 3,924, respectively. At present 467 of these 1,700 stores are in China, where it sees huge potential. The company plans to get to 1,000 stores there in the next five years, with 3,000 stores in China the ultimate goal. We expect store growth, including its other global brands such as GU, Theory, and J Brand, to be around 200 new stores per year for at least the next decade. We expect revenue to grow by an average of 13% per annum for the next five years. Rises in disposable income, together with the growing fast-fashion trend, and store expansion should make this a reality. It may face headwinds from a strong yen, but the Bank of Japan does seem to want to devalue it, so by the end of the financial year things may have improved in that regard. We believe the shares are undervalued at present. As shown above, the shares have had a tendency to trade at around 2.6 times sales, but at present are trading at just 2.16 times sales. We feel a rise up to put it in line with Zara operator Inditex is coming in the next few months. Right now we feel fair value is $36.10, and have a one-year price target of $40.58 based on estimated full-year revenue of $16 billion, shares outstanding of 1.025 billion, and a price to sales ratio of 2.6. This would give shareholders an incredible return of 33% from the last traded price of $30.33. So, there it is, if you want to profit from fast-fashion, don't buy Amazon, buy the Japanese retail giant Fast Retailing.
