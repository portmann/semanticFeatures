Amazon Walls In Its Garden - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has turned off encryption on its version of Android, the Fire OS. This reduces the overhead encryption delivers as part of its protection scheme. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) does not like the Internet, and I write this as a proud Amazon shareholder. What Amazon likes is Amazon. And Amazon's partners. The Internet is something different. The Internet is a wide, angry world filled with dangers. The world of Amazon on the other hand is like a calm suburban home where goods are delivered to you even on Sunday, and you know what you're going to watch today because it's included in the price and curated. The fact is Amazon dropped encryption from its Fire OS months ago , long before Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) got into its current tiff with the FBI. Encryption represents overhead . Most Fire OS users don't use this overhead because they don't leave the Amazon walled garden. Amazon doesn't want them to. AMZN can get away with this while other vendors might not be able to because Fire OS is designed around Amazon services. Disabling it degrades those services. On its main screen, the Internet is just one obscure icon. Books or movies or TV shows the user is binging on are most of what you see. And everything behind this is optimized for an Amazon experience. It's the only store in its mall - why should it want you to go outside? The whole purpose of creating Fire devices in the first place was to make Amazon the whole world for its customers. It was never about giving access to the Internet. It was about giving easy access to Amazon. The only advantage a Fire device has over real tablets is price. Amazon is selling them for as little as $50. You can turn a Fire OS device into a real tablet by dumping the OS for an open source Linux like CyanogenMod. This has been a hard year so far for Amazon shareholders. The stock is currently down $100/share for the year. A month ago, it was down nearly twice that. The only compelling reason to own Amazon's shares seemed to be its AWS cloud, with its $8 billion run rate, 50% growth rate and 28% operating margin. But even if you value that at 10 times revenue, or $80 billion, you still have to account for nearly $200 billion in market cap, and most retailers are being priced at a fraction of their revenue, not a multiple of it. Thus, captive customers. Once someone pays $99 for a yearly subscription to Amazon Prime, they cease to comparison shop. When they see something they like, they're more likely to ask "is it on Amazon" than compare Amazon's prices for it with anyone else's. It's too convenient. It is this lock-in you're buying if you buy Amazon's stock today. It's powerful. I know. I'm not only an Amazon stockholder, but I'm also a Prime member. Expanding the number of members from 50 million to some unheard-of figure will take time, but it can be done. Just as Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) can't really be stopped. You can argue that this is something investors are paying too much for, or you can argue that, whatever its faults, it is worth far more than the sales offered by any other retailer in the stock market.
