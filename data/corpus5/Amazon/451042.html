On Microsoft And The Hypothetical Xbox Spinoff: More Than Games Would Be Needed - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Pundits have discussed the possibility of an Xbox spinoff from Microsoft; it's a fascinating idea. Xbox on its own, though, is not necessarily a good thing; being part of Microsoft has its obvious advantages in terms of access to financial resources and scale. There is a way to enhance Xbox's value as a spinoff entity: combine an already successful media business with the console concern. There's been talk in the financial media for some time about whether or not Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) should spin off its Xbox asset. There are both pros (check out this article , as well as this piece ) and cons (represented by this article ) to this argument, but I believe management could seriously consider the idea -- assuming certain conditions are met, however. The console business is competitive, and the industry as a whole has had rough patches the last several years. Xbox is a high-profile, strong gaming platform, but Sony (NYSE: SNE ) has done very well with the PlayStation 4, and even though Nintendo faded into the background with the disappointing reception of the WiiU, there are still plenty of fans of Mario House, and the company is no doubt in a mindset to aggressively promote its next hardware offering. Gaming continues to be popular, but obviously, users have more choices. We all know the mobile story, the free-games-on-the-web story, the story concerning digital-download services such as Steam, and so on - all of these tales illustrate the point that the industry continues to go through massive shifts. Also, the law of diminishing returns is exerting an effect in terms of technological triumph - how good-looking does a game have to be, and at what price? Is it the processor, the algorithms that are the limiting factors involved in the equation of success, or is it the design, the story? Even further complicating the analysis is that game companies really need to be media companies these days. The concept of Magnavox Odyssey 2 surviving solely on "Pickaxe Pete" and Atari thriving only on "Haunted House" is an antiquated one; today, there would need to be a "Pickaxe Pete" movie and a "Haunted House" television series, as well as assorted comic books and action figures, to go along with the games to make the model attractive to Wall Street. Which brings me back to Microsoft and its Xbox division. Microsoft has built up an impressive brand in this space, but Microsoft also has other divisions that seem to be a bigger focus. Office, for one, and its transition from boxed-product to subscription-service is an obvious example, as is the company's Windows operating system. Times, as I've noted, are changing, and the company cannot rely on Windows (and its assorted missteps over the years) to grow operations, especially as the desktop has yielded its central dominance to tablets and smartphones. Acquisitions are key steps in any company's evolution, and Microsoft recently made a significant one in the form of LinkedIn. LinkedIn, though, is not necessarily additive to the Xbox franchise. And it sort of signals (in my opinion, anyway) that the company has different visions about its future; in other words, Xbox is obviously still important to Microsoft, but it probably will never overtake something like Office-as-a-service as a grand priority worthy of intense focus and ideation. Therefore, it is perhaps time to seriously vet the notion of doing a spinoff transaction involving Xbox. Thing is, it can't just be Xbox as a standalone concern, thrown out of Redmond with nothing but the design specs of its next console system on its corporate back. What would prospective shareholders make of such a beast; what would their collective confidence level be concerning a gaming hardware/software company suddenly detached from the most famous, not to mention extremely cash-rich, software company in the world, a company in which cyclical weakness could easily be masked by new iterations of productivity-software suites, Start-button menus, and various acquisitions, both grand and humble? Xbox-Spinoff might be more compelling if it had another part to it - a media component. Let's face facts - you can create IP that is composed of cut scenes and action sequences and RPG exploration, you can throw in all the quick-time events that you want, but today's bottom line demands a synergy between storytelling via software and storytelling on the big screen. Before cutting Xbox loose (if it ever happens; one assumes, though, that at some point, any large business starts to look at its assets to see what parts still make sense to keep and what parts might prosper on their own), Microsoft should attempt to marry the division to a media company that can create new revenue streams based on Xbox content. Not only that, but a media company would also be a good investment just for the ROI potential; that potential comes with an enormous amount of risk - i.e., some movies/episodic series are hits, some are not, and best-of-luck with figuring out the why - but many tech businesses have found that content could be key to value generation over time (e.g., Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )). Xbox's eventual destiny might exist in the world of movies, merchandise, theme parks, etc. Actually, if the company is to survive long into the future, I think there's really no might about it. Thought experiment: what if Microsoft had purchased Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE: LGF ), combined it with Xbox, and then spun off that entity to shareholders? Xbox was always supposed to be a strong competitor in the battle to conquer the consumer's entertainment room, and gaming was just one side of it - all kinds of services can be accessed through the device. If Xbox owned Lions Gate, that could have been one solution to capturing the attention of those who watch movies in theaters and on streaming services, binge the 8/16-episode season of the latest hot entry in quality cable programming, and complete level after level of the latest Resident Evil gorefest. Second thought experiment: what if Xbox had been paired up with DreamWorks Animation before Comcast saw the light on that value studio? What if both Lions Gate and DreamWorks Animation were placed under the same roof as Xbox? Microsoft certainly had the cash (it just needed the imagination). Microsoft also has always known that content would be important; it did at one time have its Xbox Entertainment Studios division. Going back to the beginning, my thesis rests on the idea that an Xbox spinoff has to be more than just Xbox; at that point, all you have is another Nintendo-like company that has to play the game of producing great first-party exclusives while praying for robust third-party attachment (also, there's deciding whether to eventually make the exclusive games available on other platforms at some point - I'm thinking about you again, Nintendo). Sony has PlayStation and a content studio; Nintendo seems to be thinking more about content production; publishers like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) are definitely embracing the content-is-king mindset. Microsoft would definitely need to buy a media studio before spinning off the business, or do some sort of partnership/etc.-type of transaction that could unlock value for shareholders (bonus thought experiment: Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) hooks up with Xbox; Netflix hooks up with Xbox; who knowsâ€¦).
