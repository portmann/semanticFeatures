Amazon gets back in the phone business - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Jun 30 2016, 03:20 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor There's no Fire 2, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is getting back in the smartphone business. Starting today, Prime members can buy an unlocked BLU R1 HD for just $50 or the Moto G for $150. Where's the money? Amazon's apps, services and ads are all over the phones even on a locked screen. If your a dedicated shopper this may be desirable, but if you want to kill the ads, you'll have to pay back the $50 subsidy. but it's only for prime members. so it actually makes sense for some of them to keep it on there.
