What The Latest Time Use Survey Says About American Culture... And Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Time Use Survey can help investors identify trends in how Americans are spending their time. Long-term trends suggest aggregate time spent working is in decline. Leisure time remains at elevated levels relative to past 12 years with sleeping and TV watching showing greatest increases in time. A will to work is all that is required to grow the economy at hand. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) puts out its annual Time Use Survey toward the end of June for the previous years results. The results of 2014 came out last week. The results of this survey help define American culture and see trends that are unfolding. These trends can help investors by keeping them in sectors that are seeing growth and avoiding sectors that are seeing declines in American's time use. I break out how we spend our time in three sectors: 1. Market work: This is the time use spend to work on someone else's behalf for a wage or fee. It could be an employer or a client for example. I have taken the average time spent per day based on the BLS survey of those 15 and up on the following activities for market work: Working and work-related activities (3.59 hours per day) Total market work time is 3.59 hours. 2. Non-Market Work: This is the time spent doing activities that you can pay someone else to do for you but you instead do yourself. Household activities i.e. cooking and cleaning (1.77) Purchasing goods and services i.e. grocery shopping (0.74 ) Caring for and helping household members (0.54) Total non-market work time is 3.65 hours. 3. Leisure and Sleep: These are activities that you can't pay someone else to do for you like go to church, train for and run a marathon, read a book, take a shower, eat a hamburger, etc. Telephone calls, email, other (0.37) Total leisure and sleep time is 16.74 hours. That's the overall summery of how American's spent their time in 2014. Regardless of whether our time is spent doing market work, non-market work or in leisure, it's all part of our human and American experience. What we can say about work is that, in my judgment, it's critical to give credit to the non-market work that gets done. The 3.65 hours per day in non-market work is more than the 3.59 hours per day in market work. Combined, we can get the actual hours worked per day or week. In 2014, 7.24 hours of time was used working per day per American who are 15 years of age or older. With 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, we get 168 hours per week. If we use 9.58 hours per day for sleep and hygiene, that leaves us with about 101 hours per week of waking time to divide between work and leisure. Americans spent on average nearly half on each in 2014. Data from the BLS Time Use Survey goes back to 2003. To give brevity, I used the same activities from above to get the aggregate data for each subset: For the major trend in aggregate work from 2003, here's the combined market work and non-market work time per week: There is a lot we can take away from this data. For one, American work culture took a hit after the last recession but it continues to remain down. Americans seemed to not have stepped up and labored more on their own account as market work declined. What investors can take away from this data From a glass half full perspective, there's tremendous hope and opportunity for standards of living to increase and for the economy to grow if time was to shift back to work in the aggregate. This is especially true for non-market work which is more discretionary. From a glass half empty perspective, this shift in time of becoming more and more of a nation of leisure is hampering living standards and economic growth and that's impacting the wealth of the nation. Specifically, the time use survey can help investors identify notable trends like that of TV watching. As we have seen, the time spent on leisure has been increasing a good deal since 2003 and especially since the last recession. TV watching stands out as an area of growth in how Americans are using their time. Here's a chart of time spent watching TV since 2003: One such content provider that has seen tremendous success is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Netflix describes itself as an "internet television network" and as of their last quarterly report issued in April, they have over 62 million subscribers in 50 countries. Netflix reported having 41.397 million domestic streaming subscribers at the end of the first quarter of 2015 with average revenue per subscriber at $8.41 per month. According the Burough of Labor Statistics , there were 125,670,000 households in the U.S. in 2013. Nielson recently noted that 41% of U.S. households had a streaming video service vs. 36% from the year before. So the growth in this industry has been staggering. Netflix's streaming service only just began in 2007 so they have very quickly taken a huge share of U.S. households paying for their service. Netflix has both benefited and very likely contributed to the increase in time spent watching TV in the U.S for the last seven years now. If TV watching time has peaked and Netflix's market share in the U.S. is saturated, they may be in for some tough growing pains in the years ahead. Lofty growth estimates may need to come down too. Just three years ago, Netflix share price was under $100 and is now $656 a share. The market cap is nearly $40 billion and revenue is estimated to be $6.78 billion in fiscal year 2015 ending in December, which would be up 23.20% from a year ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is estimated to increase another 24.6% in 2016 to $8.45 billion. At this juncture, growth for Netflix may be harder to come by. Especially with the likes of fierce competition from competing internet streaming services including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) prime instant video and Hulu , for example. While TV watching saw a bump of about 1.5 hours per week from the 2003-2007 year period to the 2008-2014 year period, it does appear to have plateaued. Any sign of the trend reverting back to the levels of 2003-2007 would reduce the number of aggregate TV watching hours substantially and that would impact the value of the content as well as the volume of the content sold. Although that does not appear to be happening at this time. It is this data and these trends that make me wary of more explosive growth in the TV watching category. Netflix is schedule to report second quarter earnings on July 15th. What I'll be watching for especially is domestic subscriber growth. Ideally, giving back that 1.5 hours per week to work would be in the best interest for the American economy as a whole. Source: What The Latest Time Use Survey Says About American Culture...
