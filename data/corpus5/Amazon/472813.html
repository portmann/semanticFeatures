Amazon Got Duped By Wells Fargo - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon and Wells Fargo partnered together to offer discounted student loans to Amazon "Prime Student" customers. Wells Fargo student loans are on average much pricier than federal student loans. Last week, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC ), announced a partnership where customers of Amazon "Prime Student" would be eligible to apply for a .5% discounted loan from Wells Fargo. Both companies entered the agreement in order to boost customers; get more "Amazon Student" subscribers for Amazon, and more student loan customers for Wells Fargo. I believe Wells Fargo came out way ahead in this deal and that is bad business for Amazon. Amazon brings on customers with the goal of having them for life, getting into the nasty business of student loans, especially with a private provider, may alienate the company's younger users. Amazon "Prime Student" costs $49 a year and is about half the price of a normal prime subscription. In order to qualify for the accounts you must have a .edu email address. The service is aimed at college students and offers a suite of perks like free two-day shipping on millions of items and unlimited streaming of Amazon's digital content. The service is great for Amazon's user growth because it brings on students and converts them to long term prime customers after four years. The Wells Fargo deal threatens that conversion process. Wells Fargo is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. It $12.2 billion of student debt on its books at the end of 2015, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of 2014. It is clear that their student loan business could use a leg up. When the deal was announced, Wells Fargo charged between 3.39 percent and 9.03 percent for a variable-rate student loan, and 5.94 percent to 10.93 percent for a fixed-rate loan. According to Reuters, under the new scheme with Amazon, a borrower who would ordinarily qualify for a 3.39 percent rate would be able to get a 2.89 percent rate by paying for a "Prime Student" subscription. How much does this actually save student borrowers? It depends on the size of the loan, but the E-commerce Times estimates that over a 10-year repayment for a $10 thousand loan, the borrower could save up to $300. While saving $300 sounds great, we must consider the other loan options available to student borrowers. Students hoping to actually save money by borrowing through Wells Fargo would need to be extremely credit worthy. The interest rate on federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1st, 2016 are as follows: Most students borrowing with Wells Fargo would be losing money by going with a private instead of a federal student loan. Students seeing Amazon craft a deal without having most of their best interests in mind is not good for Amazon. Having this deal work in Amazons favor requires two assumptions be correct. Firstly, potential customers for Wells Fargo's student loans programs do their due diligence and figure out what the most economical choice is and make an informed decision about where to get a loan. Two, Amazon "Prime Student" customers are on average more credit worthy than normal college students and can get the lowest possible student loan rate offered by Wells Fargo. If lots of students feel that they were somehow tricked into getting a more expensive student loan because of this deal, it will likely hurt Amazons customer base. Amazon doesn't get anything out of this deal except a new way to market their "Prime Student" service. This view is reiterated by John Rasmussen, head of Wells Fargo's Personal Lending Group, said that "Amazon's looking for increased membership in Student Prime. That's what they want out of this deal." Wells Fargo has a fledgling student loan business and I believe this is a last ditch effort to revive it. Most big banks don't pour many resources into this space, in 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co decided to exit the student loan business altogether because it was too difficult to compete with federal loan programs. Amazon has an amazing subscription business through Amazon "Prime Student", and the potential user growth through this deal is not worth Amazon tainting its reputation.
