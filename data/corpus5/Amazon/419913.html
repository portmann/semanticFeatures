Netflix And The Content Bubble - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Wall Street news: the Disney deal, Apple, upgrades, and insider selling. On Friday, May 20th, we reported a negative momentum shift for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which quickly shifted to positive last week, as the company was the subject of much news and rumor, sending the stock up nearly 12% for the week. The widely anticipated Netflix-media announcement about the exclusive Disney (NYSE: DIS ) content deal made waves through financial media as the stock rallied. The pundits were all over this, especially after valuation numbers for Hulu came in at $25B, up from $15B, according to an analyst at Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ). With these kinds of numbers, bulls suddenly validated multiples for Netflix. However, it should be noted that soon Hulu will be adding live news and sports to its mix. The Disney deal will give Netflix access to movies made in 2016 or later, but not exclusive rights to the latest Star Wars movie, released in 2015. So far, few financial details of the "game-changing" deal can be found. The big rumor, however, stemmed from The Financial Times report that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) executive Eddy Cue raised the idea of buying Time Warner at a meeting with the company's head of corporate strategy at the end of last year. Somehow the Street and financial media believe Apple needs to acquire and deliver content via iTunes, and should overpay for it with all that cash overseas, et cetera, et cetera. The bigger question: Is Apple really that desperate for growth? It seems every analyst or journalist purports to know what's best for Apple, and statements like the one from Eddy Cue only justify their opinions. A Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) deal feels unlikely, and predicting how Apple would buy and/or implement content is not an investment strategy. With those rumors, Netflix was naturally mentioned as an Apple takeover candidate, and multiple validation continues. Sometimes the sStreet tells you one thing as it does the other, and Piper Jaffray chimed in with a reiterated upgrade last week (not listed below), as didmany others. Back in April, analysts reiterated bullish price targets for NFLX without providing much justification aside from subscriber growth, and this after the stock took an earnings hit. In fact, many price targets actually dropped, but with the targets remaining significantly above the actual share price, the upside had to be reiterated. Obviously analysts see a lot of upside, and here's a look at what they've been telling us: Institutions buy, sell, and rebalance every quarter, but note that J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) all reduced exposure to NFLX significantly. UBS-AG also cut 20% of its exposure to NFLX in the first quarter of this year, but it wasn't enough to get into the top fifteen. However, heavy insider selling from NFLX executives, including CEO Reed Hastings, raised red flags. The television industry has changed drastically in the last decade, and with that we are nearing Peak TV, a phrase heard amongst industry insiders. Peak TV is best described in the Vulture article " The Business of Too Much TV ." Writers Josef Alalian and Maria Elena Fernandez offer industry insight as to why the cost and number of new television shows has skyrocketed. Good television is the new normal, and streaming companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) continue to drive up costs as competition for talent increases. The movie industry is producing more action-type movies, while high-quality dramas have found there way into this new television norm. The article, both dense and insightful, describes the new nature of television and the effects it is having on the industry: Movie stars are getting offered $5 million to do a single ten-episode season of a show, even as studios slash budgets for lower-level actors. The biggest changes are the ways in which the show is produced and distributed. Companies like Netflix pay bigger up-front costs to produce a show, and under this model the back-end revenue (syndication) all but disappears for the talent involved. This works both ways, and some backlash will only continue to drive up costs. The difference between the two models has sometimes led to friction between showrunners and the studios to whom they're under contract, network insiders say. "The talent wants to go to the fancy-schmancy new kids on the block," says one TV executive. Because of the creative freedom offered by streaming, as well as their perceived "coolness" factor - remember, Hollywood is just high school with (lots more money) - Netflix and its streaming peers are often the first choice for many creators, particularly those newer to the business. "The studios would prefer they go to the traditional networks, because, at the end of the day, the backend of a big network-television show is still worth more than [streaming shows]. If you woke up and said, 'I really want to be rich, and that's all I care about,' you would go and create a multi-camera [comedy] for CBS. And if you woke up and said, 'All I want to do is win an Emmy Award. I don't care about money. I'll live in a shack,' then you would get a job at Hulu or Netflix or HBO." (This agent was speaking metaphorically, of course: One rep says an established showrunner on a streaming or premium-cable network can easily make $60,000 to $70,000 per episode, compared to the $45,000 to $55,000 a broadcast show pays.) Studios have sought to find some middle ground. The industry competes with different models, and different sets of rules. Profitability, for a content producer like Netflix, doesn't appear in the equation, and the creative freedom offered from streaming is only rising in price due to competition from the likes of Hulu and Amazon. Cable networks like FX, AMC, and TNT operate with more creative freedom than the networks, and allow for financial incentive should the show become a hit because of ad support. Premium cable networks Starz and Cinemax also allow their studio partners to retain international rights, and thus bigger back-end profits. Eventually, Netflix and other streaming-only companies will have to provide even more money up front without any guarantee of a hit show. Or Netflix might find demand for more transparency from the industry, which will probably not bode well for bullish sentiment surrounding the stock. An example of some backlash from director Steven Soderbergh, who took the bait and produced The Girlfriend Experience for Starz and The Knick for Cinemax, said this about the subject in the aforementioned Vulture article: On something like The Knick, I participate in the foreign sales of the show," he explains. "So if I keep the show going, and we keep making it, and the license fees keep going up and all that, then I get to participate in that." Soderbergh is not a fan of Netflix's approach. "Their model right now is to overpay up front because they don't really have a backend structure," he says. "That's only gonna fly for so long, because at a certain point, if I go create a valuable asset for Netflix or Amazon and the thing blows up, I want to participate in that." He also echoes a refrain heard from a number of agents, namely that Netflix's lack of transparency over how many people are watching its shows makes it difficult for reps to figure out the value of their clients' creations. "Their refusal to open the books … is a problem for me, and I think it's gonna be a problem for a lot of people down the road," he says. "I'll take less money up front for … real participation in wild success. I'm always willing to gamble on myself." Comments from creatives such as Soderbergh hearten cable executives, some of whom insist that the streaming giant is starting to experience some pushback from producers. "Netflix is a very sexy place to go, and they're ordering a ton of product, and people are having great experiences there," says one veteran development executive. "But we're starting to see some talent coming back around and saying, 'You know what? From a business standpoint.' I think everyone is starting to be like, 'Okay, wait. This cost-plus model's kinda good, but is it good enough?'" But the rise of Netflix itself is the real culprit when it comes to the rising costs of producing television shows. The cost-plus model employed by Netflix will eventually cause the best talent to move closer towards a backend model because the best talent will want to participate in the upside and not have their profits capped because nobody in Hollywood wants a ceiling. Otherwise, front-end costs will continue to rise dramatically for everyone. In reality, probably a bit of both will happen. Streaming high-quality star-studded episodic television is all the rage, and just to get from concept to production can prove costly. Studios from California to Vancouver, B.C. remain crammed, and talent spread thin amongst the record amount of ongoing television productions. How crazy is the competition? Another quote from Vulture: One studio executive says the scramble for crews and production staff may be most responsible for the rising cost of episodic television. "Forget above the line - the below-the-line costs have risen drastically," he laments. "Because to pay for the experience and know-how and speed in parts of the country that weren't known as production hubs, good crews are at such a premium now. I'm literally having a discussion today about picking up a show before the network is ready because Netflix is coming in and they want to steal our crew. Would we ever be having that conversation in any other time? Holy [f---], we've got to get the show picked up because we're going to lose our crew. Those conversations are happening because the costs are crazy. Oh my! What a week it has been. More often than not, technical analysis tells you where the stock has been, but not exactly where the stock is going. Regardless, Netflix made some nice moves on good volume and now sits just below its 200-day moving average (-1.12%), a bullish week indeed. Have we seen this episode before? The week before earnings in April NFLX made a similar move only to be thoroughly rejected after reporting. False breakouts can fool investors and stifle short sellers, but the chance that this is the real deal must be considered. Investors, both long and short, need to pay close attention to price action as the next couple of weeks could solidify a bullish reversal, or re-confirm the downtrend for NFLX. The same could be said about the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) as the clock turns towards that unfavorable seasonality we've all heard about. Much ado about nothing seems to be the market direction, as Fed-watch remains boring and predictable. NFLX, however, always has a story working, and that makes the stock exciting for Wall Street as well as Hollywood. Fundamentally, Netflix must deal with reality at some point. The rising cost of content can only be contained by reduction. How many star-studded shows can be produced? And more importantly, how many will be hits? How many new episodic must-sees will the public consume? There is no doubt that Netflix can keep producing quality programming, but at what price? And the question on every investor's mind: How long can NFLX trade on content and subscriber numbers alone? A marriage with the likes of Apple plays as a Hollywood ending, but that was last week.
