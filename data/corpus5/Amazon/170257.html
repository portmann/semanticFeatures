A New Growth Factor For Facebook? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebookâ€™s Shop and Service features can redefine e-commerce. Many SMBs will have no need for standalone websites or apps anymore. The ability to make money directly from their Facebook Pages means companies will have an incentive to spend more on Facebook ads and drive more traffic to Facebook. There is no added value in going into detail about Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) well-known strengths. An unprecedented scale, growing revenue, a seamless transition to mobile and a solid balance sheet - it's all been the subject of extensive analysis which has contributed to the thoroughly justified confidence investors have shown in the company. To the aforementioned factors one might also add the untapped monetization potential of Whatsapp and Instagram. Facebook is introducing two new features targeted at businesses: Shopping and Services. According to the company: The new Shop section helps retail businesses bring their products to the forefront of their Page, while the new Services section enables professional services businesses to showcase a list of their offerings at the top of their Page. In the Shop sections users will be able to make purchases directly via "Buy" buttons provided by Facebook's partner Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ). It's hard to overstate the potential that this move generates. With more than 45 million active businesses on Facebook, it can redefine the e-commerce landscape in a very short period of time. There will be essentially no need for many SMBs to even build a website anymore, let alone something more expensive like an app. Negotiations prior to a purchase are facilitated with the "Message To Buy" button which will get potential customers in direct contact with the business in case they want to discuss details. Furthermore, customer service will be more efficient than ever since page admins will have the option of replying via a private message to comments or wall posts on their pages, and the Saved Replies feature will save time by allowing them to compose a template for frequently sent answers. There are two main instantly discernible ways in which Facebook will benefit from these features. First, increased traffic. Businesses were already advertising their Facebook pages a lot, but now they will have a major incentive to do so significantly more. As I already mentioned, for many types of SMBs there will soon be no point in even having a standalone website, and therefore their Facebook pages will be their go-to online location. Second, increased ad revenue. Facebook's ad business is already in great shape and constantly improving with advertising revenue growing rapidly (Q2 2015 ad revenue was $3,827 million, up from $2,676 million in Q2 2014). Imagine how much more advertisers are going to be willing to spend when they will be able to directly make money from users landing on their Facebook pages. A big part of SMB business strategy is centered on web presence, if not fully defined by it. It is, hence, no surprise that companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) are vying for the attention of the numerous small players and local services markets worldwide. Facebook, however, possesses the advantage of being in a position to directly link costumers to companies in a way no one else can. Sure, a user can click on a Google ad and land on a company's web page, but this is a one-off occurrence. On Facebook, if you "like" a company's page, that company will have everyday access to your timeline and therefore countless opportunities to attract your attention. As web usage shifts to mobile, there is little doubt that Facebook is where companies will want to have a strong presence. According to COO Sheryl Sandberg, more than one in five minutes spent on mobile phones is done on Facebook or Instagram. Facebook says that approximately 80 percent of its U.S. users already "like" at least one SMB page, so one can only imagine what will happen if firms take a big part of their sales operations to the social network. In conclusion, Facebook's new shopping and services features have the potential to massively leverage its existing scale when it comes to business presence and can be expected to have a strong positive impact on traffic and revenue.
