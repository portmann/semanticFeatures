First Purchase Of 2016: Wal-Mart - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long WMT. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Wal-Mart is cheap compared to peers and cheap compared to its own historical valuation. Wal-Mart is its own beast, there is enough differentiation between competition. Don't worry, there is a place in the future retail world for Wal-Mart. I was reading William Koldus's Seeking Alpha article and he brought up the LONG Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) SHORT Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) trade idea. Before reading his article I had no idea Wal-Mart was trading in the low 60's. I sold Wal-Mart back in early 2012 @ ~ $53. I had sellers remorse, forgot about it, the stock eventually rose to $90 last year and I always wanted a chance to buy back close to the same price. Sometimes wishes come true. I'd like to start with valuation. The peers I used in comparison were Amazon, Costco (NASDAQ: COST ), Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Kroger (NYSE: KR ). I kept Amazon off this chart because their PE was literally off the charts. Wal-Mart has the cheapest PE ratio on a 12 month trailing basis and it's not even close. It's also cheaper than the broad market. This time I kept Amazon in our comparison. Wal-Mart was the 2nd cheapest, 2nd to grocery store Kroger but was still cheaper than all traditional peers. I kept Amazon out of this comparison as well to make the chart prettier... Wal-Mart is cheaper than all of their peers in the popular EV to EBIT valuation technique. Why does the DDM apply? Because Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its dividend every year for 42 years. Dividend Growth Investors are interested in this stock, and if the DDM ever applies, it applies for a company like Wal-Mart. There are some assumptions. Wal-Mart's 10 year average dividend growth rate is 12.9%, the 5 year average dividend growth rate is 10.6%. With a $1.96% Dividend, using an 8% dividend growth rate assumption and an 11% discount rate - the model says an investor should be willing to pay $65.33 per share. Using the same assumptions but with a 9% dividend growth rate instead of 8%, the model says an investor should be willing to pay $98 per share. Wal-Mart is ALWAYS compared to Amazon. I agree they are competitors but they are DIFFERENT in how they sell to customers, Amazon obviously with their dominant online presence. Target stores look the most like Wal-Mart, I've seen Tarjay dubbed a "Middle class Wal-Mart". I think that's a fair comparison. Costco's concept tries to basically one up Wal-Mart's every day low prices model. Costco sells in bulk, I think Costco is a great comparison to Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, but not their regular stores or their neighborhood markets. Both Sam's Club and Costco have a membership model. Kroger isn't usually compared to Wal-Mart but Wal-Mart is the largest grocery store in America and it generated nearly 60% of revenue from the grocery segment. When I look at the competition one thing important thing stands out to me. Wal-Mart does things a little bit differently and they don't have a true #1 competitor. Yes they are competing for the same retail/grocery dollars but their business model is different. THERE IS A PLACE IN THIS WORLD FOR WAL-MART. They will be around. If you fear Amazon just bulldozing them over and taking all the market share I am willing to bet that you are wrong. The current valuation is a snapshot in time and it doesn't factor in future growth. If all of these peer companies grew at the same rate, Wal-Mart is the cheapest company and that's not debatable. But these companies won't grow at the same rates. Amazon is expected to grow at a much faster rate, but in this article I am NOT trying to predict the future/future growth rates. My point is that Wal-Mart is cheap and it is worth the risk/reward balance. Wal-Mart sells through Superstores, Discount stores, and Neighborhood markets, (plus Sam's Club). I like that one size doesn't fit all as they strategically place different stores into different markets. In Tysons Corner Virginia there is literally a Wal-Mart next to a Porsche dealership. You could go drop $100,000 on a new Carerra and then buy batteries for your latest iGadget. That's pretty different than the, "there ain't nuthin in our town but a Wal-Mart" rural perception. Different neighborhoods, different ways to reach customers. All of International operations are doing well with exception to the U.K. and China. Overall, Wal-Mart International sales grew 3.2%. Mexico is clearly Wal-Mart's #2 spot. This past quarter Mexican sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%. I like to venture off the beaten path a bit, and I've been to Wal-Mart in Mexico. It's busy, it's nice, and seemed similar to Wal-Mart in America. I thought it was funny they literally sold steroids there. $122.4 billion revenue on a currency adjusted basis, $3.4 billion or 2.8% growth. Plan to add $45 to $60 billion of revenue over 3 years. $20 Billion of repurchase authorization over 2 years. Neighborhood markets have had 19 quarters of positive comps. The headline news is that Wal-Mart is investing in people and technology. They are spending $1.2 Billion on wage increases and they are upping their online game. Wal-Mart invested money to help grow future earnings, the market didn't like those immediate outflows but it will help this company grow for the future. That's the kind of move a private company would have made, but the publicly traded company got a punch in the stomach from Wall Street. This stock is cheap. Very cheap. I'd be shocked if more DGI investors don't flock to this company. 42 straight years of dividend increases with a slightly above 40% payout ratio and still positive revenue growth. You should also see interest from people who want to buy the dog of the Dow, value buyers, turn around players, mutual fund manager defensive sector rotation... Maybe Uncle Warren wants to buy more. All signs point to Wal-Mart being a good deal. So what happens if I'm wrong? You collect your bond-like 3% dividend yield, reinvest it into other companies and be happy. Wal-Mart is unique and they will be around. At this price the downside risk is limited, but the upside has a lot of potential. Tagged: Dividends & Income , Services
