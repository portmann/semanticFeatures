Amazon's Clever Streaming Strategy: Downloads - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon Prime Video is still the only major streaming service with download capability. The significance of this goes beyond just the convenience the download option offers. Most streaming video content on all major services remains non-exclusive. But consumers will still assign credit for that content to just one service. About seven weeks ago, I published an article arguing that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video was being underestimated as a streaming service because its download option, which is almost unique on the market, would not appear in peak downstream Internet traffic reports. The article received a considerable pushback from many, who argued, among other things, that the service was both too unknown and too inconsequential to have the kind of impact I ascribed to it. In keeping with my usual practice, I didn't publish on the topic again right away. I wanted to give some time for the other side's arguments to sink in and really bounce around inside my head. But having considered it again and watched the ongoing evolution in video streaming, I have not changed my view. In fact, I think if anything I might have underestimated downloads significance. Amazon spent $1.3 billion on Prime Instant Video content in 2014 and will spend even more this year. Meanwhile Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) spent $3.2 billion on content in 2014, a number that will swell to $5 billion this year. Assuming Amazon's spending is growing at even a proportional rate, it will be above $2 billion in 2016. And as it is trying to catch up with Netflix it may grow even faster. Obviously, maximizing the value of such large investments is crucial. An increasing percentage of this money goes to exclusive content deals that keep content off of competing services. Netflix has made it clear it intends to focus on exclusives from here on out, and Amazon has signed an increasing number of them as well. But a large amount of content remains un-exclusive, even now. Amazon and Netflix shared Epix content for three years until last year , when Netflix decided to drop it because - wait for it - it wasn't exclusive. But Amazon didn't get to enjoy even a moment of exclusive bliss: Hulu picked up Epix right where Netflix left off. Many other movies and TV shows are also shared between competing providers, including not just other SVOD providers but also other traditional premium channels such as Showtime or Starz, which have all released their own apps for their Pay-TV subscribers and two of which (HBO and Showtime) have released stand-alone apps for cord-cutters as well. As a late arrival to the streaming video space, with less than half the content spending of Netflix, Amazon cannot hope to secure nearly as many exclusives, which for obvious reasons often raise the cost significantly. Most of its content will therefore be content that is shared with other services. Although Prime Instant Video boasts "thousands and thousands" of titles, its "Exclusive: Not on Netflix" category currently comprises exactly 478 titles. And almost half of those are not really exclusive, since they are back seasons of TimeWarner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO shows which are also available on HBO itself. A smattering of one-off deals for second-tier networks programming, a block of children's shows from Viacom , the CBS (NYSE: CBS ) summer slate and a few NBCUniversal shows (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) are its only truly exclusive fare. The rest is shared content. But it is highly unlikely that someone will subscribe to multiple SVOD providers all offering identical or nearly identical catalogues. HBO and Amazon share HBO shows, Hulu and Amazon share Epix, and Netflix and Amazon still share most of the rest of the Prime catalogue, including large blocks of content from CBS , NBC, and others. Downloads obviously help Amazon differentiate its offering. "We offer downloads and the other guys don't." To those who take a lot of plane trips or have slow internet, that certainly has value. But the real impact of download rights is not the differentiation, but the elevation. Most consumers don't have official training in economic theory, but economics is actually the study of human behavior in the real world, so whether they do it consciously or sub-consciously we can expect them to follow the basic principles of diminishing marginal utility. Somewhere in their head they will rank all the various services. "If I could only have one it would be this one. This would be my second pick, my third, etc." This ranking will reflect both costs (how much everyone charges) and benefits (how much content it includes that they want to watch.) But a lot of that content is non-exclusive. From a consumer standpoint, that's actually not ideal. If a consumer pays $99 for Amazon Prime Video and pays $7.99 for Hulu and pays $9.99 a month for Netflix, they're actually going to be a little upset when they log in and the see the same content in all three places. It will feel like they paid for it three times. So as they weigh the price and benefits of that non-exclusive content, which of the three services gets credit for delivering it, and which two get resented for making them pay for it a second and third time? Say someone likes three shows, A, B, and C. Netflix offers A and B, Amazon offers B and C. Who gets credit for show B? How do consumers decide whose "benefit" column non-exclusive content goes in? Prior to now, if the consumer was being rational and following marginal utility, that actually depended on A and C. Which one do they like more? Whichever one they like more is the one they attach higher priority to, the one they bought "first." And since both shows came with show B thrown in at no extra cost, whichever one they bought first, or would buy first, gets credit for its own show and show B as well. The other service has to hope that its exclusive content alone is enough to convince the consumer to pay their subscription fee. Show B is already in the "pile," so the marginal benefit of a second SVOD is only the exclusive content. Netflix spends over twice what Amazon does, and Hulu has access to next-day content from three of the top four broadcast channels (ABC, NBC, and FOX.) We can't get inside consumers' heads, but Amazon Prime Video probably wasn't first on many people's priority lists. But now, enter downloads. Marginal utility, remember. If the consumer buys Show B through Netflix or Hulu, and later discovers they need to download it, they'll have to buy Amazon Prime anyway to have that option. On the other hand, if they buy Amazon Prime, they won't need to spend any extra money to save money in a dead zone. Some customers already know they will need downloads and some already know that they won't, but a lot of customers probably just aren't sure. And they might well attach some value to the piece of mind of knowing that they have the option to download if they need it. If that value is enough to convince them to rank Amazon higher than the other services, that does much more than just tinker with the Prime renewal rate at the margins. It suddenly shoves a bunch of non-exclusive content shared with Netflix and Hulu to Amazon's side of the ledger. It makes them see Amazon Prime Video as the service that "got" them all that non-exclusive content. Hulu and even Netflix are just the ones stupid enough to make them pay for it again. Amazon probably will not be matching Netflix's content spend for the foreseeable future. The competition for exclusive fare is becoming increasingly cutthroat, and prices are rising accordingly. But far from being an also ran in exclusives, Amazon may actually be following a very clever strategy of deliberately not throwing quite so much money at them. If downloads can put them ahead, they can pay non-exclusive rates and still get most of the benefits, in the form of customer loyalty, engagement, and retention, that exclusive fare would have brought them. I know many believe I ascribe too much importance to the download option. But I truly think many are under-estimating just how pivotal downloads can be, both for Amazon and for the course of the streaming video competition. With so much non-exclusive content being shared between services, the stakes are high for whoever manages to push themselves to the head of the pack in that regard. I believe with downloads, Amazon has taken a substantial step in that direction.
