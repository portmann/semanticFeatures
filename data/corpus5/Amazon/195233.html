Qualcomm: Microsoft Remains Loyal To Snapdragon Processors - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha It is to the great benefit of Qualcomm that Microsoft has formidable presence in the enterprise market. Unlike Samsung, which will only use the Snapdragon 820 on some versions of the Galaxy S7, Microsoft again went 100% Snapdragon for its new flagship Lumia phones. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stock definitely benefited from the recent news that Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) will use the Snapdragon 820 next year for some models of its upcoming Galaxy S7. I also expect that Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) exclusive use of Snapdragons on its new flagship Lumia handsets would also inspire more bulls to rally around QCOM. The Microsoft Lumia 950 Windows 10 phone has the hexa-core Snapdragon 808 and the Lumia 950 XL has the octa-core Snapdragon 810 v2.1. These two Windows 10 phones are likely to be available for purchase this last quarter of 2015. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is already listing accessories for these two Windows 10 smartphones. The commercial launch might therefore happen sooner than we expect. A comparative specs sheet reveals these two Lumia phones are geared toward affluent customers and enterprise clients. This is great because Microsoft has a bigger clout than Samsung on the U.S. enterprise market. I expect the Lumia 950 and 950 XL phones to be play an important role in selling more Snapdragon 808 and Snapdragon 810 processors. Microsoft's ambitious pricing for the 5.7-inch Lumia 950 XL puts it in direct competition with the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6S Plus and the Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Nexus 6P. Slapping a $649 price tag showed Microsoft is confident enough to go toe to toe against the most expensive phablets. Apple is no doubt the undisputed champion when it comes to selling luxury gadgets. However, judging by Microsoft's pricey Surface Book laptop and new Lumia flagship phones, Nadella is only too willing to scrap it out with Apple's most expensive products. While Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) benefits from Microsoft's move to become a high-end laptop vendor, Qualcomm is the derivative beneficiary of Microsoft's aggressive push toward high-end Windows 10 high-end phones. The two Snapdragon-powered Lumia phones are fully compatible with Continuum for Phones. These makes them great alternatives to the Pocket PC concept of the Acer Jade Primo . The Jade Primo also has Snapdragon 808 inside it. Microsoft and Acer's Windows 10 Mobile OS high-end phones could all function as desktop computers when docked to a monitor or TV set. The Microsoft Display Dock transforms Windows 10 phones into useful office computers. Microsoft made efforts to code its mobile Office apps and Outlook scale properly to give people real desktop PC-like productivity when using a Windows 10 smartphone. Continuum is a killer feature of Windows 10 phones that Apple or Samsung will find hard to match. Those two lack industry-standard software that is as powerful and famous as Microsoft's Office. I therefore expect more enterprise clients to favor the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL over other high-end smartphones that cannot function as pocket computers. Small and medium businesses will appreciate the cost savings of buying just a Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 phone instead of replacing their entire set of older desktop PCs. QCOM is a Buy. I'm now convinced this ARM-based fabless semiconductor company has a solid lock on Lumia phones. The economic benefits of Microsoft's move toward selling high-end phones is easy to comprehend. Instead of just supplying entry-level chips like the Snapdragon 400 for sub-$100 Lumia phones, Qualcomm will now be able to ride Microsoft's big need to sell its high-end $600++ Windows 10 phones. Microsoft sold tens of millions of its Lumia phones last year. However, most of them are of the budget variety. Microsoft finally realized that its bad business to sell cheap Windows phones at a loss. Unlike Google , Microsoft still lacks the mobile advertising platform to make selling dirt-cheap hardware a winning proposition. Microsoft is therefore moving toward higher-priced phones. Qualcomm will supply Microsoft the necessary flagship-worthy Snapdragons to make next-generation Lumia smartphones remain competitive versus the best Apple and Samsung phones. Qualcomm shareholders would only truly appreciate Microsoft's loyalty once more higher-margin Snapdragons gets inside premium phones. The margin on a Snapdragon 810 v2.1 is obviously higher than that of the Snapdragon 400/410. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
