Amazon Success Changes The Technology Game - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The decision by GE to close data centers and commit to Amazon's cloud is the year's biggest tech story. Even open source can no longer compete with Amazon's lock-in. The realization that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Web Services now dominates public cloud has caused the value of that stock to more than double this year. But it has also changed the terms of the open source debate, something I have covered for a decade now, and thus the entire tech marketplace. Thanks to the Supreme Court non-decision that allows Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, the directions for connecting to software, to be protected by copyright, the AWS cloud is now proprietary. But nobody cares. It had long been believed by technologists that open source OpenStack would replace public cloud with a private-public "hybrid" where enterprises avoided lock-in. But General Electric's (NYSE: GE ) announcement a few months ago that it will go "all-in" with Amazon and start closing data centers has changed the rules of the game. Suddenly, moves like Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) to "open source" its OneOps code in order to let companies avoid Amazon lock-in appear futile, and its request that companies help it build another open source cloud stack is drawing guffaws from technology writers who a year ago were cheering any effort to evade Amazon's dominance. As open source guru Tim O'Reilly noted recently, "there's ideological open and there's pragmatic open." Cheap, accessible Amazon represents pragmatic open, and that may well be open enough. Not everyone is yet willing to cede control of the future to Amazon's cheap cloud. Because Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has a cheap cloud, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is not throwing up a white flag either. Companies that depend on Amazon's cloud while competing with it in other areas, like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), are desperate to keep the door open for alternatives. This is why Netflix has released its own open source tool, Spinnaker. The idea is that customers should be able to simultaneously manage workloads on Google and Microsoft Azure even as they remain dependent on Amazon. I'm with you, but I have one foot out the door, is the message, even if Amazon has a firm hold on the other foot. For those who don't understand why the value of Amazon stock has doubled, maybe this discussion of open source politics can demonstrate the point. Amazon's aggressive $1 billion/quarter CapEx spend, and regular price cuts, succeeded in giving its cloud a dominant position against companies that other pieces of Amazon - the store and the media operation - also compete against. It is becoming increasingly clear to technologists that resistance to this trend is futile, that even the largest tech companies must find a way to live in an Amazon world, rather than fight it. And this is probably the biggest business story of the year, maybe of the decade. Because if even open source has surrendered to Amazon's API, there's no one to stand in its way.
