Amazon: What's In Your Wallet? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon India could be launching a digital wallet to strengthen its e-commerce platform. A potential positive to AMZN in the near term. The Times of India reported that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) could be launching a digital wallet in India as part of its plan to build an online payment business. The company could create its own wallet or pursue potential acquisitions. I believe that there is credibility to this story given the importance of digital wallet to an e-commerce platform. When we look at the success that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) achieved with Alipay and how it drove growth in its core e-commerce platforms, it is inevitable for AMZN to create its own digital wallet to strengthen its ecosystem and control the e-commerce value chain. Although this initiative may start in India, I would not rule out a similar initiative in North America where the company will directly compete with Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ), by incorporating it as part of its Prime ecosystem, and the banks. Longer-term implication of the payment platform could allow the company to become a relevant digital wallet player in the retail segment where Prime users could use Amazon Pay to pay for items at the store level while accumulating loyalty points that are eventually used on Amazon. Such initiatives have been used by the offline retailers for several years, and it is not difficult to see AMZN replicating a similar model in the digital world. I remain bullish on AMZN and continue to like its Prime ecosystem expansion story. India has been a hotbed for e-commerce competition given the weak logistics infrastructure and growing smartphone penetration. This environment is highly favourable for e-commerce growth with the launch of local players such as Flipkart (Private: FPKT ) and Snapdeal, as well as foreign companies such as Amazon. Just last week, Flipkart launched its own digital wallet to gain a stronger grip on its e-commerce shopping experience and AMZN certainly does not want to fall behind. Amazon could be looking to roll out its own digital wallet but could also be looking to acquire online payment start-ups. Worth noting is that the company could launch its own digital wallet through Qwikcilver, which AMZN owns a minority stake and has a license to operate a semi-closed loop wallet. Qwikcilver already powers AMZN's prepaid gift cards that are widely popular in India, so it makes sense for the company to maintain some consistency. However, Qwikcilver may not be as scalable as some existing players on the market such as Paytm, which is the largest digital wallet business in India with more than 120m users. Acquiring Paytm will instantly give AMZN an edge over the local rivals including Snapdeal's FreeCharge, Ola Money, Mobikwik, Oxigen and Citrus. With the number of digital wallet transaction more than doubling to 153m during the December quarter vs. 66m a year ago and the value reaching Rs 55.3b from Rs 22.2b, I believe that a near-term acquisition can allow AMZN to quickly gain a foothold in the market by leveraging the platform's brand equity and customer base. I remain bullish on AMZN. Growing its financial arm is a long-term positive to the company's ecosystem, and assuming that it restarts its payment platform in North America by leveraging Prime, we could see Amazon becoming a serious contender in the digital wallet space.
