The Gaming Community Can Boost Amazon Prime Subscriptions - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Amazon wants to attract more subscribers by offering a discount on new game title purchases. Building good relationships with gamers could attract more Amazon Prime subscriptions. Amazon Prime subscribers account for almost half of online purchases. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) growth is hugely influenced by its loyalty program. Prime subscribers account for almost half of purchases made on Amazon's marketplace since early last year. It is therefore great news that the company is doing its best to retain and attract new Prime subscribers by giving a 20% discount on new games. This is a great way for Amazon to better monetize the huge population of gamers. Giving discounts on new games is an easy way to attract more people to Amazon Prime. It already does a healthy business of selling games. Therefore, it makes sense for the company to go after the gaming community. Building good relationships with gamers can be a long-term winning strategy for Amazon. There are more than 1.4 billion PC/console gamers . They represent a huge pool of purchasing power that the company could monetize through Prime subscriptions and online shopping. The average age of video gamers is now 35 years . The gaming community is full of people that are likely employed with disposable income. People with disposable income are ideal customers for online shopping sites like Amazon. A person who doesn't mind buying 2-3 $50 PC games per month can certainly afford the $99 annual fee of Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime already offers a lot of privileges . The generosity of Amazon is likely why it is estimated that 38% of U.S. household are now Prime account holders. Cowen Group estimates that there are now around 41 million members in the U.S. alone. The Amazon Prime Day event added another 3 million subscribers last December. This estimated 44-million strong Amazon Prime army is a strong tailwind for the company. However, keeping a huge number of subscribers consistently happy takes constant pampering. The latest offer of 20% discount on new game titles is another effective way for Amazon to retain the loyalty of its Prime subscribers. The potential economic benefit of the company going after gamers is two-fold: It can increase the number of Amazon Prime subscribers, which could lead to more people doing repeat online purchases. Yes, Amazon Prime's offer of 20% discount only applies to boxed versions of games. However, this is just fine, because physical sales still accounts for 2/3rd of new video game sales. The gamer who used to buy most of his boxed PC/Console game from retail stores like GameStop (NYSE: GME ) will find it more cost-effective and convenient to just sign up for an Amazon Prime account. The free Same-Day/2-day shipping means a person no longer needs to go to a GameStop branch to get the newest games. Amazon and its publisher partners might also include downloadable versions of games inside the 20% discount program of Prime. I speculate that the 20% discount could eventually expand to include older game titles. Game publishers can monetize their older games by offering them inside Amazon Prime's game discounting program. If GameStop can offer 2-year old game titles with deep discounts, Amazon's online marketplace can also be used by game publishers to sell their unsold inventories of DVD games. GameStop is just one of the firms that could suffer from Amazon's pursuit of gamers. Its latest move can also hurt Best Buy's (NYSE: BBY ) Game Club service. The $30/2-year membership plan of My Best Buy Game Club Unlocked also offers 20% discounts on purchases of new game title releases. Going forward, Best Buy is unlikely to see serious growth in Game Club subscriptions. Amazon Prime is now targeting the same core audience of gaming enthusiasts. It makes financial sense for a gamer to abandon Game Club and get the other benefits of Amazon Prime. The free unlimited streaming from Prime Instant Video and Prime Music are already great bonuses even for gamers. Unlike Best Buy's game club, Prime membership also offers discounts on other products. I also assume that some Amazon Prime members previously signed up for Game Club because Amazon's loyalty program did not yet have the 20% discount. With the implementation of 20% discount on games inside Prime, there will be no more reason for people to renew their Game Club accounts. The gaming community definitely represents millions of potential subscribers for Amazon Prime. Seducing gamers with a discount is one way to nurture a long-lasting relationship. The bigger picture is that one successful sign-up (because of the new 20% discount on new games) can lead to a gamer probably spending thousands of dollars on Amazon's marketplace. The recent substantial price pullback on AMZN presents an opportunity for brave investors to buy it on the cheap. Amazon Prime is the dynamo behind the company's rapid growth. Consequently, Amazon can sustain its double-digit growth rate (in revenue) as long as Prime keeps getting new loyal subscribers. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
