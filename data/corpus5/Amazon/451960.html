How Apple Can Compete Against Wal-Mart Pay - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart Pay is expanding across the country and Apple Pay is left out. At first look this is a negative to Apple but Apple has several options at its disposal. First, Apple can ban Wal-Mart Pay app on its App Store. This may hurt a small percentage of Apple users (such as frequent Walmart shoppers), but nothing material. Second, Apple could follow Alibaba and set up an e-commerce platform that connects merchants to consumers on everyday essentials, and make Apple Pay the default payment service. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) expanded its payment service, Wal-Mart Pay, to 19 more states as it continues to prevent Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ) from penetrating its store networks. In total, Wal-Mart Pay is now available in 5,000 stores across 37 states and the company expects to achieve full nationwide rollout by the end of this year. Wal-Mart is one of the few companies that have openly refused to support Apple Pay since its launch in October 2014. Instead, Wal-Mart decided to use its own payment app to tie its customers into its ecosystem. This is a smart move on Wal-Mart's part in that the retailer has a lot of leverage over Apple by being the largest retailer in the country. In light of Wal-Mart's decision, Apple is losing on a big piece of offline retail that continues to account for a portion of the overall retail spending, and this will be a problem for Apple if more big retailers decide to invest and develop their own mobile wallet. What are Apple's options to address this risk? First, because that Wal-Mart Pay app is available on iOS and Android stores, Apple could technically forbid the App Store from offering the Wal-Mart Pay app. This effectively bans Apple users from using Wal-Mart Pay on their devices. While this may sound unreasonable to iPhone users who prefer to use Wal-Mart pay, consider the following: By banning Wal-Mart Pay from the App Store, only a small number of iPhone users are negatively affected by this decision (such as the iPhone users who are also frequent Wal-Mart shoppers). Keep in mind that Wal-Mart Pay works similarly to Apple Pay in that both payments organize credit and debit cards for easy checkout. Under the worst-case scenario, iPhone users that do not have Wal-Mart Pay app would instead use their Visa (NYSE: V ) or MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and pay for the purchase at the terminal, something that they have been doing for years. This is unlikely to be a big deal and the inconvenience created by Apple is not severe enough to hurt user loyalty to the Apple ecosystem. On the other hand, banning Wal-Mart Pay may be a bigger negative to Wal-Mart in that iPhone users who use Visa and MasterCard to check out will continue to remain loyal to the iPhone and to their credit card providers as a form of payment rather than to Wal-Mart Pay. Overall, I think this is a risk for Wal-Mart that continues to refuse Apple Pay. Would Apple raise anti-competitive issues by banning a Wal-Mart payment app? Potentially. Hundreds of apps are banned from Wal-Mart and the most common grounds that these apps are banned are because of their access to personal information . However, Apple could have a legitimate reason to ban Wal-Mart app if Apple can prove that Apple Pay is safer, more secure and less intrusive than Wal-Mart Pay. Unless Apple can prove that banning Wal-Mart Pay could stir negative publicity and anti-competitive issues. The second option is for Apple to use its extra cash on its balance sheet and develop an e-commerce platform similar to that of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) that does not require Apple to hold inventory. In essence, the Apple e-commerce will be an online site where Apple connects consumers with local merchants and where Apple Pay is the only acceptable payment method. This method has been proven by Alibaba whose Alipay is the only accepted payment method in Taobao and TMall. This is also the reason why Alibaba's Alipay has the largest market share in China's online payment space. While Apple's lack of presence in Wal-Mart is a short-term negative, I believe that Apple should focus more on e-commerce because e-commerce is growing at a faster rate than offline retail and could continue to expand its share at the expense of brick and mortar stores. Apple could replicate the Alibaba business model by encouraging merchants to list their products on the Apple e-commerce platform for a fee and taking no commission. The users pick the items from the e-commerce platform, pay with Apple Pay (the only payment service available on the platform) and get the products delivered to their homes. By setting up an e-commerce platform, Apple could ensure that its users can get comparable items on its site as they would from Wal-Mart at the retail level. The more important part of this plan is that Apple can let Apple Pay to expand beyond offline retail and into other parts of online retail. Keep in mind that Apple is doing this as a product broker rather than a merchant so that it does not need to build warehouses like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). All Apple is responsible for is to connect the consumers to the merchants in a transaction where the consumer pays using Apple Pay and the merchants ship the items directly to the consumers. In the short term, Wal-Mart's decision to favor its own app over Apple Pay is a negative. However, since the growth is online, I feel that Apple should focus on making Apple Pay's online presence stronger by partnering with third-party websites (something that it is already doing) and/or set up its own e-commerce platform that will tie users deeper into its ecosystem, making them less reliant on offline retailers such as Wal-Mart.
