Netflix: Earnings Miss, Subscriber Churn Provide A Buying Opportunity - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's miss was not as devastating as the bears paint it. The issue of subscriber churn due to chip-card replacement renewals has been widely mocked. I've been wanting to add Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) to my growth account for a while now. On Wednesday, I decided to pull the trigger, at least tighten down on it. Near the close, I decided to go short in-the-money puts in anticipation of earnings. Right now it looks likely that I'll get those puts assigned in a week. Fine with me. Netflix missed by a penny. But any miss for a momentum stock like Netflix will hurt. After hours Wednesday it dropped about -9% before closing the after-hours session down 3.2%. I'll not be surprised to see that pattern repeated. As I write this, it's down 8%. As long as it doesn't go much lower, I'll be okay, and my opinion is that the stock will not go much lower from here. Much has been made of the discussion on subscriber churn resulting from the switch to chip cards. Most of the commentary has been mocking. I think that derision betrays a poor understanding of how Netflix works. It is a subscription service. It depends on ongoing renewals from its subscribers. For most that occurs automatically and most just don't pay attention, letting it roll onto the credit card bill more or less without notice. The only time most subscribers really pay attention is when the card needs to be renewed, typically when the expiry date hits. The business model depends on that lack of attention to the charge month after month. But when a subscriber has to take action to renew, Netflix inevitably loses some, at a predictable rate. This is something that is certainly built into their models. They know it and try to mitigate it, but they accept it. So, when every credit card in the system has to be renewed all at once, that predictable percentage loss of subscribers also occurs all at once. That's the churn that's happened, as nearly every card in the country has been replaced with a chip card (long overdue, in my view, but that's another issue). There is nothing silly about it. It's not an excuse. It may have been explained badly at the conference call , but management in general is often bad at explaining bad things in ways that don't come off as sounding like excuses. I'm no more concerned about the subscriber loss to the chip-card churn than I would be if someone told me that every month Netflix has x% of subscribers who fail to renew their credit cards. It's a shrug, at best. Netflix is at the forefront of on-demand media entertainment. It has become synonymous with streaming video. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix will share most of this market for years to come, in my view. And the market is huge, make no mistake about it. While the bears are now dancing on what they see as Netflix's grave, I don't agree. The international expansion is on track . Growth, despite the miss (which is really at the low end of expectations), is on track. I fully expect to see the stock back on track by next quarter's earnings. When that happens, I will be glad to have gotten it at about $100 a share back in October. If it closes above my strike, I'll have earned a nice premium for the 10 days, but I still want NFLX in my growth account, so I'll be looking for an entry.
