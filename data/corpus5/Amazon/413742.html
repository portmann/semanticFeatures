Apple: The Next BlackBerry? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Over the weekend, three knowledgeable observers offered warnings about Apple. Richard Waters, noting the inauspicious example of Berkshire Hathaway investing in IBM, suggested Apple's growth days may be behind it. Brooke Masters questioned whether Angela Ahrendt's sprucing up of Apple stores wasn't merely hype, given how her previous haunt, Burberry, has sagged recently. And Marco Arment asked whether Apple was at risk of becoming the next BlackBerry, as tech competitors lap it in developing AI assistants. We elaborate on the three warnings, and present a couple of hedges for those who want to stay long Apple but limit their risk. Last month, before Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) released earnings, we noted that social data aggregator LikeFolio had put out a sell rating on the stock based on their analysis of social media data, and we presented a couple ways for concerned shareholders to hedge if they wanted to stay long ( Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings ). As LikeFolio co-founder Andy Swan summarized it at the time, Apple's earnings, a disappointment across the board , as Seeking Alpha contributor Seth Golden put it, supported LikeFolio's bearish assessment, and, as we wrote near the end of April, hedged Apple investors who wanted to exit, were able to do so with less of a loss than they would have had otherwise. Apple shareholders who didn't hedge or sell may be interested to know that three knowledgeable observers offered separate cautions about the company over the weekend. We'll review those below, and offer a couple of updated hedges if you'd like to stay long but limit your downside risk over the next several months. Richard Waters, who reports on Silicon Valley for the Financial Times, presented the bearish interpretation of Apple being bought by one of Warren Buffett's deputies at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) -- The End Of An Era For Apple (free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here ) -- namely, that it signifies Apple's run as a growth company may be over: One possible conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaway's appearance on the scene is confirmation that Apple has now passed into a form of corporate seniority much dreaded by the growth-addicted denizens of Silicon Valley. [...] In the tech world, where "grow or die" has been the mantra, what is considered respectable maturity in other industries smacks of outright senility. Yet it is a future Apple's massive size has rendered inevitable. At $234bn last year, its gigantic revenues -- almost as much as Google [(NASDAQ: GOOG ), (NASDAQ: GOOGL )], Amazon [(NASDAQ: AMZN )], and Microsoft [(NASDAQ: MSFT )] combined -- make significant sustained growth almost impossible. Richard Waters' Financial Times colleague, companies editor Brooke Masters, poured some cold water on Apple's new stores -- Hope Collides With Hype As Apple Gives Stores A Makeover (free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here ) -- noting the result of former Burberry ( OTCPK:BURBY ) CEO Angela Ahrendts' two-year rethink was underwhelming: Mostly, her vision seems to involve even bigger glass doors and lots of plants. Every flagship store will have outdoor space -- in San Francisco, the greenery-lined square will feature free WiFi and acoustic musicians on weekends. The Genius Bar, where customers go for help with technical issues, has been replaced by a Genius Grove stocked with trees and more space for people to sit while they wait. Tart commentators suggested the tree money might have been better spent on more staff to keep delays down. Masters doesn't say how Apple stores situated in shopping malls, such as the one in Westfield's ( OTCPK:WEFIF ) Garden State Plaza in New Jersey, will keep all the new trees alive. To remind us why Apple hired Ahrendts from Burberry, Masters retells the story of Ahrendts' successful reopening of Burberry's flagship London store, though readers familiar with Silicon Valley's concerns about gender and diversity may wonder if that played a role. Angela Ahrendts is currently the only one of Apple's 10-person executive team who isn't a white man. In any case, Masters points out that the gains to Burberry from Ahrendts' sprucing-up have since faded: Since then, the news has not been so good. Burberry has been hit hard by a fall in Chinese sales. Shares have dropped 35 per cent in 12 months. [...] Burberry's current woes may have nothing to do with Ms. Ahrendts. But perhaps her highly vaunted effor to reimagine luxury shopping was more about hype than real transformation. Apple is about to find out. Marco Arment is a prominent software developer, entrepreneur, and commentator. He was the lead developer of Tumblr , which was acquired by Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), and the creator of the popular Instapaper app. He raised the possibility of Apple going the way of BlackBerry ( BBRY ) -- If Google's Right About AI, That's A Problem For Apple. Arment explained that BlackBerry didn't fail because it started to make worse smart phones, but because Apple shifted the expectations of what a smart phone could be, and BlackBerry didn't have the staff or expertise to catch up. Arment wonders if Apple is now in a similarly precarious position with respect to artificial intelligence, given investments by Amazon, Google, and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ): Today, Amazon, Facebook, and Google are placing large bets on advanced AI, ubiquitous assistants, and voice interfaces, hoping that these will become the next thing that our devices are for. [...] Amazon, Facebook, and Google - especially Google - have all invested heavily in big-data web services and AI for many years, prioritizing them highly, iterating and advancing them constantly, accumulating relevant data, developing effective algorithms, and attracting, developing, and retaining tons of specialized talent. [...] But if Google's right, there's no quick fix. It won't be enough to buy Siri's creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years. If Apple needs strong AI and big-data services in the next decade to remain competitive, they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets, in-house, extensively, for years. They need to be a big-data-services company. Their big-data AI services need to be far better, smarter, and more reliable than they are. And I just don't see that happening. Becoming a major big-data AI services company doesn't happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world, completed, in a keynote. It's a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people, and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world. It's easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services. For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months, but without capping their upside, these were the optimal puts, as of Monday's close, to hedge 600 shares against a greater-than-14% decline by late October (screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ): As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $1,668, or 2.88% of position value. A few notes about this hedge: To be conservative, the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts. In practice, an investor can often by the puts for less (for some price between the bid and the ask). If you are willing to risk a larger decline ("threshold", in the app's terminology), you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner. The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts, so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term, when the puts may still have significant time value . For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same 14% threshold, but willing to cap their potential upside to 10% by late October (the potential upside implied by the current median 12-month Wall Street price target), this was the optimal collar to hedge 600 shares, as of Monday's close: As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above, the cost of the put leg was $1,308, or 2.26% of position value. But as you can see in the second part below, the income generated from the call leg was $936, or 1.62% of position value. So the net cost here was $372, or 0.64% of position value. Two notes about this hedge: Similar to the situation with the optimal puts, to be conservative, the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls. In practice, an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so in reality, an investor would likely have collected more than $408 when opening this collar. As with the optimal puts above, this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value (for an example of this, see our previous article on Apple). However, if the underlying security spikes in the near future, time value can have the opposite effect, making it costly to exit the position early (for an example of this, see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards Cautious Investors Less ).
