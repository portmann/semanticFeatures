Netflix: Revenues At $18 Billion By 2020, But Fair Value Is $87 Per Share - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (458 clicks) Beyond the hype cycle of a growing subscriber base is the unfortunate truth that Netflix is trading at a $43 billion valuation with -$722 million in ttm free cash flow. While some might see trouble with slowing US subs growth, we believe the math checks out for the chip-card issue to be the main culprit of slower growth. Cheaper international pricing does give Netflix leverage in some price-pressured international markets, and this value-oriented pricing will experience viable synergies from current emerging market weakness. Netflix has not distinctly proven price elasticity for its streaming service, but we do believe gradual price hikes will be accepted by the customer. We see Netflix achieving net sales of $17.8 billion by 2020 while netting a profit in excess of $1 billion, but believe that shares today are worth $87. If one thing was made clear in trading following Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) earnings it's that shares of Netflix trade almost exclusively on subscriber growth. When the company announced that domestic subs grew only 880,000 in the quarter vs. estimates for 1.25 million and guidance for 1.15 million net additions, the stock fell nearly 15% in after-hours trading. Once the company revealed in the conference call that slower sub growth was due partially to a consumer transition to chip payment cards, shares rebounded to almost flat. But investors still remained concerned about subs growth in the US, and shares traded down roughly 8% on Thursday, October 15. Shares have traded erratically on subs growth for some time now, with sub beats pushing shares higher and sub misses crashing shares. At some point, though, the market has to realize that subscriber growth does not pay back shareholders - cash flow does. Beyond the hype cycle of a quickly growing subscriber base is the unfortunate truth that Netflix is a company valued at $43 billion with -$722 million in trailing twelve month non-GAAP free cash flow. It's true that current heavy spending on streaming content additions will eventually lead to greatly positive free cash flow, but even under aggressive assumptions for huge piles of free cash flow in the future we can't wrap our heads around the current valuation. Netflix credited involuntary churn in the third quarter to the increasing prevalence of chip payment cards. The transition included the changing of account numbers for some consumers, which led to an inability to process payments for some customers, according to management. Management believes this involuntary churn is temporary, and that the TAM remains 60 to 90 million households in the United States. According to data from Visa and other payment card issuers, this seems a legitimate reason why subs growth slowed. Visa says 141 million chip cards have been issued to customers, or about 20% of their total customer base. More widely, more than 200 million chip cards have been issued in the US, or a little more than 15% of the 1.2 billion total payment cards in the US. Meanwhile, Netflix had 42.3 million subs at the end of Q2. Assuming an equal distribution of chip-cards among those 42.3 million subs, then roughly 15% of those subs have been issued chip cards, or roughly 6.3 million. From this standpoint, about 6.3 million Netflix subscribers were "at-risk" of the account number changing issue management cited. US subs missed estimates by less than 400,000, so if the miss was entirely attributable to chip-cards, about 6% of Netflix's chip-card subs were affected by account number changing issues. This seems very reasonable, and management does cite that multiple issues outside of the chip-card issue may have been at play, so in actuality, far less than 6% of Netflix's chip-card subs were affected by account number changing issues. To us, this makes complete sense. While some might see trouble in slowed US subs growth, we believe the math checks out for the chip-card issue to be the main culprit of slower growth. This issue is not terminal, and so we do believe management when they say the TAM remains in the 60 to 90 million range. While US subs growth was slower than expected, international subs growth exceeded most expectations. International paid subs growth is still slowing on a Y/Y basis, consistent with previous quarterly trends. But this is to be expected given prior Y/Y growth rates were north of 80%. Despite CEO Reed Hastings attempt to remain neutral on country-specific developments, he did shed some color on Brazil and Japan. Brazil continues to be a "rocket-ship" for Netflix, as a value-oriented product like Netflix is proving to be a popular option in countries with tough economies. Cheaper international pricing does give Netflix leverage in some price-pressured international markets, and this value-oriented pricing will experience viable synergies from current emerging market weakness. This cheaper international pricing coupled with FX headwinds is weighing on margins as net profit margins have compressed dramatically due to a negative teens contribution margin from the international streaming segment. Management, though, sees no reason why the international business can't be at least as profitable as the domestic business, especially when FX headwinds slow down. By our calculation, actually, monthly ARPU (quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by 3) actually increased sequentially from Q2 to Q3, so this is promising for margins. Indeed, international streaming contribution margin was more than 700 basis points less negative in Q3 than in Q2. The Brazil market also benefited particularly from the Netflix original series Narcos, which features Brazilian superstars as the lead and director of the series. Narcos also was popular in France and Norway, according to management. Narcos provides investors a glimpse into the benefits Netflix's move to exclusive content will give the business, and we discuss that more in-depth in the next section. While management is attempting to taper expectations for the Japan market, CEO Reed Hastings did imply that Japan is doing well. Price Increases And Original Content Netflix is moving to exclusive content and is spending a ton of money in doing so (more on that further down). So naturally, management expects to be able to charge customers more in the future as Netflix's exclusive content library grows. While it seemed that management intends to keep its standard definition offering in the US at $7.99 (CEO Reed Hastings was quick to point out that the standard def offering has remained constant in years past), the company does expect to space out its price tiering. In other words, management does expect to hike prices in the future for HD and ultra HD offerings. Netflix has not distinctly proven price elasticity for its streaming service, but we do believe gradual price hikes will be accepted by the customer. Management appears to be trying to sell the "you get what you pay for" model, as the more customers pay per month the more and better content the viewer base will get. Specifically, the more and better original content the viewer base will get, and given the massive success of both domestic and international original content like House of Cards and Narcos, we do believe both domestic and international consumers will be willing to pay more as this original content library expands. It makes sense to us and believe it will make sense to the consumer, that a service that offers exclusive content is more expensive than a service that offers non-exclusive content. At this point, though, this is our speculation, and Q4 results will give us more founded insight into Netflix's price elasticity. Intense competition does complicate the consumer decision. As opposed to a dilemma between pay more or lose streaming service entirely, the consumer is now faced with a third option to use another streaming service, like Amazon Prime or Hulu. We believe that the more diverse Netflix's original content library is, the more protected Netflix is from churn due to price hikes. From this standpoint, we affirm that the move to exclusive content is a necessary move, albeit an expensive one. Most economic moats are expensive to flesh out, and we see no difference from the norm for Netflix. It's nothing new that the streaming content space is highly competitive, as companies like Netflix and Amazon attempt to capitalize on the growing shift from linear to internet TV. While we believe that Amazon has key pre-existing advantages in certain international markets, Netflix is still viewed pretty unanimously as the streaming content king. According to Piper Jaffray's Fall 2015 Taking Stock With Teens Survey, teens are spending far more time on Netflix than any other streaming service. The numbers are not even close . Unlike Netflix, though, Amazon Instant Video is part of a bigger Amazon Prime ecosystem. This advantages Amazon Instant Video in that its appeal isn't directly attached to its content. Amazon Instant Video's attractiveness increases as the overall appeal of the Amazon Prime ecosystem grows. We see Amazon Prime's growing ecosystem as a major deterrent to Netflix's price elasticity. At the margin, consumers might be willing to pay for both Netflix and Amazon Prime services. However, as both become more expensive, consumers will likely be forced to choose between one or the other. If Netflix sees churn increase as a result of price hikes, we believe lost subs there will mean gained subs for Amazon Prime. Overall, we believe that the global streaming content space, much like many other industries, will be an oligopoly and not a monopoly. We believe Amazon Prime and Netflix, among a few others, will continually compete for market share in the foreseeable future. Given all the factors previously discussed, we believe Netflix has a long runway for continued strong topline and bottom-line growth. We believe that the company will brush off non-terminal chip-card headwinds in the US and grow US streaming subs at a 15% rate in 2016 (assuming 2015 paid US streaming subs come in at roughly 43.7 million), before growth slows to a 10% CAGR into 2020. This projection puts total US paid streaming subs in the range of management's TAM by the end of 2020. Q3 domestic ARPU (quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by months in period) was up 4.57% Y/Y, and given our expectation for continued price hikes in the future, we model for ARPU to grow roughly 5% per year into 2020. We see domestic streaming revenues exceeding $9.5 billion by 2020. Given slowing Y/Y international sub growth trends, we believe international subs can grow right around 25% in 2016 (down from roughly 66% in Q3, and this assumes Q415 paid subs come in at 27.05 million) and at a 20% CAGR thereafter into 2020. This projection means that we expect international paid member count to almost equal domestic paid member count by 2020. Similar to domestic streaming ARPU, we believe international streaming ARPU will grow at a 5% CAGR into 2020. We see international streaming revenues exceeding $7.6 billion by 2020. Contrary to popular belief, we believe the DVD segment has some longevity and value as long as some Netflix offerings remain DVD-only. We model for DVD member count to level off around 4.5 million over the next five years, and believe pricing will inflate only ~2% per year. We believe domestic DVD revenues will sum to just over $600 million by 2020. More favorable pricing tiers should help improve margins, and we believe that the international business can become as, if not more, profitable than the domestic business. Overall, we believe net profit margin should continually improve into 2020. In sum, we see Netflix achieving net sales of $17.8 billion by 2020 while netting a profit in excess of $1 billion. Our five-year revenue and earnings model can be seen below. Important to note that not shown is 4Q15, which we assume will grow at a comparable rate to 3Q15 from a subs standpoint. The company's biggest problem is its negative cash flow, which is driven by huge spending on streaming content additions. In 2013, the company spent $3 billion on streaming content additions. That number grew to $3.8 billion in 2014, and is already $4.2 billion through the first nine months of 2015. These are necessary additions, and with the streaming landscape only becoming increasingly competitive, we do not see Netflix easing on this spending. As detailed above, Netflix's key advantage moving forward is quality, original content, so Netflix will have to continue intense investments in originals. While investments will likely not continue to accelerate going forward, we do not see this going down. Helping cash flows as a result of heavier spending on originals is amortization of the streaming content library, which grew from $2.1 billion in 2013 to $2.4 billion through the first ninemonths of 2015. This will continue to grow and should help cash flows. Through the first nine months of 2015, net income to operating cash flow reconciliation is -$584 million. That puts net income to operating cash flow reconciliation on track to be nearly -$800 million this year, from -$250 million last year. Overall, we believe that the company can reach net income to operating cash flow reconciliation of zero by 2020 as the intensity of investments in originals cools while amortization of the streaming content library grows. We model for net income to operating cash flow reconciliation roughly as follows: Looking at capital spending, we believe DVD acquisitions should continue to cost roughly $60-70 million per year, while we expect additions to PPE to continue to be above $100 million and accelerate next year, but slow as international growth slows. Under these rough assumptions, we see the company generating positive free cash flow by 2018 and upping annual free cash flow to more than $900 million by 2020. This agrees with our intuitive feeling that Netflix has huge free cash flow potential. In our DCF model, we use an aggressive 3% perpetuity free cash flow growth rate and a 5% discount rate. The CAPM discount rate is much higher than 5%, but we use 5% because we really like the Netflix business and do not require a high rate of return on a super growth stock like Netflix which will almost assuredly grow revenues and earnings at a healthy clip. Taking the net present value of our explicit free cash flows and summing this with the net present value of our terminal free cash flow, we believe the net present value of all future free cash flows is roughly $37.8 billion. Adding in MRQ net cash of $209.6 million, we believe that Netflix's fair value today is $38 billion. Using an MRQ average diluted share count of 437.6 million, this equates to a fair share price of roughly $87. In our model, we have done our best to reconcile the bullish revenue and subscriber growth story with the bearish negative cash flows to paint a full picture of Netflix and its value. This full picture tells us that Netflix is worth $38 billion today, or roughly $87 per share. Despite the premium valuation, Netflix actually isn't terribly overvalued. We believe shares are trading north of fair value, but a ~15% premium on fair value isn't dramatically overvalued for a super growth stock like Netflix. At $101 per share, we believe investors are overpaying for a stock that doesn't pay its shareholders. While we believe share price will be higher than $101 in five years, we believe buying here would yield a very small rate of return for investors. Without a dividend, a small rate of return on a richly valued stock is unattractive to us. We will stay away from Netflix for now, but this is not to say share price won't appreciate from here. As we began this article with, NFLX trades with subs growth, not cash flow. We are not interested, though, in buying at these sup-$100 levels, since the value is not fundamentally supported. We believe the stock gets really interesting if it dips to the $85 range. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
