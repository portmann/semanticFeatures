Winners And Losers In Amazon's Private-Label Push - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is rolling out private-label nonperishable products for Prime members. I believe that this is a net positive for Amazon and its ecosystem as it expands its product category and scale. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has begun selling perishable private-label foods and I think this is another way for the company to pursue high margin products and expand its product categories to disrupt conventional grocery stores. The private labels are sold exclusively to its Prime members and include nuts, spices, baby foods, coffee, tea, vitamins, diapers and laundry detergents through brands such as Mama Bear, Happy Valley, Presto! and Wickely Prime. This is in addition to Amazon's push into private-label apparel last year. I think this is a positive development for Amazon to expand its ecosystem and capture a portion of the $118bn private label market in the US. Private label benefits both Amazon and manufacturers in several ways. For the manufacturers, Amazon provides a point of distribution and a reliable buyer of their products. As for the retailer such as Amazon, they benefit from bigger product category, scale and a stickier ecosystem such as the Prime membership program. I consider this to be a long-term positive for Amazon because its fast shipping slowly diminishes the advantage of physical grocery chains in terms of convenience. If the products are not time sensitive then consumers could purchase them over Amazon, have them shipped within two days and potentially achieve a small savings. Even more important to consider, private label is very popular among millennials due to their cheaper prices and comparable quality. Because of the fact that millennials are tech savvy and familiar with ecommerce, I believe that this will act another tailwind for Amazon's private-label brands. So which companies face the risk of Amazon going into private label? Private label is a very high-margin produc ts in major grocery chains such as SuperValu (NYSE: SVU ) and Krogers (NYSE: KR ) and these companies will face the highest risk. On the other hand, I think convenience stores that have locations strategic locations will be less impacted because of the lower price sensitivity among consumers in these stores. Companies such as Casey's (NASDAQ: CASY ) should be relatively better positioned, in my view. Finally, media has pointed out that Amazon's private-labels may be a threat to brands such as Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) because Amazon's coffee is priced lower than certain Starbucks coffee brands. I do not believe this to be the case given that Starbucks generates most of its revenue from its stores and grocery sales only account for a small percentage of the total sales. I do not expect Amazon to materially impact Starbucks. In conclusion, I continue to like Amazon because the company is making the right moves to expand its product category, which makes its website and Prime services more attractive, and leverage its logistics and fulfillment centers to maximize their return on investments. I continue to like Casey's because I believe that it is better positioned for Amazon's private-label threat in the long-term relative to the other grocery companies.
