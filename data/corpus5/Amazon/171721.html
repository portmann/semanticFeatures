Time To Lighten Up On Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha After a gain of 66% on Amazon, it's time to take profits. The company continues to do well, but the market volatility means it's time to raise cash. Last week I was calling Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) a great buy at $500. But at $520, I am reversing my own view. It's time for me to take some profits off the table. This is not a call on the company. Amazon is an amazing company. It's a call on the market and on the nature of market psychology. If you buy it now, I fully expect it to be worth more within a year. Here is the problem. There is no doubt that the market as a whole is heading for turbulence. China, Europe's refugees, crazy politicians, an oil turnaround - they all spell risk over the next few months. I personally think we'll get to the end of the year in fine shape, but at a time of risk you want to have ready cash. I don't have enough. Second, volatility first hits speculative issues. At its present price of $520, and market cap of $245 billion, you're paying roughly three times revenues for a company that is growing at 20% per year. But Amazon is unlikely to grow 20% this year. It's in the nature of numbers that the bigger they get, the harder it is to raise them by a set percentage. For the first two quarters, the company scored $45 billion in sales. Last year it hit $88 billion. For Amazon to grow 20% from there would require sales of $105 billion for all of 2015. Even if the company beats its regular run rate by 50% this Christmas - and that's what it did last year, with sales of $29 billion over Christmas after running sales at about $20 the rest of that year - that would deliver a sales total of $101 billion for the year. Third, when volatility hits people look to sure things. Amazon is not a sure thing. During this most recent bout in August, Amazon fell nearly 20%, to about $470. While it has gained all that back, I'd rather buy it at $470. It can get there easily, with just a little bad news over which it has no control. Fourth, Amazon's spectacular run this year has made it a fat piece of my portfolio. When I bought it, at about $300, it represented about 8% of my total holdings. Now it's up to 12%, by far the largest piece of my retirement account. Logic dictates a readjustment. Now, let's look at the other side of the coin. First, a sale of Amazon at this time violates my own rule for market timing, which is that I try not to do it. When the market falls, I generally do nothing. I wait for the market to rise again before considering an adjustment. Are we really on the precipice of another fall right now? A Fed decision not to hike rates, a "flight to quality" in terms of U.S. assets, could easily cause the market to go up later this week, rather than down. The footing under the market's feet is far from level. Second, Amazon is, as I stated, not doing anything wrong. It could easily deliver an upside surprise next month. Analysts, 80% of whom are bullish bearish, expect a loss for the September quarter of 12 cents/share, and revenue of almost $25 billion. The bottom line can be beaten but the top line is almost $2 billion above what was achieved in June, and I've seen no indication business is really that much better. Was Prime Day really that big, while taking nothing from future sales? Maybe. So here is what I'm going to do. I'm taking out half my Amazon investment for the next three months, putting the total holding in line with the other stocks I own, grabbing some fat profits, creating cash to pick up opportunities, and risking some of that upside surprise.
