Did Amazon Just Become A Mall REIT's Best Friend? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha When a mall REIT suggested Amazon was getting set to open as many as 400 stores, it made headlines. While no one knows for sure, 400 sounds like hyperbole. The mall is dead! That's pretty much the mindset of many investors when they look at Internet retailers. You can understand why on many levels, but then what do you make of the fact that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is rumored to be looking to expand its brick and mortar footprint? General Growth Properties' (NYSE: GGP ) CEO shocked the book and retail world when he commented during an earnings call that Amazon was, to his understanding, looking to open as many as 400 physical book stores. At this point, GGP has stepped back from that statement and Amazon isn't talking. But other industry watchers think the number suggested is way too high, with something in the teens a more likely outcome in the near term. Interestingly, one of the critiques offered for Amazon's current store in Seattle is that it's quite popular but appears to look more like an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) store. The books are on the periphery and the gadgets are the showcase in the middle. A mall real estate investment trust, or REIT, wouldn't care about that, but it hints at something else. For example, Amazon not only has a store but it also has kiosks in some Westfield ( OTCPK:WFGPY ) malls. And, according to The Wall Street Journal, other online retailers are going physical, too . For example, clothing store Bonobos and eyeglass store Warby Parker are opening brick and mortar stores-and are much further along in that effort than Amazon. Bonobos has 20 "guide shops" while Warby Parker , which uses the more pedestrian term retail locations, has 26 stores. Could it be that online isn't the end all and be all? Is it possible that mall owners like GGP, Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG ), and Taubman Centers (NYSE: TCO ) have a business ahead of them after all? I'm being sarcastic, of course. But when you look at the media drubbing that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ) took this past holiday season when their websites couldn't keep up with demand, you might get the impression that physical locations are a dead end. To be fair, online sales are growing quickly while sales at physical stores bumble along at low levels. But remember that the online sales channel basically didn't exist 20 years ago, so it's still growing from a small base. Which makes the action of online retailers all the more interesting. Their move into the physical realm suggests that the online tree isn't going to grow to the sky. Indeed, the real outcome for retail is likely going to be somewhere in the middle, with both online and physical stores playing a key component to the retail story. This is the so-called omni-channel idea. That shouldn't be a shock to anyone who kind of likes to wander around a store every so often and, you know, see and touch the things you're about to buy... Or just because you can't stand being stuck at home looking at yet another screen all day long. So what's the big takeaway? Location, location, location is probably going to remain the keyword for retail focused REITs. Simon , known for its high-end malls, clearly has a lock on that in a big way, with its over 200 malls spread around the world. There's no doubt that its bread and butter is owning a collection of highly desirable malls, and its financial results, the deep 2007 to 2009 recession aside, have long been top-notch. It appears well-positioned today and if online retailers look for good locations to enter into the physical world. But Taubman may be an even more interesting play here. This mall REIT only owns or controls around 20 or so malls, but that's because it does things a little differently. Taubman doesn't think size is as important as quality. So it works hard to make its small collection of assets into premier properties. Along the way, it will sell assets that it doesn't think measure up anymore and invest that money into acquisitions, its other properties, and/or into construction projects. But the key here is that while some REITs focus on getting bigger and bigger portfolios, Taubman's focus is on making its portfolio better and better from the ground up. General Growth , which owns around 130 malls, is on the location bandwagon, too. In fact, it highlights that it owns 97 of the top 457 malls. That's an odd stat in some ways, but it shows that GGP fancies a good location just as much as Simon and Taubman. That said, its results don't hold up quite as well as the other pair when looked at historically. On that score, a look at the all-important dividend might be worth your time. The 2007 to 2009 recession took out General Growth's dividend. While it's back now, the annual payout is still well below its pre-recession peak. Simon, meanwhile, trimmed its payout a bit during the recession, but has since grown it to the point where it now pays more than twice as much as it did before that deep downturn. It used the recession to expand aggressively. Taubman kept its dividend steady for a year during the recession before getting back to regular annual increases with a slow and steady approach as the overriding theme. Taubman would be my favorite for conservative investors, if I were forced to make a recommendation today. What you'll want to watch out for is second tier malls. For example, the ones that Simon spun off in 2014 as Washington Prime Group. This transaction was often billed as Simon getting rid of its strip mall business, but with those 54 strip malls went another 44 less-desirable enclosed malls. Washington Prime has since merged with Glimcher Realty Trust and today is known as WP Glimcher (NYSE: WPG ). WPG has an around 11% yield and a bunch of malls with Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) and J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ) stores as anchor tenants. That could make it a turnaround play for aggressive investors, but my question would be about the longer-term future of the assets it owns relative to, say, what Taubman has built? For reference, SPG has a yield of 3.4%, TCO's yield is 3.2%, and GGP's yield is 2.7%. I don't think any of these mall REITs is a great buy in here, but neither do I believe that WPG is appropriate for all but the most aggressive investor. Better to wait for the higher-end trio to fall in price, in my book. So as you watch Amazon explore the physical world and see big retailers like Wal-Mart increasingly move online, remember that the meeting of these two worlds will, most likely, be in the middle - not at either extreme. And that will mean that physical retail space remains important, you'll just want to make sure you own the right location, location, locations. Disclosure: I am/we are long TGT, AAPL.
