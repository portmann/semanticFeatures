Wal-Mart Stifled By E-Commerce And Global Factors - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha A lowly earnings report is setting the tone for the upcoming quarter.. The low digital footprint needs to be improved, considering the size of the capital investment directed towards the segment.. E-commerce giant Amazon is certainly taking away from the company's top-line growth. A now cheap base valuation and great dividend yield makes it more attractive than competitors, but this is an incredibly risky environment to be buying into.. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) is down 22.52% on the year and has limited growth catalysts propelling it through the back half of 2015. Bogged down by e-commerce competition and global macro problems, the company's downtrend is justified, in my opinion. Will it continue? Based upon a lowly top-line and problems with the bottom-line, particularly increased wages, I say the downtrend should continue. In this environment, shorting would seem to complement the stock's current trend, but is ballsy and should be done at your own risk. I'd advise to hold the stock through the current US equity downtrend. Nearly every US equity is being adversely affected by the intense pressures of currency wars, demands shifts, underlying downtrends (commodities, energy), and interest rate speculation. Wal-Mart is susceptible here really in terms of their international segment, as this is the source of 40% of their total revenue. Brazil and Mexico account for large compositions, which is bad for Wal-Mart considering in the last month both have experienced notable downtrends in their currencies (apart of a larger downtrend against the strengthening dollar). Wal-Mart has seen these regions slow to a growth rate of just 2% per year since the end of 2013. Observe the currency pairs trending down in the last month below: This is going to hurt, assuredly, as last quarter they lost $1.68 billion on translation. Being cognizant of these negative effects should point to lower net earnings next quarter. The company is trading at a lower P/E than direct competitor Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) at 13.89 versus 26.63. Both of these are dwarfed compared to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), who technically doesn't have a P/E because of the negative -$0.41 EPS for the full year. Forward P/E estimates for Amazon from Reuters are coming in at 97.72. Now, this is great because we know that for the near-term an entry could be justified considering it's not nearly as expensive as other retail competitors, however it is still just a basis. That basis is even slightly faulty considering the company lowered the EPS guidance for the next year. From a kicker perspective, Amazon also doesn't pay a dividend, compared to Costco and Wal-Mart, who have a 1.15% and 2.95% yield, respectively. The latter is exceptional, especially in this operating environment. Revenues last quarter declined about $165 million to settle at $114 billion, which is less than 1% growth YOY. It's flat over the LTM, but up from Q1. COGS for Wal-Mart are relatively flat in the LTM, hovering at about $90 billion. Unfortunately, we're not seeing the positive diversion that we'd like, considering the heavy movement into e-commerce by the company. The e-commerce business is assuredly the way to go, but with it only accounting for 5% of current operations, it's not going to be enough to dethrone some revenues from Amazon. Besides, if you need to buy something online, your first inclination is to go to Amazon, not Wal-Mart. With more and more players entering the online retail market, Jet being the most notable , Wal-Mart really needs to start seeing more efficacy from this segment and shift its customer base faster. They sunk $270 million capital investment for the platform in Q2, but needs to start creating a more attractive platform. Competing with Amazon means competing with a 187 million (and growing) user base, a 20% YOY sales increase for Q2, and sales that have increased 13x since 2014. E-commerce sales for Wal-Mart last quarter only had an impact of 0.3%. That's pitiful. Increasing wages every so often isn't a new story, but Wal-Mart likes to think it really creates a great environment for its employees to work in. Wage growth is happening because of a stronger dollar and because of lobbying. Now, how hard is Wal-Mart about to get hit because of this new expense? Considering that the actual wage isn't part of the problem, but rather the training programs and employee benefit package increases is really putting a dent in their bottom line. They did raise the minimum wage to $9.00 for 500,000 employees, but more importantly they just added $1.8 billion to 401(k) programs . That's money that could be better spent considering the lagging e-commerce business. SG&A has increased $12 billion since 2011 and after a 6.4% increase from Q1 to Q2 this year in the amount of $1.2 billion, the company needs to cut back. Trend towards e-commerce, pay lower SG&A costs, and drive in higher operating revenues, considering the operating margin has been stagnated at an average of 5.6% since early last year. That's the direction the company needs to take before a reasonable growth rate can be achieved back to the $90 high earlier this year. Historically, Wal-Mart does exceptionally well during the holiday season. Yes, it is only the end of August, but thinking about that January earnings call some five months out is a great idea if US retail equities continue to deteriorate. Last year, Wal-Mart saw a jump in the revenue from $119 billion in Q3 to $131 billion in Q4 and net income of $1.6 billion higher. Could Amazon further eat into this top and bottom line? Assuredly, but nonetheless its worth considering that sales and net income will pick up for the firm based upon shear volume. Strong same-store sales , despite the international setbacks, grew 1.5% in Q2. Management doesn't like it being this low and neither do I, but you have to work with what you got in this market. It's not hard to place your trust in CEO Doug McMillion when he does something as charitable as donating $25 million on his own dime, but maybe a bit better management of company cash flow would be vital to creating a stronger digital presence. Holding the stock through this current market downtrend may be your best bet. I personally am not going to advocate the cheap level as a time to pile on more shares because I think the US equity market is going to continue to sink; but, shorting the stock wouldn't give the necessary upside given the stock's low beta and general risk profile. Wait and see what Wal-Mart does and how they counteract increasing costs and lower revenues and if any betterment of the e-commerce platform occurs.
