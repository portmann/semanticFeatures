5 Reasons Amazon Is Getting Aggressive With Its Gaming Strategy - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The motive behind Amazon hiring to build out its gaming business. Why Amazon is opening up a new demographic front. There has been a lot of chatter since Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) let it be known it was taking its gaming strategy to another level, announcing it had hired a number of prominent game designers for that purpose. Heading up the unit will be well-respected Mike Fazzini, who was installed as vice president of the gaming division last year and was the director of the group before that. He was one of those pushing strongly for Amazon to acquire Twitch. The obvious question is this: Why is Amazon showing such a strong commitment to upping the ante in this particular market? What Amazon must do via its Amazon Game Studios it to gain mindshare with gamers. That suggests it either has to produce a big winner to build the brand or provide a platform featuring numerous games which will leverage it across different demographics. It's probable the company may attempt to do both. But for reasons I'll show you, I think it's primarily the gaming platform Amazon is looking to build out over the longer term. For some time I've been saying almost everything Amazon does will be associated in some way with its Amazon Prime service, which when consumers subscribe to they end up paying on the upper side of the 60 percent to 70 percent range above regular Amazon customers. No matter how the gaming strategy is implemented, there's no doubt the end game will be to enhance Amazon Prime. I say that because it's possible Amazon may attempt - in the beginning of this aggressive move - to hit an individual gaming home run in order to boost its Amazon Game Studios brand. That's not necessarily a surety, but it is a strong possibility. It may start that way, but I see no reason why Amazon would attempt to build out its gaming brand without it tying directly into its Amazon Prime service. After all, it could get a nice boost from an individual game hit, but that would pale in comparison to what it would mean in revenue and potential earnings if it was offered solely to its Prime members. Investors should look at how all this plays into its Amazon Prime strategy, as that's the real key to the long-term success of Amazon. That's how everything Amazon does should be analyzed. So how does adding games to Amazon Prime help the company with its core business? That's easy. It adds even more value to Amazon Prime, which makes it even more sticky to those wanting to pay for its service. If Amazon can continue to expand and retain its Prime members, it has the potential to offer to shareholders the profitability that it hasn't been able to offer. Eventually Amazon must go beyond the scale and potential stage and start to generate sustainable earnings. If it doesn't, I think it could take a big hit that it will have difficulty recovering from. The next recession would be the catalyst for that. Every time Amazon adds more to its Prime membership, it boosts the value in the eyes of its members, which not only lowers churn, but increases word-of-mouth interaction that's so vital to grow a business in the Internet age. In the case of gaming, it also has the potential to reach a demographic that could open up a new growth spurt for Prime. When talking of reaching a new demographic in a much larger way - meaning the young male demo, there are a couple of things to consider. First, we'll have to see how Amazon moves forward with gaming. Will it look at retaining Prime members even further in order to lower churn? If so, I would look at a more casual gaming initiative in order to keep its female Prime members. If it's looking in the beginning to reach the young male demo, we'll see games that will reflect that strategy. Over time Amazon will institute both of these strategies. My thought is it may attack the young male demo in the beginning in order to maintain the marketing momentum. Not too many will be overly excited if casual games are where this new strategy starts. That would take a lot of air out of the excitement garnered in the early stages of the campaign. I also don't see major game design personalities being attracted to Amazon in order to launch casual games. Again, over the long haul that's a certainty. Over the shorter term though, something that will generate interest among young males has to be the way Amazon approaches this. If not, it will be a big disappointment in my mind. All of the above-mentioned elements combine to make the final important part of its gaming strategy, which is to allow the company to raise its Prime prices when it needs to. The latest price boost to $99 annually was mostly a defensive measure because of the high costs associated with shipping. I believe Amazon must and is taking steps to bring a more offensive strategy to bear on Prime in order to create value so strong the majority of members won't hesitate to pay more when the company puts a price increase in place. I think of cable and satellite companies in this regard, which haven't been considered to have added value to their customers as they continue to raise subscription prices. Pricing power is the key to identifying whether or not a company has gone beyond the commodity business stage to becoming a company with a defensible moat. The last increase in subscription prices for Amazon Prime was successful, and showed, at least at that price point, customers felt the cost was in line with the value they received from it. The next price increase will be more challenging, and Amazon is obviously preparing for that moment by continually adding products and services to ensure there isn't a disastrous backlash. If it can continue to raise prices over time, it will prove it has in fact moved into a place where its customers believe it offers strong value for the price. Interestingly, Amazon recently entered into an agreement with GameFly (a video game rental company) to offer what it calls "game packs," which a user can subscribe to individually, rather than the flat rate offered by gaming competitors. It'll be interesting to see if Amazon offers something similar with its new games via its Prime service. A lot of the focus on the recent announcement by Amazon that it is looking for game developers - while parading out some of those that have joined there team - has been on the company producing a high-quality and popular PC game. I don't think that's close to the real reason for this happening, as mentioned above. Amazon is creating a complex ecosystem where the majority of its initiatives center around adding value to its Amazon Prime service. That includes its cloud business (Amazon Web Services) and of course Twitch, which offers broadcasts of video games being played. I'm not saying there may not be some secondary business built out as a result of success with games, but again, it pales in comparison of the value of growing and retaining its customer base for Prime membership. If it's able to successfully attract a significant number of young males to its Prime service, it would really be a game changer in my opinion, as it opens up huge opportunities that it hasn't had in the past. It may offer some of these as a loss leader to let potential customers know about the games and service, but I believe a lot of this will be placed behind the wall of its Amazon Prime service, which if successful, will bring it to an entirely new level. This is what is exciting and has potential for Amazon concerning investors. I can't emphasize enough that everything Amazon does should be looked at through the spectrum of its Amazon Prime service. It may not always be apparent how it may fit in, but there is a surety there will be some connection.
