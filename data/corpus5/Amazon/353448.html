Control4: Insurmountable Competitive Pressure Leads To Large Price Cuts And Business Impairment - Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL) | Seeking Alpha Amazon now making a huge home automation push with Echo platform. Just made a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash. We have written about Control4 Corp. (NASDAQ: CTRL ) ("CTRL" or the "Company") twice before - both turned out to be quite timely and accurate calls. We believe current conditions present another, even more attractive opportunity to short the stock. Over the last two months, CTRL's stock has run-up nearly 50% despite significant negative developments including: 1) a 40% price cut to its controllers effective January 15th, 2) a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash, and 3) a massive increase in Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) commitment to the Echo product line in January with a stated intent of dominating the home automation market. This is compounded by an unfavorable mix shift to lower cost controllers and volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job. CTRL's current 23.7x LTM P/E multiple is predicated on unattainable mid-teens organic revenue growth and a 100% increase in net income (all number proforma with Pakedge). This aggressive earnings guidance and lofty expectations drove the stock's recent price appreciation. The reality is the recent price cuts and competitive pressures are leading to negative revenue growth and further margin erosion in the near term. We believe the Pakedge acquisition only accelerates the Company's demise. Control4 has limited IP and no discernible strategic value, thus the stock is likely not worth more than its ever-declining net cash position of $1.78 per share for a potential 75% return. A borrow in the security is readily available with a -2% rebate. Current Reality & Recent Developments Last year, we highlighted how the Company has a structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence. The below developments, ordered by severity, should make it clear that Control4's product is officially obsolete and its demise nearing: Amazon Echo Family: On January 22, Amazon announced it was hiring over 800 engineers and developers in its home automation segment (569 to be added to its Echo team and 241 to Alexa). Note CTRL has 178 people in its entire R&D department so this single expansion by Amazon will alone bring its headcount to well over 4x that of Control4. This followed Echo's $10M Super Bowl advertising spot and ongoing marketing blitz. Amazon's clear intention is to transform and dominate home automation. The pain for Amazon's competitors is already being felt as this recent Wall Street Journal article states. From a product standpoint, Amazon's Echo Family is voice activated, intuitive , does not require professional installation and costs $130-$180 versus $600 (plus $1.5k-$3k installation) for a basic Control4 remote. The rapidly evolving dynamics in home automation technology being led by Amazon has a lot of historical parallels, all of which portent disaster for CTRL. Amazon's strategy to enter the home with Echo is analogous to Apple and Samsung's entrance into the smartphone market. Meanwhile Control4 is the now nearly extinct guy out selling landline home phones. Price Cuts: In mid-January, CTRL released and began shipping its new EA series controllers. The published MSRP is 37% lower for its new entry point controller ( EA-1 ) than its equivalent legacy model ( HC-250 ). What people failed to realize is the EA-1 is priced at $600 retail versus the HC-250 at $750 but with the new EA-1, CTRL is bundling-in the remote, an item it used to sell separately for an additional $200. It is safe to assume CTRL generated high margins on these remotes, a product the Company now includes for free. Ultimately this large price cut was in response to competitive pressures and pushback from distributors. This will obviously impair revenue growth and margins significantly, yet somehow it seems to have gone unnoticed by the market. Declining Unit Volumes: Controllers are getting increasingly powerful, thus less and less hardware is required to cover a given amount of square footage. Now an entry level component is sufficient for the main ground floor room of an average home. The Company's 2014 10-K noted, "more than half of our consumers have Control4 system configurations with one controller." This number is likely substantially higher now. The below number of units sold per home and revenue per home indicates this trend has accelerated for CTRL. In 2015, the number of controllers per home dropped between 26% and 38% and revenue per home declined 28%. Note: we had to back into these numbers from information that was somewhat buried in CTRL's filings. The bottom line: in early Q1 prices for a product that represents the majority of CTRL's revenue were significantly cut. This is exacerbated by the volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job. Pakedge Acquisition: The Company closed its acquisition of Pakedge in January for $32.7M in cash. Facing floundering growth prospects, this transaction appears to be a desperate attempt to buy revenue. Pakedge is a private company with limited information available but based upon information on Pakedge's website , it is a hardware company primarily selling routers yet Control4 management characterizes it as a software business (perhaps to justify the lofty multiple). Employee reviews of the company and industry reviews of its product are mixed . Regardless, CTRL used the majority of the cash on its balance sheet to acquire a slow growth, marginally profitable business, selling a commoditized product for 32.7x earnings. In the press release announcing the deal, the Company said, "We are excited to expand their channel with our channel and get the synergies of creativity." This sounds like a pretty flimsy rationale for spending 50% of its cash. In our view, this only accelerates the Company's demise. We have also been hearing that there has been quite a bit of disruption and challenge integrating Pakedge. Distributors have been questioning the compatibility of the two businesses. This is relevant as part of CTRL's 2016 growth expectations is predicated on cross-selling CTRL products at the 1,140 incremental dealers with whom Pakedge does business. It does not sound like there is any incentive for these dealers to suddenly start selling CTRL products and vice versa of CTRL's dealers. Sonos Struggling: Earlier this month, the formerly rapidly growing wireless speaker producer Sonos announced it was laying-off staff and changing course as a result of the disruption Amazon created with its voice-response system. Yet another data point showing the impact of the market shift on other hardware providers. Open-Source & Emergence of Universal Routers: Home Wi-Fi and "Internet of Things" (IoT) eliminated all the technology entry barriers that previously made install systems like Control4's viable. IoT refers to the ability to virtually connect to home and office devices that have embedded sensors. Now most appliances are internet-enabled (smart TVs, wireless speakers, LED lights, etc.) and have their own smart device applications. These are free, can be accessed from your phone or tablet and do not require clunky hardware installation or maintenance. Additionally, the latest CTRL platform is open-source on Android, which eliminates the need for customers to buy a clunky CTRL touchscreen for $1k (a product that accounted for ~15% of revenue per last disclosure). Numerous hardware vendors now sell sub-$200 home routers. Last year, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) released an Android-driven home automation/ IoT platform "Brillo" and "Weave" (I/O agnostic communication system). Part of this will include a home automation hub that will run through the home router. Going a step further, this technology eliminates the need for any controller and shows the direction of automation technology. Control4 sells hardware that automates home appliances, essentially a remote control for video, music and lights. The Company was founded in 2003 and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware. The <$100k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxury-priced providers at the time. For the next three to four years, home automation remained a nascent market and Control4 was one of few selling hardware at the lower-end of the price spectrum (below $5k per unit). CTRL's hardware is sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service. This is a major structural flaw in its business model. Control4's product costs $600-2k for the basic hardware but when you factor in programming and installations, the cost increases massively to $5k-8k for one room, >$20k for a small to mid-sized house. This is a bit of a hidden cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews. These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base. The Company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing. All revenue is from one-time hardware sales. Control4's product is sold through independent, third-party distributors. These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRL's hardware not based on the merits of the technology but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate. As noted, installation costs range from $5k to $20k depending upon the scope of the project. Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration. It is important to note, CTRL does not receive any of this revenue. A basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200. This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates (as indicated by CTRL's poor customer reviews). While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple of years ago, it debilitates CTRL's competitive position given the ever-growing number of alternatives, including Amazon's Echo, which do not require expensive installation and ongoing service. At $8.11 per share, CTRL has a $218M market capitalization (27 F/D shares) and an EV of $170M ($48M net cash adjusting for the Pakedge deal). The Company reported $163M in revenue and $8.1M in adjusted net income in 2015 and Pakedge generated $18.5M in revenue and approximately $1M in net income. CTRL has guided to 2016 revenue of $198M-$202M with adjusted net income of $16M-18M. This implies 10-12% organic revenue growth yet CTRL only grew organic revenue 4% in 2015 (ex-Leaf acquisition) and Pakedge was flat. This also assumes a 100% increase in adjusted net income off the $9.1M base. This is insane given the aforementioned growth and margin headwinds. Yet the current 24.7x proforma EV/LTM net income multiple indicates the market is buying it. At the end of the day, Control4 has a severely impaired business model and the growth story that supports its multiple is imploding. The increasingly bleak competitive picture is leading to negative revenue growth and declining margins. The Company has negligible IP it can monetize. One need only look at the failed sale of peer Wink to get a perspective on how little strategic interest there is for hub hardware manufacturers. At a 15x EPS market multiple (arguably generous given the business profile and prospects), CTRL would trade 40% lower. Ultimately, Control4 lacks any discernible strategic value, thus the stock is not worth anything more than its net cash position of $1.78 per share for a potential 75% return. The primary near-term catalysts include: 1) revenue and margin erosion from recent price cuts and volume declines leading to performance falling well short of current lofty expectations/guidance, 2) increased competitive pressures from Amazon and others, 3) stock re-rating as its fate becomes painfully apparent, and 4) potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures. Accounting Red Flags& Other Considerations Low earnings quality: In 2015, levered FCF was -$4.3M vs. adjusted net income of $8.1M. Inventory has been consistently growing well ahead of revenue. In Q4'15, inventory grew a staggering 40% Y/Y while revenue only grew 4%. Timing of the new product releases can only explain part of this inventory build. The more likely scenario is orders have not been meeting anticipated demand and the Company will likely need to take some write-downs. For six consecutive quarters, A/R has grown well ahead of revenue, suggesting aggressive recognition/pulling forward of sales and/or that CTRL is being forced to extend credit terms to its dealers. The CEO, CFO, VP of Marketing, VP of Business Development and VP of Product Development collectively own 0 common shares. It is also rather telling that Pakedge totally cashed out and did not take any stock in the deal. Not favorable signals or incentives. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
