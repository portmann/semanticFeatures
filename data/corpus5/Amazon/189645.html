Amazon's $50 Fire Tablet Sold Out, Bezos Bans Competing Streaming Devices - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The crazy-low $49.99 price tag of the new Amazon Fire Tablet 7 made it instantly successful. Cheap Fire Tablets are gateways for Amazon to get more subscribers and paying customers. The $49.99 Amazon Fire Tablet is just slightly slower than the $399 iPad Mini 4 when it comes to browsing and video/music streaming. America still loves a good bargain deal. This adage is again confirmed by the overwhelming instant success of the $49.99 Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Fire Android tablet. Due to the huge better-than-expected demand, Amazon notified its customers that the next shipping date for the Fire tablet will be on October 26. The first batch of the Fire tablet apparently sold out during the first shipment date last September 30. The Buy 5, Get 1 Free promotion also definitely contributed to the irresistible appeal of the Amazon Fire tablet. I suspect that many Americans bought the six-pack deal for resale purposes. Since Amazon has no store here in the Philippines (Amazon also doesn't ship to the Philippines), enterprising Americans are tempting me to order one from them for $60.95 +$27.01 international shipping via eBay.ph. Buying this $50 tablet is a no-brainer winner idea . Even though the Amazon Fire tablet only has 1GB of RAM and a quad-core 1.3 GHz MediaTek processor, hands-on tests showed it is only slightly slower than the $399 iPad Mini 4 when it comes to web browsing and streaming video playback. Buying five and getting one free Fire tablets will only cost $250. Six tablets that get access to 30-day Trial of Amazon Prime and free paid Android apps, is certainly a better idea than buying just one $399 iPad Mini 4. The On Device Mayday Screen Sharing app of the $50 Fire Tablet is also a gateway to free tech support from Amazon. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) charges money for its AppleCare service for iPad/iPhone owners. I reiterate that Amazon is truly being ruthless in pushing out a $50 tablet. Customers in mature markets like America will buy millions of this product. This is to the great detriment of other Android tablet vendors, which could also eventually force them to quit the U.S. market. The good performance of the Fire tablet confirmed my suspicion that Amazon used a high-quality processor/CPU to keep it competitive with the iPad and any other more-expensive Android tablets. School districts and government agencies unable to finance bulk purchases of the iPad or the Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) Tab, will probably instead go for the super cheap Amazon Fire tablet. The parents of the K-12 students who get to own a $50 Fire tablet will likely become online shoppers at Amazon, and/or customers of Amazon Prime and Prime Video. Amazon has a compelling need to sell hardware at a loss to continue its strategy of getting more people to become repeat customers of its online store and media streaming subscription services. It is a classic Bezos tactic to give away almost-free gadgets as a bait to hook the many fishes that are still not captured customers of Amazon. Tablets are perfect for reading books and watching movies. Amazon wants more Americans to satisfy their media hunger exclusively from Amazon Prime Video and book store services. Amazon is again being ruthless against its hardware rivals in the video streaming business. Like there are no more Samsung tablets for sale on Amazon's store, Bezos is also banning the sale of video streaming products from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple that are not flawlessly compatible with Amazon Prime Video services. This is a good excuse for Amazon to start eliminating rivals who are using its web platform and customer base to steal sales from its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets. Being ruthless against its rivals is one great reason why we should all continue to hold on to our AMZN shares. Lots of investors still rallied for Amazon this year in spite of its proclivity for selling hardware at zero or negative margins. It greatly outperformed Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and the mighty king of high-margins-only hardware vendor AAPL. Apple's failure to secure a content licensing deal for its planned video streaming service shows it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with Amazon Prime Video.
