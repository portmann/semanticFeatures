Dynamic pricing in at Wal-Mart, out at Target - ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Dec 12 2015, 13:59 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor A deep dive into retail pricing by 360pi indicates Wal-Mart W(NYSE: MT ) has shifted closer to Amazon's dynamic pricing model. Wal-Mart was found to be within 5% of Amazon's prices and shifts pricing on a daily basis at nearly the same rate as the Seattle e-commerce giant. Target (NYSE: TGT ) is more static with pricing and not quite as competitive across the board. Shares of Target have outperformed Wal-Mart by a wide margin this year, but trail the return of the S&P 500 Index. I assume this doesn't take into account things like 5% off with a red card, cartwheel or gift card offers target does. For my money target is a whole lot cheaper. Not to mention they price match wal mart and Amazon.
