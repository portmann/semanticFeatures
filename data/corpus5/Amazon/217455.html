Angie's List: Is The Post-Earnings Pop Justified? - Angie's List, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANGI) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Angie's List popped over 20%. Consumers don't like paying for online reviews, which is why Angie's growth is slowing down. Angie's List (NASDAQ: ANGI ) has staged a massive turnaround is as the stock is up almost 100% in the last three months. Although Angie's share price has recovered, there haven't been any positive developments in the company's business that justify this rise. Angie's shares jumped over 20% in the last two trading sessions on the back of its earnings report. What's surprising is the company's earnings report were anything but good, which is why I think investors should short the stock. The company reported EPS of $0.00, which was $0.05 ahead of the consensus target. Given Angie's high short interest, the stock jumped over 20% on the positive earnings surprise as short sellers started covering. While the EPS was a positive surprise, it doesn't justify the 20%+ rise in share price. The earnings were driven by extensive cost-cutting measures and investors can't expect Angie's to turn profitable just after one breakeven quarter. Angie's selling expense declined by 29% y-o-y and while it helped the company beat the earnings estimate, it isn't sustainable. Angie's list posted a similar positive earnings surprise two quarters ago thanks to a massive reduction in advertising expenses. Share jumped over 50% that day, only to fall over 60% in the next three months. Given the similar rise, investors can use this opportunity to short Angie's List. Consumers are very reluctant to pay for online reviews. Companies like Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP ) provide free reviews, which is why I believe Angie's List business model is not sustainable. Consequently, Angie's list slowing growth isn't surprising. Angie's revenue of $87 million missed the analysts' estimate by almost $2.7 million. The company's paid memberships also grew only 9% y-o-y, a drastic slowdown from 25% growth in the same year-ago period. Moreover, Angie's also slashed its full-year 2015 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The company now expects 2015 revenue of $344 million-$348 million, down from its previous range of $357 million-$363 million. Angie's also expects adjusted EBITDA of $27 million-$30 million, down from its guidance of $30 million-$32 million. With the arrival of competitors like HomeAdvisor and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Home Services, it is hard to see how Angie's List can sustain its present valuation. Angie's ex-CEO Bill Oesterle identified these companies as a big threat to the company's business and said , "These are formidable competitors, and over the long term we have to have the best product, the best service in the marketplace." Although Amazon Home Services isn't as widely available as Angie's List, the company plans to expand to roughly 30 markets by the end of 2015. The service has been well received since its launch, with customers giving workers an average rating of 4.71 out of 5 stars. Amazon also guarantees all purchases so if clients are not satisfied, they get their money back. As far as trust and perception are concerned, Amazon will have an edge over Angie's List. A study by Consumer Reports in 2013 criticized the company of allowing businesses with a B rating or better to pay to get their listing placed at the top of search results. The report said : We think that the ability of A- and B-rated companies to buy their way to the top of the default search results skews the results. Angie's List misleads consumers by prominently promising that "businesses don't pay" and that it's a consumer-driven service supported by membership fees. But almost 70 percent of the company's revenues come from advertising purchased by the service providers being rated. In addition, given that Amazon Home Services doesn't require a paid subscription, Angie's growth will slow down as the former expands to all the markets in the U.S. A short squeeze may have pushed Angie's List 20%+ higher, but the company's business model is still unsustainable. Consumers are always reluctant to buy a subscription, which is why I think people will stop buying Angie's subscription in the long-run. The company hasn't reported a profitable year in 20 years of existence, and given the increasing competition, I expect its growth to slow down drastically in the foreseeable future. Hence, I think investors should consider shorting Angie's List after the massive post-earnings pop. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
