UPS: The Structural Bull Market Has Ended - United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) | Seeking Alpha UPS is an old-world company in a new world that demands more from vendors. The company’s last three Christmas seasons have been embarrassing, pointing to capacity issues. I think the stock has long-term downside as UPS has proven it cannot adapt to higher volumes and is in the process of being cut out by Amazon. UPS (NYSE: UPS ) has seen its stock largely range bound for the past two years after a failed breakout at the end of 2014 brought the stock off of its highs. The company has been somewhat on its heels of late as it has struggled with growth, headwinds due to the strong dollar and issues of its own making. The company has been a bit of a battleground stock here on SA with bulls staunchly defending the long-term growth story while bears point to many warning signs that things may not be so rosy. In light of some of the more recent issues UPS has encountered, I'll weigh in on the debate. I think what's more important than UPS' valuation right now is addressing the bull market in shipping that has existed for a long time. UPS and FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) have been in the sweet spot of massive volume growth in e-commerce in particular and that volume growth has driven investments in infrastructure and higher revenue and profits for UPS. But the argument seems to be losing steam in my view as it appears to me that UPS has hit a number of walls that will head off future growth. First, the strong dollar has impacted virtually every multinational in a significant way. UPS gets a significant portion of its revenue from outside the US and this was evident in the company's Q3 results . Revenue at the International segment fell 7% despite 0.4% growth on a currency neutral basis. The segment accounts for about 20% of overall revenue so the impact of the loss is more muted than it could be but this will continue to keep a lid on revenue growth given that growth everywhere else is slow. UPS is certainly fighting an uphill battle with the international business - starting with a mid-single digit handicap - and that will keep overall growth in check. With the Fed decoupling from other central banks around the world this problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. In addition, UPS has had a rough Christmas the last few years as it has failed outright to deliver on promises made to get packages to their destinations by certain deadlines. This is not only embarrassing for UPS because that is its only job but it's also embarrassing to the customers that are paying the bills, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). We all remember Amazon handing out gift cards after UPS failed to deliver some customers' packages by the stated date and that is something that no one wants to repeat. However, it seems UPS is struggling again this year to meet deadlines and in my area they are even working on Saturdays and Sundays to fulfill orders. That speaks to the urgency with which UPS is trying to scramble to catch up, which brings us to my next point. It certainly seems to me that UPS has hit some sort of capacity ceiling during the Christmas season. Of course volume spikes this time of year but UPS has proven itself woefully inadequate to the challenge for three years now. This is not a fluke. It's a structural issue that continues to be a problem and it seems UPS has no answer. The company knows Christmas comes at the same time every year and it also knows volume is going to spike and yet it seems completely overwhelmed when the packages hit its system. To be fair, there are only so many packages human drivers can deliver in a day and it seems whatever that number is it's less than what UPS is getting at Christmas, which results in delays and people working on Sundays. Of course, the downside to all of this outside of the sheer fact that UPS looks incompetent is that large customers like Amazon get irritated and find another way to get their packages delivered. Amazon will not endure more embarrassment where it has to hand out gift cards en masse and is putting together plans for not only leasing freighter jets but its own fleet of trucks and last-mile delivery drivers. Amazon is looking to control every inch of the supply chain and that is terrible news for UPS. The only purpose UPS serves is to control the supply chain. And while not everyone can afford to build their own delivery fleet, the eventual loss of Amazon as a customer down the road would potentially be devastating. Given Amazon's history of doing things that seem crazy at first, I wouldn't doubt that Amazon's ultimate plan is to never have anyone besides an Amazon employee or contractor touch a box. That's billions of dollars in lost revenue for UPS. And while it won't happen overnight, it will likely begin next year given the progress Amazon has made with its own delivery plans. And what is to stop Target (NYSE: TGT ), Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) or any other large retailer from doing something similar? Or just using Amazon's delivery fleet? All of this is to say that the structural bull market that was in place for UPS is no more. UPS is an old-world company with a nice niche it carved out for itself that has made long-term shareholders a lot of money. But with UPS proving to be incompetent at the most critical point in the year multiple times now, its reputation must be suffering. I think a lot of big customers use UPS because there is no better alternative. But what happens when Amazon has its delivery fleet up and running? Surely it will take on other business besides its own to help pay the bills. These are long-term problems UPS is facing and while these are not short-term headwinds, they will almost certainly keep a lid on the stock over the long term. The dividend is nice and UPS continues to produce lots of free cash flow that it then returns to shareholders. But I think capital gains are going to be very hard to come by and I also think 2016 estimates are at risk. Sentiment on UPS is higher than I would think it should be for a company that is performing with such mediocrity and eventually it's going to catch up to the stock. UPS is good for its dividend but not much else and if it breaks below rising channel support - currently at $96/$97 - look out below. I'm not shorting UPS yet but if it breaks the channel I will. There are too many headwinds for this to turn out well in my view. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
