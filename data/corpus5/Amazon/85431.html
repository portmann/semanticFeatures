Why Nordstrom Will Outperform Amazon Over The Next Several Years - Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE:JWN) | Seeking Alpha Why Amazon's market cap of over $200 billion is unjustified. The two different strategies Amazon and Nordstrom are using for growth. Sometimes it's difficult to consider Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) a retail business, because it has attempted to position itself as a tech company, rather than the warehouse/distribution company it actually is. So when I compare my outlook for Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) against Amazon, it may be hard for some to think of it as an apple and apple comparison, because it has initiated numerous projects outside of its core competency, which gives the appearance of a multifaceted company, but can't hide the fact it's basically a retail distribution company. Nordstrom is of course easily recognizable as a retail company, and I'll show in this article why they are more predictable and steady over the long term, than the adventurous Amazon, which still tries to extend itself far beyond its core business at the expense of its earnings, free cash flow and consistency. In the short term Nordstrom will be under some pressure because of its growth strategy, which it has committed several billion dollars to over the next several years. So while it will have some pressure there, it is financing its growth through its cash flow, and not adding to its debt; something Amazon isn't participating in. Overall, I'll show why Amazon is much more vulnerable to a downturn than Nordstrom is, and why Nordstrom will do better as it solidifies its foundation for future growth. First we'll look at Amazon. A couple of weeks ago Amazon announced it was going to hire over 6,000 full-time workers for its fulfillment centers in the U.S., citing rising demand. Early in June it also said it was going to hire another 1,000 workers for its fulfillment centers in California. This doesn't include the announcement it made concerning hiring workers for its first PC game. It's possible the $3.2 billion in free cash flow will pay for part of this hiring spree; although that's not a given. It depends on if there is something else it wants to throw capital at, and if it decides to do it through debt or cash flow. My concern is where Amazon is getting its justification for hiring this many new employees. It stated it is coming from demand, and yet there hasn't been much to show that is the case. It's possible the latest report on U.S. retail sales reflects a boost in Amazon's retail unit, as they increased by 1.2 percent in May, after a weak 0.2 percent gain in April. While that points to Amazon getting the benefit of some of that spending, it certainly couldn't be the impetus behind hiring over 7,000 new workers for its fulfillment centers in the U.S. It could also be a move to boost its brand image, which has been under pressure in Europe concerning anti-competitive practices , and in the U.S. for worker conditions and wages. At this time it appears it's probably a combination of both that has caused the company to add to its retail work force. I'll wait to see the next couple of retail sales reports before I conclude growth is a part of the hiring process. If it slows down again, my conclusion is the hiring is to primarily strengthen its brand. If consumers are again loosening up their wallets, than it is a positive catalyst for Amazon; one that will likely move its share price higher in the short term. Why does this concern me as to motivation behind the number of new hires? Remember the 10,000 robots Bezos boasted about in 2014? There is also the recent robotics conference hosted by Amazon where it had a competition to see which robot could best pick orders. While they're not ready yet, if we are fairly close to getting driverless cars on the road, it won't be as difficult to successfully design robots that can successfully pick products at or near 100 percent levels. Sizes and colors appear to be the challenge left to be conquered. The point is while Amazon is hiring, it seems to be, at the same time, sending a message to those that are attempting to pressure or force it into paying higher wages and better benefits. With it struggling on the profit side since it launched, this is something that investors will have to watch closely over time. I don't believe Amazon, as it is now, could survive a major increase in wages and benefits to human employees. The latest numbers for Amazon, especially with its free cash flow, resulted in it getting an immediate boost to its market cap of $25 billion after its earnings report was circulated. That's concerning because there is absolutely nothing in the report, and its past performance, that can justify that type of increase. Of course investors have done this, so you could say they consider Amazon having the ability to generate significant future earnings and cash flow. I don't consider that outlook approaching reality, and I'll show you why. First, let's look at net income for Amazon. It has been 18 quarters in a row since Amazon last posted an earnings gain, and that was in third quarter of 2010, when it generated $1.1 billion in earnings. In the latest quarter it had a loss of $406 million year-over-year. The last time it performed that poorly was in the last quarter of 2001. Over the longer term it isn't much better. In the last decade it has only produced earnings of $4 billion. That's on revenue of approximately $300 billion. That means on average over the last 10 years, Amazon generated $400 million annually, on revenue of about $30 billion a year. For some unknown reason the market has chosen to reward it with a value at 190X earnings, and a market cap over $200 billion. It boggles the mind and sends up red flags. What about free cash flow? Is that any better? Not to me. While it did come in at a little under $3.2 billion in its latest quarter, that brings the company being valued at 65X free cash flow. Again, I can't see anything that can justify that valuation. While it paraded that number more than any other, it also added it was up 112 percent over the same reporting period the prior year. The problem is that came in at a time when it was at the bottom of a downward move. Finally, when looking at the end of 2009 , free cash flow for Amazon stood at $2.92 billion. That means the annual rate of growth for free cash flow over the last five years has been under 1 percent (0.8). It also looks like earnings and free cash flow will remain under pressure, as the EU is scrutinizing the tax practices of Amazon in the region, and it has already agreed to change its practices in some countries, and will probably do so in all countries in the region, which will increase its tax burden. Taxes are also increasing in the U.S., as it adds to the number of states it has fulfillment centers in (physical presence), and also data warehouses. The latest state it has agreed to collect sales taxes in is Ohio, which it is doing voluntarily; although it was almost a surety it would have had to in the near future. This is going to be a growing burden on Amazon, and in light of its weak long-term performance, will need to find answers, or it's going to take a big hit in my opinion. Nordstrom has a goal of increasing its revenue from just under $14 billion annually, as of the latest earnings report, to over $20 billion by 2020. This is the major narrative for Nordstrom, and what investors with a long-term outlook need to look at. To achieve that, the company will have to add new customers and improve its cross-shopping strategy. To add to its sales with existing customers, it will have to continue to offer more merchandise on a timely basis. That's the new reality for fashion retailers like Nordstrom, and it has been doing a good job of that over time. And as mentioned, it will have to make improvements on its cross-shopping outlets to increase sales there. That also has been doing well. As for new customers, a lot of that will come from its foray into Canada, which the company sees as ultimately being a $1 billion dollar market. It is also opening a couple of new stores in the U.S., as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico. These will be a nice addition to its revenue momentum, which as of last quarter was up 9.8 percent over the same quarter last year, reaching $3.1 billion. As for comparable sales, that was up a decent 4.4 percent, led by its Nordstrom.com website, which gained 20 percent, and its off-price Internet sales - up 50 percent year-over-year. Nordstrom's EPS did drop in the most recent quarter, coming in at $0.66, down from $0.72 year-over-year. That was from Nordstrom's increasing presence in Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club. Without that earnings would have been a little on the positive side before taxes. I'm not concerned about this at all, because the steps being taken and strategy implemented, is resulting in solid growth for the retailer. According to CFO Michael G. Koppel, investments in HauteLook, Trunk Club and Canada has boosted sales by $100 million in the first quarter. Concerning Rack, growth there has been very good, as the company has plans to open another 10 stores in this quarter. Another 16 are planned to be opened in fall season. Rack comps were slightly down by 0.2 percent, but maintains its outlook of comps ending the year with growth in the low single-digit range. To better serve its customers, it is also building a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania in the fall. Guidance for earnings and revenue were maintained by the company, with expectations of $3.65 to $3.80 in yearly earnings, and revenue growth in a range of 7 percent to 9 percent for the year. On the capital expenditure side, the company will spend about $4.3 billion, which amounts to approximately 5 percent of sales. Of that, the company plans to spend about $1 billion, or 25 percent in Manhattan and Canada. Koppel added that those two projects are viewed as extremely important, calling them "generational investments," which have the potential to significantly add to the value of the Nordstrom brand and boost markets share. He sees them being a major impetus to gain market share for "several decades." About 40 percent of its growth plan will include expenditures on opening new stores and reinvestment. The remaining 35 percent of CapEx over the next five years will be spend on fulfillment and technology, which it has a goal of creating synergies in the entire business. That's a reference to providing a seamless experience across a variety of sales channels. In the short term, meaning 2015, CapEx will have more of an impact on earnings, with that decreasing after 2015, coming down to under 5 percent of sales. Along with new stores in Canada and Manhattan, and the Pennsylvania fulfillment center, the company also has plans to remodel a few of its flagship stores. The importance of all of this to me is Nordstrom has been able to continue to grow while it is putting its foundation for future growth into place. That speaks of brand strength and good management. I don't see anything that will change that in the short or long term. I like how Nordstrom is positioning itself for ongoing and sustainable growth long into the future. Once 2015 is over and the stores and fulfillment center are operational, it should bring about a major growth spurt that could last for many years. Add to that the fact the costs of that strategy will continue to fall, and the company has a good plan in place to retain its brand strength, and I see this as a good business to invest in and hold for the long haul. Amazon must start to show it is committed to profits, and quit acting like it's a Google or Apple wannabe. It may have an Internet ordering system, but it's still primarily a warehouse, retail distributor. Until it accepts that and quits throwing shareholders money carelessly around with little in the way of a coherent strategy, it's going to continue to struggle with earnings and free cash flow. The new tax pressure and additional workforce, make it very difficult to see how Amazon is going to improve its performance. What I do like concerning Amazon is its Amazon Prime service, which I see as the most important part of company growth. That's because it is highly valued by its customers, and they spend far beyond the non-Prime member. The churn is also fairly low, which means it's one of the few constants that can be counted on from quarter to quarter by the giant retailer. But even here the company had to increase its price because of higher delivery costs. Also a factor is its Prime Instant Video service, which it has to continually pay out to produce its own content and to pay for content from other media companies. The importance of its video streaming service is it helps to keep churn at a manageable level. When looking at a 5-year chart for Amazon and Nordstrom, it would seem crazy to choose Nordstrom over Amazon for the future. But Amazon is a lot of smoke and mirrors, and is very prone to move off its core business to throw a lot of capital at dubious ventures. The long-term weakness of earnings and anemic free cash flow confirm to me it will eventually have to be more particular and careful about what it chooses to invest in. I understand the marketing value of making the seemingly endless announcement of new projects it's undertaking or acquiring, but it is doing so at the expense of meaningful profitability. Until shareholders pressure management to become more cautious with their money, I don't see this changing. That's why it will remain a volatile company that will suffer significantly with its share price when the next downturn comes. Nordstrom on the other hand, is positioned for more visible and consistent growth. It has a very clear strategy and amount it's going to spend to achieve its goals; which I believe it will reach over the next several years. I also like the fact it is aware of and responding to the demand for a constant introduction of new products to its mix. That is the key for retail fashion stores, and those that get it right, will continue to outperform those that are slow to respond. For example, it has brought brands like Brandy Melville, Tilbury and Madewell to its stores, and customers have responded strongly to them. With a projected revenue growth goal of about 50 percent to over $20 billion in less than five years, I see Nordstrom outperforming Amazon. Not only that, but I see the market catching on to the weakness of Amazon, and when it underperforms, and is identified as such, it will be hit hard. That is certainly going to happen more than one quarter over the next several years, which is another reason I see Nordstrom being the better performing company during that period of time.
