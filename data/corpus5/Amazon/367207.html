All Eyes Are On Facebook At F8 - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Given the high expectations, Facebook needs to release a major announcement. As noted in my previous articles, Facebook is priced for perfection. Anyone who follows my articles knows that I have questioned Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) with regard to how long their business model can beat expectations. On the eve of the F8 Developer Conference I thought now would be a good time to check the performance of my prior two calls and to give my opinions on the upcoming Conference. Before I discuss the new clouds hanging over Facebook I need to clear the air. It has been suggested by many that one is only as good as their track record. So, with that being said, I decided to go back and check my performance related to Facebook. My first article was published at night on February 24th. In it, my conclusion was: "With that being said, our outlook for Facebook stock is for market underperformance in 2016. Please note that this does not translate into my stating that this is an opportunity or claim to short Facebook. Rather, as just stated, it constitutes an expectation of market underperformance." My second article was published at night on March 24th. In that article, my conclusion was: "At current levels, Facebook cannot be recommended as a buy or hold. Therefore, a sell or short would be the only logical conclusion." I bring these up because in both instances I have been attacked by every FB bull for questioning their beloved and well performing (so far) investment. My thesis for both articles was that complacency in FB (buy and hold) may not be the most prudent decision. So why write a new article? Because we are on the eve of the F8 Developer Conference. The last two weeks have seen some interesting stories devoted to Facebook. The first article I saw is an article by Richard Saintvilus that raises questions surrounding the double-digit decline in FB "original posts." In it, he mentions reports from 2015 that showed personal posts were down 21% and overall sharing of posts was down 5.5%. Mr. Saintvilus also mentions that "according to reports, Facebook recently suffered a double-digit decline in 'original posts.'" These updates not only are a critical part of Facebook's advertising dominance, they are how Facebook collects personal information about its users and a primary source of determining targeted advertising." The second article I saw was an article written by Brian Deagon that brings into question what we can or should expect from Facebook at the F8 meetings. In it he mentions: "Two sessions are dedicated to Messenger - the first is at noon Tuesday and is titled "Messenger: Connecting People and Business." At this event, Facebook is expected to announce plans to integrate so-called chatbots into its mobile Messenger platform." Also, "a second session on Messenger takes place Wednesday at noon, entitled "Messenger: The Future of Communications." The expectations are high. With Facebook by their own admission (page 14 of their 2015 annual report) stating that their user growth is slowing - "we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we achieve greater market penetration." FB needs new and creative venues to keep and grow the user engagement of their members. Mr. Deagon notes that the Live video streaming service for mobile device users and Oculus will also be main focuses of attendees attention. The third article was an article written by Shirley Pelts where she discussed why Facebook withdrew their bid to stream NFL games. The main reason for the withdrawal apparently was something FB has created called Facebook Sports Stadium. As Sheryl notes: "Its purpose is to attract sports fans to follow play-by-play updates, live scores, and commentaries on games. The new feature will allow users to share player statuses and videos as well as to discuss major sporting events with fans and followers." Interestingly, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) won the bid, despite not being the high bidder, and not even being mentioned as a contender in the bidding war. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) were considered to be the other serious contenders. So what does Twitter winning mean? Essentially, TWTR has a lock on many of the tweets/comments related to those games. People are lazy. Why watch the feed on Twitter than move to FB to post your thoughts? Users will already be logged in to Twitter and can share their thoughts there. The negative press does not stop there. Recent days have seen a significant increase in articles questioning Facebook and their dominance. Additional articles ranging from this article to this article to this article and even this article have popped up on the radar screens of investors at a much more increased pace than past months have witnessed. Finally, I need to discuss quickly the technical breakdown in Facebook. The failure of FB to break out to new highs despite the overall market strength in the past few weeks has given momentum players ammunition to take FB down going into both the F8 conference and the upcoming earnings announcement. So what does it all mean? I have focused on it in the past but it needs to be repeated. With a stock price of $110 or higher, a market capitalization well in excess of $300 billion and a PE ratio that is over 80, the market is pricing FB for perfection due to its successes in the past. With that being said, if there is no earth shattering announcement from FB at F8 or earnings do not beat expectations another (significant) round of selling may be at the doorstep of Facebook longs. My call of March 24th stands. Now is a good time to sell or short Facebook. Disclaimer: Investing in stocks such as Facebook can be risky. There is no guarantee that your investment will be safe.
