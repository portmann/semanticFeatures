Apple: Mac Sales Delivered Increased Market Share But Still Posted Negative Growth - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple still has an important revenue stream from Mac computers. It must adapt with current trends. We should all know that like all other PC vendors, Apple also posted negative YoY growth for Q3 2015. Gartner said Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) increased its market share in PC sales in Q3 2015. However, IDC's chart below says Apple, like other top PC vendors, also posted negative growth in Mac sales during the most recent quarter. Gartner claimed that Apple Mac sales increased 1.5% YoY but IDC said the global shipment of Macs for Q3 2015 was actually -3.4% YoY compared to Q3 2014. I will go with the assessment of IDC that Mac sales still declined by volume, in spite of it growing its market share from 6.9% to 7.5%. I say so because I believe that the lack of touchscreen-enabled Mac computers also made it vulnerable to a current market trend toward touchscreen computers like the upcoming Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro 4. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is now taking pre-orders of the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft's equalizer to the MacBook Pro will likely get shipped before 2015 ends. Mac sales also may continue to drop because the no-touchscreen policy of Apple right now is an obvious Achilles heel that Windows PC vendors will continue to exploit. While its rivals Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ), Dell, Acer and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) are now selling touchscreen-equipped desktop and laptop computers, Apple-branded computers are still stuck in the no-touchscreen-display era. Yes, Apple computers have been posting an impressive growth rate recently in spite of the mainstream decline in PC sales. However, Apple's product differentiation policy that compels it to never release a touch-friendly Mac OS X computer could ultimately relegate Mac OS X PCs to a zero-growth or declining niche. The ambitious entry of Microsoft as a laptop vendor also is a clear and present danger to the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air sales. As you can see below, Microsoft is leveraging Amazon's online marketplace to disseminate its first high-end laptop. It's geared toward high-income customers of the MacBook Pro. The $2,699 Surface Book has a touchscreen-friendly and detachable PixelSense 13.5-inch display that no MacBook Pro can match right now. There also are dozens of new all-in-one touch-enabled desktop PCs that are cheaper than the iMac. The $2,700 HP Z1 G2 all-in-one is as powerful as any Apple iMac Retina available now. Unless Apple surrenders to the current trend toward touchscreen-equipped computers, I fear that the Mac's current popularity will eventually wane. I understand that Apple wants to maximize monetization of die-hard Mac users by not giving them a touch-enabled computer. They will be forced to buy an iPad or an iPad Pro as a companion tool for their expensive MacBook Pros and Mac Pro computers if they want touchscreen productivity. However, Microsoft and its partner OEMs are now shifting toward an all-touchscreen PC product line-up. This could eventually persuade even the most ardent Mac-using graphic artist to defect. As long as Tim Cook does not allow a touchscreen-friendly Mac computer design, Apple's PC business is in danger of repeating the same downward spiral of iPad sales. The cult-like following of the Mac is what is helping it gain traction now. However, this is not going to last forever. Microsoft has the advertising budget to aggressively promote its Surface Book and Surface Pro as superior alternatives to outdated Mac laptops that still rely on mouse and keyboard operations. Smart consumers will obviously see the great savings in buying just the 2-in-1 Surface Pro instead of buying the MacBook Air and the iPad Pro. Mac computers running a Yosemite 10.10 or newer OS should be able to go full touchscreen-friendly . It is only Apple's love for its lucrative product differentiation that is holding back touch-enabled Mac computers. Enterprising Americans are now exploiting this by modifying MacBooks to function like Mac OS X tablets. ModBook buys Macbooks and then modifies them to work with a touchscreen display. Their clients are mostly creative professionals like me. I believe Apple is missing a great opportunity to really dominate the PC market by refusing to equip its Mac computers with a touchscreen display. Consequently, I will not endorse a buy for AAPL. Tim Cook should not ignore the threat posed by touchscreen-friendly Windows 10 desktop computers and laptops. I hope that he will eventually change his mind like he did last year when he finally released phablet-sized iPhones last year. The product differentiation needed to sell a non-touchscreen Macbook to force loyal Apple users to also get the iPad is not tenable in the long run. Imitating the large-screen phablets of Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) definitely helped the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to break record sales. In the future, when MacBook sales go stagnant, Apple will have no choice but to also imitate the 2-in-1 form factor and touchscreen usability of the Surface Book/Surface Pro 4.
