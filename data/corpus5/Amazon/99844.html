Amazon's Shipping Strategy And Why It Must Work - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Why the company is experimenting with a variety of delivery options. It seems just about every few days there's another story on how Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is going to take steps to address the rising costs of shipping; especially in light of the fact Amazon Prime is the future of the company, and it will struggle if it can't deal with the shipping costs which are eating into margin and earnings. In 2014 shipping costs jumped 31 percent, while revenue growth came in at 19.5 percent. It doesn't take a genius to see that this can't continue on if Amazon wants to retain investor trust. Among the variety of ways Amazon is reportedly dealing with the issue, is to offer an Uber-type of delivery service , rather than UPS and other delivery services. The assumption is the current delivery operators are the cause of the problem in regard to higher costs, so Amazon is taking steps to deal with the issue on its own terms. It remains to be seen whether or not it will successfully carry out its strategy. It appears that in order to compete profitable Amazon will have to go outside of normal delivery channels to achieve that goal. The other option would be to raise the price of its products and services, along with the annual Amazon Prime membership. I don't think it wants to do so this soon after it did so last year. Consumers would probably rebel at the notion of a higher Amazon Prime until the company can add value to the point it's still considered a bargain.

This isn't all the delivery services Amazon is thinking of, but a few that have been reported on. At a glance the option with the opportunity to make the biggest impact would be its use of amateur drivers. How that would probably work is Amazon would rent out space in local retail stores or other businesses, have the packages delivered there by its current delivery companies, and from there have it picked up and delivered by local drivers who know the area. That's an assumption of course, but it makes the most sense. Another possibility would be to build smaller facilities which it would deliver to from its regional fulfillment center, and from there have them picked up by the locals. Whatever the details end up being, it would be surprising if that isn't a part of its delivery system in the future. What Amazon's delivery future will look like My belief is Amazon's delivery strategy will eventually evolve into a multifaceted one, where it includes a variety of delivery options across the world. While that is already happening, it will roll that out to numerous regions once it has the logistics in place to run the complicated affair. Since Amazon is already an expert in logistics, it's only a matter of deciding which delivery systems will be offered in specific locations. From there it will only be a matter of setting them up and operating them. Even there it could include more than one type of delivery option for each customer in the area, allowing for choices to be made. Either way, it would result in lower shipping costs for the retail giant. Another reason for a variety of delivery options Since shipping costs have risen so quickly, there can be no doubt one of the reasons Amazon is letting it be known it's experimenting with a variety of shipping options is in order to use it as a bargaining chip with those services. When sales rise at a 19 percent clip and Amazon isn't close to keeping up with the boost in prices from its existing delivery services, it must do something in order to rein in those costs. That's a major reason we're hearing about all the delivery options Amazon is considering. But I don't believe Amazon is bluffing here at all. It has to find ways to cut shipping costs. If it can't negotiate down some of the costs, it will forced to develop other means of delivery. Further out it will probably continue to use UPS (NYSE: UPS ), FedEx (NYSE: FDX )and others, but it won't be at the prior levels it had been. That's something to consider for those holding these type of stocks, as over time the crowd sourced business model will compete against the delivery majors, and that will cut into some of their earnings. As mentioned earlier, Amazon Prime is the core business at Amazon, and its success will determine the performance of the company. While there are a lot of numbers thrown around as to how much Prime members buy in comparison to non-Prime members, there is no way of knowing how accurate those numbers are. One thing that is a surety is Amazon Prime members do spend a significant amount more than non-Prime members do, and Amazon must find a way to make that a profitable business as it scales it out. With 2-day shipping being the key element attracting consumers to Prime, the company will have to cut shipping costs in order to keep from having to increase Amazon Prime annual fees. I think if it had to increase it above $100 a year, it would be a psychological barrier to many, and it would result in higher churn going forward. Make no mistake about it, shipping costs are of major importance to Amazon at this time, and it will do whatever it takes to lower costs. And these shipping concerns are directly correlated to its popular Amazon Prime service. Amazon can't afford to incur losses in this program, as it is the future of the company. Nothing else comes close in value at this time, and won't far into the future. So whenever the issue of shipping comes up in regard to Amazon, think of it in relationship to Amazon Prime and how it may impact the service. That means from it being a bargaining chip in negotiations with larger carriers, to providing a variety of low-cost delivery alternatives under different regional scenarios. My outlook is Amazon will eventually end up with several major different shipping alternatives, with several more that will be operated on a smaller scale in concert with the local requirements and conditions. When I say smaller scale, I don't mean it won't have it in a significant number of communities, or possibly even countries. I mean it may have a smaller presence and impact on specific localities, but still be spread around the U.S. or the world. Obviously, the way to measure its progress in this area is to look at the shipping numbers. Earnings of course will also be a significant measure; although it will take at least a couple of years for this to play out and be visible to investors. That means in the shorter term Amazon may struggle in these areas until if finds a sustainable low-cost shipping solution. In 2014 shipping costs climbed to $8.7 billion, an increase of $2.07 billion, or 9.8 percent of total sales. In 2013, shipping costs accounted for 8.9 percent of all sales.
