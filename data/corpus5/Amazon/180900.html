The $140 Amazon Fire TV Gaming Edition Is A Strong Rival Of The Apple TV 4 - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The Amazon Fire TV outsold the Apple TV 3 last year. Apple has launched the new games-centric Apple TV 4. I'm in love with Tim Cook's new $199 games-centric Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV 4. However, I admit that the $140 Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Fire TV Gaming Edition bundle is more attractive. Unlike Apple, which has not announced a free dedicated game controller for the Apple TV 4, Amazon is bundling a free game controller and a 32GB SD card with its latest Android gaming console TV product. Amazon is now accepting pre-orders for its equalizer to the Apple TV 4. It is also offering two free games with the $140 Fire TV Gaming Edition. I predicted last April 2014 that Amazon's move to sell a games-friendly smart TV stick was a killer idea. I am now happy to report that the Fire TV Stick outsold the Apple TV last year. The superior internal hardware and gaming performance of the Fire TV Stick definitely contributed to its first-year debut success. Amazon's Android Smart TV product no doubt inspired Apple to come up with a new generation Apple TV with a beefed-up processor and GPU. Unfortunately for the iPhone company, Bezos has again come up with a cheaper (but better value-for-money) version of the Apple TV 4. Apple is not only going to compete with the Xbox and PlayStation, Amazon has a great gaming console in the Fire TV Gaming Edition. The Fire TV gaming platform already has 800 optimized Android games that take advantage of the special hardware and software of Amazon's Smart TV product. I expect the different variants of the Fire TV to again outsell the Apple TV 3 and Apple TV 4 this year. The Smart TV portfolio of Amazon now caters to a wider addressable market. The $140 version is a great bargain for mobile gamers who want to play their favorite Android games on their giant 52-inch TV sets. The gaming console of Amazon has a USB 2.0 port and a microSD slot, features that Apple devices always lack. The Fire TV Gaming Editon touts support for 4K (2160p at 30fps) Ultra HD TV/displays, Dolby Surround 5.1 Audio, and a powerful PowerVR GX6250 GPU . The low price tag of the games-centric Fire TV Gaming Edition is a classic Bezos move. This is similar to what he is doing with the new $50 Fire Tablet . He is letting customers get bargain deals on Amazon-branded tablets and Smart TV products. Bezos knows there is a high chance those buyers will become repeat customers of Amazon's marketplace. Aside from the products that Amazon will sell to buyers of the $140 Fire TV Gaming Edition, there's also the share from partnership distribution deals over paid video streaming services. The Fire TV products are great vehicles for on-demand TV shows and movies. The timely move of Amazon to immediately counter the upcoming threat of a games-centric Apple TV 4 again showcase the decisive/fearless leadership of Bezos. He knows all too well that the Fire TV platform's success last year was due to Apple's lack of updates for the Apple TV. Now that Tim Cook has upgraded the Apple TV with a games-centric design, it is astute of Bezos to immediately match it with cheaper Fire TV alternative. Gaming is part and parcel of the surging sales of connected TV products. As of Q1 2015, Amazon already has 30% of the U.S. TV streaming products market. A special gaming edition should help it win more market share. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
