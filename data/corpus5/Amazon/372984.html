(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Mar 11 2016, 10:42 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor TechCrunch: "[Amazon] plans to launch a free platform for schools and other educators to upload, manage and share educational materials. Signs indicate that the platform will be based around open educational resources (OER) and will come with a ratings system and interface that will resemble the commercial Amazon.com many of us already know and use." The site observes Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) recently set up a wait list for its education platform. Amazon: "The future of education is open. Someday soon, educators everywhere will have free and unlimited access to first-class course materials from a revolutionary platform." The e-commerce giant, which might hope to use a free learning platform to help sell Kindles, digital textbooks, and other products to schools, bought online math instruction service TenMarks in 2013, and has been prepping a self-publishing service for schools called Inspire (could be linked to the wait list). 2U ( TWOU -2.5%), which works with colleges to provide fully-fledged online degree programs (rather than just online learning materials), is lower on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.3%.
