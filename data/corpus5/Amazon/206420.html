Wal-Mart: The Software Company - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart's early success was tied to technology. WMT is now "pulling an Amazon" to focus again on cloud and device technology. When Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) told investors it would "pull an Amazon.com" (NASDAQ: AMZN ) for the next few years, foregoing profit in order to invest in technology, the stock tanked and the onlookers laughed. But what most people don't know is that WMT has always been a technology company. Its rise in the 1980s and 1990s was fueled by bar code technology, which could track shipments directly from Chinese manufacturers through stores, and efficiently manage inventory to reduce the need for warehousing. Competitors have caught up with all that. Amazon, in particular, has gone well beyond that; its Amazon Web Services cloud disrupting the heart of the technology market. That's where Wal-Mart is now going to focus. Its move this week to open source its cloud hopper technology , which allows companies to manage their workloads on disparate clouds, is aimed squarely at the heart of Amazon's cloud business. As Wal-Mart said in its announcement the whole idea behind OneOps is to eliminate "cloud lock-in," to allow enterprises to continuously choose among cloud vendors in order to get the best possible deal. As WalmartLabs head Jeremy King wrote: It's great news for companies who have considered switching cloud providers but experience the 'Hotel California Effect,' where they can 'check out but never leave' their cloud provider because they're locked into the provider's proprietary APIs, architecture and tools. The key words there are "the provider's proprietary APIs." Amazon's proprietary API is considered the "secret sauce" of AWS, an industry standard coders have to write to. The reason Amazon.com is now worth 2.5 times its annual revenue while Wal-Mart is worth only 40% of its comes down entirely to Amazon Web Services, which has been growing 80% year over year, with very fat margins. The Wal-Mart move won't entirely change that, but it could give customers the ability to reduce their dependence on AWS and cause the kinds of small "cuts" that Amazon's success is causing to WMT's stores. Another piece of Wal-Mart's technology puzzle is Radio Frequency Identification, or RFID. The cost of passive RFID tags has come down to 10 cents each , still too high to put them on individual items, but low enough that, along with portal readers at warehouse and store entrances, you can track goods with far more precision than before. The key software challenge is to get the cost of picking orders from a store closer to what Amazon.com pays in its warehouses, close enough so that the time and distance advantage a network of stores has over a warehouse becomes meaningful. That also means automating consumers' shopping lists - Amazon.com is trying to do that with its widely-lampooned Dash buttons. This is the current focus of WalmartLabs, and it has quietly made 15 acquisitions aimed at that in the last two years as part of that effort. The "holy grail" is that consumers' lists of what they need and use are kept in an electronic form that can be turned into shopping lists with precision, and then fulfilled automatically. Instead of you going to the store, what you need would come to you, and shopping will be transformed from something you do into a service you can buy. This is a software challenge. It is also a system integration challenge, which is why only scaled companies need apply for it. Amazon is well along in this effort. Other stores, like Kroger (NYSE: KR ), are making efforts in that direction. Now, Wal-Mart has decided to focus on this key technology challenge. If it can be met, with true middle-class and lower-middle-class shoppers, the company's physical infrastructure will make it look like a bargain at present levels.
