The Merit Behind Opening A New Position In Marked-Down Wal-Mart - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Invest With Color , Invest With Color (19 clicks) Wal-Mart is currently trading at multi-decade lows due to increased competition and negative overall sentiment. Wal-Mart is still very profitable, with a solid balance sheet and increasing dividend yield. Investments in online may be way overdue, but with investments, Wal-Mart should be better positioned for the new online shoppers. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) has hit hard times recently from the general market, with the stock losing 30% in market cap in 2015. Now, there are some companies that drop this much and I would not touch them with a ten foot pole. There are other times when a drop may actually provide a buying opportunity. There are reasons for the sharp decline, including increased competition, negative overall sentiment towards Wal-Mart and low growth potential. Probably the biggest reason for the decline in Wal-Mart is the rise of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and online shopping. Amazon blew by Wal-Mart in terms of market cap early in 2015, with Amazon's stock price appreciating by 115% with over a month left in 2015. Historically Low Valuation/Historically High Income Generation Wal-Mart is currently trading at historically low multiples in a variety of financial metrics. Since 1985, the price-to-earnings ratio has never been lower than at the current levels. On top of that, the dividend yield has never been higher at almost 3.3%. Another great sign is management lowering the share count through buyback programs. Over the past 20 years, Wal-Mart has successfully lowered the share count by almost 30%. Though earnings have been experiencing slow to stagnant growth recently, due to the share buyback programs, earnings per share have been rising consistently. When a management team has consistent growth, although slow growth, and a mandate to reward shareholders with both share buybacks and increasing dividend payouts, then you have a winning stock position. The payout ratio is currently less than 50% which gives confidence that Wal-Mart can sustain the currently high dividend yield. Having a low price-to-earnings ratio does not mean a company is cheap. The market may be telling you something to justify low multiples. The business of Wal-Mart, at multi-decade low multiples, has been the symbol of consistent results. Even with such a negative sentiment towards Wal-Mart, growth has been steady for years in terms of revenue, consistently profitable, and increasing store front growth worldwide. The figure below shows again that over the past 30 years, on an annual basis, Wal-Mart has succeeded in growing revenue and net income consistently over the long haul, which is important for long-term investors. Past performance shows a company that has been slowly increasing operations and increasing both dividends paid out, revenue and net income proving their model is profitable and can grow. With the shrinking share count, you are getting a dividend growth stock that has decades of solid financial performance to increase your confidence that the dividend is safe. In terms of warehouse sales, Wal-Mart has Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) to deal with in terms of bulk buying and store membership programs. In retail, Target (NYSE: TGT ) has become almost as omnipresent as Wal-Mart with an ever-growing store front base. Amazon rules the online shopping landscape, with Wal-Mart slow to adopt to this shift in customer behavior. Wal-Mart has been lagging behind all three competitors, and if you invested in all three companies three years ago, only Wal-Mart would be your losing position as shown in the figure below. So in terms of financial metrics, how does Wal-Mart stack up with these three competitors? The following table compares some key financial metrics to show how Wal-Mart stacks up to three of its biggest competitors. Even though Amazon has overtaken Wal-Mart in terms of market cap, in terms of revenue, Wal-Mart still stands on top. Besides price-to-free cash flow, where Target is cheaper than Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart is the cheapest stock when comparing price-to-sales and price-to-book. Wal-Mart also leads in dividend yield, net profit margin, return on assets and return on investments. When looking at these companies side by side, Wal-Mart stacks up pretty well with them. The purpose of this table is not to say Wal-Mart is a better investment than its competitors. It is to show that Wal-Mart, when compared to its competitors, is performing quite well with the suppressed stock price more about perceived weakness or general market perception. Recently, Amazon announced the opening of its first brick-and-mortar store in Seattle, Washington. Now, this can be good news for Amazon, but I argue this is good news for Wal-Mart as well. Wal-Mart has been slow in adopting an online presence that can rival Amazon which Wal-Mart is rightfully paying for, but there is still value in having a physical presence, and if Amazon continues to push store fronts, this could be perceived that Amazon acknowledges that there is value in having a brick-and-mortar store which helps Wal-Mart. Right now, Wal-Mart is investing in online sales to compete with Amazon and other online stores and investing in the Sam's Club Membership program to compete with Costco. E-commerce sales have grown by 22% globally, and though this is a small base, the growth rate in encouraging. Sam's Club memberships grew by 10% and drove net sales by $58B. Investing back to the business seems to be a top priority with senior management calling for the highest levels of investments to occur in 2017. Another initiative is the much publicized increase in workers' wages. Though this will hurt the bottom line directly, if Wal-Mart takes care of its employees, this will help the store experience and should increase same-store sales growth. At current valuations, it seems Wal-Mart is priced to pessimistically. There are challenges with some due to increased competition from strong companies and others self-inflicted (e.g. online strategy). In the short term, though, there may be volatility, Wal-Mart supports a high dividend yield to help investors weather any hits on the stock price short term. In the long run, there are signs that Wal-Mart is increasing online presence, investing back in the business and possibly growing the business further. With over 11,000 stores worldwide, a strong balance sheet, an AA credit rating, and a focus to increase shareholder return and supply the lowest price to consumers, the current stock price seems like an attractive entry point for a long-term investment.
