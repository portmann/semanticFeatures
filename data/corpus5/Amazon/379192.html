Can Apple Take India? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Appleâ€™s iPhone sales in India have increased at a tremendous pace of late, though revenue generated from the country is less than even 1% of overall sales. Apple, however, is optimistic about India and expects it to remain one of its fastest-growing markets. There's no doubt the iPhone is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) most important product, and we can't deny that India is among the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world. The good news for Apple investors is the company has cracked the Indian market successfully, but will Apple continue to grow at elevated rates in India? Before trying to answer the question, let us try and understand where the iPhone stands in the scheme of things in India. iPhone makes up more than two-third of Apple's total worldwide sales by revenue. Apple's last reported quarter in India was its best ever in the country. In the fiscal year that ended in September 2015, Apple shipped 1.7 million iPhones in India. In the first quarter of 2016 itself, Apple shipped nearly 800,000 iPhones, which is close to half of what it shipped in four quarters of the preceding fiscal year. In fact, iPhone sales were up 76% in India for the quarter, compared to around 45% in Korea, the Middle-East and Africa, and just 18% in China. This is in complete contrast with the iPhone's global sales growth of 0.4%. Now, India's revenue contribution to Apple can be gauged from the fact that Apple sold a total of 74.8 million iPhones worldwide in just the last quarter, while it shipped only 800,000 units to India in the same period. Also, revenue from India hit $1 billion in the Indian fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2015. That was less than even 0.45% of the $233.7 billion in revenue Apple earned in its fiscal 2015. Moreover, iPhone's market share in India is only 2%. But, this small market share is the reason why Apple is growing at such a terrific pace in India, even though the company's revenue from the country is low. Apple will find it challenging to continue growing at such an exceptional pace in India. India hasn't been as successful as China for Apple. India is a challenging market for Apple, mainly because people in the country have weaker spending power than in China. The iPhone is perceived to be an unnecessarily expensive product by most Indians, even among those who can easily afford one. In fact, the government itself levies substantial import duties on the product as it is on the list of "non-essentials/luxury items," and Apple has been forced into price cuts to move units in the country. For instance, an iPhone 6s Plus 16GB retails for INR 54,990 (approx. $813) on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) India, while the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy S6 Edge with a bigger 32GB memory retails for INR 40,900 (approx. $607). Considering the fact that India's per capita income over 2011-15 was just $375, this is too much money to pay for a phone, and the results can be clearly seen. In India, people are brand conscious, but they do have slightly economical options, such as Samsung, which deliver more than what an average Indian expects out of a mobile phone. Apple belongs to a different class. And that class is in much smaller numbers than what Apple needs to get exorbitant growth numbers in India, which is why it has to resort to discounts to sell units. For instance, Apple's iPhone 6s saw weak sales when the device was launched in 2015 as distributors found it difficult to move inventories due to high prices. Only after the company addressed the pricing challenge by providing more flexibility to retailers and distributors, the inventory began to move. Similarly, the previous generation iPhone 5s also had to be sold on the cheap by Apple to increase the numbers. This is because the average Indian simply drops the idea of buying an iPhone due to high price irrespective of his purchasing power. The tendency to save money and buy more in the same amount stops him to buy the expensive Apple iPhone, a trait that can be easily judged from the fact that Indians save the most money in the world and rather go for investments in appreciating assets. In such a scenario, an expensive iPhone does not make sense, especially considering that India's per capita income is so low. Apple is trying to adapt to the Indian consumer's behavior as there is huge opportunity over here. In fact, just 40% of the phone market in India is made up of by smartphones, while in China, smartphones account for 90% sales. However, Apple needs to understand that it needs more first time buyers in India right now. Once they get locked into its ecosystem, Apple can keep upgrading them to whatever it launches in the future. Apple will benefit in this regard from growing wealth in the Indian middle class, where an individual's wealth ranges between $50,000 and $500,000 annually, meaning that prospective Apple customers are growing at a fast pace. In fact, the Indian middle class has grown by 150% in the past 15 years, outpacing other regions such as the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. But, to get more first time buyers in India, Apple needs to get its pricing strategy right and work its way up the income chain and capitalize on this growing middle class. Moreover, with a constraint on the pricing of its devices, Apple will need to find other revenue streams. Whatever small user base Apple has been able to garner in India, it is building the ecosystem around it. Moreover, of late, Apple has been bolstering its distribution network in India. The company now has five distributors all across the country, with three added recently. By doing so, Apple will be able to tap the fast-growing market for premium smartphones in India. By 2018, it is estimated that the market for premium smartphones in India will be worth 35 million units, which is significantly higher as compared to just 15 million units last year. Now, on the back of its increasing distribution base, the increasing spending power of the Indian middle class, and Apple's moves to make its services more economical, it is expected the company will be able to tap half of this demand for premium smartphones. The Apple brand is as coveted a status symbol in India as it is in China or the U.S. But, in the latter two markets, Apple is entering the saturation zone. On the other hand, Apple hasn't seen much of India yet. Hence, India remains to be exploited by the company for its future growth, especially as it is going to surpass the U.S. as the second-largest smartphone market in the world. But, investors should not forget Apple is making a number of smart moves in India, such as improving the distribution base and reducing prices. As a result, the company should be able to capitalize on the fast-growing premium smartphone market in the country going forward.
