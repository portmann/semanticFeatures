ETSY 30-Day Average Daily Volume data by YCharts The Bears could point to the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) announcement to question Etsy's growth and prospect for growth. Listing growth did flatten for a short time after the Amazon announcement before reaccelerating. Judging from forum thread chatter (more on that below) at Amazon and Etsy it appears the question of whether Amazon will have an Etsy killer platform will soon be answered. Might the Bears start to cover some of their shorts when the Amazon site launches, sell the rumor and buy the fact? What if the Amazon site has a glitch during the launch or opens with fewer than expected vendors or products? Might the Bears cover and book profits before year-end? Bulls might gain confidence with improved investor sentiment if Etsy could deliver an upside surprise on revenue, gross profit, and gross merchandise sales.

The fundamental driver for Etsy is listings and gross merchandise sales. Listings have increased; the unknown is whether sellers have maintained or increased their conversion rate. If they have, then an upside surprise might be forthcoming. There is a risk that Handmade at Amazon will have a successful launch and Etsy's vendors will flee. This is given a low probability as over 20 million buyers have found and purchased an item on the Etsy platform. Buyers are not expected to migrate to the Amazon site for the purchase of handmade items, as the site is better known for general retail items rather than unique and custom-made items. Etsy faces challenges growing the site while maintaining its handmade roots. Some Etsy forum threads have contained concerns over mass produced and counterfeit items. This is expected to be an issue on the Handmade at Amazon site too. So far, Etsy has seen listing growth in the face of headwinds. Should it fend off the Handmade at Amazon challenge then it could become the go-to site for handmade and custom gifts. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
