Value Investors Should Not Be Deterred By Amazon's High Earnings Multiples - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon already dominates in the growing cloud computing market and will continue to do so with its analytics and web services offerings. Value-oriented investors held positions in Amazon at last measure, giving credence to the notion that Amazon is not just a stock with a wild valuation but has value. Amazon Prime Air will drive growth for the company and is just one of Amazon’s innovation initiatives that shows the company’s penchant for research and development. Amazon is highly regarded by its customers, signifying that they won’t easily switch to other services on a whim. Very few companies are as synonymous with their industry as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is with online retail. The US-based e-commerce giant beloved by Wall Street for its outstanding growth continues to outpace even the most optimistic forecasts at a time when traditional retailers are struggling to grow their market . Amazon's established footprint in online retail, leadership pace in the cloud computing market, and strategic investments in drone technology give it an unparalleled advantage over other large-cap internet companies. Yet for all its upside, Amazon's extremely high P/E ratio has supported the contrarian case against buying the company. However, more scrupulous investors understand there's a reasonable trade-off between short-term profitability and future growth. While some investors may be alarmed by Amazon's PEG ratio of 9.42 (compared to just 0.88 and 2.57 for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS ), respectively), the company has clearly taken the high road when it comes to expansion. And as the latest quarterly earnings demonstrated, profitability isn't as elusive as some make it out to be. We take a look at the smart money investors to discern if their sentiments are aligned with ours on a company. Ken Fisher held one of the biggest positions in AMZN at last measure with 2.47 million shares. Fisher is usually a long-term holder, so we expect his AMZN investment to remain when Fisher Asset Management's latest filings are released. We like that Eagle Capital held 2.23 million shares at last count as Eagle is a bottom-up, value-oriented fund and has not been dissuaded up to this point by AMZN's high valuation based on earnings multiples. Landsowne Partners, one of the most successful funds over the last couple years, also had a position in AMZN made up of 1.7 million shares. Landsowne held other stocks we like and recently wrote about at last measure, so we feel that we are seeing value along the same lines. Landsowne owns Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), which we recently wrote about , and also owns The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ), another company we made a case for. We take special note of what stocks funds are long on, especially with respect to value-oriented funds, because their long picks have shown a history of outperformance ( see more details here ). Amazon's latest quarterly report blew past even the most optimistic Wall Street estimates, earning $0.19 per share on $23.18 billion in revenue. The company's sales soared 20% year-on-year, outpacing the highest estimates by more than $300 million. As a result, share prices have set multiple record highs throughout the year. Although Amazon has traditionally had an extremely high price-to-earnings ratio, looking solely at a stock's P/E can be misleading, especially in high-growth sectors. For companies like Amazon, whose revenues continue to grow dramatically thanks to a loyal active consumer base and an expanding business model, profitability is less relevant. While it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a competitive P/E, Amazon has made it abundantly clear that it's focusing on continued growth rather than profitability. With revenues expected to reach more than $105 billion in 2015 and $126 billion in 2016 , the company's growth trajectory will remain linear for the foreseeable future. Sources: MarketWatch. Annual Financials for Amazon.com - Yahoo Finance. Amazon.com Inc. Analyst Estimates While it may be difficult to disassociate Amazon from online retail, the company also is the world's largest provider of cloud computing services - the $100 billion a year global market that's reshaping how businesses operate. If you've never heard of cloud computing or don't know what it is, there's no reason for you to be sifting through Internet stocks. Boasting clients like Netflix, Expedia, Reddit, Adobe Systems and Pinterest - Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing platform, earned $1.824 billion in net sales in 2015 Q2, up 16.5% from the previous quarter. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years and could reach $270 billion in 2020 . The proliferation of big data and the Internet of Things will place more demand on cloud computing services in the short-run, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that Amazon won't be at the cusp of this burgeoning market. Sources: Amazon.com Inc. Q2 2015 Financial Results ; Jacon Pramuk (July 23, 2015). " Amazon sales rise 20%, easily top most optimistic estimates ." CNBC. Amazon's position in the cloud also gives it a strategic advantage with regard to big data analytics, another emerging technology tha's increasingly seen as a competitive advantage for large enterprises as well as SMEs. Big data - tools that analyze extremely large data sets to reveal patterns, trends and relationships - is already valued at $125 billion annually. AWS tools like Amazon Redshift provide full managed data warehouse services at a fraction of what it would cost for businesses to develop and operate their own big data infrastructure. Amazon is America's top brand, according to the 2013 and 2014 YouGov BrandIndex . In addition to its online retail and cloud services, Amazon announced 10 million new subscribers to its Amazon Prime shipping service during the 2014 holiday season, bringing its total domestic subscribers to 40 million. The power of Amazon's brand fits in perfectly with its underlying strategy of growth and innovation. By investing in Amazon Prime Air - a future delivery system that uses drones to deliver packages to consumers in 30 minutes or less - the company continues to forge new innovations that will continue to tilt the market in its favor. Amazon's stock has gained an astonishing 73.4% in 2015. By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 8.2% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index has barely grown and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is in the negative. With expected growth in excess of 35% annually over the next five years, Amazon will out-grow the industry, sector and S&P 500 averages. Source: Yahoo Finance. Amazon.com Inc. Analyst Estimates . Amid global economic volatility and a strong US dollar, Amazon is innovating to create opportunities in an otherwise stagnant market. For these reasons, Amazon is still an excellent bet for investors who can get over the high P/E ratio and see that profitability (or lack thereof) has never been a principal concern for Amazon's valuation. Thus, there's no reason that Amazon cannot go higher and investors should not necessarily be scared away by high P/E multiples in this instance. Instead, they should embrace that Amazon's future will be just as good as its past if not better and that Amazon is a good long-term play.
