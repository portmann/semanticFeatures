Reduced Rates For iCloud Primarily Impact Box - Box (NYSE:BOX) | Seeking Alpha Apple's new iCloud prices are part of the commoditization trend in the consumer cloud storage services market. The leading competitors have strong ecosystems and leading branded apps. Box has improved its reach within Fortune 500 companies in the last few quarters. The company should strive to lead the business segment and become a follower in the consumer segment to succeed in the long term. In its September 9th event, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) introduced a number of exciting new products that include the new iPhone, iPad and Apple TV devices that took most of the attention in this event. However, I want to focus on another announcement Apple made that day that might receive less attention but has wide implications over some companies - the new iCloud plans . The new iCloud plans could have probably gone unmentioned unless the company introduced a significant drop in its upgrade plan prices. The new prices are highly competitive and mostly on par with competition, as shown in the table below: $15 per user per month (Dropbox for Business) $6.99 per month (includes Office 365 subscription) Apple's iCloud is primarily a personal cloud storage service targeted at common consumers. Let's see what the competitive landscape in the consumer segment is: Basic/free tier: This is the free offering that every service provides new subscribers that is used to attract new users before they need to upgrade. This tier allows consumers to test the service before they commit to any price plan. Consumers with very small storage requirements use this tier as their favorite choice. In this tier, Apple is behind most players when it offers only 5GB free when the others offer 10GB to 15GB for free. However, Apple's offering is higher than Dropbox's free 2GB. In this segment, each service is likely to keep their current customers as users usually prefer a service that best fits their OS and storage requirements. Medium tier: This tier contains the 50GB to 200GB plans that common consumers usually purchase. Apple offers two price points in this tier - $0.99 for 50GB and $2.99 for 200GB - while Google offers only 100GB for $1.99 and Microsoft offers 100GB for $1.99 and 200GB for $3.99. For the 200GB, Apple offers a better price. However, the interesting thing in this segment is Box's offering, which is $11.5 for 100GB. Users that had only Google and Microsoft as a better alternative in this segment can now choose iCloud. Consumers who didn't prefer Google Drive or OneDrive over Box in spite of the significantly lower price could choose iCloud. In my opinion, this will drive consumers in this segment from Box to Apple. Performance/high-end tier: This tier includes the 1TB plans for heavy personal users. In this segment, Microsoft has the best offer, with $6.99, while Google, Apple and Dropbox offer a $9.99 plan. Box has no offering, in this size, for personal storage. Apple is obviously trying to be more competitive at this price point. However, I expect only a small shift from Google or Microsoft and a more significant shift of customers from Dropbox to Apple's iCloud. The new iCloud pricing will probably have very little impact on Google, Microsoft and Amazon as they have particular features that are preferred by certain consumers: OS compatibility, ecosystem, interaction with popular apps, ease of use and pricing. Dropbox and Box are unique players in the cloud storage market as cloud storage is their core business, and, while they have a broad partnership network, they don't have popular, branded productivity apps (like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and Apple Numbers in the spreadsheets app, for example) that are used as default services. Hence, they are highly dependent on their network and their marketing. While Dropbox remains competitive in all consumer segments, Box has a highly attractive offering in one segment and is totally absent in another. I don't think this is happening by mistake - Box understands perfectly that the consumer cloud storage segment is going through accelerated commoditization and it would be very hard for the company to compete with Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon in the consumer market when they have such a strong ecosystem in this segment. In the Q2 earnings release, Box mentioned that 52% of Fortune 500 companies and 28% of Global 2000 companies use Box's solutions. Box presents a gradual increase in these two factors as well as more registered users and larger partnership networks. As I mentioned above, I believe the consumer cloud services market is going through an accelerated process of commoditization where Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon offer very attractive pricing. Box cannot get into pricing wars with these giants in the slowing consumer market. To win in the long term, Box should strive to become a leader in the consumer segment while transforming to a follower in the consumer market. In the enterprise/business segment, Box should become more competitive, increase its network and ecosystem, as it did lately with the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) partnership, and rebuild the company as an enterprise-focused service. At the same time, while consumer prices drop rapidly, Box should remain competitive, so it will not become obsolete, and match its prices to its competitors. In the event that Box becomes a leader in the enterprise segment in a few years' time, it could then invest in the consumer segment once again. For investors interested in benefiting from the expected surge in cloud storage, Box, at its current price, might be an attractive long-term alternative. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
