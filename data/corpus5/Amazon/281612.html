UPS: An Old System About To Be Disrupted - United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital (564 clicks) Jan.  6, 2016  2:13 AM ET  |  About: United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) , Includes: AMZN , FDX by: L&F Capital Management For the third Christmas in a row, FDX or UPS has had trouble handling increased e-commerce shipment volume around the Holiday season. Neither of the delivery giants are prepared to handle ramped up volume from 2015's historic levels. UPS increased its processing capacity by 6% this Holiday season, but another 20% expansion to handle future growth in e-commerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment. It seems UPS is playing "keeping up with the Joneses" here, and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself. The 2015 Holiday Season was an interesting one for the US delivery system. While one shipping giant, The United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ), managed to handle a surge in last-minute e-commerce shipments, the other, FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), was late on a handful of its deliveries . But this is nothing new. This is now the third Christmas in a row where shipping has been a problem for FDX or UPS around the Holiday season. In 2013, UPS's inability to keep up with Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December 25 . In 2014, both UPS and FDX capped Holiday deliveries to avoid a repeat of 2013, causing companies like Amazon to miss out on some profit that comes with last-minute demand surges. Now, in 2015, FDX played the role of 2013 UPS and was late on a handful of Christmas deliveries due to an "unprecedented surge" in e-commerce shipments. This "unprecedented surge" will become the norm very soon and an anomaly on the low-end soon thereafter. The problem is that neither of the delivery giants, UPS and FDX, are prepared to handle ramped up volume from 2015's historic levels. To us, this only strengthens Amazon's motivation to squeeze UPS entirely out of its delivery process . There is no doubt that there exists strong secular growth trends in e-commerce adoption, in large part thanks to Amazon's growing e-commerce presence. As Amazon continues to threaten the retail industry, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), Target (NYSE: TGT ), and Macy's (NYSE: M ) will be forced to put more emphasis on their respective e-commerce channels. Throw in a new wave of popular e-commerce-only retailers like Wayfair (NYSE: W ), and it is inevitable that we will continue to see an increase in e-commerce shipments, particularly around the gift-heavy Holidays. FDX's inability to handle a surge in e-commerce shipments in 2015, at the early stages of a multi-year uptrend in e-commerce shipment volume, likely gives Amazon and other retailers little reason to trust the traditional delivery system. We believe 3 Christmases of botched deliveries in a row between UPS and FDX is significant of an old system in a new marketplace. Many will argue that UPS was on top of its deliveries this year, so there is little to worry about, but we believe this is a near-sighted claim. UPS's efficiency this Holiday season was simply attributable to getting orders in early and making more room. Monday, December 21, was the busiest shipping day of the Holiday season for UPS. This is because UPS worked closely with retailers to get orders before the Christmas weekend, thereby providing a cushion for UPS into Christmas Day. UPS also increased its permanent processing capacity by 6% . But it seems UPS is playing "keeping up with the Joneses" here, and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself. You can't force all shoppers to "shop early" - that somewhat deconstructs the convenience of shopping online. You also can't stop secular growth in e-commerce adoption, which will only magnify these shipment surges. Steve Osburn, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, agrees with us on this point. A 6% increase to facilities might have been doable this year, but more expansion is going to be costly. He has said that UPS expanding its network by 20% to handle future growth in e-commerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment . In his words: "For them to try to keep up with that kind of growth is impossible. So retailers are going to have to figure out a way to get the product to the customer at different times, or through different channels." Jonathan Colehower, chief marketing officer for Atlanta-based logistics software company Manhattan Associates, also believes retailers are beginning to look at the situation a little differently. He thinks that retailers may be interested in "taking back the wheel on this one" and will try to "shape demand versus always having to respond to it". One way for retailers to do this is in-store pickup. A significant amount of retailers aggressively promoted buy-online, pick-up-in-store shopping this Holiday season, but it didn't quite workout for the retailers or the customers. In Kurt Salmon's audit of online orders, only about 40% of in-store pickup orders were actually ready for pickup upon the shopper's arrival to the store. That means 60% of the buy-online, pick-up-in-store orders this Christmas didn't play out as planned . According to Osburn: "For a lot of retailers, this was the first peak season they tried to do it. Performance of buy online-pick up in store was terrible for a lot of retailers." While retailers will likely continue to tweak and attempt to improve the efficiency of their buy-online, pick-up-in-store models, Amazon will continue to flesh out its own delivery system that doesn't mess with the hassles of in-store pick-up or put the ball in the court of UPS and FDX to invest billions to expand infrastructure. We firmly believe Amazon has taken the ball back into its own court when it comes to delivery. No more late deliveries at the hands of third-party shipment companies, no more $20 gift cards doled out to several customers because of an external error, no more capping of last-minute order surges, and no more impediments to the growth of the Amazon e-commerce machine. Amazon wants to grow its e-commerce channel as fast as it can. As they currently stand, UPS and FDX are impediments to that growth. We believe investor optimism surrounding UPS being on-time this Holiday season is misplaced. Some deliveries in the US were still late, and that is all that matters. FDX being late on shipments this year coupled with in-store pick-up failures only further compel Amazon to create its own delivery system. It is only a matter of time before UPS loses all of its Amazon business. We do not think the current valuation is braced to handle this loss, especially as Amazon grows its e-commerce market share.
