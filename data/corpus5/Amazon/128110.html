Subscription Based Services Lead Amazon's Explosive Second Quarter - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN up 20% after earnings thanks to strong EPS, sales growth lead by improvements in AWS revenue. Combined, AWS and "supplemental" income, likely including Prime, become 8% of AMZN revenue, up from 6% in Q2 2014. Prime ecosystem expanding internationally, retail likely becoming the gateway to recurring revenue even as it continues to be AMZN's bread and butter. It's still early in the earnings season, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) blew investors away with an earnings report that sent the stock up 20% in post-earnings trading, largely due to EPS that trounced estimates as well as improving revenue projections. Yet arguably the most important aspect of the earnings report for the last quarter might not have to do with the number of products Amazon was able to move, but rather its recurring service business such as Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime, which not only had some of the biggest gains year-over-year, but has grown its share of the overall revenue, signaling how important this branch has become, and will become as the quarters, and years, go on. One aspect that many analysts are excited for is Amazon Web Services, a cloud data storage system for businesses that generates its revenue through subscriptions. According to the company's filings, AWS has become 6% of TTM sales, and is now significant enough to be separated in the earnings report. For Q2, net sales increased 81% YOY to $1.8 billion, with operating income at $464 million , up from the $15 million operating loss in 2014. This is a significant area of growth for Amazon because unlike its inventory and third-party sales in goods, this is revenue that can be continually generated and is significantly more predictable. Cloud data services are growing in importance as companies look to outsource its data analytics at an often cheaper rate than building the infrastructure in-house, and Amazon is positioning itself to be a go-to destination for off-site data storage. As this segment grows, expect AWS to make up a larger share of Amazon's sales and become a more pivotal part of the company's operations. In the shopping and streaming ring of Amazon's products, Amazon Prime has increased in importance to the company's top line. According to the transcript re-published on Seeking Alpha , Amazon executives noted how Prime is growing internationally at a faster rate than in the US, with one-day shipping arriving in London and Italy coming up soon. While hard Prime figures are still hard to come by, and has not been separated out like AWS has, executives emphasized that digital services for Prime such as movie streams and access to original content have helped drive retention rates and free-trial conversions, which is helping to keep the "Prime Flywheel" turning. While the actual numbers of new subscribers weren't released, looking at the company's supplemental income hints at a significant increase in subscriptions as well as other service improvements. Supplemental income increased by 16% YOY in North America, offsetting a 7% decrease worldwide to show a $22 million improvement for the quarter. News that Prime Now added three more cities to its network and its first international location also confirms that Amazon is committed to growing the ecosystem to include even more than just shipping and streaming, and with over $4.3 billion in free cash flow, Amazon has the resources to make good. Supplemental income, assuming this includes services like Prime, as well as Amazon Web Services, have increased their share of Amazon's revenues as Amazon continues to aggressively invest in subscription-based services and providing value for money. In Q2 of 2014, these two services combined for only 6.3% of Amazon's revenues, at $1.2 billion out of $19.3 billion in revenue. Last quarter, this share improved to 8.8% of revenues at roughly $2.04 billion out of $23.2 billion in revenue. As this rate of growth improves, retail will become secondary, or as in the case of Prime Day, a vehicle to hook new customers into Amazon's ecosystem. Hence, the main takeaway from this quarter should be that Amazon's future growth is dependent on increases in subscriptions for business and personal services rather than retail figures, even as retail continues to be Amazon's bread-and-butter. Expect Prime subscription data to be separated in earnings reports very soon; simply because it will become too significant to hide in the "supplemental" category.
