Also covered: Microsoft's latest smartphone job cuts and reported plans for new Xbox One consoles, Facebook's shuttering of an ad exchange, and a new Google self-driving car R&D center. A Salesforce/Amazon deal, Twitter's reported e-commerce pullback, and HP Inc., NetApp, and Pure Storage's earnings also get attention. Alibaba drops on SEC accounting probe disclosure , takes Yahoo lower with it - Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) disclosed in its FY16 annual report the SEC is probing the company's consolidation practices and related-party transactions, as well as the data it reports for Singles Day (effectively, China's version of Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Barron's questioned some of Alibaba's numbers last September; the company aggressively defended itself in response. Shares closed down 6.8% on Wednesday, leading Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) to drop 5.2%. Reuters: Apple exploring charging stations for electric cars - Citing sources and LinkedIn profiles, Reuters states Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is "talking to charging station companies and hiring engineers with expertise in the area." Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has a big head-start in this space: the company has a network of 628 supercharger stations (free for use by Tesla EV owners) that can recharge a car in 30 minutes, and recently said it wants to double the network's size by the end of 2017. The WSJ reported last year Apple wants to bring an EV to market by 2019. Bloomberg: AT&T submitted a first-round bid for Yahoo - Ma Bell apparently joined Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and P/E firms in bidding for Yahoo. Bloomberg adds Verizon "didn't submit one of the highest first-round bids" (they might be lowballing for now), and reiterates (though a recent WSJ report spoke of $2B-3B bids) Yahoo received bids in the $4B-8B range. As with Verizon, it looks as if AT&T (NYSE: T ) wants to lower its dependence on a U.S. telecom market showing little to no service revenue growth, thanks to landline disconnections and mobile price pressure, by expanding its online media presence and then promoting the newly acquired content to its subscribers. One big difference: Verizon (via AOL) already has a big online media operation it can merge with Yahoo and use to obtain cost synergies and achieve greater scale. That arguably makes Yahoo more valuable to Verizon than AT&T. Microsoft is cutting 1,850 smartphone division jobs, taking a $950M restructuring charge - The move follows a $350M deal to sell Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) feature phone ops to Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) and newly created Finnish firm HMD Global (will be selling phones under the Nokia brand). It also follows massive 2015 job cuts that hit the phone division hard, recent comments from Windows chief Terry Myerson suggesting Windows Phone won't be a 2016 priority, and a report the company's Surface Phones won't arrive until 2017. "[We're] scaling back, but we're not out!," insists Myerson. That might technically be true, but everything Microsoft has said and done in recent months seems to scream, "We realize iOS and Android won, and won't allow our phone business to be a cash sinkhole any longer. Our mobile priorities lie elsewhere." In semi-related news, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) is discontinuing its Windows Phone, BlackBerry 10 (NASDAQ: BBRY ), and Amazon Fire OS (NASDAQ: AMZN ) apps as of June 30. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and WhatsApp announced they're ending BlackBerry 10 support earlier this year. Reports: Microsoft prepping smaller/cheaper Xbox One, VR and 4K-capable Xbox One, and Chromecast-like streaming stick - The smaller/cheaper Xbox and the streaming stick are said to be due this year, and the VR and 4K-capable Xbox next year. Notably, Microsoft reportedly wants the 2017 console to directly work with Facebook's Oculus Rift - currently, Rift headsets connected to high-end Windows 10 PCs can stream Xbox One games. The reported consoles feel like a response to Sony (NYSE: SNE ) - the PlayStation 4 has been outselling the Xbox One, and Sony is expected to release both a 4K-capable PS4 and its PlayStation VR headset later this year. Microsoft and Sony's revamped consoles are a positive for processor supplier AMD Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), given that the devices require more horsepower. They could be a mild negative for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which has done booming business selling high-end GPUs that enable 4K PC gaming. Facebook shuttering FBX ad exchange; Criteo slumps in response - FBX has allowed advertisers (via ad tech partners such as Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO )) to deliver Facebook ads based on what users browsed on other sites. But it only functioned on PCs (responsible for just 18% of Q1 ad revenue), and apparently never reached Facebook's once-lofty expectations. Moreover, FBX relied on cookies rather than the user data delivered via Facebook's ad API - it lets Facebook cut out middlemen and maintain control over targeting data, and supports many of the company's most successful ad products. The shuttering of FBX continues Facebook's attempts to focus on higher-value ad services that allow to it often directly interface with advertisers and agencies. It could be a slight positive for Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) AdSense and DoubleClick Ad Exchange platforms. Google is opening a self-driving car R&D center near Detroit - "Many of our current partners are based here, so having a local facility will help us collaborate more easily and access Michigan's top talent in vehicle development and engineering," says Google. The announcement follows a non-exclusive deal with Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) to develop 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. HP Inc. posts mixed results and guidance ; PC and printing revenue each down double digits - In one of Wednesday's less shocking developments, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ) revealed it's still not much fun being a PC or printer OEM. Markets signaled their lack of shock by having HP finish after-hours trading up slightly. Personal Systems revenue fell 10% Y/Y in FQ2 (business PC revenue fell 7%, and consumer revenue 16%), and Printing revenue 16% (printer units and supplies revenue each fell 16%). IDC previously estimated global PC shipments fell 11.5% Y/Y in Q1, with HP's share rising slightly to 19.2%. Meanwhile, online and mobile document/photo sharing has been doing a number on printer demand for years, and the trend doesn't show any signs of letting up. A 19% drop in SG&A spend (job cuts at work) let HP beat EPS estimates in spite of a sales miss and allowed the company's PC division operating profit to actually rise 7%. But the printing division, still by far HP's biggest profit creator, saw operating profit drop 18%. Salesforce chooses Amazon as its preferred cloud infrastructure provider - Fortune reports the deal is worth $400M to Amazon Web Services over the next four years. It arrives a week after Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) announced it had inked a deal with Amazon through which Salesforce's cloud apps will serve as Amazon's "company-wide" CRM software provider. That deal (a quid pro quo?) is believed by many to be worth nine figures. Salesforce's core offerings, including its Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Analytics Cloud apps, will be hosted by AWS in international locales. The company's popular Heroku cloud app development platform is already hosted by AWS, as are a few other offerings. The tie-up is a negative for Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), whose hardware and software Salesforce agreed to use as part of a 2013 deal between the companies. AWS, still the 800-lb. gorilla of cloud infrastructure, saw revenue rise 64% Y/Y in Q1 to $2.57B. NetApp sells off after FQ4 miss , weak FQ1 EPS guidance - Shares finished after-hours trading down 7.4% - the 10-year chart isn't pretty either. NetApp's (NASDAQ: NTAP ) product (storage hardware/software) revenue fell 17% Y/Y a quarter after dropping 19%, thanks to both weak enterprise storage demand (hurt by cloud adoption) and share loss. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ), which on Tuesday reported its storage revenue rose 2% in FQ2, appears to be among those taking share from NetApp. For now, the company's $870M acquisition of flash storage array vendor Solidfire isn't providing a major boost. Pure Storage tumbles after slight FQ1 beat , in-line FQ2 guidance , lack of FY17 guidance - Unlike in March, Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG ) didn't provide an FY17 (ends January '17) sales outlook, and that might have markets spooked - particularly given fresh competitive challenges from IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), NetApp, Nimble Storage (NYSE: NMBL ), and especially EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC ). Also, while sales of Pure's flash storage arrays are still growing rapidly, product revenue growth fell to 75% Y/Y in FQ1 from FQ4's 120%, and net loss was still up slightly Y/Y due to heavy spending. On the earnings call , Pure insisted its win rates against EMC are unchanged, and reiterated a goal of achieving "sustained positive free cash flow" in 2H17. Report: Twitter disbands commerce product team, ceases Buy button development work - Though Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has made a series of e-commerce-related acquisitions and ad product launches in recent years, sources tell BuzzFeed the company has now "curtailed product development on its 'Buy' button and product pages, and shifted its commerce team into other divisions within the company." One source suggests a dearth of social media-related commerce activity is to blame. Perhaps more ominously, another says "the innovative, experimental could, should, might happen in a year or two years stuff is completely shut down at Twitter." The significant brain drain the company has seen over the last 12-18 months could be playing a role here. As might the pressure faced by Jack Dorsey & co. to focus on features/services that can boost user growth and ad sales in the short term. Facebook, meanwhile, has launched Buy buttons and mobile storefronts for merchants, and has done brisk business selling them Dynamic Product Ads . AT&T plans to start a "multi-gigabit, fixed" 5G trial by year's end - AT&T's comments follow ones from Verizon stating the company plans a 2017 5G trial. Like many others working on 5G, both carriers will initially focus on testing fixed broadband services, which are easier to deploy than mobile services on many of the high-frequency bands targeted for 5G use and (when deployed by upstarts) could act as a threat to incumbent ISPs. AT&T expects a "Phase 1" 5G spec to be finished in 2018 and commercial deployment to start a year later. A "Phase 2" spec supporting lower-frequency bands similar to the ones used for 3G/4G services is expected to be finished in 2019.
