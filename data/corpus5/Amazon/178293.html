Amazon: You Should Own This Name; It's Worth $610 - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (406 clicks) At $50, the Fire tablet is priced in what we believe is a impulse buy range. Fire tablet users will be swamped with Prime offers, and we believe this will inevitably have a positive flow-through effect of Prime subs growth. We believe creating a kids' tablet version and appealing to the family-oriented consumers will yield strong benefits for Amazon. Amazon consistently reports operating cash flow dramatically north of reported net earnings, and free cash flow is set to explode when capital expenditures reduce to normalized levels. We believe shares are worth $610, so at $540 per share, we believe AMZN is actually a buy despite inflated multiples. Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) are now trading at $540 per share. At this level, it is very easy to knock Amazon's rich valuation. Look no further than the stock's 113x forward P/E multiple to realize that immense growth expectations are baked into the stock's current stock price. But the company's current investments to support technological infrastructure and build-out its already expansive ecosystem skew the current valuation. While shares of Amazon certainly look expensive, we believe investors buying at these levels are actually buying a great growth company trading at a discount to its fair value. After considering its immense cash flow growth potential of Amazon in future years, we believe shares are currently worth around $610 per share. We have written before on Amazon, commenting on why Amazon Prime had an advantage in Japan over Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and why Amazon Prime is a true juggernaut of a business. In our opinion, Amazon Prime will be the fuel for sustained revenue growth for the company. Amazon is currently taking what we expect to be successful steps to grow its Prime user base, including the recent launch of its Fire tablet. At $50, the Fire tablet is priced in what we believe is an impulse buy range - at a level so low relative to other tablet prices, namely the iPad, that consumers will be coerced to buy the device on price attractiveness alone and discover its specs later. While the $50 price-point surely offers slim, if any, margins for the company, Amazon is banking on greater Fire tablet presence to promote Amazon subs growth, where margins are much more attractive. This strategy is not new for Amazon. Amazon did much the same thing for its Kindle e-reader, selling the Kindle for a bargain, low-margin price to promote the e-book sales. The strategy worked for Amazon, and resulted in millions of e-book sales . We believe the $50 Fire tablet will yield similar results. Fire tablet users will be swamped with Prime offers, and we believe this will inevitably have a positive flow-through effect of Prime subs growth. More Prime subs has a huge effect on Amazon. Prime subs spend on average more than 2x the non-Prime Amazon customer on Amazon.com. This finding that Prime subs spend far more than non-Prime subs is consistent with RBC Capital Markets' research. They believe Amazon Prime has 50 million subs in the US, and 60 to 80 million globally, and affirm that Prime growth will continue to fuel strong revenue growth. Moreover, the Fire Kids Edition seems perfectly created for kids , as it already comes in encased in a rubber exterior to prevent damage and already has "adult" content blocked on the device, two precautionary steps that parents would otherwise have to take in addition to paying for the tablet. We believe creating this kids' version and appealing to the family-oriented consumers will yield strong benefits for Amazon, as we believe it will also increase Fire tablet unit sales among parents and other non-kid family members. Amazon continues to invest heavily in technological infrastructure such as building out its AWS platform, and we believe this will inevitably have a hugely beneficial impact on the top and bottom-line. Overall, we are very comfortable with the analysts' consensus revenue growth estimates for nearly 20% this year and next year, and believe continued adoption of Amazon Prime globally coupled with AWS growth (which is accelerating ) will drive net revenue growth north of 15% per year into 2020. As the company realizes the benefits of massive spending efforts, we believe margins should expand into 2020. RBC recognizes that Amazon should taper off a roughly five-year investment cycle of new US distribution, so this should help profit margins over the next 5-year period. Moreover, we believe higher Prime subs will drive higher profit margins due to Amazon's ability to leverage scale. AWS should also reach higher profit margins over time. One of the major benefits of Amazon is its cash flow. The company consistently reports operating cash flow dramatically north of reported net earnings, and in 2014, the company actually reported that operating cash flow was in excess of $7 billion more than net income. As a result, operating cash flow has grown every year since 2010, including a $1.37 billion jump last year. As revenue and margins grow, Amazon should continue to benefit from its healthy cash flow reconciliations, and so operating cash flow should see extremely healthy growth in the foreseeable future. Free cash flow should see even healthier growth, as the company has ramped up capital expenditures to right around $5 billion per year to build out its ecosystem with Amazon Prime and AWS. As soon as Amazon pulls back these capital expenditures to a more normalized $1-3 billion annual run-rate, free cash flow is set to explode, benefiting dually from increased operating cash flow and decreased capex. We qualitatively feel that the company will maintain high capital expenditure levels through 2016, but believe the ecosystems will be built up enough by 2017 (and after roughly $15 billion in capex over 3 years) to where the company will not need to spend as much to support future growth. Overall, we see the company netting free cash flow north of $23 billion by 2020, up from $2 billion in 2014. Using an 8% discount rate and a 2.50% free cash flow perpetuity rate (higher than we normal use to account for Amazon's growth potential even beyond 2020), we believe the net present value of all of Amazon's future free cash flows is $303.8 billion. Using MRQ share count of 476 million, this equates to roughly $638 per share. Amazon's net current asset value, using MRQ current assets and total liabilities figures, is roughly -$14.3 billion. On a 476 million diluted share count, this is roughly -$30 per share in NCAV. Summing NCAV and the NPV of future FCF, we arrive at a fair value of $289.52 billion. Again using MRQ fully diluted share count of 476 million, this equates to a fair value just south of $610 per share. Amazon isn't cheap by traditional metrics, but if you consider the long-term growth prospects of the company to grow revenues at a consistent double-digit clip, drastically expand margins, and ramp up free cash flow, the stock is actually trading at a discount to its fair value. The company is taking strategic steps to grow its Prime sub base, and the juggernaut that Prime currently is and will continue to be both domestically and internationally should fuel strong revenue growth. We believe shares are worth $610, so at $540 per share, we believe AMZN is actually a buy despite the multiples. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN.
