Amazon Prime Day Is Not Alibaba's Singles Day - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon Prime Day is a basic merchandising clearance sale. Look at the top line, not the bottom line. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) announced it will hold a "Prime Day" on July 15 , with big sales on electronics, ostensibly to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Some analysts, with Amazon's encouragement, are already comparing this to Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) "Singles Day" event, or the "Black Friday" that occurs the day after Thanksgiving. But nothing could be further from the truth. It's a clearance sale, nothing more. But nothing less. Amazon needs to clear its warehouse of remainders and overstocks so it will have room for its next two big events, its next electronics launch and the Back to School shopping season. It just so happens that mid-July is the site's anniversary. The news tells us several things about Amazon, some bad and some good. Start with the bad. Amazon is overstocked. Amazon has to dump some merchandise, just like an ordinary bricks-and-mortar store. Making it a "celebration" is a great distraction from these problems. Now in with the good. This sale is aimed at its best customers, those who are already paying it $99/year to belong to Prime. Rewarding your best customers, rather than new customers, is simply good merchandising. The fact that this general law has dawned on Amazon management is a good thing. Over the next 10 days, Amazon is going to also bang the drum on this event in hope of selling more Prime memberships. The fact is that membership has become as important to Amazon's bottom line as it is to Costco's (NASDAQ: COST ). Amazon has always been cagey over just how many Prime members there are - the most recent analyst estimate is 40 million . At $99 per member, we're talking over $4 billion per year on Amazon's top line, just from membership fees, and billions more from the extra purchases Prime members make - conversion rates on Prime shopping baskets are ginormous. The sale, coming about a week before the company's next earnings report, also indicates the company may be working harder to court investors. The second and third quarters of the year are usually a retailer's worst, and analysts are expecting a loss of 15 cents this quarter, and another loss next quarter. Amazon uses stock in its executive compensation and buybacks to keep the share count level. The number to watch is the top line, expected to be $22.35 billion which would be 15% ahead of what it did a year ago. That would seem to be an easy number to clear given the strength of Amazon Web Services, but Amazon needs to please analysts given the 41% gain investors have become since the start of the year. Most of that was booked right after the full 2014 numbers came out in January. The stock moved sideways after the January report, then scored another huge jump after the first quarter numbers came out, and it has moved sideways since. Amazon has done a number of small things over the last quarter aimed at boosting its bottom line at minimal cost, like selling ads on boxes. Bears will say it smacks of desperation, bulls will say it's just smart. For now I go with the bulls. Source: Amazon Prime Day Is Not Alibaba's Singles Day Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, COST.
