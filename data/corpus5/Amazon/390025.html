Google To Face Stiff Competition On Video Revenues From The Other 3 FANGs - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google's YouTube could see ad revenue erosion from Facebook's fast-moving initiatives on video. YouTube Red is pitting itself against Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but can it sustain the planned addition rate for new, original programming? Google's video revenues are now tied closely with market share action. How much will they lose to Facebook versus how much can be gained from Netflix and Amazon? If you want to summarize what Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as a business is, you just need to explain four things: Google Advertising, Search, YouTube and Android. If advertising is the dam that collects water for Google, then their catchments are Search, YouTube and Android. Outside of these catchment areas, Google's attempts at creating new ones - so far - has been a huge let-down, like their Motorola dream or Google Plus. But so far, Search, YouTube and Android have served the company well and, in fact, have positioned the company to take advantage of the global shift toward mobile video consumption. But where there is money involved, it's obviously going to bring competition - and YouTube is starting to face significant threats to its long-term future. Don't get me wrong - I don't think YouTube is going to go away any time soon. However, the way the market is shaping up, there are two distinct threats to YouTube - one in the form of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and the other in the guise of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video. In my recent article, " Facebook's Future is Video ," I talk about why Facebook is pushing hard on the video front and the tremendous growth that the industry has seen in recent years. In the current scenario, Facebook is still a rookie in the ever growing mobile video world - when you consider the size, scale, reach and timeline of YouTube. The real lure of mobile video, for Facebook, is the advertising revenue. Sitting, as they are, on a user base numbering billions, they have every reason to get into this business. With WhatsApp still unmonetized and Instagram already piggybacking on FB's ad platform , this is something they sorely need to cement their future. The loser in this game is going to be YouTube - although it will take time before Facebook Live and other initiatives can catch up to the pioneer of user-generated video content. However, once Facebook fully integrates advertising into its entire suite of video offerings, their strong network of advertisers will be in full battle gear against Google's YouTube ad business - a fight to be watched, for sure. YouTube is the precursor of current-day video streaming services, but one thing Google failed to do was to see the early potential of YouTube as a significant source of income. Today, that has changed, and Google earns more than $14 billion through search and YouTube advertising. The company doesn't break out revenues for YouTube, but one source estimates YouTube gross revenues at around $8.5 billion for 2015 - expected to grow more than 50% to $12.8 billion in 2016. The source that estimates neglects to factor in is the entry of Facebook into this business, so Google not only stands to lose future revenues but current video advertising gains as well. Google is depending heavily on the growth of YouTube for forward revenue growth, and Facebook's efforts may well put a damper on their plans sooner rather than later. The moment Google launched YouTube Red, it was clear that the competition now was not limited to Facebook - or even sites like Vimeo, for that matter. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video now came into the picture with their premium video streaming services. That's the competition that Red is up against in this space. YouTube doesn't have the kind of content that Netflix can offer. They may be able to stave off Amazon for now, but Netflix is a very real opponent for Red's popularity. Google is working under the assumption that just because YouTube has a huge following, Red will, too. That's not going to be the case until they can start matching content with Netflix. Of course, Google's money muscle can make that happen, but it will be several quarters before Red can boast a strong and growing following for premium content. YouTube Red plans to have about 15 to 20 original programs this year, and they've already got about six now, according to CEO Sundar Pichai's comments during the company's last quarterly earnings call. That growth rate for original programming nearly matches what Netflix will introduce this year, but let's not forget this: not only does Netflix have a huge lead in terms of subscribers, but also dozens of original programming feeding those millions and an enviable international presence in 200 countries. It's going to take awhile for Google to get to where Netflix is, and my only hope is that they do it in a sustainable way. Once again, Google is late to a key segment. The same thing happened in the cloud industry: Google was already a provider of cloud-based services for several years, but only with the success of AWS, Microsoft and IBM did they actually wake up to the revenue reality of cloud Infrastructure as a Service in a big way. I covered this recently in an article called Alphabet's Google Weak on Cloud Numbers . Amazon Prime Video is another threat to watch out for in the segment that YouTube Red operates in. APV's success is tied in with Amazon Prime memberships, and that number is growing fast - most recent estimates put it at around the 54 million mark and counting. Though Prime members aren't there mainly for the video streaming service, Google will still have to factor that in when they count the competition. YouTube certainly has the first-mover advantage over the user-generated video streaming market, but the competition is getting thicker by the year. Not only has Facebook entered this market, but IBM also announced a service for media companies to distribute their HD video content seamlessly using IBM's technology backbone. This will create even more traffic from multiple sources. For now, YouTube has the luxury of being the dominant player in streaming video monetization through advertising. I don't see this status quo being maintained for more than the next two years. In that time, Google must grow YouTube Red's revenues quickly while making sure that they maintain the growth on video advertising revenues. They're already seeing success with initiatives like Google Preferred , so all they need to do is keep pushing from multiple directions - and each of these must align either to video ad revenues or their subscriber base on YouTube Red. Video and cloud are two areas that Google has been very slow at and they cannot afford to sit on their online advertising laurels any more. Just like they brought in Diane Greene to head their cloud division, they need someone with strong media experience to run YouTube Red. I don't see this as a major problem considering how critical this component is to their overall business. The kind of manpower, money and muscle they're putting behind their cloud business is exactly what I'd like to see here in their video business. Please follow me as I track the performance of FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) in the video space in the months ahead. It will be fun to watch!
