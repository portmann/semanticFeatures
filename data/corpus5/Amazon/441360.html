Amazon Video Looks Strong - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN grew downstream Internet traffic share by 1.2% in 1H16, while NFLX's share decreased by 1.9%. NFLX's decrease can be attributed to a re-encoding of the video library to deliver superior quality on less bandwidth use. We argue that an analysis of trailing 5-year data best lends itself to the conclusion that both platforms are growing concurrently. Sandvine recently released their North American Internet usage numbers for the first half of 2016 . They look quite favorable for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Video, which grew Internet downstream traffic share from 3.1% in 2H15 to 4.3% in 1H16. Those numbers look especially favorable against Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) numbers, which illustrated a decline in Internet downstream traffic share from 37.1% in 2H15 to 35.2% in 1H16. The quick read is that while NFLX still dominates the streaming market, Amazon Video is quickly gaining traction at the expense of NFLX expansion. We argue that a deeper read contradicts this point, and that both platforms are actually growing concurrently behind a secular shift away from linear TV. Looking at Sandvine numbers back to 2011, we can see that there is a positive trendline for AMZN, NFLX, and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) owned YouTube. Since 1H11, NFLX has grow share 5.5% while YT has grown share 6.5%. AMZN, which has no data for 1H11 since it was not a top 10 service, has presumably grown share roughly 4% (now stands at 4.3%). In a trailing 5 year window, then, YT and NFLX growth have outpaced AMZN growth. That story changes in the trailing 2 year and trailing 3 year windows. Over the past 3 years, both NFLX and AMZN have grown market share by ~3%. It is when looking at the past 2 years that we see AMZN growth beginning to outpace NFLX growth. AMZN share grew 2.4% over the past 2 years, while NFLX growth has inched up a mere 0.9%. We argue, though, that this is more indicative of AMZN ramping growth rather than NFLX having stalled growth. According to Sandvine, NFLX's lost market share in the most recent report should not be read as "peak Netflix" and is actually attributable to the company re-encoding their entire video library to deliver superior quality on less bandwidth use. According to Sandvine: Frequent readers of this report should however not interpret this decline as a signal of "peak Netflix". Earlier in the year, Netflix began implementing "PerTitle Encode Optimization"2 which saw Netflix re-encode their entire library with a focus on being more efficient in order to deliver what they claim is a "same or better experience while using less bandwidth". Sandvine believes Netflix's bandwidth share decline is tied to the new encoding techniques, and that this implementation is a tremendous win for subscribers and operators since Netflix video will now use fewer network resources, resulting in an overall better experience. It should be noted that at the time of collection, it was unclear if Netflix had re-encoded their entire library, so an update in the second half of this year may better reveal the impact Encode Optimization may have had on networks in the region. History shows that Sandvine is usually accurate about their rationales for NFLX share declines and projections for future increases. In 2H13, NFLX saw downstream traffic share slip from 33% in the prior year to 31.6%. Sandvine explained, though, that the data was collected before NFLX made SuperHD content available to all subscribers. Sandvine further forecasted that NFLX share would return to or even surpass previous highs. From that 2H13 report: Netflix continues to be the unchallenged leader for traffic, accounting for 31.6% of downstream traffic during peak period. While we observed that their share of traffic decreased slightly since our 1H 2013 study, it should not be interpreted as a decline in the dominance of the service at the expense of their competitors. In fact, the bulk of data collection for this report occurred before Netflix made SuperHD content available to all subscribers, regardless of the service provider. Based on initial findings from customers, we expect Netflix share to return to or even surpass its previous heights. As it turns out, availability of higher bitrate Super HD content to all subscribers caused share to jump 2.6% to 34.2% in 1H14. The 34.2% downstream traffic share represented a 1.2% increase from NFLX's previous high share of 33% in 1H12. Given the accuracy of this rationale and forecast, we are confident in Sandvine's current rationale for NFLX's decline as it relates to a re-encoding of the video library. Interestingly enough, Sandvine indicates that Amazon Video is up to a similar re-encoding, making it all the more impressive that the platform saw its downstream traffic share increase 1.2% from 2H15. We argue that an analysis of the trailing 5-year Sandvine data best supports the conclusion that AMZN and NFLX are growing concurrently while both benefiting from a secular increase in adoption of OTT streaming services. According to Sandvine, Real-time Entertainment has gone from accounting for only 30% of peak period aggregate Internet traffic in 2009 to now accounting for almost 70% of aggregate traffic and over 71% of downstream traffic. NFLX, AMZN, and YT combined to account for 41% of downstream traffic in 2011. Today, they account for 57% of downstream traffic. In short, not only are people spending a greater portion of their online time watching and listening to content, but the market for online streaming has remain consolidated on a few quality platforms. AMZN and NFLX are benefiting from cord-cutting On the first point, it is nothing new to point out that Americans are cutting the cord. Some data shows that 1 in 7 Americans are cord-cutters, with this trend being accentuated for young adults ( 19% are cord cutters ). This article provides strong data to support the thesis that the cord cutting trend is just beginning, while this survey and this study illustrate Millennials prefer watching Internet TV over watching Linear TV. A continued transition away from Linear TV and towards Internet TV will grow both Interenet and OTT streaming service usage. On the second point, both AMZN and NFLX have poured a significant amount of money into building out their streaming platforms and developing a moat to protect from competition. This includes spending heavy of acquiring content and spending even heavier on developing original content. These efforts are clearly paying off, as both platforms have grown their share of downstream Internet traffic consistently since 2011. We think the market, especially internationally where we see NFLX as having a 140 million sub opportunity by 2025 , is big enough to allow both NFLX and AMZN to grow their streaming platforms concurrently. Even in a rather saturated US market, both are still growing downstream traffic share. We are bullish on both platform's long-term growth.
