Apple: Major Surprise Coming At WWDC? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iOS refresh to focus on Siri and Apple Pay. In a couple of weeks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference ("WWDC") from June 13th to June 17th. While everyone is expecting the usual operating system upgrades, investors are looking for ways to get struggling product sales going again. While this year's conference looks to be dominated by Apple's growing services business, perhaps a surprise or two could get everyone excited. There has been a lot of talk in recent weeks about Apple opening up Siri and potentially preparing an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Echo rival. While it would be nice for additional Siri capabilities, consumers will be looking at the newest operating system for its battery life and storage size. Longer battery life would be a key reason for consumers to upgrade to the iPhone 7. I also believe the company should look at scaling back compatability as a way to drive upgrades. The size of the operating system is key because if it takes up too much storage space, consumers won't like the 16GB entry level iPhone. Apple may end up splitting the iPhone , giving consumers more storage space options, and potentially helping average selling prices. It seems likely that at least one new iPhone model to be launched later this year will start with a base of 32GB of storage. With a major focus on the growing service business, Apple could show off some improvements to Apple Pay. If the company does allow iOS users to send money between devices with a tap or through iMessage, the Apple Pay service could end up becoming a true replacement for PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ). This comes at a time where one prominent Apple analyst recently stated that only one out of five new iPhone owners is using Apple Pay. This year's biggest overhaul at WWDC is expected to come for the company's music service, which is rumored to get a simpler design and cleaner backgrounds. At its most recent earnings report, the company stated it was over 13 million subscribers for the service, meaning that Apple Music brings in over $1 billion in annual revenues. While that number is about half of what Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) does currently on a yearly basis, it is small in the Apple universe. Apple could look to grow this number by announcing an expansion of the service to more countries at WWDC. A third version of the Watch's operating system is expected at WWDC, but what about a second version of the actual product? That could be a surprise at this year's event, if Apple announces a launch date that's in the near future. In the chart below, Apple has seen a decreasing market share percentage in the wearables category since the first model was launched more than a year ago. (Source: IDC reports - Q2 2015 , Q3 2015 , Q4 2015 , Q1 2016 ) Apple may wait to launch the next watch until the fall, gearing it up for the important holiday shopping season. But if the company wants to get sales going, a launch in the next month or two would do the trick. This would also help stop some of the sales momentum seen by Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) with its smartwatch offerings. A new Apple Watch would also help Apple's revenue number as we now have year ago comparisons that are tough as slowing sales compete against the first few launch months. One recent Forbes article detailed how the latest software update for the Apple TV box didn't do much other than fix some behind the scenes issues. The author of the article wondered if this meant Apple has something big planned for Apple TV at WWDC next month. Perhaps a new version of the product comes, one that has the ability to handle 4K video. The biggest surprise, however, would be if Apple finally launched its streaming service that has been in the works for quite some time. Apple's content plans have been talked about immensely, especially with recent news about a potential bid for Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) or even Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). While many don't expect any news on this front, a streaming service reveal would be the big surprise that investors are looking for, and it certainly would help stem current revenue declines. Apple's annual developer conference is important because it lays the groundwork for the company's next set of products. With iPhone sales struggling, the newest iOS will need to provide added features aimed at driving consumer upgrades. Apple will look to grow its strong services business through improvements to Apple Pay and Music, and hopefully some expanded availability. While the company will likely launch its newest Watch operating system, a new version of the Watch is needed to stem market share losses. Perhaps the biggest surprise could be in regards to Apple TV, not only a new edition of the device, but a streaming service to go along with it. WWDC will give Apple a chance to get consumers excited about its products again, hopefully leading to a sales rebound in fiscal 2017.
