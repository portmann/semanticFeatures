Disney: Look Here For Growth - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Late last year, Disney launched a direct-to-consumer subscription-based streaming service and app - DisneyLife. DisneyLife is special because of its niche market and rich globally recognized content. Besides being different, DisneyLife is a cost-efficient and optimal margin expansion strategy for Disney to maximize revenues from its content and its IP portfolio. After ESPN's subscriber numbers started to decline, there have been a series of bearish sentiments aiming at Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) lack of diversification. These bearish sentiments were answered, in part, by Disney's effort to launch a direct-to-consumer subscription-based streaming service and app in the United Kingdom - DisneyLife. DisneyLife can be accessed through a dedicated app on tablets, smartphones and TV streaming boxes like the new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV. The Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX )-like service lets families of up to six stream Disney movies, TV shows, music, audiobooks and e-books online. DisneyLife gives subscribers access to classic Disney-animated movies and the entire collection of Pixar-animated films. According to Corey Robertson from The Disney Blog, Disney has plans to expand DisneyLife to other markets such as France, Spain, Italy and Germany starting this fiscal year. But based on a recent comment by the CEO at the Deutsche Bank 2016 Media, Internet and Telecom Conference on March 8 , DisneyLife has not yet fully taken off. We believe DisneyLife will be a margin growth story that will enable Disney to diversify its revenue stream from selling content to Netflix and from its gains in its 33% stake in Hulu to selling content directly to consumers. Many companies have started selling content directly to consumers to compete with online rivals who are disrupting traditional television business models and transforming the way that people watch TV. A few companies, who have original content, already package their content and sell it directly to consumers. Aside from well-known media companies such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), niche players have entered the market with original content. These niche players include the World Wrestling Entertainment's (NYSE: WWE ) WWE Network, HBO's (NYSE: TWX ) standalone Internet streaming service and Major League Baseball's MLB.TV etc. We believe the decline in ESPN viewership and the need to diversify revenues was one of the major catalysts for Disney's decision to launch DisneyLife. "Let me first of all -- I think putting it in perspective a little bit, what we're seeing in the marketplace today is not that different than what we anticipated.... ESPN is always priced robustly -- our pricing would moderate, meaning we'd be able to take increases, but not at the rate that we were getting them before. And with that in mind it's actually one of the reasons why we thought about diversifying the company more...So what we thought we would do is strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace and we did that by licensing great sports for long-term periods of time, investing in our content, original and live sports, and investing in digital, which is -- essentially means not only giving ESPN subscribers an opportunity to watch ESPN on mobile platforms, but giving us more touch points with the consumer." -Bob Iger at the Deutsche Bank 2016 Media, Internet & Telecom Conference on March 8, 2016. First, Disney was anticipating the decline in ESPN viewership as stated in the quote above. As a result, Disney wanted to "diversify the company more" by "giving" Disney "more touch points with the consumer." Hence the reason why alternative sources of revenue such as DisneyLife were only launched approximately six months after the introduction of skinny bundles (since initial basic Skinny bundles did not include ESPN). The decline in ESPN numbers is not because Americans or the rest of the world suddenly developed a hatred for sports. Part of this decline is due to basic skinny bundles such as the FiOS Custom TV which did not include sports programming. But after Disney sued Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), Verizon decided to offer two low-cost basic TV packages: one with sports and the other one without. DisneyLife is a niche market and its Total Addressable Market ("TAM") includes any parent or any guardian with kids around the age of 12-years old. We've gotten a strong sense for our pricing, we're out at I think £9.99. We have learned a lot about marketing, which we haven't even kicked in, in a big way yet, we're doing that end of this month. And we've learned a fair amount about programming. What I mean by that is, what people want when they subscribe to the service, and it's largely movies and TV shows. The games and the books are nice, but they're subscribing to this for movies and television. And that Disney matters. Parents with kids under 12, even those that subscribe to Sky and a multi-channel bundle, are still interested in buying this as an add-on or bolt-on service for their children... So what we've accomplished and we've really only just begun, I think launched in December or maybe Thanksgiving time, is actually significant for us as a company because the opportunity to launch this in other markets we believe is pretty great. We just haven't made any decisions about which markets and when." Bob Iger - Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company at the Deutsche Bank 2016 Media, Internet & Telecom Conference March 8, 2016 Page 22 DisneyLife is unique because of Disney's rich, worldly recognized branded intellectual properties. Disney has an outstanding list of movies meant for kids such as The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Toy Story 1,2 & 3, Monsters, Inc., Inside Out etc. This is why Disney was able to start pricing DisneyLife at £9.99. Because of its unique content and niche market, we believe there is a market for a premium service like DisneyLife. In a market where every major player is investing heavily in original, quality content, Disney is well-positioned to excel because it has the capital to develop or acquire great content. In addition to capital, DisneyLife is backed by a portfolio of high-quality, branded intellectual property developed and acquired by the Walt Disney company over the years. Besides the demand for Disney animated movies is alive and strong. When you look at the worldwide list of the highest grossing movies of all time , Disney animated movies such as Frozen, Toy Story 3, The Lion King, Finding Nemo etc rank as the 9th, 17th, 25th, 33rd highest grossing movies of all time on the domestic, international and worldwide box offices. This proves that the demand for Disney's movies is as strong as ever. Consequently, it is our contention that DisneyLife will excel as an add-on service for children. This will be a cost-efficient revenue stream for Disney because Disney will be able to realize more revenues by selling content directly to consumers. Aside from being a catalyst to Disney's stock price appreciation, this is critical for Disney investors as any margin expansion initiatives allow Disney to sustain and grow its dividends overtime. Disney has something particularly significant going on for it that other digital movie providers such as Netflix and Amazon are spending billions of dollars to imitate - their own content. From Winnie the Pooh to Mickey Mouse, Disney has created some of the most iconic characters in history. It is more likely that parents who grew up watching Disney or Pixar movies are likely to let their kids watch the same. Good parents would like their kids to watch non-violet and non-sexual contents and DisneyLife offers one solution to that. DisneyLife is a lucrative alternative source of revenues for two main reasons. First, it is a cost-efficient solution. It is cost effective because it eliminates middlemen and maximize margins by taking its content directly to consumers. Second, it enables the entertainment giant to optimize on the value of its IP and realize more revenues from its rich brands by charging a premium on some of the world's best animated films ever created. Subsequently, this is important for Disney investors because Disney's efforts to diversify revenues will mitigate the ESPN problems and thus bolster investor confidence in the stock. Lastly, any margin expansion initiatives enable Disney to sustain and grow dividends.
