Amazon Valuation Post AWS Disclosure: Justified Or Not? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's stock price is up nearly 9% since its announcing its Q1 2015 numbers. Amazon Price targets have been hiked post the announcement of better than expected AWS segment results. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock price is up nearly 9% since its Q1 2015 numbers hit the street. Major investment houses have been busy hiking their Amazon price targets citing the newly disclosed operating profitability of AWS as a major driver of the firm's value. We had earlier highlighted the fundamental problems Amazon faces as factors which made the stock a risky bet. With the new information on AWS, should investors rethink their stance on Amazon, as is being widely done? We update our Amazon stock analysis to put things in perspective. Amazon's valuation can be understood if we look at the company as one comprising of three pieces: Direct sales or Product Revenue, Cloud or AWS and Third party sales or Rest of total revenue. Amazon valuations on most traditional valuation metrics would throw up ridiculously low valuations, due to an inconsistent or near non-existent bottomline. However, a sum of the parts valuation based on revenue multiples for comparable businesses would provide a better understanding of what the right market valuation for Amazon stock would be. We use a sum-of-the-parts approach, looking at the three components as mentioned earlier, to understand Amazon's overall valuation. We compare the Direct Sales of Amazon to that of regular retailers. Most large retailers currently trade at a Price-to-sales multiple of around 0.5X. Providing for Amazon's superior product revenues growth rate, a multiple in the range of 0.5 to 1 would be appropriate to value the direct sales component of Amazon. Using a multiple of 1, Amazon Direct sales can be valued at $71.5 billion. Amazon Service Sales mostly include 3P sales on which it receives and records associated commission, similar to eBay Marketplaces. We could therefore use eBay's PS ratio of 4.09X to value the service sales component of Amazon. However, a point to note is that eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) valuation is positively impacted by the high growth of PayPal and hence the eBay multiple already implies a premium as compared to a pure play marketplace. However, Amazon 3p sales have a superior growth rate as compared to eBay Marketplace and hence we apply a multiple of 5X sales to Amazon's service sales to account for its rapid growth, valuing this component at $76.7 billion. The total valuation of Amazon's non-AWS business comes to $148.2 billion, as detailed above. Amazon currently has a total market cap of $203.31 billion (June 4 2015 close), implying a valuation of $55.11 for the AWS segment. The derived AWS valuation equates to a multiple of 10.7x LTM sales of $5.16 billion. AWS Competing with Google and Microsoft in a highly commoditized market Are these valuations stretched? A few points to consider would be the fact that Amazon's retail platform has failed to establish any kind of a significant and stable bottom line, unlike most established retailers and eBay. Hence valuing the company at these valuations does provide for a significant premium and an assumption that Amazon will turn profitable someday. Profitability is the company has failed to achieve with any kind of consistency, in its close to 20 years of existence. Moving over to the cloud segment, AWS competes in a market which has attracted companies like Microsoft and Google. The cash piles these companies possess are no secret. The IAAS market, where AWS operates in, is a highly commoditized market where cash cows are highly valued, given the huge upfront investments required. Google's online search and Microsoft's Windows and Office suite are great examples of solid cash cows. Competing with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) in a highly commoditized market where Price is the significant differentiator can only lead to one destination, lower profit margins. AWS operating profits are a proof of what is in store ahead. Amazon reported a segment operating profit margin of 17% for AWS in Q1 2015, a significant contraction from 23% in Q1 2014. Hence, any Amazon stock analysis should closely reflect and incorporate any changes in the AWS segment operating margins over the coming quarters. Amazon valuations definitely appear stretched even when evaluating the company using a sum-of-the-parts approach. At this point in time, investing in Amazon would be a like walking blindfolded to the edge of a cliff. While you won't be sure where the cliff ends, the fall could be great if the company fails to reinvent itself into profitability. While it would be highly speculative to go long at current valuations, betting against the stock would amount to foolishness of the highest order; for this is a stock which has traded in defiance of the greater investment rationale for well over a decade. The takeaway for investors: Look at better risk/reward options to park your money rather than a gamble in Amazon. The market does have plenty of them.
