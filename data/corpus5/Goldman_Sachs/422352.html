He can tell that there will be an Apple car coming out based on their hiring patterns. They should have embarked upon the project sooner, says Musk. They are on track volume production by 2020. It was a missed opportunity for Apple to have started so late. As for Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ), Musk expects them to license its technology to car companies such as Fiat (NYSE: FCAU ) instead of build cars itself. He said that Google has shown the potential of autonomous transport but they are not a car company. In the years ahead, autonomous cars will become the standard. There are five Chinese-funded electric vehicle startups at over the billion dollar level. Musk likes the activity in this industry. He opened up Tesla's patents in order to help accelerate the industry's development. He wants to get to a million Teslas per year by 2020. There is a lot of room to improve; so far none of the major car companies such as GM (NYSE: GM ) have been able to build a good electric car. Musk also spoke about his rocket competition with Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Jeff Bezos. Musk plans to land the first people on Mars in 2025. Oh, and he makes a reasonable argument that we are probably living in a simulation and not base reality. Thoma Bravo is buying Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ) for $30.50 in cash. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) is advising the target and Goldman (NYSE: GS ) is advising the buyer. Ares (NASDAQ: ARCC ) is also helping with the financing. At the request of Sanofi (NYSE: SNY ), Medivation (NASDAQ: MDVN ) set a record date of June 1 for the Consent Solicitation. Medivation is working with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ). Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) announced the terms of its purchase of ordinary shares from SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ). The company agreed to purchase 27,027,027 shares for $74 per share for an aggregate of $2 billion. Many Tribune Publishing (NYSE: TPUB ) holders plan to withhold votes during today's annual meeting. Gannett (NYSE: GCI ) requested investors withhold their votes in an act of no confidence for the Tribune Publishing board. The Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL ) acquisition of Meda ( OTCPK:MDABY ) was notified to the European Commission on June 1. The Phase 1 review expires on July 6. The Competition Commission of South Africa approved the Apollo Education (NASDAQ: APOL ) acquisition by Apollo Global (NYSE: APO ). The $0.80 net arbitrage spread offers a 15% IRR if the deal closes by year-end. More to come in future editions of M&A Daily â€¦ I am so happy that I joined StW. I have not been a member long, but a couple of quick turn deals easily allowed me to recoup my investment. As far as what I like best, I am not sure where to start. Chris and Andrew are extremely receptive to comments, and frequently interact with members. If you send private messages, they respond to those as well. I am not sure when they actually sleep. They are constantly coming up with new ideas to keep the hopper full, and frequently provide updates on ideas in progress. I am also grateful to them for the education that they are providing. Although many of the ideas would be impossible for me to duplicate since I don't have access to the resources that they have, there are techniques that they have shared that can be put into place by any investor, even those with small portfolios. One caution I have is that this is not a Buy this/Sell that service. As Chris says, if you want that, then open an account with Rangeley. If you want actionable ideas early, with clear explanations of what and why along with relatively frequent updates of milestones achieved by open positions, then this is something you would benefit from.
