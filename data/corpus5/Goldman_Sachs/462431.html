Stocks - The Second Pillar And Netflix's Veil Of Shadows - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Stocks have run 6.3% higher since we suggested investors should buy into weakness post Brexit. Currently, there are certain pillars of support under equities. I believe one of those pillars of support is shareholder hope and optimistic speculative interest in the earnings reports of widely held stocks that have exhibited relative strength. But as Netflix showed us last evening, those same reports could produce negative surprises. Nonetheless, it appears equities continue to draw bids, especially in the previously lagging technology and financial sectors, where recent operating performance or expectations have been enthusing. In my last report on the market, I talked about an ironic pillar of support under U.S. equities emanating from international uncertainty and its direction of beneficial capital flows into U.S. assets. In this report, I discuss a second pillar of support I believe is under stocks currently, and whether Netflix's earnings miss might undermine it. Since we suggested investors buy into the fear post Brexit about a month ago, stocks are up, with the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY ) having appreciated 6.3% and marking record highs. But investors and traders need to know what is next for stocks. I expect this season of giving can continue for a bit longer this week, before something gets in its way next week (stay tuned). There are key pillars of support under the current market beyond the capital flow factor I defined over the weekend. I believe a second pillar of support exists currently under stocks relative to earnings season and the hopeful expectations of shareholders and speculators. The shares of technology and financial sector stocks had been lagging the market during its nascent march higher. However, as broadly held stocks that have enjoyed good times in the past come due to report their earnings for Q2, it serves the broader market along with those shares. Shareholders of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), for instance, are significantly less likely to divest their shares ahead of the company's upcoming report. Speculators in the same issue are well aware of the stock's outperformance last quarter after a stellar report. Stories like this will keep current shareholders hopeful and in place, while luring speculative capital in for the ride. It's the reason Facebook has inched higher over the last couple weeks, as it moves back toward its all-time high. Even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is drawing capital despite expectations for a relatively poor quarter ahead of the launch of its new iPhone. Investors are thinking about what forward looking guidance that company might present at its meeting. Meanwhile, decent reports from the major banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and others has capital coming into those value plays and into stocks like them, even despite still dulled Fed expectations (not mine mind you). However, there exists the risk of poor reports as well, as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) showed us last evening. Netflix shares opened gap-lower this morning and were down nearly 14% in early trading. The company reported soft subscriber growth versus its own forecasts and analysts' expectations and provided lower forward subscriber growth expectations than analysts had forecast. Perhaps partly due to the Netflix disappointment and concerns that optimism could be misplaced elsewhere as well, the market is expressing some concern today. The SPDR S&P 500 is off fractionally this morning, despite a strong report from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ). Netflix's veil of shadows, which is a reference to its original program Stranger Things, which I watched this weekend and believe fans of The X-Files and The Twilight Zone will thoroughly enjoy, looks to not have the ability to kill earnings optimism. FB and AAPL shares are continuing higher this morning despite the bad news from NFLX, as investors differentiate between stories. Let us be clear that this theory of mine is just that, a theory, and is not supported by historical regression analysis. However simplistic, I believe the price movement of widely held equities that have had recently strong relative strength into their earnings news is evidence enough for reasonable consideration that it may be offering another pillar of support to the market more broadly now. I expect this pillar of support to continue to help stocks higher this week, but the key support for stocks now remains the Federal Reserve and what it might do to the cost of capital.
