The U.S. Congress Is The Biggest Threat To The Boeing 777 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Lack of Ex-Im flexibility could cost Boeing much needed orders. Order for Iran could help Boeing 777 program. The Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777 gap has been subject to some of my articles. In my previous article A Negative Trend For The Boeing 777 , I concluded that order inflow has been trailing the multi-year average and order inflow in 2015 was below my expectations. In a bearish note Goldman explained why they see a further drop in production rates in 2018 and 2019. In my previous article I had a look at the required production rate when using the annual order trend ( method 1 ). In this article I will have a look at average order inflow (method 2) and based on that I will look whether closing the gap can be achieved with the current negative trend of lower order inflow. Using the annual trend since the launch of the Boeing 777X First of all, it is important to explain why I am not using the long term trend. The long term trend was impacted by the 9/11 attacks that put the airline industry in a deep crisis and it took about 5 years before order inflow picked up pace again. I am not actually interested in this impact and therefore it is better not to look at the long term trend. If you wish to read about the long term trend and the various factors that impact order inflow, I can recommend you reading my series of articles covering each subject extensively. Besides that, the global financial crisis resulted in lower order inflow as well. The lower oil prices do have impacted order inflow for the Boeing 777, but there is no way to cut out that impact by chopping off another piece of the dataset. In the end, I do expect oil prices to rise again in the years to come. Secondly it is important to understand why I think the bi-annual trend is more suitable to estimate order inflow: The order inflow plot usually does not look like a steady rise or decline, but more like a zig-zag pattern. By using the annual order trend line, some information about that zig-zag is lost. By using the bi-annual average, the time as well as the unit spacing is used and the resulting lines and data should become much more useful and accurate. Figure 1: Bi-annual average order inflow Boeing 777 Classic ( Source ) The bi-annual average shows that the trend is down, since the launch of the Boeing 777X. If we use this trend, we can see that the bi-annual average will likely drop to around 45 units in 2016, around 35 in 2017, 30 in 2018 and around 20 in 2019. The next thing to do is to deduct the estimated order inflow from this. This has been done using 2 methods: Using the bi-annual average with no damping factor Using the bi-annual average with a certain damping factor Figure 2: Estimated order inflow Boeing 777 Classic ( Source ) What can be seen from Figure 2 is that the zig-zag pattern returns when using the bi-annual average for the estimate of order inflow. Figure 3: Estimates of the production gap using the zig-zag order inflow ( Source ) What can be seen is that using the zig-zag order inflow pattern, there is no need for another rate cut until at least 2019. Figure 4: Estimates of the production gap using the damped zig-zag order inflow ( Source ) If we translate this to required production rates for both, the damped and undamped, order inflows the following rates are required: Figure 4: Required production rates versus Boeing's planned rates ( Source ) What can be seen is that additional cuts of 1 unit per month might be required in 2018 and 2019, which differs quite a bit from Goldman's view that rates need to be cut to 4 and 3 per month in 2018 and 2019. Taking into account the zig-zag pattern of order inflow. Additional cuts of 1 per month, might be required in 2018 and 2019. This, however, is nowhere close to the cuts Goldman Sachs sees as necessary. Important to achieve a strong order inflow are the Ex-Im Bank. Aided by risk free credit, Boeing was able to sell aircraft to African airline TAAG. It is likely that some smaller airlines could be seduced by the combination of discounts and Ex-Im credits. Additionally, there are options that could be exercised (after renegotiation) and there still is a potential order from Iran. One thing that can be concluded is that there is a lot of potential for the Boeing 777 Classic, but a lot depends on the US Government. Killing off a deal with Iran and not approving export-credit in excess of $10 million could eventually force Boeing to cut rates.
