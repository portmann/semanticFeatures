Netflix Keeps Pushing Ahead With International Efforts - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix needs to show definite progress in its international segment. Activist investor Carl Icahn sold out his entire Netflix stake last month, making about a $2 billion gain. Investor David Einhorn said Netflix is more driven by spending than earnings. It should be an exciting week for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Shareholders will be in for a ride as well. Earnings are coming out and a few big investors have already made their views known as to where Netflix earnings and the share price may go. Activist investor Carl Icahn cashed in his chips and sold his last remaining stake in Netflix in June. Having made as much as $2 billion possibly from his Netflix investments, he may have just declared it as "mission accomplished" and felt it was time to move on. Perhaps he saw some of the froth that he commented about in the market generally in the Netflix share price. He sold his Netflix shares in late June at about the same time he said the market was "overheated." Only time - and the next Netflix earnings report - will tell if the stock is going to swoon. Another activist investor, David Einhorn, was a little more direct about his view of Netflix. In his quarterly letter to shareholders he wrote , "Practically: NFLX changed its story and pushed its promises into the distant future, with grand hopes for the decade starting in 2020. It transitioned from being a company judged by how much it earns into a company judged by how much it spends." He's lamenting about Netflix's growth story, but could it also be the first salvo of a short-sell? My view is that barring some big breakthrough to offset sour quarterly results, Netflix shares will go down. Investors have made good returns off of Netflix. The stock is up 60% over the past 12 months. They will probably take another weak quarter as a good reason to take their winnings off the table. If you're a believer of the long-term growth story of Netflix, then you actually want this to happen. A sell-off shakes the weak hands out, and once most of the sellers are gone that leaves only the buyers to push the price back up. Despite all the market speculation, Netflix keeps trucking along because it's busy becoming the world's biggest video streaming company. Right now, Netflix's international segment business only generates about 30% of revenue, yet the growth rate of quarterly revenue was over 55% year-over-year in Q1. That's more than double the rate for the US market. As an online company, the video streaming company doesn't have to worry about store networks, so it should be growing as fast it can overseas. Netflix knows it makes very good business sense to make its own original content to have exclusive rights to programs and films, and it is following that strategy now in foreign languages, too. Just within China and India alone, there are already close to 1 billion people online. That's nowhere close to the total populations of the two countries, but just those existing users outnumber the US users over three to one. Even a small portion of those markets is huge. When Netflix arrives in some countries, it's like the proverbial 800-pound gorilla showing up. In Australia, with a total population of almost 23 million, local streaming video providers were preparing for Netflix's arrival like a hurricane was about to land. However, as much as China and India may be interested in watching some US TV shows and films, it may be hard for Netflix to penetrate their markets to a significant extent. Case in point - when Netflix was considering partnering up with Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) in preparation to launch in China, soon after Alibaba announced it will start its own video streaming service, Tmall Box Office, and "…become like Netflix in the United States." What a welcome. But that's business. Netflix has begun making original TV shows in Spanish and will stream the first of 13 episodes of Club de Cuervos in August. That could be a good draw for new subscribers in Latin American countries as well as attract Spanish-speaking Americans. Foreign language original content would open up the door of a new country's internet market wider. Goldman Sachs projects Netflix will have 112 million international subscribers by 2020, or over five times what the company had in Q1 2015. On the other hand, the investment bank is only forecasting 69 million domestic market subscribers five years from now versus the 41 million in Q1 2015. Clearly the growth will be coming mostly from abroad. Goldman Sachs put a $780 price target on Netflix, saying it projects the company will replicate itself internationally within two years. I would agree with that logic. Netflix is acting as the first mover, entering new markets while its competitors are for the most part acting more defensively just to protect their own existing market. The advantage stays with the offensive side, so Netflix will have the momentum to grow earnings. As for this next earnings report, if Netflix sells off, wait for the dust to settle, and pick up the stock at a cheaper price.
