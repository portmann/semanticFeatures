The Dow Divergence Is A Good Thing | Seeking Alpha Jul.  2, 2015 12:35 PM ET  |  Includes: AA , AAPL , BAC , CSCO , DIA , FEYE , GS , HPQ , NDAQ , NKE , SPY , T , V by: Dana Blankenhorn The Dow continues to underperform other averages, most notably the NASDAQ. This is despite the fact that the Dow is rigged, with companies like Apple regularly replacing outfits like AT&T. So far this year the Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA: DIA ) is down 1.15%, while the S&P (NYSEARCA: SPY ) is up .2% and the NASDAQ (NASDAQ: NDAQ ) is up a solid 5.3%. This "Dow Divergence" has been going on for some time. Go back five years and the NASDAQ is up 124%, the Dow just 74%. Take it back 10 years and the NASDAQ is up 143%, the DOW up just 71%. This includes the Great Recession. About the only way to make this comparison work in the Dow's favor is to take things back to the dot-bomb, at the turn of the century, which over the course of two years cut the NASDAQ from a high of 5,000 to a low of about 1,200. What's going on? This game is supposed to be rigged the other way. Dow stocks are regularly taken out of the average when they don't perform, and new ones put in. Just this March AT&T (NYSE: T ) was dropped in favor of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). You'd rather own Apple, right? Before that, in 2013, Alcoa (NYSE: AA ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) were dropped in favor of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Visa (NYSE: V ). Tell me you wouldn't make that trade? As an average, the Dow Jones is like the New York Yankees and the NASDAQ like the Kansas City Royals. The Dow buys high because it wants to win now, baby, while the Royals nurture the farm system and let some big stars go. (It's just a coincidence sports analogies work here - think the Knicks and Warriors, the Cowboys and Seahawks, or Arsenal and Southampton in England's Premier League.) You get more bang for your buck with the "tech heavy NASDAQ" in part because of the law of numbers. Small numbers are easier to grow than big ones. Fireeye (NASDAQ: FEYE ) has more room to grow than Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ). This makes it more volatile, but the volatility is usually pointed up. You also get more bang from the NASDAQ because of the nature of the economy. It really does make sense, as Mark Twain said, for companies to put all their eggs in one basket and watch that basket. Innovation comes from close attention to one thing, and the greatest growth comes when you're selling to the early adopters of something, not those buying replacements. Since Apple joined the Dow on March 6 the shares are down 2.4%. This has happened, as Apple fans know, despite it being a screaming bargain. The current Price/Earnings multiple is 15.5, and you get a 52 cent dividend yielding 1.66% to boot. Apple's top line continues to grow - 7% for the most recent fiscal year, and it's on pace to crush the comparison again, with sales for the first two quarters of $130 billion and sales for all of fiscal 2014 of $182 billion. What's going on? It's the expectations game. People just aren't buying Apple for big gains anymore. They're buying it for steady progress. They're buying it and they're holding it and, here at Seeking Alpha, we don't even talk about it as much anymore. That's not the fault of Apple management. It's the law of numbers, the expectations we have for Dow stocks, and the limits on bigness imposed by an innovation economy. I would much rather invest in such an economy, wouldn't you? If I'm looking to make big money, I don't head for the comfy chair, for the fat guys lighting their cigars with $100 bills. I head for the work bench, and the young hotshots with fire in their eyes. I just don't fall in love with that fire. When the earthquake comes it's going to hit those on the shakier foundations harder.
