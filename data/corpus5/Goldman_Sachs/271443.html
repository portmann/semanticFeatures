Disney: 'The Force Awakens' Is Just The Beginning - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Disney have been very much under pressure lately, largely due to fears regarding ESPN. While this warrants the attention of investors, a key thing the market seems to be overlooking is the company's strong showing with "Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens". Over the weekend, the film broke many records, despite missing out on the major motion picture market in China. Collectively, the film should be a major contributor to the company's sales and profits for years to come but that's not all it has to offer. With a massive pipeline of films due to come out over the next three years, many of them sequels to successful movies, the potential for Disney looks beautiful. "Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens" opened in theaters over the weekend, performing extremely well and causing Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) to raise guidance for both the film and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) as a whole. In spite of all the anticipation surrounding the film's release, analysts have been pessimistic about the company and BTIG sent shares lower to close at $107.72, 11.8% below their 52-week high of $122.08 after downgrading the company to "Sell" over fears associated with its ESPN operations before the stock dropped another 1% on Monday. While there are some issues investors should be concerned over, however, I think the market is probably overreacting and the upside prospects for Disney moving forward are very good. The issue haunting Disney and its share price right now relates to concerns that the company overpaid for exclusive ESPN deals in an effort to keep said contracts away from some of its competitors, namely Fox Sports, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox ( FOX A). In addition to fighting hard to retain its market share by paying a hefty sum, many investors fear that a wave of unbundling, which is a trend among consumers paying cable companies less but for access to only certain programming, will hit Disney's profitability hard. For those who don't follow Disney closely, it should be mentioned that the company owns 80% of ESPN and that it is a massive part of the company's Media Networks segment which, among other things, includes the company's ownership of ABC Family and Disney Channels. For the company's 2015 fiscal year, Media Networks reported revenue of $23.26 billion and segment operating income of $7.79 billion. This represents 44.3% of the company's overall revenue and 53.1% of its segment operating income for the year. Obviously, any such hit taken by ESPN would prove destructive for shareholders of the company but I don't think this is likely to transpire. In a previous piece , I covered the ESPN concern in great detail and stated that, while shares are expensive, I have a hard time seeing the stock drop by more than 10% to 20% (I mentioned I wouldn't be surprised to see a drop of 10% to 15% whatsoever but that a 20% decline would likely be driven by economic reasons). Since then, the company's stock has fallen 6.9% and could see some downside over the next month or two depending on what transpires both with Star Wars and with ESPN. One amazing bright spot for Disney was the company's release of the seventh installment of Star Wars. This is the first theatrical installment released by the company since acquiring Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion. Truth be told, the first three films produced decades ago never impressed me because, although the acting was great, I am a graphics junky and, while the three newer films that were produced had great graphics, the acting was terrible. If anybody can take a great concept like Star Wars and turn it into one of the greatest films ever made, it's Disney. So far, the results have been very encouraging. The domestic box office totaled $248 million for the weekend and $529 million globally. The initial reception has been so positive that Goldman Sachs now expects the film to record total U.S. sales during its time in theaters of $750 million and international sales of $1.2 billion, bringing total receipts up to $1.95 billion. This represents a major jump from an earlier expectation of $1.5 billion globally for the film and would cement it as the third best-performing feature ever released, just behind the $2.21 billion earned by Titanic but still quite far below the $2.78 billion record-holder Avatar. This would allow the film to handily outperform Frozen, the most successful animated theatrical feature ever released, which raked in $1.27 billion. Goldman Sachs believes this will ultimately result in somewhere around $6 billion in consumer products sales for Disney but this isn't the only way in which Star Wars will benefit the enterprise. In addition to the box office and consumer products, the company will be able to generate revenue for years to come (most of which will take place over the next 12 months) from licensing, using the content to lure more customers and advertisers onto its networks, etc... Nobody knows how big, exactly, Frozen was but, in 2015, the company's Home Entertainment category saw sales come in $295 million lower than they were the year before, driven largely by a strong performance from the film the year before. The impact from Star Wars should be materially larger. Ultimately, theatrical releases by the company open a pipeline that can be tapped for years to come so this is anything but a one-time benefit for the company. If this were all that Disney had going for it in terms of theatrical releases, I could understand the fears investors have moving forward because of ESPN because, while this Star Wars film will generate revenue for the company for years to come, having one major release isn't enough to keep the ball rolling. Thankfully, however, Disney has a lot more slated to come out over the next few years. Take, for instance, "Finding Dory", "Cars 3", and "Toy Story 4", expected to be released in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. All three Pixar releases are sequels to major motion pictures that fared very well in the box office. "Finding Nemo" generated $936.43 million in the box office while the first two Cars movies made $461.65 million and $560.16 million, respectively. The first three Toy Story movies brought in $364.40 million, $511.33 million, and $1.07 billion, respectively. In addition to Pixar films, the company has a large array of other releases set over the next few years. In May of 2016, "Captain America: Civil War" will air. The first film attracted $370.57 million while the second brought in nearly double that at $713.85 million. "Alice Through the Looking Glass" will also be released in May, after seeing the previous film attract $1.03 billion in the box office. Although The Lone Ranger proved that Johnny Depp is not an automatic ticket to success, it's hard to not make a nice profit when the first film in a series topped $1 billion. Speaking of Johnny Depp, the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie is due to be released in 2017 and will likely have a nice run. Even though the box office releases have been getting weaker since the second film was released, the fourth in the series generated $963.42 million. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 will be released in 2017 as well, following a successful first hit that generated $771.17 million. Add to this the fact that Frozen 2 is in the works and it's hard to see how Disney could fare poorly in the years to come, especially when each of these products will move throughout the Disney pipeline to generate revenue not only in terms of movie sales and consumer products but also through other sources such as the company's theme parks, which will attract even more people to its overcrowded hotspots. Right now, many investors seem to be scared about the prospects of ESPN taking a beating and I understand this. I, too, think that this could ultimately give Disney some trouble but I do not believe that it will be so damaging that it will destroy any material amount of value in the years to come. At 22 times earnings, shares of the company are still quite pricey but, when you consider that Disney is still growing at a nice clip, that it has a strong economic moat (perhaps the strongest in the world), and that it has a wonderful collection of releases that will come out over the next few years, I don't think the price being paid for the company's shares are unreasonable. Will owning Disney's stock make you rich over the next year or two? Probably not. But, it has demonstrated time and again that it is a phenomenal place to store money for the long run and that the probability of performing poorly over any significant period of time is miniscule at best.
