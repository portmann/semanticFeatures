2 Peculiar Questions For Ford Longs About June's U.S. Auto Numbers - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's June U.S. auto sales look good. A couple of questions loom under the surface; despite a growing ASP, how does a drop of 8.9% in F-series sales coincide with increased demand. Earlier in the summer, we took note of Ford's need to ramp production through the summer months. This morning Ford (NYSE: F ) announced what appeared to be a good June U.S. auto sales number. In this article, we'll look at the results, remind people why we're bullish on Ford, and take an opening look at a couple of peculiar questions that Ford longs should seek the answers to. They're questions that we're going to look into as well, and we'll report our findings in a subsequent articling. Ford met expectations with its U.S. auto sales in June, which were up 1.6% versus a consensus of between 1% and 2%. Utilities sales being up 11% offset both passenger vehicles and trucks, which fell 4% and 0.7%, respectively. After the market pushed Ford up for Wednesday's open, the stock fell during mid-day trading; likely a result of the investing public taking a closer look at the company's "+1.6%" number and mulling the specifics, which we have also done. A major positive point from today's number (GM (NYSE: GM ) found the same success despite posting a negative comp) was that ASP was strong : Ford reports a record average selling price for the F-Series during June. Increased demand for the new F-150 pushed the ATP during the month up 8.9% to $44K. The Ford Mustang knocked out its best June sales performance since 2007 with 11,719 units sold. This was also the key focus of the company's press release this morning: "Strong retail momentum continues building for our newest vehicles - including F-150, Mustang, Edge, and now Explorer," said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. "The Ford brand's average transaction prices have increased $2,700 versus a year ago - more than triple the industry average - while our incentives are down, showing how much customers value our investment in new vehicles with the latest technologies." While the ASP is important and goes to show robust demand for a product that isn't being incentivized as much as industry comparables (like GM), we would have liked to see a stronger number from the F-Series. Here is what a majority of the full report looked like: As you can see, the company's F-Series number was down 8.9% YOY from 60,560 to 55,171. What is even more peculiar about this was last summer the company was expecting a slowdown in F-Series numbers as it was prepping for the launch of the new F-150. It was widely expected that those comparable numbers wouldn't be robust as the company guided consumers away from the older model F-Series in anticipation of its new line. Strong Transit numbers held up Ford's utility segment despite truck numbers falling short. Nonetheless, auto sales as a whole continue to trend upward for 2015. We're still bullish on Ford, but we have a couple of critical questions to push onto the Ford investing public. Our last article on Ford talked about Goldman Sachs' recent upgrade of the stock. We noted that this shows us that not only is the company evolving, but also the public's perception of the stock could be the next to shift with it. We think if the investing public begins to see the opportunity that we think we see in Ford, the stock will begin another ascent toward $20. But today's report leaves us with a couple of peculiar questions about Ford. In a past article, we discussed Ford's disclosed plans to shorten its summer break this year. We forecasted that this was a direct result of increased demand. The company's F-Series numbers seem to tell us otherwise, no? Also, can Ford issue a breakdown of the sales in the F-Series? Does the F-150 continue to be a driver compared to other trucks in the line? Being long Ford isn't for the impatient or faint of heart. Being long Ford has been a tough proposition, but one that we think will ultimately pay off in the long term. The stock has been in a trading range for the last couple of years. However, we're confident that the company's allocation of capital into its own innovation, combined with the company's increasing global footprint with many "one time" set-up costs out of the way, will drive Ford's bottom line and put a charge into the stock in coming years. Still to this day, you have a chance to buy Ford with its newly instated dividend yield near all-time highs. We aren't currently long as we're moving our dividend portfolio, but we will look to reestablish our position within the coming weeks. Long-term net/net, we are still very bullish on Ford. We'd like to know more about the company's poor F-Series number and specifically, how much of that was due to each specific series.
