ETF Hub Jun 15 2015, 12:31 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Declaring May sales data from Taiwanese PC contract manufacturers (ODMs) was much weaker than expected, Goldman's James Covello (Sell, $23 target) has cut his 2015 Intel ( INTC +0.3%) EPS estimate by $0.10 to $2.10 (below a $2.16 consensus). Deutsche's Ross Seymore (Buy, $37 target) has cut his Q2, 2015, and 2016 estimates, stating PC sales remain weak and that a seasonal demand pickup aided by the launch of Windows 10 (due on July 29) and Intel's Skylake CPU platform ( expected to begin rolling out in late summer) will come largely in Q4, rather than Q3. Seymore also thinks channel inventory burn will hurt Intel's gross margin, and that the Altera deal will affect the pace of buybacks. However, he maintains "INTC offers a favorable risk/reward at its current discount valuation and [expects] shares to appreciate as PC headwinds lessen (2H15/2016)." RBC's Amit Daryanani recently estimated May ODM shipments were down 16% M/M to 9.6M, in sharp contrast to May 2014's 12% M/M growth. "Given the larger than normal monthly declines thus far reported in 2015, we see risk to the downside for PC demand in June-qtr and CY15. Broadly barring a much stronger June, we think PC units could end up being down q/q in June-qtr." On the bright side (and echoing Deutsche), Daryanani thinks Q2 should "mark a bottom for PC supply chain as we see Win 10 being a tailwind in 2HCY15 and we suspect the channel will start rebuilding inventory and provide relief as well." In May, Intel's IR chief reportedly tried to temper hopes for an immediate Windows 10-driven PC rebound, while adding Intel does expect 2H15 inventory replenishment.
