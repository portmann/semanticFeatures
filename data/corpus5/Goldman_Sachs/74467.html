6% Yield From Intel's Deal With Altera - Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) | Seeking Alpha INTC reached a deal with ALTR after a concerted shareholder effort. INTC wanted the deal and ALTR holders did, too. Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) makes and sells semiconductors. Specifically, the company specializes in the field-programmable gate array/FPGA market, in competition with Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) and Microsemi (NASDAQ: MSCC ). Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and ALTR announced a definitive deal in which INTC will buy ALTR for $54.00 per share, all in cash. This deal is not conditioned on financing. INTC plans to pay for the deal, which will probably close within the next nine months or so, with cash on its balance sheet and debt. ALTR is working with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), and INTC is working with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ). The deal has been unanimously approved by the INTC and ALTR directors, and is subject to typical regulatory reviews and closing conditions, including the approval of ALTR holders, many of whom actively pushed for this deal. The key holder behind encouraging ALTR to return to the negotiating table was Drew Figdor of TIG Advisors . In the middle of last October, ALTR updated its change-of-control and severance agreements with the company's CEO and other top executives. By late March, INTC was in discussions to buy ALTR. I first discussed my $6 million long ALTR position on Sifting the World in early April. It is up over 25% since then. No other deal alternatives are likely to emerge at this point. However, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) would be another potential bidder. The common stock appears to have a better relationship between risk and reward than the equity options. However, one somewhat interesting contract is the January 20, 2017 $50 put. It last traded at $1.50, and currently has a bid of $1.55 and an ask of $1.60. If you write this contract, it will be accelerated to the date of the deal's closing, which will probably be during the first quarter of 2016.
