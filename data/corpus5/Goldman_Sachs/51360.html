What Apple's Buybacks Mean For Investors - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's earnings per share are higher than most investors think (when using the correct method to determine EPS). Apple' share repurchase have a huge impact on per share metrics and reward investors in down years. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported first quarter earnings last week, and the results were impressive. Still, the company's shares are down six percent right now. I'll lay out in this article that this provides an excellent entry point into Apple's stock. Apple also boosted its shareholder return program, the dividend is increased by 11% to $0.52, the share repurchase authorization was increased by $50 billion to $140 billion. This equals a total amount of $200 billion, a truly impressive number by itself. Apple has been generous with its shareholders over the last few years: Over just the last two years, the amount of shares outstanding decreased ten percent whilst the dividend was increased 20% over the same time. With Apple's huge remaining stock buyback authorization, investors can count on further steep share count declines and dividend increases in the low double digits. Apple's share count reduction affects the company's per share metrics such as earnings per share, free cash flow per share, revenue per share and ultimately increases the amount Apple can pay out as dividends per each share. The actual effect on these metrics is often underestimated, mainly due to the effect that most analysts (and also finance information websites) calculate a company's earnings per share wrongly: The often used way to derive the trailing earnings per share is to add up the company's reported earnings per share for the last four quarters: In Apple's case, this equals $2.33 + $3.06 + $1.42 + $1.28 = $8.09. This is also the number publicized by most websites, such as finviz . The correct way of determining a company's earnings per share (and thus the correct way of determining one share's worth) is to add up the net income of the last four quarters and to divide the sum by the number of shares outstanding in the most recent quarter. ($13.6B + $18B + $8.5B + $7.7B) / 5.79B shares = $8.26 per share This means that Apple's past earnings per share are actually $0.17 higher than most investors think. Apple's trailing P/E ratio is thus 15.3, a hefty discount to the broad market (which is valued at a trailing P/E ratio of 20.5). Is this discount justified? I don't think so. Note: Year 2013 includes Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2012 and Q1 of 2013, etc. As you can see, Apple's revenues grew each year, by 4% and 20% (for a cumulative growth of 25%). At the same time, the reduced share count led to revenue per share increases of 11% and 28%, for a cumulative growth of 42%. As you can see, net income declined slightly from 2013 to 2014 (down five percent), but earnings per share grew two percent over those twelve months: The result of the company's share repurchases. In theory (assuming an unchanged multiple), the company's worth declined over that time, but the worth of each Apple share an investor holds has gone up over the same time. From 2014 to 2015, the company's net earnings grew 27%, earnings per share grew 35%. This equals a two-year cumulative net earnings growth of 21% and earnings per share growth of 37% - an impressive surplus, generated by Apple's share repurchases. Cash from operations declined slightly from 2014 to 2013 (down two percent) and grew immensely over the next twelve months (up 43%). This equals a cumulative two-year growth of 40%. At the same time, cash flow per share grew 5% and 51%, for a cumulative two-year growth of 59%. As you can see, the company's share repurchases led to growing operating cash flow per share even through a down year, allowing investors to see their investment become more valuable even when the company needed a breather on its growth streak. We can see that Apple's share repurchases had an immense effect on the company's per share metrics. This per share growth led to a growing worth (note: not price) of each share and thus also to a growing worth of a total investment (unless an investor sold or bought shares in the meantime). Since the process stays the same, we know that Apple's future share repurchases will have the same effect: Apple retires shares, the revenue, net income and cash flow that are generated by Apple are distributed over a lower total share count and the result per share keeps growing. As we could see in the past, share repurchases are able to push per share metrics even in times of stagnant operational results. With Apple's huge current share repurchase authorization, I count on ongoing substantial outperformance of per share metrics vs. fundamental results (which should be pretty good anyways). Another fact investors should consider is that Apple's share repurchases work as downward protection for the stock price in the near and medium term: Apple's management will up the pace of share repurchases on days (or weeks) where the company's stock price is down, thus creating additional demand for Apple's shares and laying a floor at a certain level. This stabilizes Apple's share price and should make the stock less volatile in a broader market correction. In addition to the huge effect of Apple's share repurchases, a lot of factors speak for ongoing (organic) growth: - Apple should be able to grow revenues and net income by a huge margin over the next two quarters because the iPhone 6 / 6 Plus is sold in way higher numbers than the previous models, and it has a higher average selling price. - Apple's wearable hasn't started appearing on the company's reported top and bottom line so far, but will do so in the upcoming quarters. - Apple's China results have been on a high growth trajectory in the last quarters, a trend that will likely continue. - With growing adoption in the US and upcoming introduction in foreign markets, Apple Pay is poised to grow over the next years. - Apple's pipeline and future products (e.g. a car) should be able to contribute to the company's success in the future. I also want to address something I have read in some articles here on Seeking Alpha recently, a claim that Apple's cash pile was a problem, due to the fact, that most of it is hoarded overseas and can't be used for shareholder returns. Although the statement itself is correct ($171B of its $194B is overseas), this is not a problem for the company, due to three reasons: Overseas cash can be used for acquisitions in foreign countries (think Microsoft's Mojang acquisition for $2.5 billion) which will ultimately benefit shareholders, overseas cash can be used for capex in foreign countries (Apple store openings in China come to mind) and lastly, Apple can easily borrow US cash at a very low rate (where the company's overseas cash reserves work as a risk reduction for the lender). In the past quarters, Apple has increasingly done this (borrow against its overseas cash) to have ample US cash it can use for shareholder returns. At the end of 2014, Apple has issued debt notes nominated in € for the first time, this does make sense for two reasons: - The second one is a little more complicated: By issuing € bonds Apple gets access to Euros, which are then converted to dollars, which the company uses to fund buybacks and dividends. When Apple has to pay back its bond it has to pay it back in Euros (Apple thus will likely have to convert its dollar holdings to Euros). This is especially intriguing in one case: When the Euro falls/the dollar rises. Let's look at an example: Apple floats a 5 billion Euro bond (five years), gets five billion Euros and converts those to dollars ($5.6 billion at today's exchange rate). If the Euro falls and in 2020 (when Apple has to pay back said bond) the $/€ rate is 1.00, Apple has to pay just $5 billion to get access to 5 billion Euros which are then used to pay back the bond. When the Euro falls against the Dollar, Apple thus makes more money by borrowing. Many analysts see the Euro heading to parity with the dollar in the future (e.g. Goldman , Bank of America ). In this scenario (which seems likely), Apple's borrowing against its overseas cash position thus isn't a problem, but rather something the company can actually benefit from. Apple's share repurchases allow the company to boost per share metrics even in years when fundamental growth is sluggish, and as long as Apple keeps returning huge amounts of its cash to shareholders this is something investors can count on. The fact that the majority of Apple's cash is located overseas isn't a huge problem because it can be used for overseas acquisitions, overseas capex and Apple can easily borrow against that money. By borrowing Euros (which Apple started doing recently) the company can benefit from a falling Euro. Source: What Apple's Buybacks Mean For Investors Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
