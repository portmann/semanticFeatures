Microsoft, Intel: Can Wintel Ride Again? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Investors have grown used to disappointment in Wintel, now bought solely for yield. But both are making successful transitions into new growth areas. What makes you money in the market is surprise. That Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a great stock to own is not a surprise, so the stock doesn't move much. That Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) stands against the cloud-and-device trend is not a surprise, so that stock doesn't move much either. But what if conditions change? And might conditions change soon for two former favorites, now deep in the doldrums, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Once, "Wintel" strode the technology world like a colossus. Microsoft was the operating system standard, Intel was its chip, and whether your PC was a big server or a small desktop model, the answer was the same. No more. Now the PC is deader than your Atari game machine. So they say. Ignore for a moment the fact that Microsoft's gross profits remain solidly above half of all revenue. Forget that it has nearly $100 billion in cash and short-term investments on its books, on a market cap of $376 billion. That used to be meaningful. But under Satya Nadella, there is life after Windows. There's the XBox, which is as much a software platform for games as it is a piece of hardware, and there's the Azure cloud for starters. More important, there's the Office productivity suite, which wrote this story, and which is not going away, no matter what Apple may do. There is also a different attitude on the part of Microsoft management. Open source is no longer anathema. Stepping on stages with Apple executives is now routine. The stage is being set for new surprises, pleasant ones, off a base that now yields 3%. But this is an Intel story. Intel reported earnings yesterday , net income of $3.1 billion, 64 cents per share, on revenue of $14.5 billion, with gross margins at an eye-popping 63%. The problem is that, as with Apple, the good news was baked into the stock long ago and continues to grow stale. Shares dropped 2.2% in early trade on all this good news, again on a belief that PCs are in long-term decline, and the fact that those profits, while good, were still below those of a year ago. What are you doing for me tomorrow remains the question. The stock actually popped after the numbers came out. The fall began with the company's conference call , which seemed surprisingly downbeat. The company's success in cloud infrastructure, which it calls its data center business, its work in NAND with Micron (NASDAQ: MU ), the pending acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), even a stronger performance among Taiwanese OEMs, were all swept aside as management talked about global financial concerns and gave guidance squarely in the midpoint of its previous expectations. You're not taking a big risk on either of these stocks. If you're a "widow and orphan" investor, you can live with the 3% yield. Both are financially solid, with Intel carrying 13 cents of debt for each dollar of assets, an incredibly low number given the capital intensity of Moore's Second Law, under which capital costs double with each doubling of chip capacity. Right now, I think both these stocks are underestimating what they can do for the next few quarters. These managements know that promises won't cut it, after years of disappointment, and that only results will matter. Look for an upside surprise from both these companies for the Christmas quarter, followed by some large moves higher. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
