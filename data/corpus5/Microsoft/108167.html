Is Any Company A Major Threat To Apple? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL is on pace to achieve 40% iPhone shipment growth this year. Xiaomi was once seen as an Apple threat, but its growth is slowing, even declining sequentially. Samsung is the world's largest smartphone maker by volume, but its share of the market has declined after its poor first quarter. This time last year, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi was seen as a growing headache for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with its iPhone look-alike phones running an Android operating system. Fast forward one year and Xiaomi sales are slowing significantly, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has lost momentum as well, and Apple looks like a genius for making larger screens with the iPhone 6. Therefore, with many analysts expecting iPhone sales growth of more than 40% this year for Apple, it's beginning to look like neither Xiaomi nor any one else can slow Apple's impressive momentum. Prior to Apple's launch of the iPhone 6, Xiaomi really was causing a headache for the world's largest company. As seen above, the appearance between Apple's iPhone 5 and Xiaomi's Mi 4 couldn't be more similar. Xiaomi was then able to sell its devices at a much lower price point due to cheaper components and an Android operating system. In the second quarter of last year, Xiaomi shipped 15 million units for a whopping 240% increase year-over-year. That gave it a 14% share of the smartphone market according to Canalys, thereby making Xiaomi the top smartphone vendor in China. However, its fortunes haven't been nearly as great competing against the iPhone 6. During Apple's December quarter, it shipped 74.5 million iPhone units for a 46% increase year-over-year. Then, during its last quarter, Apple once more posted year-over-year shipment growth of 40% to ship over 61 million iPhones. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's smartphone shipment growth has slowed to just 33% during the first half of 2015, 34.7 million total shipments. According to research from Quartz , Xiaomi's smartphone shipments during the second quarter even showed a minor decline vs. the first quarter, something that hasn't been seen during its remarkable run. As a result, Apple emerged as the top smartphone vendor in China with a 14.5% share of the market after the first quarter, and Xiaomi's share slipped from 14% to 13.5%. This suggests that Xiaomi isn't nearly the Apple threat that so many analysts and investors thought it would be. Apple's impressive growth in China should make shareholders very excited given the fact that 4G LTE networks in China do not yet cover the entire country, and in many instances, are just being built. That's why Apple's outlook in China remains so bright and why it can build on the 100% unit sales growth that UBS expects during this current quarter. Beyond China, Apple is forecasted to sell 48 million total iPhones this quarter, a number that many believe is too conservative, and a number that will surpass 100 million for the first six months of 2015. Once more, that's good for a 40% jump, which is not only causing turmoil for Xiaomi, but also Samsung. During Samsung's last quarter, it witnessed a 6.2% decline in smartphone sales and a 39% decline in profits. This tells investors that not only is Samsung having a hard time competing against Apple but that these struggles are occurring despite Samsung selling units at a lower profit with cheaper phones. Now that Apple has seemingly figured out what the consumer wants, larger screens and is on tap for an iPhone 6 refresh later this year, it's really hard to find a viable competitor that can slow it down. Samsung has always been that competitor, but it seems to have hit a wall. Meanwhile, Xiaomi looked like a real threat, but its shipments are slowing and even declining sequentially. That leaves BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Lenovo and Nexus, among others, each of which whose history as a competitor against Apple has been anything less than stellar. As a result, it doesn't appear that any company can stop Apple, or at least not in the foreseeable future. With the majority of Apple's profit coming from iPhone sales, this is good for investors, and suggests that Apple will soon surpass resistance at $130 to trade much higher. After all, Apple still has a very large opportunity to convert smartphone users. IDC estimates that Apple controls just 18.3% of the worldwide smartphone market. While large, it leaves open the possibility for additional market share gains in the coming years, something that Apple proved is possible after having its share rise from 15.2% last year. At just 10x next year's earnings, Apple is a must buy, a company that can only be stopped by itself.
