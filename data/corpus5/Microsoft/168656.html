Intel And Microsoft Will Penetrate The Mobile Market In The Next 2 Years - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is testing Core M on smartphones. Core M idle power consumption capabilities are still unknown. A PC class SoC inside a smartphone together with Windows 10 Continuity could be disruptive for the market. The main problem that impacts Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is the low mobile market penetration. It's true that in the tablet sector it achieved some penetration but it is clearly not enough. Skylake is an architecture meant to be used in a very wide power consumption and heat production range (TDP from 4,5W to 91W). The Skylake-Y series is the most power efficient and powerless version, called Core M. The new Core M series is provided with configurable TDPs: TDP down of 3,5W, normal TDP of 4,5W and TDP up of 7W. The previous Core M series version (Broadwell-Y) was able to provide performances not far away from ultra-laptop CPUs of the Broadwell-U series (TDP 15,0W). In fact Core M has been used in tablets and 2-in-1 devices thanks to the low power consumption. We must say that these SoCs strongly throttle under heavy load. This happens to Samsung Exynos 7420 in Galaxy S6, to Apple A8 in iPhone 6 or to Intel Core i3/i5/i7 of the U class: this happens because a small chassis cannot dissipate all the generated heat due to excessive workload or environmental conditions. Preliminary benchmarks have shown that the fastest Skylake-Y Core M 6Y75 (TDP 4,5W) provides a raw peak performance similar to the fastest Broadwell-U Core i7 5500U (TDP 15,0W) in benchmarks like Geekbench 3. This achievement is quite remarkable since the Intel Y series has only one-third of the U series TDP. Obviously, the Broadwell-U i7 runs at higher clocks for much more time thanks to the higher TDP that is designed to permit higher power consumption on the long term. Anyway, this achievement makes me think good of the progresses Intel is bringing on. If we compare the same Skylake-Y Core M with the new Atom X7 we find out that Core M is roughly 2X faster than Atom X7 which powers Microsoft Surface 3. We don't even consider Core M iGPU which is a class beyond X7 iGPU. Surface 3 is powerful enough to flawlessly do light office work and with Windows 10 things will get even better. Atom X7 has a lower SDP about 2W which is the equivalent of a TDP between 2,5-3W. The point is that if X7 gives suitable power to do light office work, things get incredibly interesting with Core M which is a PC class CPU. If preliminary benchmarks are correct, the Core M series will become suitable for office work and entertainment providing the right performances for a low amount of battery drain. This is only the natural evolution of the previous Core M designed for those purposes. The interesting part comes with smartphones, a sector which was believed to be out of target. At the beginning of this month, news ( here and here ) said that Intel is testing Skylake-Y Core M on smartphone platforms. They stated also that this chance is compelling but there are still problems that Intel will have to face, even if it's only a matter of time. I personally think that if Intel will be able to fit a Core M - a PC class SoC - inside a smartphone, it could be a disruptive move. A Core M has a typical TDP of 4,5W that is good for tablets but way too high for smartphones. Core M has a down TDP of 3,5W which is still too high, even if it's not too far away from a typical phablet TDP of 3W (smartphones with 5 inches or less tend to have a TDP of 2,5W or less). These Core M have even a SDP (Scenario Design Power) of 3W which is simply a settable TDP for highly thermal constrained devices. This SDP is at the limit but it would be OK for some preliminary tests. It must be underlined that the Core M SoC lacks of GNSS, cellular, WLAN and PAN modules that increase power consumption and heat generation. These components must be added on the motherboard making it more complex and expensive and theoretically less efficient. A specific feature of the SDP behavior is: if in that moment the temperature and generated heat are low, the SoC can achieve a performance equivalent to the TDP (being 3.5W, 4.5W or 6W) for a relative amount of time. This means that in a smartphone like scenario where demanding tasks are quite short (not gaming), performances will be very high. This happens because the lower the temperature at the same performance threshold, the lower the power drain is. By the way, 3W of generated heat would be suitable for a phablet with around a 60inch screen, not for a smartphone around 5 inches or less (because throttling would be too high). Intel is likely to modify Core M with a TDP settable from 2,5W to 3,5W and a SDP of 2W. What about performances? Right now a Core M 5Y70 with a down TDP of 3,5W gives 80% of raw peak performance of the 4,5W TDP version. Performances are likely to be around 65-70% giving around 4000 points in Geekbench 3 Multithreading benchmark when SDP is enabled. A notice about benchmarks: synthetic benchmarks are not reliable because they do not provide real world usage. Only those benchmarks based on real programs present on multiple platforms may be reliable. If you take a list of games and you test them with the same settings over various platforms, then you are doing a good benchmark. If you take a big photo in Photoshop and you consider the application time of a filter, that is a good benchmark. If you take a commercial rendering program and you control time elapsed during the same rendering, that is a good benchmark. If you take a synthetic benchmark instead, you will test only raw power between completely different architectures and OSs. This does not mean a lot because there are too many variables (OSs, Compilers, calculus which are only a part of real world case scenario) that do not correspond to real world scenarios. In any case, such a result would be good enough to just have an idea. The real problem is the idle consumption which is practically unknown. Windows 8.1 was not built like Windows Mobile, so the idle behavior cannot be compared to ARM smartphones powered by Windows Mobile. In any case Core M is likely to be suitable for high performance phablets and smartphones in the next 12-24 months. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 10 will be a key point in all of this. A smartphone powered by a PC class SoC and Windows 10 would be exactly like having a low power PC inside your pocket. Windows 10 features Continuity: when you connect your smartphone to an external display and keyboard/mouse, the interface will switch to the classical desktop view with the chance to run virtually every classical windows application. This implies a high grade of productivity, quite unthinkable before (Motorola and Asus experiments were not successful). It will be possible to switch between various apps, notes and calculations, and when you are at home or in the office, you will be able to use it like a normal PC raising up productivity. It's possible that professional applications will have a sort of "module" that works exactly like a mobile app, with the advantage of being a fully integrated part of the classical windows application. In addition, Windows 10 is able to adapt itself to keep very low power consumption on low power and mobile devices. This means that Windows 10 is able to consume very low energy exactly like actual smartphones once it's equipped with optimized hardware. When this will be possible with Core M is only a matter of time. Real Sense is a technology mature enough to get into market: Skylake is the first CPU that will support this technology and it could be a game changer. With Intel Real Sense it's possible to make Windows login and payments by face recognition, use hand movements as a flexible input device, do 3D scans of the environment and so on. Intel Real Sense is so precise that it can recognize and make a distinction between twins without error and it's a Skylake exclusive feature at the moment. The new Vulkan APIs and DirectX 12 will permit decreased power consumption by lowering the header crowd on the CPU. This means, in simple terms, that the load on the CPU is better designed until the point that the GPU will work better and flawlessly resulting in overall reduced power consumption. Looking at preliminary benchmarks, it looks like Vulkan and DirectX 12 will permit a power optimization that previous reviews could not achieve at all. It's clear that Windows and Intel are going toward a mobile world where smartphones will become portable PCs able to do light work and entertainment. So, 2-in-1 devices, ultra-books and laptops will be able to powe rup instead when connected to external GPUs/stations through Thunderbolt 3.0. It's also likely that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will follow Microsoft even here after it has taken inspiration from the Surface Pro series to release the new iPad Pro (which still uses a pure mobile OS and not OSx which gives lower productivity). In 2014 the worldwide market saw 1.3 billion shipped smartphones and 229.6 million shipped tablets. Intel retains the second position in tablet SoC market share, but it's known that it achieved this by cash subsidies that generated losses for Intel itself. As for smartphone market share, Intel's presence is dramatically low. What can do Core M in such a scenario? In my opinion it will be able to attack the high end segment, the most profitable one. Core M will provide such a computational power and operative system flexibility not comparable to any other competitor's phablet. In this scenario, Samsung is even losing market share, first of all in the high-end segment. This Android market share loss would find the flexibility of Windows 10 as a better and more suitable option to iOS. In addition, more than one-third of shipped smartphones were phablets in 1Q 2015 which predicts a phablet market over 450M-plus in 2015 with an increasing trend for the next few years. If you take into account that high end smartphone share is around 30% of the global market, you will understand that Intel and Microsoft could generate massive revenues from this. achieve a 2,5% global market share made of high end devices achieve a net income of $33 per device (which is the actual Samsung net income per device that includes even mid and low end smartphones - it's a quite low profitability for high end market) ... Microsoft would be able to achieve 325 million high-end devices, $19.5 billion in revenue and $1.072 billion net income. This would imply a probable market evaluation of 30% at least, given the implied better outlook of the mobile market penetration. To add fuel to this, selling those devices would imply an increase in related service and software sales for additional revenues and profits. All of this is possible because the Android platform continues to lack "continuity" between smartphone, tablets, laptops and desktop devices. Android cannot provide a message center into Windows and a lot of Google features must go through Chrome and not through a native installation into Windows itself. Android users generally use Windows as the main laptop and desktop OS, so Microsoft may have the right points to attract the Android user base, pushing on Continuity. Keep in mind that $33 of net income for high-end devices alone would be quite low. In fact Intel is likely to provide more constrained Core M and Atom X7 (and future revisions like Goldmont) for those smaller smartphones and/or mid-high smartphones giving enough power to exploit Continuity very well. This would imply higher sales and additional profits, while $33 of profit per device would be more suitable for such a sales mix. Intel's scenario is somewhat similar. Intel has closed 2014 with heavy losses in mobile market and it's set to achieve profitability in 2016. It has achieved relative good sales in the smartphone market only thanks to the Zenphone 2 release. If Microsoft will be able to penetrate the high end market, Intel could increase the SoC sales about 30 million, remembering that Core M gives a lot higher profit than Atom. Somebody could argue that Atom X SoCs still have low power GPUs which cannot compete against high-end competitors SoCs. This is true only for now. Intel has a delay in implementing its generation of PC CPU features into the Atom series: Innovations released with Ivy Bridge in 4Q 2011 took seven quarters to be implemented into Atom Bay Trail (Silvermont) in 3Q 2013 while innovations released with Broadwell in 2Q 2014 took only two quarters to be implemented into Atom Cherry Trail (Airmont) in 4Q 2014. This is partially caused by the fact that Intel was already concentrating on Goldmont which will be released the next year and so they decided to spend less time on tweaking the latest Atom chip. In addition the actual Atom is equipped with an Intel Gen 8 HD Graphics which is still one-year-old. All of this delay will be depleted the next year with Goldmont architecture which will implement Skylake-refresh (Kaby Lake) features and an Intel Gen 9 HD Graphics revision, the probable same one on Kaby Lake. That will be the moment which will show the first and really competitive Intel offer for the entire smartphone sector. For a better understanding, think about what Intel managed to achieve with Broadwell-K series and Skylake-K series: With Broadwell i7 5775C (Inte Gen 8 HD Graphics - 48 EUs + eDRAM) CPU Intel has achieved in getting graphic performance equal to an ATI R7 250X with 1/6 of power consumption. With Skylake i7 6700K (Intel Gen 9 HD Graphics - 24 EUs) is able to get very close to i7 5775C even if it has half of EUs and no eDRAM. It's clear that the next year will be very interesting for Intel in the mobile market. That is why Intel must penetrate the high-end market because once Intel is well-established in that sector it will be able to exploit its name to make Atom Broxton (Goldmont) more compelling the next year: once you get the high end market, it becomes easier to penetrate lower markets. I would not be surprised if Intel will be able to push its own smartphone market share around 6-8% in the next two years given the scenario. This would mean around 120 million of SoCs based on 2015 IDC estimates. The same goes for the tablet sector which starts from a better starting point. Intel has already achieved a 17% market share in 2014. Given its Core M series which is becoming well known and powerful and given the upcoming Surface Pro 4, I wouldn't be surprised to see Intel gaining a market share around 25%-30% in the next two years, especially with Windows 10 spreading around. This would mean 60 million-plus SoCs based on 2015 IDC estimates. Remember IDC estimates that Windows tablets will face a five-year CAGR of 30% which is quite undervalued given Windows 10 success until now. In this scenario, adding 21 million SoCs would not be a problem. Since these two companies are tightly bounded in mobile market, if Windows 10 will continue to spread like it is doing now and if Intel will be able to release Core M at a lower TDP, their outlook is really good. So, I think that an upside of 50% in three years is quite possible and feasible. Microsoft has registered 1.5 million Windows 10 activations in the enterprise sector. Continuity will push hard for the creation of a flawless Windows ecosystem. Microsoft Windows 10 activations look good, 81 million right now. Intel continues to improve its own processors scalability. Intel has the highest world know-how in lithography. Intel will align Atom development levels to PC Core series the next year. Microsoft is bringing on universal apps. Microsoft and Intel analysts forecasts do not take into account the Intel-Microsoft synergy in the smartphone sector. Intel has high chances to see its revenues dramatically increase in the next years, most of all in the mobile sector, providing a great help to Microsoft's Lumia smartphones too. This argument could be reverted because at the same time it will be Microsoft which will help Intel by spreading Windows 10. Given that for Intel and Microsoft the biggest problem is the smartphone sector, the high chance of a possible dramatic market share increase of Windows in relation to Intel makes these two companies a good buy with great long-term potential.
