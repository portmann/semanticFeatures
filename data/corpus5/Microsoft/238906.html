ETF Hub Nov 17 2015, 16:43 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Wanting to get a larger portion of corporate IT security budgets that have seen healthy growth as companies react to a slew of major hacking incidents , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has launched an Enterprise Cybersecurity Group (ECG) promised to deliver "security solutions, expertise and services that empower organizations to modernize their IT platforms, securely move to the cloud, and keep data safe." Much like many other enterprise IT firms, Microsoft is looking to pair security software with human and cloud-based services (security appliance vendors also bundle hardware). ECG's offerings include security assessment, monitoring, threat-detection, and incident-response services. Meanwhile, a new Cyber Defense Operations Center will feature dedicated teams 24x7 to respond to security incidents, and is said to provide "direct access" to thousands of professionals within Microsoft for dealing with security threats. The software giant has also announced it's testing Azure Security Center, a Web-based console that works with third-party hardware and software to give IT admins an overview of their company's Azure security profile, and uses analytics to detect and respond to threats. Satya Nadella states such features could also be used for on-premise security, and to protect services running on third-party clouds. Microsoft exec Bret Arsenault: "Microsoft’s unique insights into the threat landscape, informed by trillions of signals from billions of sources, create an intelligent security graph that we use to inform how we protect all endpoints, better detect attacks and accelerate our response." In a blog post , he highlights the security tools provided via Windows 10, Office 365, Azure, and the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), and claims Microsoft spends over $1B/year on security R&D. In other Microsoft news, Bob Stutz, the exec in charge of the company's Dynamics CRM app business, is leaving the company. Re/code reports Stutz is joining Salesforce. Dynamics CRM R&D lead Jujhar Singh will replace Stutz.
