Immersion Sues Apple: Implications For The Samsung Relationship - Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) | Seeking Alpha Haptic feedback developer Immersion is suing Apple for infringing some of their foundational haptic feedback patents. The move doesn’t come completely unexpected as Immersion’s largest shareholder had suggested such action was necessary during the last conference call. The expiry of Samsung’s multi-year license at the end of 2015 also may have contributed to the timing of the lawsuit. We see the move both as offensive, as well as defensive. Immersion needs to take action to launch a signal to its existing and potential licensees: infringing won’t be allowed. We see a Samsung renewal now as more likely. Immersion’s action against Apple is certainly a move Samsung may only benefit from. Last week Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR ) announced that it had filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and AT&T Mobility LLC, as well as a patent infringement complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against the same parties. The lawsuit states that the haptic feedback systems of the Apple iPhone 6/6Plus, iPhone 6/6s Plus and Watch/Watch Sport/Watch Edition infringe upon two of IMMR patents, and the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus allegedly infringe upon a third patent. Apple's description of 3D touch , a picture which is also part of Immersion's patent infringement complaint in the U.S. District Court After announcing the lawsuit against Apple, Immersion held an investor conference call to resume the main reasons behind this move. During the call, Immersion's CEO, Vic Viegas, commented: Immersion is the leading innovator of haptic technology. For more than 20 years we have invented, designed, promoted and commercialized haptic feedback technologies that bring digital experiences to life. Through decades of research, development efforts and business activity, Immersion has built a far-reaching and deep worldwide portfolio of over 2,100 issued or pending patents, covering many of the foundational aspects and commercial applications of haptic technology. With these comments, it is quite obvious that Immersion is trying to distance itself from the so called "patent trolls" that often buy patents of relative value and try to enforce their rights against accused infringers far beyond the patent's actual value or contribution to the prior art. If we look at Immersion's history, we can almost consider it as a university spin off that benefited from government funding in addition to private sources to advance research in a new field: This case study describes how SBIR grants helped a young company develop a large intellectual property portfolio centered on adding the sense of touch to diverse computer applications. It illustrates how government funding can be used by a university spin-off to leverage funding from private sources to achieve faster growth, eventually essentially eliminating the need for government R&D support. The case also illustrates how a basic idea - adding the sense of touch to computer applications - can be used to enhance entertainment experiences, increase productivity of computer use, train doctors, and more. Immersion's technology was inspired by a NASA system, but its growth centers on its embodiment in consumer products. The case provides a number of suggestions for improving the SBIR program. Given Immersion's background, it should come as no surprise that management is describing its patent portfolio as foundational to haptic IP. For those interested, here is the description of the three patents that are part of Immersion's lawsuit : The '356 patent relates to haptic feedback in handheld electronic devices that have a touchscreen. The '356 patent teaches, among other things, systems and methods for providing tactile sensations, including displaying a graphical object on a touch-screen, receiving a sensor signal indicating an object contacting the touch-screen, determining an interaction between the object contacting the touch-screen and the graphical object, generating an actuator signal based at least in part on the interaction and haptic effect data in a lookup table, and outputting a haptic effect to an actuator based at least in part on the actuator signal. The '051 patent relates to haptic feedback in handheld electronic devices. The '051 patent teaches, among other things, systems and methods for generating haptic feedback, including storing a plurality of pre-defined haptic effects that are accessible to multiple applications via an application programming interface, receiving a request for a pre-defined haptic effect from an application, retrieving the requested effect via the application program interface, generating a drive signal based on the effect, and applying the drive signal to an actuator to provide a haptic effect. The '571 patent relates to haptic feedback in electronic devices. The '571 patent teaches, among other things, systems and methods of producing a haptic effect, including receiving first and second gestures signals, generating a dynamic interaction parameter using the signals, and applying a drive signal to a haptic output device according to the dynamic interaction parameter. We are no patent experts, but these descriptions seem to lay the case for the infringement of basic haptic effects, patented by Immersion, that are found in Apple products. In the lawsuit, Immersion is reminding the court that Apple should be aware of IMMR's patents, "including without limitation through Defendants' knowledge of Immersion, knowledge that many Apple competitors in the mobile space have licensed Immersion's patented technology, and Immersion's disclosure of its patents on its website." We would add to this list the fact that several patents recently filed by Apple in the haptic field reference previous Immersion's foundational patents. During Immersion's Q3 conference call, Immersion's largest shareholder , RIMA Senvest, urged the company to take action against Apple to defend its IP, as we underlined in a previous article: So, we're very, very upset with Apple's action that they seem set to introduce these products and not compensate you guys. And I'd love to see you guys go after them - get an injunction and have them stop shipping the iPhone 6s into the United States. We're just serious about this. I just want to say that we're right behind you, being your largest shareholder, and we're looking forward to our day in court here against Apple, who we believe has been stealing our technology. We were around when you guys sued and successfully won against Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and won hundreds of millions of dollars. And that was just for some features on video games. Now, we're talking about billions of products using haptics, from cell phones to tablets to laptops. So, our view is that your company - your technology today - it's worth at least $1 billion. And we - we're very disappointed that Apple's chosen to steal the technology rather than pay you for it. There are certainly several factors that contributed to Immersion's decision to proceed against Apple, including, as noticed, the strong input from prominent shareholders. However, we do not believe that Immersion is telling the complete story in their commentary about the timing of the lawsuit: As I've given some indication in the past, a strategy develops based on the products; the infringing acts; the status of the IP; developing a team. And so, we felt that it has come together. It's reached the point where we believe that the best course of action for us is to defend our IP in the ITC and in the District Court, and so we feel like it's - timing's right. We feel really good about the case, and we're excited to proceed vigorously. At the end of 2015, Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) multi-year license came to an end, and the two companies haven't come yet to an agreement to renew it. The lack of a timely renewal has been, in our opinion, the main reason behind Immersion's stock weakness since the start of 2016. At this stage, starting a lawsuit against Apple may certainly put additional, positive pressure on Immersion's efforts to renew with Samsung. IMMR's move shows both its willingness not to let any player infringe on its technology, but also direct attention to the criticism that may have been risen by some of its Android partners, including Samsung: "why should we be the only parties paying for a technology that is now clearly part of our main competitor's offering?" We believe that a renewal of the Samsung license is now more likely and that it might represent a short-term catalyst for the stock. While Samsung didn't succeed in getting a ban on the importation of select Apple products in 2013, the Korean company may now become a kind of "sponsor" of a similar effort by Immersion, just by renewing its license with the company. Immersion's position as the leading source of haptic IP would certainly be strengthened by a renewed agreement with the largest smartphone and tablet OEM. Given the costs most likely involved in the lawsuit, it's almost as if Samsung's revenues generated in one single year are "invested" against Apple: We'll be able to give you a lot more information around the cost and the timing in our February 25 earnings call as we provide guidance and assumptions around spending levels. If you look at prior litigation - although each litigation is unique in its own right - in the most recent action with Motorola and HTC, I believe we spent something in excess of $20 million. That would be spread over a number of years. Immersion hired a very well know legal team to Apple - the one that won a $234M jury verdict for WARF against Apple The choice of the lawyers hired by Immersion to proceed against Apple is quite interesting, and worth a note. Here's a partial list taken from the company's patent infringement complaint in the U.S. District Court (emphasis added): Irell & Manella are the same legal team that won a $234M jury verdict for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) against Apple : On October 16, 2015, a federal jury in the Western District of Wisconsin found that Apple Inc. owes Irell & Manella client, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), $234.2 million for patent infringement following a two-week trial. Irell also represented WARF in earlier litigation against Intel on the same patent, which resulted in a $110 million settlement shortly before trial in 2009. In addition, WARF filed another suit against Apple earlier in September 2015 alleging that new Apple products, including the iPhone 6S, also infringe the '752 patent. The WARF trial team includes Morgan Chu, Gary Frischling, Jason Sheasby, Alan Heinrich, Annita Zhong, Christopher Abernathy, Amy Proctor, Jackson Trugman and Tony Rowles. The home team includes Richard Birnholz, Rebecca Carson, Gavin Snyder and Grace Chen. Morgan Chu also was Immersion's lead attorney in their court case against Sony ( SNE ), that still remains the company's largest win against an infringer. A word of caution is necessary: the environment for monetizing patent rights is certainly different today, and more difficult, to what it was just a few years ago . Experts warn that defenders "fight longer and harder, because statistically they're more likely to win than they used to be." Apple has certainly the capacity and financial strength to defend vigorously in court. Nevertheless, as the WARF outcome shows, a strong patent portfolio may survive a court case and see the patent holder being recognized their rights, even against the largest US company. Immersion has a very good history when it comes to proving their IP in court, and the time had come for a "make or break" outcome of its haptic IP in the mobility sector. We expect a lot of volatility in the months to come, caused by the start of the legal action, the possibility/rumors of a settlement, and the ups and downs that are to be expected from court action, but also additional scrutiny from investors which may be attracted to the story by the impact caused by this lawsuit. It is little doubt that this move will represent another key moment in the history of the company, whose outcome may be binary. However, a settlement or a court win also could mean a completely different value attributed to IMMR, as by Richard Mashaal's comments we previously highlighted. In total, $1 billion would roughly translate into $35 per share, as opposed to Immersion's current stock value of $ 7.77. While we do not have this target price in the short term, we believe that a renewal of the Samsung license and the first positive news from the start of the court case against Apple may lead to a double from this level in the next few months.
