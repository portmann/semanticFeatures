Microsoft's Future On Line Starting July 29 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha The launch of Windows 10 on July 29 is Microsoft's D-Day. It dominates the desktop, but must get numbers comparable to iOS and Android to stay relevant. July 29 has been announced as the launch date for Windows 10. On that date users of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 will be able to download it, free, and after that date it will become the default operating system for all Microsoft PCs. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) began pushing users toward 10 when it ended all support for Windows XP , which first came out in 2001. But NetMarketshare shows 14.5% of PCs still run it. Some 91% of PCs going online currently run some version of Windows, according to NetMarketShare. But Windows 8.1 only overtook XP last December. Thus we have the Windows 10 challenge, which is to get folks who have been notoriously slow to upgrade to do so. If they can, then Microsoft and its software developers can begin releasing software as "apps," can march more users toward the cloud, and can generally make the operating system work more like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS. Contrast the Microsoft chart, showing Windows 7 with a dominant share, with that of Android , where 80% of users now have one of the two most recent versions of the software, KitKat or Jelly Bean. That is because phone companies and OEMs regularly push out updates to their devices. Once Microsoft delivers this experience, it can do more than patch security every week. It can upgrade user experiences seamlessly, deliver a level playing field for software developers, and compete against its two operating system rivals with a level playing field. It should also, then, be delivering the same experience to mobile users as desktop users. One move to encourage the update is the return of the old Start menu, the "tile" system of Windows 8 being as popular as New Coke. The tiles will still be around, but they will take the form of status updates , delivering news of incoming mail, social media updates and weather data. Windows 10 will also feature Cortana, the company's speech interface. While the first NetMarketShare chart showed Microsoft still has a dominant desktop position, Windows 10 is Microsoft's acknowledgement that it is, in fact, in the fight of its life, and looking up at both Android and iOS. Putting Windows on the same charts with the two mobile operating systems will offer an oranges-to-oranges comparison of the three companies, which will put their competition into better perspective. For Microsoft users, and stockholders then, July 29 is now D-Day. If it's thrown back from this beachhead, Satya Nadella's war for its survival may end in defeat.
