Why Microsoft Prefers Apple For Apps - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Ex-CEO Steve Ballmer has complained that Windows needs to be able to run Android apps. Porting Android apps to Windows would have been an unqualified disaster for the company. Microsoft appears to be shifting its focus to a much better strategy of giving iOS developers tools for easily creating Windows apps based on their iOS projects. At Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) recent annual shareholder meeting, the company's biggest shareholder, Steve Ballmer, also became its most vocal critic. One of Ballmer's widely reported criticisms is that the company's strategy of universal apps for Windows 10 "won't work" in his words. He claimed that Windows phones need to be able to run Android apps. But the company appears to have pulled the plug on its plan to port Android to Windows 10 in order to focus on a parallel effort to port Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS apps. It was at Microsoft's 2015 Build developer conference that the company unveiled several "software bridges" for bringing non-native apps into Windows 10. As nicely summarized in an article in Windows Central , the bridge for iOS was called Project Islandwood and the bridge for Android was called Project Astoria. The fact that Microsoft even needs to do this underscores the sorry state of the Windows Phone app store compared to its bigger Android and iOS rivals, as can be seen in this chart from Statista showing a number of apps as of July 2015: The announcements were meant to galvanize developers, but in the case of the Android bridge, Astoria, developers were displeased, according to the Windows Central article. The reason is that Android apps ran unchanged in an Android emulator, which Microsoft called a "security container." As implemented in early insider builds of Windows 10 Mobile, any user could load an Android app downloaded from the Web. There were concerns about piracy, monetization, security as well as the question of why bother developing for Windows at all. If Android apps could run unmodified in an emulator, there was really no point in developing Windows-specific versions. In fact, the promise of running unmodified Android apps in Windows was never fulfilled. As the Build conference demo made clear, developers were expected to substitute any services provided by Android OS, such as mapping and search, with the Windows equivalents. Now it appears that Astoria is on hold or perhaps dead in the water, according to Windows Central. The article cites three reasons: developer pushback, technical problems, and potential licensing issues with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). We're committed to offering developers many options to bring their apps to the Windows Platform, including bridges available now for Web and iOS, and soon Win32. The Astoria bridge is not ready yet, but other tools offer great options for developers. For example, the iOS bridge enables developers to write a native Windows Universal app. . . According to Windows Central, Microsoft has 80 people working on the Android bridge project vs. five for iOS. That's probably a fair measure of the relative technical difficulty. The approach for iOS apps is completely different. iOS apps are written in one of two high-level programming languages, Objective C and Swift. Developers who use Objective C can compile their code directly into a native Windows 10 app, which can then be monetized on the Windows app store. Microsoft's Objective C compiler supports most but not all of the iOS APIs. I haven't tried out the Islandwood tool, but at Build the demo of an iOS app running on a Win10 tablet worked, whereas the demo of an Android app on a Windows 10 phone did not. Probably there's plenty of work for the developer to do, but less than is required for the usual cross platform development. Windows 10 and Mac OS X and iOS apps are compiled, unlike Android. Compilation takes the programming language code and converts it into the binary instructions that a computer understands. Once the app is compiled, it's relatively straightforward for the operating system to feed those instructions into the processor. The basic similarities between the app architectures of Windows and iOS makes porting iOS apps much easier to do. Android has a completely different app architecture in which an Android Run Time (ART) takes high level Java and C++ code and converts it into the binary code the processor understands. Each Android app runs in its own instantiation of ART. If it sounds cumbersome, it is. Microsoft has probably realized there's no reason to offer developers bridges for both iOS and Android. Almost any app that Microsoft would want on its app store is already available for iOS. That means it's either already available for both iOS and Android, or iOS exclusively. A developer who has both iOS and Android versions doesn't need both tools to port to Windows, but only one. I doubt there are any developers who have apps for both platforms who would prefer to use the Android version as their vehicle to port to Windows 10. In addition to the technical hurdles of getting an Android Run Time to work in Windows, there's the licensing difficulty. Microsoft would have to license ART from Google. That means paying a royalty fee to Google for every copy of Windows with ART installed. Ouch. In the case of an iOS app, Microsoft is only dealing with the source code generated by the individual developer, so no license fee gets paid to Apple. If Microsoft decides to extend the bridge to include Swift, Swift is now open source . The recent open sourcing of Swift may not be a coincidence. Apple could very well be trying to do an end run around Google by nudging Microsoft into creating a Swift compiler for Windows as well. A port of Android to Windows 10 would have been an unqualified disaster. The Android-based apps would have been buggy, unreliable and fraught with security issues. There's every indication that Microsoft has dodged this particular bullet, and Microsoft investors can heave a sigh of relief. There have been signs lately of a growing rapprochement between Microsoft and Apple. There was the appearance of Microsoft's Kirk Konigsbauer to demo the iOS version of Office at Apple's September iPhone event. And Apple's open sourcing of Swift seems almost a plea to Microsoft to develop a Swift compiler for Windows. Investors in both companies should welcome these developments. Enabling easier cross platform development probably serves to increase the developer pool for both companies. Sure, the companies compete on multiple fronts, but their businesses are more complementary than not. Apple is stronger in smartphones and tablets, while Microsoft is stronger in traditional personal computers as well as enterprise services. And they both have a common enemy, or at least adversary, in Alphabet. Android has become the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and anything Apple and Microsoft can do to lessen the reach of that gorilla benefits both companies. Based on Microsoft's y/y revenue and earnings declines in the September quarter , I can't really recommend Microsoft as a buy. But Microsoft has fielded some good hardware in the latest Surface Pro and Surface Book. Co-opting iOS apps is a good strategy to beef up the Windows app store. Microsoft is at least a hold.
