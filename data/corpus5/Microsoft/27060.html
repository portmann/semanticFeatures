Google's Slow-Motion Strangulation - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google's growth continues to deteriorate, and it remains dependent on advertising. Governments around the world are on the warpath against it, but the company is increasingly self satisfied. While the S&P 500 is up 15% over the last year, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) shares have advanced just 2%. This is not a mirage, and it's not a short-term trend either. Google is becoming what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) became in the late 1990s - slow, bureaucratic, timid, and way too self-satisfied for its own good. The problem for Microsoft started with the Clinton Administration, which launched an anti-trust case against it in 1995. While the government lost its case, it saddled the company with a host of lawyers, analysts, and public relations people who found it was easier to say "no" to new ideas and milk the Windows-Office monopoly than to try something new. While the Obama Administration looks more kindly toward Google than the Clintons did Microsoft, this is not true in most of the world. The European Union is planning formal antitrust charges , Russia and China have kept out Google with their own versions, Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX ) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), and other governments around the world routinely seek to censor it in various ways. Google is a one-trick pony, built on Internet advertising, and the world is not going along with the trick anymore. Worse is the self-satisfaction coming out of the Googleplex, so reminiscent of when Microsoft ruled and "everyone" who was super-smart wanted to work there. Bragging about your job interview process or about how most employees are paid like they are stupid is arrogance personified. Bragging about the poor performance of your stock is arrogance to the nth degree. The fact is that Google's growth continues to slow and its margins continue to shrink. The deterioration has been slow - revenue growth falling from 21% to 18% over three years, and net income falling from over 25% of revenue three years ago to 21.8% last year. Just as Microsoft tried many things to get out of its Windows dependence, and eventually failed, so Google is proving unable to find new profit centers. Android is dominant but not profitable. The same is true for Chromecast and Chromebooks. Google Wallet has been trumped by Apple Pay, and threats to everyone in the space is not the same thing as taking share. If most CEOs were seeing deteriorating results, self-satisfaction at every hand and an inability to break out of the original niche, they'd be worried, and activists might be pounding on the door. A dual-share structure assures this cannot happen at Google. It's good to be the king, but only for the king. What all this tells me is that investors have been right in dismissing the stock, and that the ennui is set to continue indefinitely into the future. When a company you're invested in is no longer hungry, stop investing new money in it. I've cut my own Google stake in half recently, and I suspect it's only a matter of time before the other half goes, too. Why am I still in it at all? Because the next step here looks obvious - financial engineering in the form of dividends and buybacks to keep the stock price up. And I would like a taste of that.
