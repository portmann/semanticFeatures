(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor The 9.7" iPad Pro (also rumored) weighs less than 1 pound. Its oxide TFT display is said to be 25% brighter and have 25% greater color saturation than an iPad Air 2's, and to have the lowest reflectivity of any tablet. Meanwhile, its "True Tone" display measures the color temperature of ambient light and adjusts the screen in response. Like its 12.9" sibling, the 9.7" Pro sports Apple's ( AAPL -0.4%) A9X CPU and M9 motion co-processor. Its 12-core GPU is declared to be more powerful than the Xbox 360's. Other specs include a 12MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, four stereo speakers, and four metal finishes (inc. rose gold for the first time). 3D Touch apparently isn't supported. The Apple Pencil stylus and Smart Keyboard accessory are supported; 3D Touch apparently isn't. Looking to make more inroads with professionals and creative pros, Apple has unveiled SD card reader and USB camera adapter accessories for the Pro. As rumored, the 9.7" Pro starts at $599 (32GB Wi-Fi-only model). A 128GB model goes for $749, and a 256GB model will be available for $899. As with the iPhone SE, pre-orders start on March 24, and the device ships on March 31. The iPad Air 2's starting price has been cut by $100 to $399, and a 256GB ($1099) option has been added for the 12.9" Pro. the iPad Mini starts at $269, and the original iPad Air has been discontinued. 80% of active iOS devices run on iOS 9 (launched six months ago). 200M 9.7" iPads have been cumulatively sold, and over 1M iPad apps are now available in the App Store.

Earlier: Apple unveils 4" iPhone SE with $399 starting price, cuts Apple Watch's starting price to $299 Why is this even  breaking news, nothing is new at all. Heat maps are scoring 75, what a waste of feeds. Did anyone watch the stream?  What snoozefest, and I'm heavily vested and long AAPL.  It was embarrassingly light of anything exciting. AAPL and its hoopla. Just by varying size here and there they can't win now. They need to focus on expanding customer base by bringing price lowering products while maintaining quality. It seems that they sell the same product but call it different name.  Doesn't improve profits. WTH is wrong with AAPL?? With all that money and brains you'd expect them to come up with something NEW by now! The iPhone SE is going to put pressure on the competitors, looking for big volume especially from China. It comes at the right time as TSMC is ramping up rapidly on its Finfet process. No one else can do it except Samaung, but TSMC had capital spending of around US$10B a year over the past years to get ready for this. As to the new iPad pro, I am going to put my order in. The events need to go back to being events. Today's presentation could have been accomplished with a pre-taped demonstration or ad at the top of the Apple website. To everyone calling this event "Boring": Really?  What you fail to appreciate is all the work from engineers, programmers, architects, and business planners that goes into EVERY product release.  I'm sorry Apple didn't release their new car today.  Every updated product represents countless hours from many teams to come about.  Sure, none of the things releases were groundbreaking - but they are core items to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.  There is no reason to slam an event such as this one from any tech company.
