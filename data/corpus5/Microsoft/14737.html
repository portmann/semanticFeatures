Microsoft: The China Mobile-Backed Lenovo Windows 10 Smartphone Could Be A Future Tailwind - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 10 mobile initiative could get a significant boost from Lenovo’s support. China Mobile will offer the Lenovo Windows 10 smartphone to its subscribers. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) deal with Xiaomi is already very impressive. However, another very important development is that the world's top vendor of computers, Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ), has committed itself to deliver a Windows 10 smartphone in China this coming summer. Carrier support is very important to the success of any new phone and the first Lenovo Windows 10 will also come with the backing of China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ). A Xiaomi-branded Windows smartphone is great, but the backing of China's biggest carrier in China could also improve Windows phones' insignificant 0.8% share in that country. China is the world's largest market for smartphones. The Windows 10 mobile initiative will not be complete without a serious improvement in sales of Windows phones in the Middle Kingdom. If we use China Internet Watch's 122 million estimate of Q4 2014 smartphones sales in China, there were only around 970k units of Windows phones that got sold in China. This weak sales performance in China might be the reason why Microsoft is now aggressively focusing on rock-bottom Windows phone models like the $70 Lumia 430 . China, like other emerging markets, is dominated by sub-$100 Android phones. Engaging in a price war is an easy way to attract the attention of price-sensitive customers. However, while Microsoft can match the pricing war of any Android OEMs, dropping the Nokia branding makes it more difficult for Microsoft to win the attention of Chinese smartphone buyers. The Nokia brand still has lingering appeal in China. Microsoft, a brand never known for making bestselling phones, therefore needs the Xiaomi and Lenovo brands to improve its business in China. Windows phone is the sick man of China's smartphone industry. Xiaomi and Lenovo are the No.1 and No.3 smartphone brands in China. These two Samaritans could save and help Microsoft's Windows 10 get immediate connection with China's 520 million smartphone users. The no.4 vendor in China, Huawei, has made it clear that it is not going to come out with any new Windows phones. However, the chart above shows that Xiaomi and Lenovo have enough clout between them to possibly sell tens of millions of sub-$100 Windows 10 smartphones. Microsoft's eagerness to sell $70 Lumia phones is similar to what made Lenovo successful. Lenovo is also an enthusiastic vendor of sub-$80 smartphones . Likewise, Xiaomi is allegedly planning to release a $65 entry-level smartphone to cater to the stingiest of customers. Xiaomi's original 2015 budget phone was the RedMi 2 which currently sells for around $110 in China and India. Outside of Asia, the Lenovo brand is not as famous as Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) when it comes to smartphones. However, Lenovo has been the world's no.3 vendor of smartphones since 2011. Now that Lenovo owns the Motorola smartphone brand, there is a chance that a Motorola Windows 10 will also be released for the American/European markets. Lenovo's smartphone revenue is now 60% derived from outside China. The Motorola brand is also still strong with 10 million smartphones shipped out during Q4 2014. Motorola is another brand that could help Microsoft increase the global penetration of Windows phones. Winning the support of China's two most prolific smartphone vendors further affirms my long-term buy recommendation for MSFT. The combined might of Lenovo and Xiaomi could help Microsoft gain more market share in China's massive smartphone industry. China Mobile's support for the upcoming Lenovo Windows 10 handset is also very important. Microsoft's search and mobile advertising services requires Windows 10 mobile devices to be always online. Postpaid subscribers are highly desirable because they get free or cheap data allocation with their China Mobile Lenovo Windows 10 smartphones. Furthermore, I again reiterate my position that the smartphone/tablet industry is no longer just about profits over hardware sales. I understand that Microsoft's strategy of selling cheap smartphones is a necessary evil toward rapidly increasing the number of Windows mobile users. Contra revenue is a very sweet incentive to inspire more OEMs to make Windows 10 smartphones. Microsoft makes billions in easy money from licensing its patents to Android device makers so it can afford the contra revenue on mobile devices. Furthermore, making Windows phones might be more cost efficient for Lenovo and other OEMs because Microsoft will not charge them any patent or licensing fees. MSFT has consistently delivered excellent Cash Return on Invested Capital. It has produced an average of $90.76 for every $100 invested for the fast five years. Eleven other analysts at TipRanks also supports my Buy rating for MSFT. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
