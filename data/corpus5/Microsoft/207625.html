First Real Week Of S&P 500 Earnings, Revenue Growth Still An Issue | Seeking Alpha Oct. 18, 2015  9:53 AM ET  |  Includes: BXUB , BXUC , EPS , GE , IVV , LLSP , RSP , RWL , RYARX , SDS , SFLA , SH , SPLX , SPUU , SPXL , SPXS , SPXU , SPY , SSO , UPRO , VFINX , VOO by: Brian Gilmartin, CFA Here is the stat that jumped out after I went through the table manually, day-by-day this week: only 15 of the 74 companies beat the consensus revenue estimate. According to Thomson Reuters' "This Week in Earnings", only 43% beat consensus revenue estimates this week of the S&P 500 companies that reported. However, here is the other aspect to that statistic: GE (NYSE: GE ) missed big on revenue, reporting $26.5 billion in revenue versus the $28.6 billion consensus estimate, and the stock had a record day Friday, up 3.4% on the day on 4(x) average volume. Obviously, Nelson Peltz and Trian's activism is helping propel the stock. GE is acting just like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) did when ValueAct announced a 1% stake in Microsoft in April, 2013. Analysis/conclusion: Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) both beat consensus revenue estimates, whole Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) missed. Probably not a big surprise given the weakness in the stock and bond markets in the 3rd quarter, but it is nice to see some Financials starting to beat the consensus. Monday, 10/19: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) reports after the bell. Stock is trying to hold $150 or the Dec '14 low. Needs to hold right here, technically. (Long IBM) Tuesday, 10/20: United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ): two laggards. UTX is down from $120 to $92. (long UTX) Wednesday, 10/21: General Motors (NYSE: GM ). GM is expected to grow earnings in 2015, 55% (Yes, not kidding.) I wonder if the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), EV, tectonic shift in auto business weighing on Ford (NYSE: F ) and GM. (Long F, GM, TSLA) Thursday: 10/22: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ): Amazon is crushing Wal-Mart. Microsoft locked in trading range between $40 - $50 for 12 months. (Long AMZN. MSFT, WMT) Friday: 10/23: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ): wrong business model, i.e. higher-priced premium brands, with depressed economies in emerging markets. Not much going for PG. The S&P 500 needs to trade back over its 200-day moving average at 2,059. That is the first sign that the equity market is healing from the August '15 correction. I still think Q3 '15 earnings ex-Energy will be at least mid-single-digit y/y growth. The soft revenue growth is an issue. Hard to see a catalyst that changes this over near future. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) may have been the biggest surprise this week: beat on EPS and revenue, and reduced capex further. Stock up 2.8% on the week.
