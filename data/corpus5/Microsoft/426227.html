Intel's Retrenchment Is More Bad News For AMD - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Recent statements by Intel's executives indicate that INTC is firmly committed to the x86 architecture for PCs, Internet of Things, and Servers. At Computex 2016, Intel was able to show off processors far superior to anything AMD is currently shipping. Following Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q1 earnings, I wrote that the company had a fundamental choice between retrenchment and transformation. After recent presentations at Bernstein and Computex, it has become clear that Intel has chosen retrenchment: doubling down on x86 architecture to preserve its domination of the PC market, and leveraging this to make gains in the data center and Internet of Things. The wisdom of this course of action will long be debated, but one thing is clear: AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) x86 processors offer no hope for the company. Following CEO Brian Krzanich's presentation at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, SA contributor Bruce Burnworth wrote a very thoughtful piece in reaction. Burnworth, a long time Intel supporter, acknowledged getting out of the stock in the article, and talked frankly about the need to replace Krzanich. Burnworth realizes that Intel's fundamental problem is its failure in mobile, which he summarized this way: He ignored and did not mention the impact that smartphones have had on PC sales. Sure we need PCs to perform work, but there are many people that used to by a PC for non-work purposes that now rely on their smartphone for internet access, email and other non-work items. To me ignoring this impact on PC sales is like sticking your head in the sand. Krzanich's ability to ignore or rationalize unpleasant facts is only one of the many issues I've had with his regime. Beginning in 2014 with Intel's contra revenue subsidies of its tablet processors, Krzanich claimed repeatedly that this was to defray "chipset costs." He made this claim despite the fact that the mobile systems on chips (SOCs) from the true industry leaders such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) had already dispensed with the need for a "chipset" in the form of processor combined with an auxiliary IO controller or South Bridge. Intel's subsequent withdrawal of contra revenue this year and the collapse of tablet processor sales, combined with the failure to get any market traction with its smartphone (SoFIA, Atom X3) processors, led to the decision to pull the plug on mobile. As painful as the decision must have been, this was a commendable facing of reality for Intel. Although it came as a shock to Intel's supporters, I saw reason for some optimism. INTC installing a Qualcomm alumnus, Murthy Renduchintala, to oversee Client Computing and IoT, as well as review Intel products, suggested that a major change in direction could be ahead. With benefit of hindsight, it appears that Murthy's main impact has been pulling the plug on mobile processors, even as Intel focuses renewed efforts on its modems and on 5G. It could be argued that the decision to discontinue the Atom X series mobile processors is merely a retreat. But in the mean time, the lack of mobile presence represents a huge hole in Intel's strategy. Based on the Bernstein presentation, as well as Intel's presentations at this year's Computex in Taipei, it's almost certain that INTC will not embark on a major change of processor architecture, such as jumping to ARM architecture. Well, there was only a very remote chance of that happening, even with Murthy's influence. Intel has simply chosen the well-worn path of so many large tech companies that become incapable of disrupting themselves. The logic of this is inescapable if near-term financial results are the primary driver. Intel has a huge investment in x86 in the design expertise of its engineering staff, its intellectual property, and the installed base of customers and users. Given a near-monopoly position in x86, and the fact of a still very profitable business, not many American corporations could turn aside from this. Not many would chase an uncertain future in ARM architecture, no matter how bright that future might appear. Computex presented the world with Intel's "new" vision for the PC. We were greeted with the spectacle of Navin Shenoy, Intel's new head of Client Computing, declaring the company's "unwavering commitment" to the PC. This might be open to interpretation, but I basically translate that as Intel's unwavering commitment to the x86 PC. There is a logic to that commitment, which has been reasonably articulated by various Intel executives such as Krzanich, Shenoy, and Diane Bryant, head of Data Center Group. Intel can leverage its existing and continuing investment in x86 to foster growth in the key areas of the data center and IoT. Whether that growth is really there is another subject for debate, but clearly Intel doesn't have the stomach for the alternative. If Intel were to announce that it would suddenly start designing ARM processors for 2-in-1s and servers, this would send a tremendously disruptive message to its existing customers. The loss in x86 business would in no way be adequately compensated by new ARM processor business. The contrast between the presentations of Intel and AMD at Computex couldn't have been more stark. The only new processor that AMD could show at Computex (that's actually shipping in the near term) was the Carrizo derived Bristol Ridge. It's totally non-competitive with Intel's current Skylake, and will drop further behind when Intel rolls out its Apollo Lake processors later this year. The current gap in processor technology is very visible in the products. While Intel could show off ultra-light 2-in-1s that are 10 mm thin and don't require a fan, AMD could only show clunky, old-style, notebooks for Bristol Ridge. The 2-in-1 segment, led by the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro and various knock-offs, is growing at double-digit rates, according to Intel . AMD has nothing to offer in this class. And Zen isn't going to save the day for AMD. It will first be offered to the part of the PC market in steady decline, the desktop. Following that, AMD indicated that it will hurl Zen at the server market in a classic Hail Mary. Given how determined Intel is to hold onto the x86 franchise, and build on it for growth in the cloud, I don't see INTC giving AMD a shot with Zen. We still don't know how well Zen will perform, but it almost doesn't matter. Intel has shown that it will compete on price if that is required to meet its business objectives. Whether on price, performance, or both, Intel will shut AMD out of the server market, because it must. Intel won't have to compete with AMD long on price, because in 2017 INTC rolls out its 10 nm process, and the performance bar gets reset all over again. Intel's strategy on x86 is a "last man standing" strategy. Intel doesn't need to worry about keeping AMD around to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Intel can point to the growth of competition from ARM processors in mobile devices, IoT, and even the data center as proof that it has enough competition on its hands without AMD. Intel knows AMD has to be put down for good. With any luck, Intel can pick up Radeon for pocket change, giving it an ability to build competitive graphics into its SOCs. If AMD somehow survives, it won't be by making money on x86 processors. Intel has been able to grow or at least maintain PC revenue and profit at AMD's expense despite the overall decline in the PC market. Intel is going to keep doing what works. It's a strategy that has downside in the long term (5-10 years) since it doesn't address the threat posed by ARM processors to its core business. In the near term, Intel can grow incrementally by driving AMD out of the x86 business. This is probably the only growth path available to Intel, so I don't see the company foregoing it. With near-term growth available, Intel remains a hold in my view. AMD remains a short since the market clearly doesn't see what's in store for AMD. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, QCOM.
