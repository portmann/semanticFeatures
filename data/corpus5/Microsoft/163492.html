Apple: Will iPhone Market Share Decline In The Long Term? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IDC has projected a decline in market share for iPhone over the next four years. Such projections tend to assume a continuation of the status quo. There is some data that indicates that as smartphone markets mature, Apple gains market share. IDC has projected Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) smartphone market share to decline by 2019. I believe recent trends in the U.S. and China indicate that Apple's long-term prospects are for market share gains. As markets mature and their consumers become more discriminating, the tendency is for Apple to gain market share. IDC's rationale for their projection is that emerging markets such as India and Latin America will fuel growth in the smartphone market to 2019. Here's IDC's projection : IDC could be right about this, but IDC has some history with regard to predictions that the reader may be unaware of. Through the wonders of the Internet, we can time travel back to September 2010 to discover IDC's projection for 2014: You won't find this embarrassment on IDC's site anymore. I had to dig it up from another site that published the data five years ago. It's kind of an interesting, alternate reality view of the current market, isn't it? Sort of The Man in the High Castle of smartphone market predictions. IDC's 2010 prediction demonstrates the pitfalls of making quantitative predictions so far into the future. There's a natural tendency to linearly extrapolate the current data as well as impose one's own prejudices. For instance, when you look back at IDC's projections, Windows is always gaining market share. Some things never change. Should the trends of 2010 have been really so difficult to spot? It's debatable, but here's a summary of 2010 courtesy Gartner Research: I think the table above makes the trends fairly clear. Android and iOS are growing explosively in terms of y/y unit sales gains. Symbian and RIM are gaining y/y, but losing market share. Microsoft is losing both market share and in y/y unit shipments. Based on the above table, it appears that at least IDC is paying closer attention to their own data. Their 2019 projection is at least a reasonable extrapolation from the current situation. However, I believe that there's additional data that suggests that the simple extrapolation is missing the larger trend. Here, the key factor to consider is how Apple performs in markets as they become mature. Mature markets are saturated. Consumers all have smartphones, and sales are driven by replacement rather than first time purchases. Mature markets consist of smartphone consumers that are more educated, experienced and discriminating with respect to their purchase decisions. As markets mature, Apple's iPhone makes gains. This can be seen in the current situation in China. As I discussed recently , Apple grew unit shipments by 68% y/y in the June quarter. According to Kantar WorldPanel data , Apple's market share has been trending up, as the chart below shows: As of the June quarter, Apple had gained 7.3 percentage points of market share y/y. China continues to worry many Apple investors both from a macro economic effect and in terms of Apple's competitive position relative to other smartphone vendors. I've addressed the macro situation in a previous article , in which I pointed out that the data that's available through the June quarter doesn't suggest China is heading into a recession. However, Chinese markets are still nervous and many don't believe the data coming from the Chinese government. It's certainly possible that a recession could hurt Apple more than lower tier vendors. While I understand the concerns, I tend to run with the best data I have available, and that comes from CEO Tim Cook, who sent this message to CNBC's Jim Cramer : I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last two weeks. While I can't disprove a theory that says Apple's sales in China are about to fall off a cliff, a data driven approach mandates waiting for the data from at least the September quarter. If we look at the most mature smartphone market in the world, the U.S., the indicators also are encouraging. c omScore provides what they call "market share" data for the U.S. Here, I have to point out that comScore is using the term loosely. A distinction has to be made between percentage of sales for a given quarter, what I call market share, and percentage of users for a given quarter, what I call usage share. What comScore reports is really usage share in the U.S. What comScore's data shows is that usage share in the U.S. for iOS has been steadily increasing for over a year: The changes in percentage terms are not great because the pool of users is quite large. For instance, in comScore's most recent report for July, there were 192.4 million smartphone users in the U.S. I believe there is some data that shows that as smartphone markets mature, there's a tendency to swing to Apple, thus increasing Apple's market share. I believe this is due to the inherent superiority of Apple's iPhone. I know there are many who don't accept this. They either think that the quality difference doesn't exist, or that it doesn't matter. This continues to be one of the principal irreconcilable differences between Apple bears and bulls. Even believing as I do, it's hard to take issue with IDC's forecast. This is mainly due to the fact that new emerging markets will have to mature before Apple starts to gain significant market share in them. That process will have to run its course, but probably will take the next four years. So IDC may be right projecting continued market share decline by iOS to 2019, and investors may need to look beyond 2019 for market share gains. However, Apple's current growth in China may not be adequately accounted for in IDC's data. Once again, IDC's view may be that recent gains in China by Apple are due to a "novelty" effect that is assumed to taper off, with which I disagree. Or they may view the macro economic forces or competitive environment in China as serious headwinds going forward. At this point, I can't disprove the view that China presents headwinds for Apple, but I consider the proof (or disproof) to be imminent. When Apple's September quarter earnings come out, we should have a very good calibration of Apple's sales growth in China as well as the impact of the overall macro environment there.
