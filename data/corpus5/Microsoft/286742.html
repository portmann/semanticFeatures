Microsoft Is On The Brink Of Something Amazing - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. In the last couple of years, the augmented reality market has gained traction as more tech companies became actively engaged in the field. Last year, Microsoft introduced an AR headset called HoloLens. The consumer version will arrive only in 2020, but the developer kit will be available this year. The market for AR technology will grow from $300M to $3.6B in 2018. This presents an opportunity for Microsoft to seize a big chunk of this fast-growing industry. Last year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) announced its Windows Holographic platform, the purpose of which is to create applications that incorporate live presentations of physical real-world elements with virtual elements such that the user perceives them as existing together in a shared environment. The platform itself is set to be introduced through the smart glasses headset of Microsoft HoloLens as a part of campaign to promote Windows 10 OS. In the last couple of years, the augmented reality market gained traction as more and more big-tech companies become actively engaged in the field. For example, in October 2014, Magic Leap, a startup company that uses an augmented reality technology to disrupt different activities of our everyday life like entertainment, communication, education, etc., raised $542M in Series B funding led by Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Then, in this year's Consumer Electronic Show, DAQRI presented its headset, which has the ability to overlay schematics and blueprints in the user's field of view. Other companies also made interesting announcements on the show. This shows that Microsoft is going in the right direction with its AR technology and the release of the HoloLens in the near-future will make the tech giant one of the pioneers of this newly created market. The technology behind HoloLens is difficult to create but easy to explain. The device itself looks similar to virtual reality headsets but it works in a completely different way. The device runs on Windows 10, and when you use it, it overlays computer generated images onto what you can normally see, like on this picture: It has an energy-efficient depth camera with a 120°×120° angle of view, high definition photographic camera, a powerful GPU and CPU, and a custom co-processor created by Microsoft. It also has a number of basic applications like Skype for communication or HoloStudio for 3D modeling and a few games developed by Microsoft Studios. According to the company's CEO Satya Nadella, the consumer version will arrive only in 2020, but the developer kit will be available this year. To promote the product, Microsoft will take it on a tour to the cities of North America, UK and other developed countries. As for the price, the development version is expected to be $3,000 apiece. The price may seem too high at first, but the whole Microsoft ecosystem will compensate that. Considering the fact that the augmented reality market is relatively new, for many people HoloLens will be the only option to try. As for the technology itself, it has a lot of applications apart from the traditional entertainment industry, and the demand for it will only continue to grow. According to CSS Insight, the market for AR technology will grow from $300 million to $3.6 billion in 2018: By looking at this year's Consumer Electronic Show, it's apparent that the field has a lot of upside potential. As for Microsoft, it already established a strong presence in the industry, presumably in the entertainment industry with its Halo 5: Guardians gameplay with the help of HoloLens. Now it's up to the first users to test the device when it comes out this year. Thanks to Microsoft's reach and the sophisticated ecosystem infrastructure, it's likely that the company will take an even bigger chunk of the augmented reality market in the future as the competition is only starting out in this field.
