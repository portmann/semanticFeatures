Barron's: Microsoft's cloud transition could lead to 50% gain in 3 years - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jul 26 2015, 16:30 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Adobe's success in migrating its on-premise software base to cloud subscriptions - and the higher multiples afforded the company in response - could be a sign of things to come for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), argues Barron's in a bullish column that follows the software giant's FQ4 report and related selloff. Adobe, like Microsoft, was prodded to aggressively embrace cloud subscriptions by activist ValueAct Capital. Barron's adds Microsoft has a 2.7% dividend yield and trades at less than 16x trailing free cash flow vs. an S&P 500 average of more than 20. "A rise to $55 a share over the next year would leave Microsoft at 18 times trailing free cash flow, about where consumer staple heavyweight General Mills trades now." Of note: A shift to cloud subscriptions leads near-term earnings to be depressed relative to free cash flow, since subscription revenue is recognized just a quarter at a time (unlike up-front license payments). The paper also downplays concerns about weak Windows/PC sales, citing an RBC estimate that Windows now accounts for only ~10% of Microsoft's value. It gives a thumbs-up to Microsoft's Apple-like decision to make Windows 10 (due in 3 days) a free upgrade for Win. 7/8 PCs, and to deliver more frequent updates .
