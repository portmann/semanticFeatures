Why Apple Is A Threat To Fitbit - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha I provided four reasons last week to sell or avoid FIT. Since then, IDC has released new research related to the wearables market. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) has sold 20.8 million devices since its inception in 2007. This includes 10.9 million last year and 1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014. While that's very impressive for a company so young, it's nothing more than a starting point for a company like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) that reportedly sold 2.8 million Apple Watch units in its first two months, a company that has unlimited resources and the world's most advanced ecosystem. Given the rate at which the Apple Watch is expected to penetrate the wearables market, and the high expectations surrounding Fitbit, investors really should take everything that Fitbit has done to this point with a grain of salt, and be very skeptical of its stock long-term. With that said, IDC expects Apple to ship 21 million Apple Watches this year, a number that Apple would achieve in less than 12 months. This would represent remarkable penetration into the wearables market, one that IDC expects to ship a total of 72.1 million devices. That 72.1 million shipments is the combination of basic and smart wearables. The former consists of devices like Fitbit. IDC defines smart wearables as anything worn that's capable of running third-party apps. The smart wearables market is expected to grow at a compound annualized rate of 84% through 2019, and IDC expects that Apple will maintain a market share north of 60% from 2015 on. Up until this point, basic wearable devices and fitness bands like Fitbit and Xiaomi have dominated the wearable market, but smart technology from the likes of Apple, Google, and Microsoft present a new challenge that Fitbit and company have yet to encounter. Last year, basic wearables accounted for nearly 84% of the entire wearables market according to IDC. This year that number will be 54% until smart wearables are highly penetrated into the wearables market. Personally, I expect the transition to occur much faster than that, and for Apple to be a big reason why. That said, many investors who are buying into Fitbit's prospects seem to buy the into the idea that it and Apple Watch are in two different markets. However, as I explained in my last article , consumers who want low-end services can use cheap fitness apps on any smart wearable device. In other words, now that the technology is present for smart wearable devices, and from Apple, I thoroughly anticipate that consumers will be deciding between Apple and fitness apps and then Fitbit, not buying one to complement the other. Also as explained in my last article, the rapid growth of Fitbit's GPS enabled wearable suggests that consumers want more from a wearable than single functions. Up until this point, Fitbit has grown without a competitive threat like Apple, but given the fact that Apple will produce as many unit Watch sales in its first year as Fitbit has in the last seven years suggest to me that Fitbit will experience an effect of Apple being in the wearables industry, regardless if it's basic or smart wearables. In many ways, Fitbit's current growth momentum and Apple's superior product brings back memories of BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ). Back when the iPhone was first introduced many thought that BlackBerry and Apple weren't direct competitors, one for work and the other for play, but Apple's superior software and multi-function capabilities quickly begun to have an effect on BlackBerry's hardware sales. I think the same effect could be seen with Fitbit. Right now, Fitbit is the king of the wearables mountain, selling 10.9 million units in an industry that sold just 26.4 million last year. While 10.9 million units may be a sustainable number for Fitbit, it's going to be difficult for the company to ship 20 million units when Apple is new to the industry and is on pace to sell 21 million devices itself. Combined, that would be a substantial share of the 72.1 million total shipments expected in the wearables market this year, and leaves little room for Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ) to make their mark. All things considered, it's Apple's history of penetrating markets, causing turmoil for past leaders in those markets, and the high expectations for 21 million Watch shipments that I see as problematic for Fitbit. When you incorporate Fitbit's enormous post-IPO stock gains, thereby pricing in high expectations, the opportunity to disappoint is rather high. While research firms like IDC, many investors, and apparently Wall Street all think that Fitbit is safe from the Apple Watch thanks to its basic label in the wearables market, be sure to remember what Apple did to competitors in other industries where it wasn't an obvious threat. It's this premise that seems to have been forgotten. Investors must remember how iTunes disrupted the music industry, how the iPod eliminated CD players and MP3 players, how the iPhone crushed BlackBerry and cell phones, and how the tablet disrupted the PC and laptop industry. These were all instances of smart versus basic, and as you can see, Apple more than penetrated each market to cause a real nightmare for the companies that became its competitors. I expect that Fitbit will be next on its list, and no different from all those other examples. Source: Why Apple Is A Threat To Fitbit Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
