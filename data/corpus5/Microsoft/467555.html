Sell Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Rumors surfaced that Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) would have needed to raise its bid to win LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). This excuses Microsoft from the massive premium it is paying, albeit not by much. Investors do not seem to mind, either. The company's fourth quarter results boosted shareholder confidence. This optimistic view looks misguided. If there's one good point about Microsoft buying LinkedIn, it is LinkedIn ending the plug-in that allowed for joining LinkedIn data with contact records in the Salesforce CRM software. This feature addition gives Microsoft's own CRM product an edge. Unfortunately, much of the $26.2 billion cost Microsoft is paying will likely end up as a goodwill write-down. History is a good guide. The company wrote off $7.6 billion for the phone division. aQuantive became a $6.2 billion write-off. In a few years' time, expect Microsoft correcting its current overestimation on the value of LinkedIn users. This will mean a goodwill write-off from the acquisition. Microsoft rallied by over five percent on July 19 after beating non-GAAP consensus estimates. Non-GAAP add-backs netted a 77 percent addition to the company's reported EPS of $0.69 per share. With impairment, integration and restructuring expenses ($900 million) and net impact from Windows 10 deferrals ($1.5 billion) included, Microsoft's GAAP earnings were $0.39 a share. The company also applied a 7 percent tax rate on GAAP earnings, compared to 15 percent on non-GAAP. Microsoft's Azure cloud services business grew by 102 percent but server products and cloud services revenue grew by just five percent, or $253 million. Intelligent cloud income fell 17 percent to $443 million. Higher research and development costs added to the 22 percent increase in expenses. Microsoft highlighted 50 million monthly active devices on iOS and Android using Office 365. The four-fold increase over last year is a bright spot compared to the company's phone division. Microsoft wrote down $200 million in hardware inventory. While Phone revenue fell 71 percent, the company gave no hint to its strategy in growing its market share in the smartphone space. The company only acknowledged revenue fell due to lower volume in phones sold. Microsoft will clearly focus its efforts on mobile software applications instead of hardware. Skype, which Microsoft bought for $8.5 billion in 2013, faces an uncertain future. If it fails to clear end-user confusion over the release of incompatible Skype and Skype for Business soon, Microsoft may lose users. Microsoft trades at 26.9x price / EPS and an EV / LTM EBITDA of 13.2 times. By comparison, Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL ) EV/LTM EBITDA is 10.4x while Salesforce.com's is 51.7 times. The sector average, which includes VMWare (NYSE: VMW ) and RedHat (NYSE: RHT ), is 12.4 times. By applying an average EV/LTM EBITDA of 13.2 times, Microsoft is worth $53.68, a 5 percent downside to the $56.57 closing price on July 22: Shareholders are banking on continued revenue growth as users move from the desktop to the cloud. This is a valid assumption since desktop PC sales are falling but mobile device are going up. Still, Microsoft's overpayment of LinkedIn and a half-hearted effort in the mobile device market is a concern. Investors should consider taking some profits off the table.
