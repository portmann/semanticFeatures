ETF Hub Apr 23 2015, 18:57 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Continuing its habit of guiding cautiously, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has guided (.ppt) on its FQ3 CC for its various business units to have FQ4 revenue of $21.6B-$22.3B, below a $22.7B consensus. Corporate/other revenue (-$20M in FQ3, $314M in FQ2) isn't included in the forecast. Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on FQ4 revenue growth, up from 3% in FQ3. The unearned revenue balance ($20.2B at the end of FQ3, +4% Y/Y) is expected to rise Q/Q, in-line with seasonality save for forex. In its earnings slides (.ppt), Microsoft notes Office consumer revenue fell 41% Y/Y. 27% of the decline is attributed to the transition to Office 365 subscriptions from up-front licenses, and the rest to weak Japanese sales (they were strong a year ago ahead of a tax hike). "Windows Phone" revenue (includes Android royalties) fell 19% thanks to a mix shift towards low-royalty phones. Xbox platform revenue fell 24% due to lower Xbox One sales and a mix shift towards cheaper models. Lumia phone sales (8.6M) were up 18% Y/Y; 24.7M non-Lumia phones were sold (down Y/Y). Premium versions of Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server were a strong point: Their collective sales rose 25% ahead of the July end of Windows Server 2003 support. Microsoft also reports Azure compute usage more than doubled (Azure revenue isn't broken out), and that enterprise mobility (EMM) customers rose over 70% to more than 13K; Microsoft launched an EMM suite last May.
