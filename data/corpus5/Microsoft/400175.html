Amazon: Internet Of Things Play - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Many companies see the Internet of Things as their last shot at making a splash. Devices are nice, but the analysis of Internet of Things data will be in the cloud. For all the excitement concerning "Internet of Things" plays like Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) in the consumer space, or even General Electric (NYSE: GE ) in the industrial space, the IoT action is in the cloud. Clouds will analyze all the data, and deliver actionable insights based upon it. Cloud applications are also updated centrally, which is essential to bug fixes on client devices. Cloud is where the intelligence for IoT solutions is going to lie. This is why Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) buying a small Italian outfit called Solair is significant. Solair works in the business space, on things like production lines and distribution channels. Solair also puts Microsoft on a collision course with GE itself, making a separation of the two companies in the health space essential. Caradigm was the last vestige of Microsoft's efforts to get into health IT. GE, which made the scanners and other "heavy industrial" health gear hospitals buy all the time, turned out to be a much better fit, although the venture's market share remains low. Right now the IoT is in a stage similar to health IT a decade ago, with lots of companies who lost in the mainstream piling in and figuring this gives them another chance. Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) is back by buying Withings , a French health-tracking watch. Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) is re-arranging its deck chairs to get busy in it. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) call it a top priority . But the Internet of Things will be less about the sensors, less about the things, and more about the software and applications that make use of the data. That will all be done in clouds. And this is what makes Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), even now, the most undervalued stock in the market. Amazon doesn't just dominate the cloud market. It dominates the Infrastructure piece of the cloud market. Microsoft and other companies may claim big market share by combining platform and software application revenues under cloud in order to assert market share, but most of the start-ups that are rushing into the space are doing it based on Amazon infrastructure, giving that company the opportunity to pick up what works, and to quickly learn what does not work. Whether you define the Internet of Things first as an industrial or consumer opportunity, you need the lowest possible costs for the data analysis, and that means doing business with Amazon. This is going to be the primary demand driver for cloud capacity, and it's why analysts are now talking about Amazon not in terms of billions of dollars in value, but trillions.
