Microsoft teams with SAP on high-speed cloud databases, Office 365 integration - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha May 17 2016, 13:19 ET | About: Microsoft C... (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor As part of its latest move to make nice with a rival, Microsoft ( MSFT -2.1%) is partnering with enterprise software giant SAP ( SAP -0.8%) to support the use of SAP's popular Hana in-memory database - it's often used for performance-intensive analytics and transaction-processing work, and competes with the in-memory features of Microsoft's SQL Server database - on Azure's cloud infrastructure. A single Hana instance on Azure will support up to 3TB of RAM, with 32TB supported over 16 instances. SAP already supports Hana on Amazon Web Services, as well as through its own cloud platform. Also: The companies have partnered to integrate several SAP product lines - its Ariba procurement/B2B software, Concur travel/expense management software, SuccessFactors HR software, and Fieldglass labor-management software - with Office 365. And Microsoft's Intune mobile device management (MDM) software will be able to manage apps from third-party developers that rely on SAP's Hana Cloud Platform (lets developers build cloud apps running on top of Hana). Separately, SAP has updated Hana to include graph data processing and capture & replay support. The former helps companies better understand and visualize patterns involving people, places, and things, and the latter helps IT workers evaluate and assess the impact of changes made to Hana workloads. The Microsoft alliance follows a partnership with Apple through which SAP will (among other things) help enable third-party iOS apps that can leverage the Hana Cloud Platform. SAP is hosting its annual Sapphire Now conference this week. There is NOTHING simple about running a business with SAP - other than it's simply a lot more expensive than the customer ever expected it to be!
