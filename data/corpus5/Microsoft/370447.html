Is Vuzix About To Do A Deal With Samsung? - Vuzix Corp (NASDAQ:VUZI) | Seeking Alpha A potential deal surrounding Vuzix waveguide technology began to take shape over the past several weeks. Surprisingly over the last week I received confirmation that a Korean based OEM was in the Rochester, NY area evaluating waveguides. I have reason to believe Vuzix (NASDAQ: VUZI ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) are on the verge of consummating an augmented reality supply deal for holographic waveguides that will be produced by Vuzix. A potential deal surrounding Vuzix waveguide technology began to take shape over the past several weeks. Since the beginning of 2016 I have heard various and seemingly continuous Vuzix chatter related to a possible Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) buyout as well as a potential OEM deal with an unnamed company. At the end of the day I donâ€™t expect a buyout from Intel at these price levels, but I am leaving the door open for another strategic investment from Intel at a much higher price level to fund the initial commercial waveguide rollout. However, much to the dismay of investors there has no updates provided by Vuzixâ€™s management team and the chatter began to dissipate. Surprisingly over the last week I received confirmation that a Korean based OEM was in the Rochester, NY area evaluating waveguides. As many of you know Vuzix is based in Rochester, NY and moved into a new 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility during the fall of 2015. CES 2016 came and went in January without the fanfare that was expected to arrive when Vuzix showed off the companyâ€™s waveguides to the public for the very first time. Instead of demonstrating the waveguides to the public Vuzix CEO Paul Travers decided to demo working prototypes of the companyâ€™s waveguides behind closed doors to interested third parties. Paul Travers confirmed during a recent interview that the company showed working prototypes of the companyâ€™s waveguides behind closed doors to various interested third parties, so this indeed is not speculation on my part and is indeed a fact. Vuzix filed an S-3 in early February, which I believe provided Vuzix with financial leverage and is a precursor for another round of strategic investment from Intel or Vuzixâ€™s first OEM partner. I will make the case in this article is Vuzixâ€™s first OEM partner will be Samsung Electronics based in South Korea based on Samsungâ€™s internal waveguide presentations, patent filings as well as a recent 3 day trip to Rochester, NY by a Korean based OEM. During the Q3 conference call Vuzixâ€™s management team indicated the companyâ€™s intent to have waveguides inside of Vuzix products as well as various OEM partners in 2016 and the future. The real question is how close is Vuzix to landing the companyâ€™s first OEM partner and which OEM will have the first dance? It will be operational soon and will be capable of producing millions of waveguides annually for not only Vuzixâ€™s products but also the various OEM partners that we anticipate it may go in through 2016 in the future. (Paul Travers Vuzix CEO during the Q3 CC ) The Wall Street journal published Intelâ€™s augmented reality story last Wednesday. I was disappointed that Vuzix was not named in the article after my extensive discussion surrounding Vuzixâ€™s IP and products with Don Clark of the Wall Street Journal. However, I was pleasantly surprised that Intel is moving forward with an augmented reality device. According to the article Intel will likely offer the headset design to other manufacturers rather than market its own model to end-users. One person briefed on Intelâ€™s headset plans said Intel is collaborating with Microsoft for the project. The real question at this point is how will Intelâ€™s decision to move forward with an augmented reality device impact Vuzix? First off, I think it is important to understand why Intel invested $24.8m in Vuzix to begin with. Intel invested in Vuzix to put â€œIntel insideâ€? Vuzixâ€™s products, but the real reason why Intel invested in Vuzix was to advance the waveguide manufacturing process and to leverage augmented reality OEM partners. Intel is in a unique position to open doors for Vuzixâ€™s waveguide technology as well as insuring that Intel chips make it inside as many augmented reality hardware devices as humanly possible. A fair question everyone might have is what does Intel know about making waveguides? My honest answer is that I have no idea what Intel knows about making waveguides, but I can say Intel has some of the most innovative and advanced silicon technology in the world. I can also tell you that a key ingredient to deliver surface relief grating (NYSE: SRG ) waveguides is using silicon wafer tools. According to Vuzixâ€™s Q4 2014 conference call Intel is helping Vuzix with the companyâ€™s next generation products â€œfrom the prospective of siliconâ€?. Thereâ€™s going to be great opportunities for Vuzixâ€™s to open up business through Intel and on the flipside of the coin, Intel is helping us with some of our next generation technology from the perspective of silicon in the likes. (Paul Travers, Vuzix CEO Q4 2014 CC ) For the record Vuzixâ€™s waveguides are best suited for augmented reality because the form factor is much more important than the virtual reality space. Virtual reality devices are fully immersive so there is no need to be fashionable at this point. Microsoft is also very familiar with Vuzixâ€™s patented waveguide technology, which increases the odds that Microsoft could be a potential OEM for Vuzix. Microsoft has been rumored for several years as a possible suitor of Vuzixâ€™s waveguides. Microsoft also possesses a license for the same SRG waveguide technology used by Vuzix through Nokia. The NY Post first reported Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) being linked to Vuzix in June 2013 in a story focused on the development of smartglasses by Microsoft and Samsung. Microsoft has had dealings with publicly traded Vuzix Corp., of Rochester, NY, which develops technology around sci-fi-like glasses, another source said. (Source NY Post June 2013) Over the last week I have been tracking down a report that a Korean based on OEM was in Rochester, NY last week for 3 days evaluating waveguides. I can confidently confirm that the report is indeed valid, however the name of the company and the specific details of the visit were not made available to me. The only Korean based companies that would be interested in augmented reality and Vuzixâ€™s waveguides include Samsung and LG. While searching for a connection between Vuzix, Samsung and waveguides I came across an augmented reality presentation from Samsung dated February 7, 2015. The presentation was put together by Samsung R&D Institute Russia, which discusses opportunities in augmented reality as well as the use of holographic display and waveguides. In July 2015 Samsung filed a patent for a wearable smartglasses headset that is set to feature a holographic display according to Slash Gear . What is more interesting is that the schematics provided in Samsungâ€™s February 2015 presentation are identical to the holographic waveguide images provided in research report published by Opinvent. As you can see from the last two images Samsungâ€™s schematics that confirm a in-coupling hologram as well as a out-coupling hologram, which are associated with holographic waveguide. At this point I have confirmation that a Korean based company (presumably Samsung) spent three days reviewing waveguides in the same city Vuzix is located. I have demonstrated Samsungâ€™s intrinsic interest in holographic waveguides through internal presentations, which are also supported by recent patent filings related to smart glasses. The only question that remains open that can link Samsungâ€™s needs to Vuzix is determining if Vuzix as the IP and ability to produce holographic waveguides? In a March 2013 interview with Mashable Vuzixâ€™s CEO Paul Travers addressed the topic of holographic waveguides and his companyâ€™s intent of â€œpursuing the technology in earnestâ€?. Travers says holographic waveguide optics â€” where light is â€œsqueezedâ€? into a window in front of the eyes and then â€œreleasedâ€? to create the image â€” have the most promise, and Vuzix is pursuing the technology in earnest. (March 2013 Mashable ) In a October 2014 interview with Optics Org a former Vuzix executive went into length describing Vuzixâ€™s system including passive and dynamic holographic waveguides that are now covered by a range of patents. Development of the system and of passive and dynamic holographic waveguides, now covered by a range of patents, included a license agreement with Nokia for its Exit Pupil Expanding (NYSE: EPE ) technology related to the critical two-dimensional expansion of the image. In April 2015 Vuzix acquired two additional patents related to gesture control and managing ambient light for an undisclosed sum. These two patents added to Vuzixâ€™s 50 patents and patent pending total, which strengthened the companyâ€™s IP within the wearable technology space. Vuzix acquired these additional patents to secure a stronger IP position for its current and soon to be released products including, but not limited to, smart glasses based on our proprietary waveguide technology. This is just one element of our long-term approach to staying ahead of the curve in this dynamic sector. Paul Travers Vuzix CEO Now lets fast forward to March 2016. Vuzix has been working closely will Intel for over a year and based on clues provided during conference calls as well as understanding the waveguide manufacturing process we can gather that Intel is providing silicon expertise to help Vuzix master the waveguide manufacturing process. Intelâ€™s silicon mastery will allow the company to assist Vuzix with the silicon etching process required to perfect SRG waveguides that will eventually make their way onto the head-mounted displays worn by millions of consumers. For the first time in the companyâ€™s history that I can recall the balance sheet is plush with cash. A new 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility that is capable of producing 3 to 5 million holographic waveguides a year is now open for business. Over the past week a Korean based OEM spent 3 days evaluating waveguides within spitting distance of Vuzixâ€™s manufacturing facility, which limits the choices down to Samsung and LG. Not only has Samsung been linked to the Vuzixâ€™s geographical location, but the company has been eyeing holographic waveguides for augmented reality for quite some time. In my opinion a three day trip is more than enough time to perform due diligence of Vuzixâ€™s manufacturing facility and waveguides. For this reason I believe Vuzix and Samsung are in advanced stages of finalizing a deal or have already completed a deal and are working on detailed design for Samsungâ€™s first set of holographic waveguides. As far as timing goes I believe a deal between Vuzix and Samsung could be announced as soon as the Q4 2015 conference call, which should be scheduled no later than April 1, 2016.
