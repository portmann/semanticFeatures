Microsoft Ain't No IBM - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Warren Buffett was actually doing better in IBM than he would have in Microsoft three years ago. A few years ago, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was on the way to becoming IBM (NYSE: IBM ). The problems were similar. Its franchise product, Windows, was under threat. It was unable to get into mobility. All this threatened its enterprise franchises, starting with Office. There was even a time there when Microsoft's price/earnings multiple was getting close to that of IBM, which was having many of the same problems. This was in the spring of 2011, when Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) decided he needed to finally learn about and buy into technology. As history records, Warren bought IBM, and two years later, in early 2013, he once more seemed to have made the right call. Three years ago, IBM was actually up 30% from that early 2011 price, while Microsoft was up just 7%. Buffett had also socked away $2.40/share in dividends on his IBM stake, and the company was about to raise that rate again, to 95 cents/share. The companies were, after all, so similar. They were both run by great marketers with long experience at the company - Steve Ballmer in the case of Microsoft, Virginia Rometty at IBM. And IBM was about to make one of its periodic brilliant swoops, buying cloud player Softlayer to "marry" public and private cloud. So what happened? The turning point came nearly a year later, when Microsoft named Satya Nadella its CEO, in early 2014. But why was that move so brilliant, in retrospect? That's the point Buffett, and so many other smart investors, missed. It was brilliant because Nadella is a product guy. He didn't come out of technical sales. In technology, a product guy's job is to anticipate customer needs, to deliver what they will want before they even know they want it. While IBM divided customers into small, medium and large players, Nadella understood these differences were meaningless, that companies could go from start-up to billions very, very rapidly. While IBM was selling SoftLayer services as part of a suite of products, aimed mainly at solving current problems for large customers, Nadella positioned Azure as a highly-scalable platform that could let a company accomplish what Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) would call "ludicrous speed," going from 0 to 100 within months. Because that's what companies do today. Take Machine Zone , for instance. It was a startup in 2008, excited to even be mentioned on TV as recently as 2012, and is now the unquestioned leader in "free to play" mobile gaming, with Game of War and Mobile Strike both bringing in millions. Whether Azure got this specific customer or not, the fact is that many such companies exist, and many others want to emulate them. They're not interested in being classed as small, or medium-sized, and given just what attention a customer at that spending level "deserves." Nadella, the product guy, understood this, and he focused his attention laser-like on moving everything Microsoft did to Azure, enabling instant scalability and letting larger companies move quickly off outdated client-server systems. Meanwhile, IBM still sells mainframes. It still segments the market. It still acquires companies after much study, after demand is proven. It still runs much as it did in the 1980s. It's not the 80s anymore. Since Nadella became CEO, Microsoft is up almost 40%, while IBM is down 20%. Microsoft sales grew about $7 billion from 2014 to 2015, and now exceed those of IBM. Microsoft has taken a hit to its margins, and debt has increased as Azure has been built-out, but it's now widely considered to be one of the top players in the cloud market, while SoftLayer lags. Product people make the difference. It's because they anticipate needs rather than just responding to current demand. If IBM is serious about making a comeback, Microsoft provides a road map.
