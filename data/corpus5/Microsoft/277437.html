Microsoft: What An Expanding Multiple Can Do For Returns - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is a good example of a company that has had various valuations over the years. This article demonstrates what can occur if you buy a security with an ultimately expanding earnings multiple. In the end, it’s about identifying solid businesses and trying to capture business performance or better. The concept of "buy low, sell high" is perhaps the most well-known financial adage out there. Of course anyone in the investing world knows that is overwhelmingly easier said than done. The problem is that you have a great deal of intelligent people, all controlling different gobs of money, working toward the same goal. Add in an uncertain world and constantly changing expectations, and you have a true challenge confronting you. As the old Keynes quote goes: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." That is, even if you're correct in your assertion - a challenge on its own - there's no set schedule as to when everyone else must also "realize" this. More plainly, it's difficult to do in practice what this article is about to illustrate. However, I would contend that the process is still worth exploring. The benefit of seeing an expanding earnings multiple can provide a true boon for returns. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is a prime security to illustrate this. The company's valuation has bounced about a good deal over the years, leading to times when the investment results have varied dramatically from the business performance. I'll give you some examples. From 1994 through 1999, Microsoft was growing earnings by 30% and 40% per year. That's fantastic business performance. Yet the investment performance was even greater - climbing by nearly 70% per year. Despite the spectacular business results, the share price greatly outpaced business performance. This sort of thing doesn't last forever. From 1999 through 2005, Microsoft grew earnings per share by about 9% annually - still solid, but not quite as impressive as the past. As a result, shares that began trading at 50+ times earnings were suddenly less attractive. The share price fell by an average rate of 10% per year, resulting in significant capital depreciation. These sorts of ups and downs in valuation have been occurring for some time. Here's a table illustrating the concept : During the entire period, both earnings and the share price grew by 12% per annum. Over the course of very long time periods, this is more or less what you would expect: share price appreciation tracking business performance. Yet it's clear that this didn't happen in a regular or linear fashion. Often investors are overly enthusiastic or overly pessimistic, resulting in investment returns that vary dramatically from business performance. Let's take a look at a period when Microsoft's multiple was expanding, to get a better feel for the effect. At the end of 2008, after reporting fiscal year earnings around $1.90, shares of Microsoft were trading just over $19 - for an earnings multiple a bit above 10. Now admittedly this is a "cherry picked" time period, as alluded to above, but the point is to demonstrate what can happen when your investment sees an expansion in its earnings multiple. Since that time, the business has done reasonably well. Last year the company earned $2.65 per share, equating to a compound annual growth rate of about 5%. Also during this time, investors would have collected roughly $6.50 in dividend payments as well. Had the multiple stayed the same, today's share price would be around $26.50. Add in the $6.50 worth of dividends and you would have come to a collective value of about $33, or an annualized gain of roughly 8.2% per year. And that's prior to thinking about reinvestment. Had you simply received business results, your investment would have nicely compounded your wealth during the time. Yet that's not quite what happened. Microsoft no longer trades at 10 times earnings. Instead, today's multiple is closer to 20 times adjusted earnings. Today's share price is over $56, resulting in a true value for the long-term owner who bought at the end of 2008 of about $62.50. This represents an annual compound gain of over 18% per year. It's the difference between turning a $10,000 investment into $32,000 or "just" $17,000. This is what an expanding multiple can do for returns. The investment returns of the security greatly outpaced the business results. Business performance would have been quite reasonable, but business performance plus a doubled earnings multiple leads to exceptional results. Now obviously you can't expect to always invest in companies at the most opportune times. Investing a year later would have resulted in annual gains of "just" 12%, while a year earlier would have provided annualized gains of "only" 7% - timing can make a big difference. Yet the underlying notion remains fundamental. You don't have to time investments perfectly to benefit from the concept. First you're looking for a solid business that you'd be happy to own for years. Without this step you're relying on what other people may or may not be willing to pay. With this step it becomes a bit easier to deal with the constant ebbs and flows of everyday bids. Presumably you'd be happy with business performance if you were happy to own the business. The next step if figuring out whether or not you're getting a "fair shake." That is, whether or not the value paid gives you a fair opportunity to capture the business performance. With Microsoft trading at 10 times earnings that gave you a "fair shake" and indeed then some. Sure the business could have traded with a lower P/E ratio, but the likelihood of a similar or higher multiple in the future was on your side. Moreover, you didn't need to partner with the company at 10 times to see this play out. Had you bought shares at 12 or 14 or 16 times earnings, today you still would have seen investment performance that outpaced the business results of the company. Naturally this doesn't just apply to Microsoft. The goal is to identify a group of excellent businesses and then see whether or not you stand a fair chance at capturing business performance or better. Conceptually this looks like partnering with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) at 15 times earnings, or Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) at 17 times. Lower valuations come about from time to time, but your stacking the odds in your favor when you demand a fair (or better) valuation. Business results by themselves are often satisfactory, seeing an expanding multiple is just icing on the investment cake.
