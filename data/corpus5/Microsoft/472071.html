LinkedIn Clouds Microsoft's Outlook... A Bit - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment was the driving force behind its solid quarterly performance in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2016. The company continues to grab market share on all ends of the enterprise spectrum. Microsoft’s transition from a traditional software sales model to a cloud-focused model flush with recurring revenue potential continues to show solid momentum. Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares, as well as evaluate its dividend. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Intelligent Cloud segment was the driving force behind its solid quarterly performance in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2016, and its commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion in the quarter, putting it on track to achieve its goal of $20 billion in annualized revenue by 2018. Revenue from Azure, its enterprise cloud platform that provides businesses with cloud-based supercomputing power, doubled in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as did the compute usage of the platform (more customers are buying the platform). The period marked the eighth consecutive quarter in which Azure premium services revenue at least doubled. Customers of Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility--a mobility solution designed to help manage and protect users, devices, apps, and data for businesses--nearly doubled from the year-ago period, and its installed base is almost 2.5 times as large as it was at this time last year. In addition to the recurring revenue potential in its 'Intelligent Cloud' segment, Microsoft's commercial version of Office 365--its cloud-distributed, subscription-based productivity suite--continues to drive growth in its 'Productivity and Business Processes' segment. Office 365 commercial revenue leapt 54% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and Office consumer products and cloud services grew 19%. The company continues to grab market share on all ends of the enterprise spectrum, evidence of which ranges from its 28-month streak of adding at least 50,000 small and medium business customers or GE (NYSE: GE ) adopting its cloud for its new Internet of Things approach. Nearly 60% of Fortune 500 corporations use at least three of Microsoft's cloud offerings, and the scale associated with working with such large companies brings an attractive higher-margin aspect to the agreements. Cannibalization by its cloud business has been a key component of bearish arguments against Microsoft's business transition, but management is quick to point out that its cloud services are doing things for companies, particularly the larger enterprises, that its servers could never do. Microsoft's transition from a traditional software sales model to a cloud-focused model flush with recurring revenue potential continues to show solid momentum. Subscription trends and growth in installed bases across its cloud-based, enterprise-serving platforms have been strong, despite lumpy GAAP results in recent quarters, and we like what such growth means for visibility into the firm's future revenue stream. Its contracted-not-billed balance exceeded $25.5 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, and commercial unearned revenue advanced 8% on a constant-currency basis from the year-ago period. Bottom-line pressure may persist in the near term--non-GAAP operating income fell 3% on an as-reported basis in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 from the same period in fiscal 2015--due to ongoing strategic investments aimed at driving cloud-based revenues, but we expect such investments to pay dividends for the firm in the long run. • Microsoft's products include operating systems, server applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and online advertising. Its hardware devices include the Surface and the Xbox One gaming and entertainment console. One of its biggest assets is its cash on the balance sheet, which stands at ~$100 billion! • Microsoft can't scoop up its own shares fast enough through its massive buyback program. The firm floats debt with the best credit quality (Aaa), and we can't think of another firm with a better financial profile. Financial discipline and strong execution remain hallmarks of its business. • Investors continue to focus on Microsoft's Windows business because it has been the bread-and-butter of the company for such a long time, but we think the company's other segments are underappreciated. Microsoft is a core holding in the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio, and we think it continues to provide investors with a fantastic dividend growth opportunity. • Contrary to popular belief, Microsoft is not a tech dinosaur. CEO Satya Nadella has reignited innovation in the company, recently noting that customer excitement for new devices, Windows 10, Office 365 and Azure is increasing. However, we're not fans of the firm's decision to acquire professional networking firm LinkedIn. • Microsoft recent agreed to acquire LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) for over $26 billion in cash. The deal is expected to be dilutive to EPS in fiscal 2017 and 2018. Our fair value estimate has been reduced as a result of the negative impact on earnings and additional debt to be taken on. In our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Microsoft's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 78.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Microsoft's free cash flow margin has averaged about 29% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Microsoft, cash flow from operations increased about 1% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 40% over the same time period. Microsoft was once one of our favorite dividend growth ideas, but the recent deal with LinkedIn has the potential to mitigate its dividend prospects. Pre-deal, it registers a strong 2.7 Dividend Cushion ratio. Microsoft has had one of the most attractive dividend growth profiles across our coverage universe. It boasts an impressive balance sheet with a net cash position of ~$59 billion as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016, not inclusive of $11+ billion in long-term investments. The firm has been painting its recent agreement to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in a positive light, highlighting the expansion of its addressable market and the potential to drive engagement across LinkedIn and Office 365 as a result of the deal, but we aren't fond of what it will do for Microsoft's future dividend potential. For the time being, however, the firm's Dividend Cushion ratio remains strong thanks to its balance sheet and strong free cash flow generating ability. We think Microsoft has thrown away more than $26 billion in cash in the form of shareholder capital that could have potentially gone toward one of the best future dividend growth streaks in history at a large, Internet-based acquisition such as LinkedIn. Synergies of the deal may be limited, and we are not fond of the firm financing the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt as it seeks to complete its $40 billion share buyback program by the end of 2016. We're not fans of such a massive buyback program either due to our current opinion of the firm's valuation profile. While dividend increases may very well continue, we think Microsoft's dividend growth potential took a major hit with the LinkedIn acquisition. We think Microsoft is worth $52 per share with a fair value range of $42-$62. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3- year historical compound annual growth rate of 8.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 37.1%, which is above Microsoft's trailing 3- year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Microsoft, we use a 9.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $52 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Microsoft. We think the firm is attractive below $42 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $62 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. We estimate Microsoft's fair value at this point in time to be about $52 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Microsoft's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $64 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $52 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.
