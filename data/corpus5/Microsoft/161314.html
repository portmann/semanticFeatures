Microsoft: Power BI Content Packs For Adobe, Azure And Webtrends - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha MSFT has released a fresh round of content packs for Power BI. I continue to applaud Microsoft for its tailored approach to winning customers via Power BI. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has again added a round of content packs to its Power BI platform. This time the content packs for Power BI include packs for widely deployed Adobe Analytics (NASDAQ: ADBE ), in-house tech Azure Mobile Engagement and SMB-focused Webtrends. Power BI, which is already my BI platform of choice, gets even more comprehensive with these tailor-made additions. That said, the increased content pack capacity also speaks well to the broader Microsoft Power BI strategic initiative of avoiding "off the rack" BI additives whenever possible - a luxury that Microsoft can afford to indulge in being of the size that it is. While this hasn't been stated as a Microsoft Power BI strategy per se, it's one that's easy enough to extrapolate via the company's focus on frequent content pack updating and delivery. What does Power BI get for its content pack efforts? I think it gets quite a bit. But first let's breakout what Microsoft is deploying in each content pack. Adobe Analytics: Adobe Analytics, which has a huge following across SMBs and enterprise seats (both areas of focus for Power BI with a particular bonus focus on SMB aggregation) is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. Adobe Analytics' core purpose is analysis of customer data. With integration via a content pack to Power BI, BI/Adobe Analytics users can analyze where visitors are coming from, what days they come the most frequently, and how long they're staying as well as several metrics based on e-commerce data, CRM attributes and engagement. Power BI offers Adobe Analytics users a tailored seven-page report based on the most recent data load which is displayed at a central user Dashboard. From there Adobe Analytics users can drill down into the data set report data, repin to customize the Dashboard, or rerun the data set Azure Mobile Engagement: Azure Mobile Engagement is an app analytics service that allows developers (yet another key Microsoft seat target) track their application's performance which can lead to increased retention and app usage. Of course increased app usage drives key metrics - you can imagine why nailing down a content pack for Azure Mobile Engagement, which is Microsoft tech anyways, is important. Once credentialed (credentials are provided from within Azure Mobile Engagement) a Dashboard is created for users on an automatic basis. The Dashboard is a set of tiles with each displaying a specific metric to monitor from the Dashboard view. Selecting a tile drills in further into a report. Examples of reports than can, again, be pinned to the Dashboard in total open architecture are: Monthly Crash and Bug Report, Weekly Crash and Bug Report, Other Technical Data (Monthly), Other Technical Data (Weekly), Monthly User Report, Monthly User Activity, Weekly User Activity and Map, etc. Webtrends: Webtrends is an analytics engine for digital marketing that is widely used by advertisers, marketers, webpage managers, etc. I hate to be repetitive, but these are all key seats that Microsoft is focused on introducing itself to. Webtrends users have the ability to observe, analyze and deliver insights on the visitor process across web, social, mobile and SharePoint channels. With the release of the Webtrends content pack, users will now have the ability to use Power BI to monitor, analyze and visualize their Webtrends analytics data. While having less total capacity and open architecture than the Adobe Analytics content pack (only six pages of reporting where Adobe Analytics has seven) this is still quite a bit of BI tech being deployed. Now that we've described the content packs individually, what does this mean for Power BI and for Microsoft? Again, I think the big takeaway is that Microsoft is targeting user acquisition the "right way." What's the "right way?" I think it's by doing what's best for the customer instead of maybe doing what's best for the company, at least in the immediate term. Could Microsoft had just as easily not deployed these specialized content packs and asked users via more traditional marketing efforts to use its BI for the above, now tailored use cases? Sure. It very well could have. But by taking the time, effort and costs to actually build customized content packs Microsoft is 1) telling the users that it wants to be the partner of choice for the tech being deployed and 2) that it's willing to invest in the relationship. That matters. In a tech economy that's moving further and further away from being one that's transactional and one that's (for lack of a better phrase) "fully comprehensive" (this is pointing to the fact that many tech customers are now using the "best of breed" point solutions as an aggregated "best of breed solution"), being willing to win a relationship rather than a "right now" use-case matters. It matters because as the tech economy shifts more into a lifetime customer value focus the relationship is the underlying retention creator. I think it's fairly obvious that gone are the days of super-aggregating, all in-house solutions. Now, a user can use Wordpress for his or her webpage, Zendesk (NYSE: ZEN ) for customer service, Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) for CRM, HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS ) for marketing, and Microsoft Power BI for BI and analytics. And guess what? That's just fine to every company in the hypothetical list as long as the company in the list has a happy customer that it can get recurring revenue from and a max LTV. Believe me, this describes the new tech economy. Microsoft is just further acknowledging this with Power BI content packs and the content pack focus. With these content packs Microsoft has basically sent a non-threatening letter of sorts to users of the broader platforms for integration (ex. the in-house Microsoft tech obviously). The letter says "I know you love your platform for (insert use case) and that's fine, I know I can't compete. But maybe I can make this platform a little more useful. Consider us for addressing a need you don't already have a solution for." Here's to hoping Microsoft's sense of awareness and sense of reality pays off for it. Disclosure: I am/we are long HUBS, ZEN.
