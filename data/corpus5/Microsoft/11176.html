The Microsoft Band Is Too Popular, Retailers Are Often Out Of Stock - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoftâ€™s $199 Band smart fitness tracker is a hit. Continuing short supply of the Microsoft Band is causing inflated prices on eBay and Amazon. Nadella made the right decision in making the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Band available at other online and local retailers. However, the expanded distribution network will likely exacerbate the lingering shortage of supply of the Microsoft Band . On the other hand, the short supply also hints that Microsoft's smart fitness tracker is a commercial success. Launched last October 30, the Microsoft Band was an instant hit among fitness-minded individuals. However, the scarcity of this product has started since its launch date. Even Microsoft's own online store is often out of stock. WinBeta did say that the Band was available again at Microsoft's store yesterday. However, the delivery date for the Small and Medium size Band will be May 6, and the Large size Band, April 1. Microsoft also limits purchases to one Band per customer. The continuing shortage has allowed some people to resell their Microsoft Band units at a great markup over the $199 official price tag. A check on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) revealed that a Microsoft Band could be sold for over $400. The same thing is happening at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). One Amazon vendor is selling a Large Microsoft Band for $308.68. Microsoft's failure to anticipate this overwhelming demand for the Band has allowed scalpers to flourish. There is an urgent need for Microsoft to increase production and accelerate delivery while the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch is still not shipping out. The scarcity of the Band fitness tracker could inspire frustrated/impatient buyers to just order the $349 Apple Watch Sports. The Apple product will be available on April 24 so time is of the essence here. It's been over four months since the Microsoft Band was launched. Microsoft's future revenue stream in smartwatches is being derailed by a lingering shortage. The Band is more expensive than FitBit's Charge HR but Tom's Guide rates Microsoft's product as the best fitness tracker smartwatch. Yes, sir, the experts see Microsoft's Band as a smartwatch in spite of its tiny 1.4 inch (320 x 106) display. Microsoft cannot compete with Apple in smartphones but the Band is a semi-smartwatch that is a cheaper alternative to the $349 Apple Watch Sports model. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Band is compatible with iPhones, Windows, and Android phones. The Band is a great example of Nadella's platform-agnostic strategy for Microsoft. The Band is already capable of running Windows Phone apps and is compatible with Cortana. This fitness tracker complements smartphones and it also integrates with the cloud-based Microsoft Health service. The data gathered by the Band's sensors could be securely uploaded and shared to medical professionals via HealthVault . Fat guys like me can routinely share private health stats to our trusted doctors without us going to their clinics. The Band is Microsoft's early-bird ticket to the rapidly surging market for smartwatches and wearables. Transparency Market Research estimates that the smartwatch industry alone will be worth $29.67 billion by 2020. Transparency predicts that global smartwatch sales will post a 53.6% CAGR until 2020. CCS Insight also predicts that there will be 340 wearable devices in use by 2018, 43% of which will be wristband fitness trackers like the Microsoft Band. For this year, CCS Insight that 172 million wearables will get sold - with fitness trackers and smartwatches getting the lion share. CCS Insight also estimates there will be 27 million smartwatches that will be sold this year and 36 million fitness trackers. Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) was last year's leader in smartwatch/fitness tracker sales. Samsung sold 1.2 million units of its Gear line of products. The $119.99 Samsung Gear Fit looks similar to the Microsoft Band. However, the Gear Fit is only compatible with Android 4.3 or higher devices. The Samsung Gear Fit also suffers from poor user reviews . Microsoft's Band has received 4.5 star ratings from Amazon shoppers in spite of it being sold higher than its official $199.99 price tag. If Microsoft can kick up production, the Band could also deliver annual sales of 200k units or higher. FitBit sold 600k units of its smartband products last year. If we take into account that Microsoft has far bigger resources and distribution network than FitBit or Pebble, Microsoft might become the No.3 player in wearables - behind Apple and Samsung. Microsoft has a great thing going with the Band. We can only hope that it could produce enough units to meet the strong demand. Otherwise, Microsoft will have to license the Band's technology to other companies. Making the Band available at Amazon, Target (NYSE: TGT ), and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) is counterproductive if the product remains scarce. Swiss firm Swatch is allegedly releasing a Windows-friendly smartwatch . I hope Microsoft could land the same luxury Android watch deal that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) inked with TAG Heuer. Swatch owns the luxury watch brands Omega , Blancpain, and Breguet. The margins on Swiss-made elite smartwatches could be higher than the $17,000 Apple Watch Edition. High retail price tags of Omega smartwatches could give Microsoft very healthy licensing fees. Swatch is the fifth biggest vendor of luxury goods on the planet. A collaboration between Microsoft and Swatch is highly desirable. The affordable Swatch brand could also pave the way for $160 Windows 10 smartwatches for emerging markets. The elitist people who could afford a $17,000 smartwatch will likely prefer an Omega-branded Windows 10 smartwatch over an Apple one. Microsoft Health and HealtVault could also benefit when there are more Microsoft-licensed fitness trackers and smartwatches on the market. A majority of people today have a sedentary lifestyle. A fitness tracker is therefore a necessity product that Microsoft could and should focus on. MSFT is a smart Buy . Microsoft is a very fit company with top notch fundamentals. The long-term technical indicators also support my bullish outlook for Microsoft.
