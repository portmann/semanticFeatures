Microsoft: Putting Windows 10 Inside Android Phones Could Seriously Hurt Google - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft announced it is working with Xiaomi to test Windows 10 on the Mi4 Android phone. Microsoft will create a custom Windows 10 ROM that will let Xiaomi Mi4 users replace the Android OS in their phones. I think this is a superb killer move by Nadella to infiltrate and profit from the billion-strong user base of Android phones. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) revealed two days ago that China's No.1 smartphone vendor, Xiaomi, has signed on to test the Windows 10 Technical Preview. Microsoft will deliver a custom Windows 10 ROM for a select number of Xiaomi Mi4 Android phone users. The said users could then use the said Windows 10 ROM to replace the Android OS of their Mi4 handset. The procedure is very much similar to what Cyanogen Mod and Xiaomi does . They create custom ROMs so Android device owners can use them instead of the official Android operating system from Google. According to TechCrunch, Xiaomi Mi4 users will need to flash their phone using the Windows 10 ROM from Microsoft. Flashing a smartphone means reformatting everything to do a full re-installation of a phone's operating system and system apps. This is not a dual-boot system that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) tried to popularize during the CES January 2014 event. Microsoft and its nemesis, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) hated and killed the dual-OS venture of Intel and Asus ( OTC:ASUUY ) last year. Judging by this latest deal with Xiaomi, Nadella is a ruthless and shrewd leader who is directly aiming for Google/Android's jugular. Creating custom Windows 10 ROMs so that Android phone users can easily replace the Android OS in their phones, is an easy way for Microsoft to hurt Google's search and mobile advertising business. Letting more than 1 billion Android phone users switch to Windows 10 for free is a faster way for Microsoft to put Bing, Skype, OneDrive, and its mobile ads in more mobile devices than selling Lumia Windows phones. The massive lead of Android OS in the global smartphone market means Microsoft has little hope of ever catching up. As of Q4 2014, Windows Phone's share was only 2.8% while Google had 76.6%. Even if Microsoft uses contra revenue (free Windows licenses, marketing support, free Office 365), most top OEMs today will continue to prioritize making Android phones. In spite of its best efforts to recruit industry support, Microsoft still accounted for 90% of Windows phones sold last year. The chart below illustrates why selling Lumia phones is a hopeless tactic against Google. The Android ecosystem is too deeply embedded to be dislodged. It makes sense therefore that Nadella would try a backdoor attempt to make more people use Windows 10. Microsoft's freemium strategy of giving away free software and services is now akin to Google. Mobile advertising is where Microsoft can make up for the lost revenue from giving away free software. The mobile advertising industry, where Google dominates , is already a $64.25 billion industry this year, and will grow to be a $158.55 gold mine by 2018. The Xiaomi experiment of allowing Mi4 users to easily install Windows 10 to replace the Android OS on their phones could be a precursor to the final strategy of Nadella. The money in mobile ads is just too big to presume that Nadella will not exploit this custom ROM method to steal users away from Google's services and mobile advertisements. I speculate that once Windows 10 gets released in 190 countries this summer , many custom Windows 10 ROMs for different Android phone models could also be available for download. Microsoft is now trying to out-Google Google with its new freemium strategy . The chart from Microsoft's chief marketing officer Chris Capossella illustrates this freemium business model. Control of the smartphone ecosystem made Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google super successful. Consequently, the more smartphones that use Bing, Skype, and Windows 10, the better it will also be for Microsoft's overall business growth. Nadella's platform-agnostic strategy for Microsoft means playing by the rules first set by Google. Give away free software to attract mobile users, engage the users, mine the data of recruited users, and then monetize them through advertisements. However, giving away free Android Office Apps is still not the best way to realize Nadella's vision. Making sure that people get the ability to use their current Android phones as Windows 10 devices is the best way to do it. Nadella doesn't want to rely on sales of Windows 10 phones, he wants the buying public to betray Google and eliminate Google's search engine, apps and services inside their Android smartphones. Microsoft is a no-factor right now in mobile advertising because of the low number of Windows phone users. Custom Windows 10 ROMs might change the names on the chart below when eMarketer reports in 2016. MSFT is a Buy . Nadella can make Microsoft better than Google. He is not only putting custom Windows 10 ROMs inside Android phones, he will also allow hundreds of millions of people with pirated Windows 7 and Windows 8 software to upgrade for free to Windows 10. The more eyeballs to deliver advertisements to, the better it is for Microsoft. With or without Xiaomi's help, the charts below should be enough evidence that MSFT is already an underpriced (compared to its industry and sector peers) high-quality stock.
