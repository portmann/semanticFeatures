Why Another AMD Buyout Makes Sense, But Is Unlikely - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha This is the second significant rumor of AMD being bought out by Microsoft. AMD's struggling business and vertical integration for Microsoft justified this reasoning. Rumor has it, and has had it for several months on more than one occasion, that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is going to be acquired. There's been Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), BLX, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to name a few. This is the second significant buyout rumor concerning Microsoft that we've learned of, with the last being just in June. This time, Fudzilla states that Microsoft is 'seriously' talking to AMD about an acquisition. There are a number of reasons why these rumors have some merit, with the biggest being AMD's rough business situation. However, a Microsoft acquisition seems a bit out of place. Sure, Microsoft can vertically integrate its products with AMD's chips, but what about its strong relationship with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). And how will this affect Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), who is very reliant on sales to Windows customers. I suppose it's plausible, but I don't see how it'll fly. There are two reasons why it makes sense for Microsoft to acquire AMD. The first and biggest is due to AMD's risk of bankruptcy. About a year ago, we learned about AMD's new architecture, Zen, which is the only product that investors should be concerned with in the long run. With its debut occurring sometime in mid-2016, it's been all about surviving until then. Investors were fairly comfortable with this idea, because AMD was steadily nearing profitability throughout 2014 and claimed that it would be profitable in 2015. However, AMD's most recent earnings report notes a 45% decrease in revenue YOY and a loss of $137M. Furthermore, AMD's gross margins fell to 28% from 35% YOY and the company only expects a 6% increase in revenue for its upcoming quarter, the peak quarter of the year. There's no question that the business is in trouble, and bailing investors drove the stock to an all-time low. With so much trouble, AMD may need a savior, and Microsoft could be just that. The second is for Microsoft to be able to run a cheaper, vertically integrated business like its arch rival, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Apple has prided itself in handling the software and hardware side of its product, but with iOS, it's taken it a step further by designing its own ARM processors. This has been very profitable for Apple, but since Windows is x86 based, Microsoft can only obtain chips from either AMD or Intel, which is expensive. This affects Microsoft's pricing power, and if iPad and Surface go to war, pricing may become a concern and might only be within Apple's ability. There are a variety of reasons why this acquisition doesn't make sense, and in this section I will discuss four reasons, which should be enough. First, there's AMD's heavily diversified product portfolio. AMD knew that living with its Bulldozer cores was going to be a survival game, so under ex-CEO Rory Read, AMD started to temporarily branch away from the PC and focus on things like embedded, medical, gaming consoles, professional graphics, and more. If this never happened, AMD wouldn't be here today because AMD's PC and graphics revenue was an unbearable $379M (down 65% YOY). Outside of those segments, which includes consoles, enterprise, and embedded, AMD generated $563M. That segment is expected to grow as AMD adopts more design wins, such as this new Fujitsu Thin-Client design win , and the new semicustom design win that will start adding revenue next year. These are at least half-decade commitments, and I don't see where Microsoft fits into all of this. Second, there's Wintel. Intel has been Microsoft's best friend since the start of the industry and if Microsoft acquires AMD for its x86 capabilities, it's a little difficult to see where Intel will play a role in all of this. While AMD may not be competitive with Intel at the moment, Zen is expected to be a major contender and a leap forward that could close, or dramatically reduce the gap. AMD has, and probably won't have a product that can power the Surface tablets anytime soon, so I don't know how betraying Intel is going to play in Microsoft's favor. Third is Nvidia, AMD's other competitor. If Microsoft were to acquire AMD, Nvidia would be dropped in quicksand. Sure, Nvidia is a bit of a jerk in its pricing schemes so some may say that they deserve just that. However, there's a lot more than silicon that goes into graphics products, and with both Windows and AMD's Radeon under Microsoft's wing, I can't imagine how this would go well or be fair in anyway to Nvidia. It has been suggested that AMD may spin off its graphics unit and simply license it back for its APU, but that doesn't alter this problem very much. Fourth and lastly is that AMD has a greater upside on its own. AMD is standing above a gold mine as it has both a strong computing and graphics API under its sleeve. Nvidia has no x86 license, and Intel is still way behind in graphics. If AMD overcomes this hurdle and launches Zen along with its graphics API, you can expect to see AMD's stock triple or quadruple in a very short amount of time. Intel is worth $140B, Nvidia is worth $12B, and AMD who has the chance to thrive in both markets, is worth only $1.5B. Why would AMD want to give away all that upside? There's no doubt that AMD is in trouble and needs a little bit of cash to get by, which is chump change for Microsoft, so perhaps this is why these rumors are taken seriously by investors. However, there are ethical problems with Intel and Nvidia being victims and worries on whether or not Microsoft can even manage the company. I'm sure the Nokia fall through isn't going to give Microsoft a strong argument. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMD. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
