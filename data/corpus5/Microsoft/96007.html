Nadella's Microsoft Is Cloud First, Cloud Second, Cloud Always - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's fate depends on moving customers en-masse to the cloud-based Windows 10. Microsoft's attitude has changed, from leading customers to accommodating them. After a year spent dealing with his company's giant bureaucracy, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Satya Nadella quietly rolled out the strategy for his version of Microsoft this week. Nadella is pushing the hardware over to the side under Terry Myerson , who also runs Windows, and dropping the Ballmer-era dreams of phone leadership entirely, with Stephen Elop leaving. The company also quietly released a new version of its OneNote cloud-based editing app, but for the iPhone. Not for Android, not for Windows Phone, but for the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) platform where it's most commonly used. This is important. It means Nadella is determined to follow his users, not lead them. There is evidence, however, that users are resistant to the new attitude. Both my adult children recently got notices from Microsoft suggesting they can get Windows 10, free. Both declined, saying they distrust the company. And it seems that their distrust is not just anecdotal. Even Microsoft employees are having a tough time making the new attitude clearly understood, and appreciated. This is the biggest "cloud" on Microsoft's horizon, pun intended. Nadella is trying to re-build the company's relationship with its huge, but shrinking customer base, and he's having a tough time. It's obvious that Apple is accreting more-and-more of what used to be considered "office" work. Macintoshes maintain a price point averaging $1,500 while the new Surface 3 Pro costs $500 - that's a good measure of perceived value. But if Microsoft can hold its share of the operating system market as Windows becomes more-and-more directly competitive with iOS and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android, maybe things can go in the other direction. Meanwhile, while Apple moves into territory formerly reserved for Microsoft, Microsoft is seen as moving into territory formerly reserved for IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), the control of large enterprises. Microsoft's corporate customers now see a clearly-defined strategy for moving operations to the cloud, and Microsoft's moves to accommodate those who also use OpenStack or the Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) EC2 cloud actually makes this clearer. Microsoft stock is up about 25% since Nadella became CEO. But those gains are not reflected in the company's financials. Quarterly revenue is up 6%, year-over-year, between the March quarter of 2014 and that of 2015. Net income is down 13% year-over-year. Things are good, in that Microsoft is dragging over 20% of revenue to the net income line, and the dividend was raised 3 cents last summer, representing just half that net income so it's affordable. The gains outpace the S&P averages, but most of those gains mainly reflect multiple expansion - the P/E has moved from 15 to 19. There are high hopes for Microsoft, in other words, and the new strategy seems both logical and considered. The question is whether Microsoft can communicate its new attitude to customers, whether customers buy in, and whether that gets the top-line moving in a positive direction as a result. Investors will have an easy shorthand to understand the answer. Ask how the cloud-based Windows 10 is doing. If the answer is "great," then buy, buy, buy. If it's "no," then sell, sell, sell.
