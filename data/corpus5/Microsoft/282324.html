Apple's App Economy Indicates Increasing iPhone Sales Momentum - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple has announced record breaking iOS App Store revenue for calendar 2015 and the December holiday season. Surpassing last year's December records indicates that iPhone sales growth continues to be strong. Even as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investors have been inundated with negative supply chain reports and downgrades from analysts, Apple has released real data indicating strong iPhone sales growth in December quarter. Traditionally, strong iOS device sales in the December quarter have translated into strong app sales in the days following Christmas and New Years. Last year's app sales set new records and served as a harbinger of impressive December quarter iPhone sales. This year, Apple has announced that app downloads again broke last year's records. This bodes very well for the fiscal Q1 earnings report and beyond. With all the various supply chain rumors being floated, I try to focus investor attention on reliable factual data, and continue to point to Apple as the best source of data about Apple. The app sales announcement is important because the peak of app sales typically corresponds to strong iPhone sales during the December quarter. When someone gets a new iPhone, whether for the first time or an upgrade, the first thing they want to do is load up on apps, or upgrade their apps to run under the latest iOS version. So the surge in app purchases represents a fairly reliable barometer of iPhone sales, at least in a qualitative sense. App sales have been very strong all during calendar 2015, with over $20 billion in gross revenue being generated, according to the SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller. This represents a 40% y/y increase compared to the roughly $14 billion Apple reported for the App Store this time last year. In addition to the overall performance for the year, Apple announced that it had broken the previous year's sales records for single day sales set on New Year's Day 2015, with over $144 million in gross revenue generated in a single day. Apple also had gross revenue for the two weeks ending January 3 of $1.1 billion, setting new back-to-back weekly records in the process. This real data flies in the face of the negative narrative of declining iPhone sales momentum. Apple also reported the research of Dr. Michael Mandel, who estimates that Apple's app economy has generated 1.9 million jobs in the U.S., 1.2 million jobs in Europe, and 1.4 million jobs in China. That kind of job creation is an endorsement of the future prospects for iOS app developers. The report from Japan's Nikkei is just the latest supply chain rumor. Why are supply chain rumors becoming so predominant as we approach Apple's December quarterly report on January 26? As I and many others have pointed out , CEO Tim Cook specifically cautioned investors against drawing conclusions from such rumors. I believe that the answer lies in the denouement of the September quarter report. As the reader may recall, prior to Apple's September quarter report, anxiety about Apple was driven primarily by what was supposedly happening in China. The slowdown in China would supposedly hurt Apple, which had become too dependent on iPhone sales in China. Apple's September earnings report, which I reviewed , made it clear that the dire predictions about China were largely fabrication. Yes, there had been some slowing of growth in China, but it hadn't become actual economic contraction, and Apple hadn't been hurt in any case. Apple's revenue in China grew by almost 100% y/y. With China no longer a viable pretext for the negative narrative, a new pretext had to be found, and supply chain rumors fit the bill nicely. Most of the rumors sound terrible, but are more or less meaningless when analyzed rigorously. The Nikkei rumor is a case in point. The article reports: Apple is expected to reduce output of its latest iPhone models by around 30% in the January-March quarter compared with its original plans, according to several parts suppliers. The measure will deal a blow to Japanese and South Korean parts companies. What were Apple's original plans? We have no idea. Without that critical piece of data, there's simply no way to interpret the 30% number, even if it is accurate, which I doubt. I'm not the only one who is doubtful about the rumors. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray has also expressed his skepticism about the rumors, as reported by Apple Insider . If the rumors are just nonsense, why doesn't Apple simply make an announcement setting the record straight? I've often read complaints to that effect from investors. Certainly, Apple could do that. However, I think it would be ill-advised. Apple is already the most transparent of the large technology companies, reporting specific unit shipments for each of its product categories, which its large competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) do not. For Apple to disclose its specific sales forecasts for the coming quarter would be unprecedented, and potentially provide some strategic advantage to its competitors. One possibility is that the negative supply chain rumors are an attempt to flush out just such a disclosure from Apple. If that's the case, so far Apple isn't falling for it. I'll frankly admit that I can't disprove the supply chain rumors. They could be true, but as Daniel Eran Dilger has pointed out , the history of such rumors doesn't lend them any credibility. My opinion is that this is just China all over again. When Apple issues its guidance for the March quarter, investors will have a much more reliable take on expectations for the quarter than any supply chain rumors can provide. I recommend investors withhold judgment until then. In the meantime, I continue to stand by my rating of Apple as a buy. In fact, at its current price, it's probably a bargain.
