AMD Q1: On The Ropes Yet Again - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD is gloomier than Intel about a PC recovery in the second half of 2015. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) may still have $900 million in cash left to burn, but if something does not turn around soon, extinction is in the cards. Generally the market for CPUs and GPUs (graphics processors) is stronger in the second half of each year, with Q3 being seasonally strongest. Q3 2014 did show a profit of $17 million GAAP, $20 million adjusted, but that quarter was swamped by other losses in 2014. Right now it looks like 2015 will be even worse. There are a few possible future bright spots I will discuss, but on the whole today's sell-off in AMD stock seems justified. The PC end market has been in decline for years now. In 2014 there was a slight boost as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) ended support for Windows XP, an ancient but apparently beloved OS. So AMD and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) are fighting over a declining market, with margins in some price segments so low that AMD is abandoning them. At times AMD has done better against graphics rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), but 2014 saw newer Nvidia GPUs introduced that topped those available from AMD. That resulted in both market share and price erosion as well as unsold inventory accumulating at channel partners. Q1 was largely about allowing the channel inventory to unwind. The result was that the Computing and Graphics segment had revenue of $532 million. That was sequentially down 20%, which is more than the usual post-holiday drop. More significant was a 38% y/y drop. That's a disaster. Most likely AMD lost market share to both Nvidia and Intel within a shrinking market. Commercial, as opposed to consumer, sales were up y/y. No breakdown was given, but AMD has always been mainly a producer for the consumer market. I suspect that if the AMD share of the business PC market ever became substantial, Intel would simply lower CPU prices to constrain AMD's growth. This has been Intel's basic business strategy against AMD throughout their history. AMD's presence in the tablet market is insignificant, except for some 2-in-1 devices. AMD does not produce chips for cell phones. The next generation of AMD PC chips is called Carrizo. Doubtless they are an improvement on prior chips, but they are going up against the newest Intel chips. Maintaining market share is the best that can be expected after any short-term bump from their introduction. The possibility of a burst in console sales with the introduction of Xbox and PlayStation to the Chinese market did not materialize. It is still worth watching the ramp, as gaming consoles could yet catch on there. Nor did a price reduction by Microsoft do more than just keep it competitive with Sony (NYSE: SNE ), and maybe clear out some inventory. AMD offers no breakdown, but it is fair to assume that the bulk of revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment comes from chips for gaming consoles. Segment revenue for Q1 was $498 million, down 14% sequentially and 7% from a year earlier. The y/y decline was because gaming console chip revenue was down from Q1 2014. This segment is where any hope for AMD lies. A number of wins occurred in the quarter which could result in higher revenue later in 2015. Unnamed new embedded APU (CPU + GPU on a single chip) based products were introduced by Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), GE (NYSE: GE ) and Fujitsu ( OTCPK:FJTSY ). AMD FreeSync technology is now being offered in displays from Acer, BenQ and LG Electronics, but AMD is not charging royalties for that. The segment overall showed $45 million of operating profit. Responding to a question from an analyst, CEO Lisa Su reported that the two major semi-custom wins that were announced in late 2014 are still on schedule to start generating revenue in 2016. SeaMicro was a maker of ultra-dense servers founded in 2007. AMD bought it for $334 million in 2012, and for a couple of years it was touted as a promising area. The funny thing was it sold mostly servers that were populated with Intel chips. While no details were given by AMD management, I suspect SeaMicro customers no more wanted AMD Opteron chips than anyone else. In any case AMD closed it on April 16. Apparently it was not worth selling or could not be sold without parting with something called fabric technology, which AMD is incorporating into its next generation of server chips. AMD's inability to compete in server chips with Intel has seriously undermined its financial model over the last five or so years. AMD gained some market share when it introduced Opteron processors, but since then has shrunk to less than 5% of the market at a time when that market has grown substantially along with cloud services. Server chips have better margins than PC chips, so Intel has a cash cow where AMD has next to nothing, at the moment. If AMD has an ace in the hole, it is the Opteron A1100 . This is a 64-bit ARM processor SoC that incorporates other crucial components of server technology that may not be available to AMD's ARM-based competitors. It is being tested by potential customers and semi-custom versions may later be made available to sufficiently large cloud customers. But there is nothing that guarantees sufficient customer adoption to make it a profitable business. Nothing prevents Intel from taking out an ARM license and competing in this area if it turns out to be viable, as happened after Opteron server chips were introduced. AMD lost $180 million on a GAAP basis in Q1, or $0.23 per share. On a non-GAAP basis the loss was $73 million, or negative $0.09. In addition to the usual non-cash differences between GAAP and non-GAAP, a big contributor to the difference was a $75 million non-cash impairment charge on the SeaMicro closure. Q2 2015 guidance was not reassuring. Q2 is typically seasonally up in revenue from Q1 - it was up 3% in 2014. For Q2 2015 AMD is guiding to revenue between flat and down 6%. This was attributed to the continued need to get excess inventory out of partner channels. The good news is that process should conclude in Q2 so that growth can resume in Q3. Of course if the PC market continues to shrink despite the Windows 10 introduction, Q3 could be disappointing too. Regarding the second half, in response to a question from an analyst comparing Intel's statement that seasonality would be better than normal due to the release of Windows 10 during the summer, Lisa Su refused to go with the "better than," instead predicting a seasonally better second half in part due to the release of Windows 10. AMD can't be blamed for poor y/y gaming console sales or the shrinking PC market. AMD is right to concentrate R&D dollars on the Enterprise and Embedded segment. But there are no guarantees that this strategy will work. AMD needs to keep its Computing and Graphics segment because it needs the efficiencies of scale and because some R&D costs benefit both segments. It is possible the PC market will stabilize. Desktops still offer the best value for doing work where a large screen and ample processing power are needed, and there are indeed a lot of ancient desktops and notebooks out in the world that should be replaced. However, for consumers desktops and notebooks are increasingly optional, and it is the consumer market that AMD has always served. The embedded SoCs project is doing relatively well, with some promise of a bump in 2016. That leaves the gaming console business the crucial factor in 2015. Maybe it will grow, especially if some great games are introduced. But my sense is that gaming consoles are another industry in slow decline. I own AMD stock, which is a legacy from when my portfolio was almost exclusively in the information technology segment. I would not buy any AMD now, given what I know. I'm willing to keep what I have to see if maybe ARM server chips, gaming console sales and other embedded and customized chip applications work out according to the AMD game plan. But if I decide I need cash, AMD is now on my short list for disposal. Source: AMD Q1: On The Ropes Yet Again Disclosure: The author is long AMD.
