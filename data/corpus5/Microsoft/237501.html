Hewlett-Packard's Big Opportunity In High-End Computers - HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) | Seeking Alpha Apple’s decision to never release a Mac/iPad hybrid product says HP could continue to compete with pricey MacBooks/Macs. Not every enterprise client will be able to afford the Surface Book/Surface Pro 4. HP’s cheaper 2-in-1 tablet/notebooks are good alternatives to the Microsoft Surface laptops. Tim Cook himself made it very clear that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will never create/sell a converged Mac/iPad computer product. This decision should help HP (NYSE: HPQ ) further improve its sales of high-end laptops to enterprise users and creative professionals. Investors should care that Cook's dismissive attitude toward touchscreen-friendly computers creates a big opportunity for HP's latest 2-in-1 tablet/notebook products. The recalcitrant policy of Apple to only sell MacBooks with no touchscreen displays means the $800 HP Spectre 2 could render the MacBook Air less attractive among business users. The affordable price tag of the Spectre 2 ($800 comes with free detachable keyboard and LTE wireless connectivity) makes it a perfect threat to the 13-inch $1,000 MacBook Air 2015. Unlike Apple's latest Ultrabook, the Spectre 2 has a touchscreen display and it could also be used as standalone tablet. Cook was also wrong to claim that the iPad Pro could replace Windows PCs. Various hands-on reviews already proved that the current ARM-based iPad Pro is not yet a legit laptop replacement. The iPad Pro's lack of compatibility with industry standard x86-only software means it is an inferior product that enterprise users will likely ignore. The previous popularity of the MacBook Air helped Apple become the top seller of Ultrabook or smaller-screen laptops. However, the need to buy a separate MacBook and an iPad Pro to match the versatility of a Windows 10 hybrid tablet/Ultrabook is a important issue for budget-conscious enterprise customers. The significant cost savings from buying HP's 2-in-1 laptops is something that all IT managers would like to take advantage of. The cheaper $800 Spectre 2 could attract business users who realize that the cheapest $899 Surface Pro 4 (with no keyboard) actually has the same hardware specs of the keyboard-equipped $800 Spectre 2. My point is that HP has a great opportunity to not only win business clients away from Apple, but also from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Not every corporate IT manager will willingly accede to the high price tags of the Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Book 2-in-1 laptops. Besides, HP has decades-long of experience supplying laptops to corporate customers. If and when a company should decide to replace their old MacBooks, it will be more cost-effective to buy the Spectre 2 instead of the Surface Pro 4. HP's move to sign up to sell Microsoft Surface products was only a token gesture. HP will prioritize selling its own Windows 10 computers because HP could pre-install its own software . Yes, Microsoft will pay a commission for every Surface computer that HP sells. However, I doubt if Microsoft will allow HP to pre-install its commercial enterprise software products on the Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book. Like Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), I believe HP also knows that Microsoft's ambition to become a PC vendor makes it a rising rival that should not get any help. HP also sells top-end Windows workstations to attract designers, video editors, and CAD artists. HP's Mac To Z campaign has been going on for many years now. It aims to convert Mac Pro users to switch to the more cost-effective and more powerful HP Z Workstation computers. The focus on creating Mac Pro-level workstations helped HP become the leader (46.6% market share) in desktop workstation sales. HP's closed collaboration with leading software vendors like Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) and Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ) likely helped it optimize the Z Workstation computers to win the attention of demanding creative professionals. HP's cheaper alternatives to the Mac Pro also comes with an onsite 3-year warranty while the Mac Pro comes with a 1-year warranty. It means HP builds top-quality workstations that are absolutely worthy of multi-year high-compute abuse. The latest ZBook Workstation laptops are now also ready to encroach on the sector that the $1,999 MacBook Pro now reigns over. Upgrading the Mac to Z campaign to attack the top laptop of Apple is a shrewd move. The more affordable Windows 10 basic $1,099 ZBook 15u again comes with a touchscreen display. I opine that the HP ZBook 15u is a smart replacement for the MacBook Pro. Creative industry professionals will not only save a great amount of money buying Wintel HP Workstation computers, they also have the option of running Mac OS X El Capitan on them. Yes, HP sells its Workstations with pre-installed Windows or Linux operating systems. However, it's an open secret that many tech-savvy buyers now buy cheaper Wintel workstations like the HP Z840 to create a hackintosh . This is something that investors should take into account - Apple's decision to optimize its desktop operating system for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 processors made it easy to create cheaper hackintosh versions of the Mac Pro and MacBook Pro.s HPQ is a Buy. HP's long-term high-end PC business benefits from Apple's refusal to release a touch-enabled or a 2-in-1 Mac. The big-spending customers of Mac computers will not remain loyal forever. HP should exploit Tim Cook's blunder and really go after those Mac customers who are already dissatisfied with their Mac laptops and desktop computers. A strong focus on competing against the high-margin Mac and iPad Pro in the enterprise/creative market is better for HP's bottom line. Let Lenovo reign as the top global PC vendor with its focus on low-cost computers. HP will only suffer if it tries to match the bottom-pricing strategy of a Chinese PC vendor. Lastly, HP has decades-long track record of supplying reliable enterprise-centric laptops and workstations. This is something Microsoft cannot yet claim. Yes, the Surface Pro 3 was a trendsetting product last year that is winning the wallets of business users. However, I expect HP to leverage its relationships with its long-term enterprise clients to market its cheaper 2-in-1 laptops.
