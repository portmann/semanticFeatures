What's Most Impressive From Tableau Software's Q3 - Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) | Seeking Alpha DATA beat Q3 expectations and raised guidance. What makes this impressive is the increased competition DATA faced in Q3 from the likes of MSFT and AMZN. Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA ) did not miss a beat in the third quarter. Prior to these results DATA had fallen from a high over $130 to $80 on competition-related fears. However, Tableau management addressed those fears in a big way, which is unquestionably the most impressive development from its third quarter. Over the last few months there have been several big technology companies to enter the big data space. Investors knew about Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ), SAP (NYSE: SAP ), and that IBM (NYSE: IBM ) was flirting in arena, but the two companies that really seemed like a potential knockout punch to DATA were Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). As everyone knows, big data analytics and visualization are enterprise-focused services, and Microsoft is an enterprise juggernaut. Earlier this year Microsoft made several upgrades to its Power BI platform that allowed for increased collaboration between work groups and other Microsoft owned software. Therefore, Microsoft customers deploying Azure could simply add Power BI tools to attract Tableau's customer base. Microsoft made its Cortana Analytics Suite very diversified, and there's no question that this was seen as a big threat for Tableau. With that said, Microsoft was a big risk, but Amazon was an even bigger risk due to the scale and presence of its Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Amazon recently launched several new BI and analytics services that directly compete with Tableau. The big fear with this move, and with Microsoft, is that Tableau is a big data specialist whereas Microsoft and Amazon can offer cloud infrastructure services, big data services, and other enterprise services all from one platform. To make matters worse, DATA's core Tableau Server Product is available on AWS and the company has other products that interact with AWS. Nevertheless, these all seemed like very serious risks, problems for Tableau that could lead to unexpected and sudden deceleration of revenue growth or price cuts that ate away at margins. The fact that Tableau still grew total revenue and license revenue 63.5% and 57% year-over-year, respectively, while also beating EPS expectations and raising Q4 guidance is simply amazing given the push that Microsoft, Amazon.com, SAP, Qlik, and others have made in its core business. What Tableau proved is that enterprise customers still prefer its user friendly platform and that Amazon, Microsoft, and others must stop Tableau, not the other way around. While Tableau might be growing slightly slower than it would have otherwise without the increased competition, the company has proved that it is here to stay as a market leader, and with its stock still 20% off its 52-week high, there might still be further upside.
