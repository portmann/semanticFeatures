Microsoft: Intel-Less iPad Pro Is Not Yet A Threat To The Surface - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha The iPad Pro will allegedy use an ARM-based processor and iOS 9 OS again. Without an Intel processor to run x86 industry-standard productivity apps, the iPad Pro will still be a lightweight productivity tool. In spite of the upcoming release of the iPad Pro/iPad Plus, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) will continue to see robust sales growth for its Surface table/notebook hybrid. Evan Niu has a very myopic expectation that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will never be able to put Mac OS X on the iPad Pro. He thinks expendable vice presidents at Apple have the final say that Apple will continue to refrain from implementing multi-touch screen support for Mac OS X. The lack of multi-touch support is one of Niu's argument against my hypothesis that Apple ought to use Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 processors to make the iPad Pro a real productivity tool, especially for creative professionals. I'm not as smart as Niu but I'm happy that he believes Apple will continue to ignore the success of the touchscreen-enabled, Intel-powered, Surface tablet/notebook hybrid from Microsoft. Unlike the declining sales of the iPad, Surface sales are surging . Even prior to the release of the $499 Surface 3 , sales of Microsoft's Surface tablet was already bucking the downtrend of iPad/Android tablet sales last year. It's to the great benefit of Microsoft if Apple will really continue to let the Surface Pro 3 hurt the iPad Air/iPad Pro and MacBook's appeal to enterprise users. A stylus-equipped 12.9-inch iPad Pro with ARM-based processor that cannot run offline native versions of industry standard software like Microsoft Office or Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Creative Cloud CC software is an exercise in complacency by Apple. The Apple vice-presidents who said they will continue to offer only non-touchscreen Mac OS X computers (allegedly as a way to differentiate them from iOS tablets) also reinforces the future of the Surface. The trend now for most Windows/Chrome /Linux business-centric laptops is to have support for multi-touch screens and/or stylus operations. Unless engineers of Adobe, Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ) and Apple figure out a way to port x86-only software to run natively on ARM-based processors, a non-Intel powered iPad Pro or iPad Plus remains less attractive than the upcoming Surface Pro 4 . An iPad Pro that cannot run Adobe Photoshop CC or Final Cut Pro is not very useful to creative professionals. The bigger threat to the Surface therefore does not come from Apple but from other OEMs like Lenovo. The Windows 10-powered Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ) IdeadPad MIIX 700 is a clone of the 11.9-inch Surface Pro 3. It has 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD storage and Intel's latest 7-watt Skylake processor. Lenovo's cutthroat pricing strategy has helped it become the world's top PC vendor. Sales of the Surface Pro 4 will suffer once Lenovo starts creating clones of it. Unless Microsoft matches the thin-margin pricing tactic of Lenovo, Surface sales might suffer, especially in price-sensitive emerging markets. PC giant Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) also sells its own clone of the Surface Pro 3. Top laptop vendor Toshiba has the Portégé Z20 , which is again a replica of Microsoft's Surface Pro 3. MSFT is a buy . Apple's disinterest in creating Mac OS X computers is a long-term tailwind for Microsoft. The business users, creative professionals and ordinary people who bought the Surface 3 instead of the iPad Air 2 did so because of Apple's refusal to release a Mac OS X tablet or touchscreen-enabled MacBook. Microsoft's thriving Surface sales will not get derailed as long as Apple tablets remained limited by its ARM processors. Microsoft got it right when it decided not to use ARM processors from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) for its latest Surface products. Surface revenue was $888 million during the Q4 2015 period, 117% year-over-year higher than last year's. Sales to enterprise and educational markets helped boost Surface sales since 2014. I expect another double digit, 30% or more, sales growth for all Surface products for FY 2016. The $499 Surface 3 is still competitively-priced against Lenovo or HP's copycat products. Apple's addiction to high-margins on its computers and phones makes me believe the iPad Pro/iPad Plus will never be priced below $600. Algorithmic forecaster I Know First Research also agrees with my long-term positive long-term outlook for MSFT.
