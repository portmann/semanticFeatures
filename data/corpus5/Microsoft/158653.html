Intel Inside Smart Drones - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel’s $60 million investment in Yuneec Aviation could lead to advanced x86 processors getting inside smart drones. Intel’s RealSense technology can accelerate development of autonomous commercial drones. The recent $60 million investment in drone-maker Yuneec Electric Aviation gives Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) the opportunity to ignite the smart drone revolution . Yuneec is not as famous as DJI when it comes to commercial aerial photography/videography drones. However, Intel's entry could help Yuneec launch its first ever autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle product. As of now, Yuneec's top-of-the-line $1,400 Typhoon Q500 4K drone's best 'smart' feature is the Watch Me/Follow Me function. Adding the compute power of an Intel x86 Atom x3 processor could really smarten up Yuneec products and make them function more like intelligent flying robots. Like other commercial drones available in the market, the Yuneec Q500 4K uses ARM-based simple processors made by Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ). The dual-core Ambarella A9 Ultra HD 4K camera processor ARM Cortex-A9 is probably inside the Typhoon Q500 4K. Current drones still require a human to use a wireless controller to operate them. However, the advanced artificial intelligence programming capabilities of an x86 Intel processor offer manufacturers a way to come up with smarter drones which will not rely on extensive human intervention or GPS coordinates. The partnership with Intel could lead to Yuneec using a dual-computer system that uses an ARM-based processor for camera/video management and an x86 Intel processor for Smart Mode autonomous flight . 3D Robotics, which recently received $50 million funding mostly from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), uses a dual-computer system for its Solo drone product. Qualcomm and 3D Robotics are now in partnership to bring advanced computing to drones. Intel's deal with Yuneec is a timely answer to Qualcomm's strong interest in supplying drone-centric processors. Re/code reported that Qualcomm is offering its latest Snapdragon 820 mobile processor to drone manufacturers. Ambarella is the current go-to choice for drone processors. However, Qualcomm insists that a single Snapdragon 820 processor can replace the functions of the different processors used in drones today. Qualcomm also bought KMel Robotics last February. KMel Robotics was a start-up famous for developing swarm aerial robotics technology. Such aggressiveness of Qualcomm needs to be addressed with equal aplomb by Intel and Yuneec. MIT's Robust Robotics Group used an Intel Atom mobile processor inside an autonomous in-door navigating drone in 2012. Intel also demonstrated earlier this year that its in-house RealSense technology gives drones computer vision so they could automatically avoid obstacles when in flight. The distance measurement/3D depth-sensing feature of RealSense camera is similar in concept to what KMel Robotics did to program their swarm of quadrotor drones. Intel's small mistake is that it failed to snap up KMel Robotics. Intel helped KMel create its sensational YouTube video, Flying Robot Rockstars , last year. RealSense-enabled drones could also be programmed to work in cooperative or swarm mode. Getting hold of the swarm artificial intelligence algorithms improves (the winning chances of) the $60 million bet on Yuneec. Intel could perhaps hire Vijay Kumar. Kumar was the robotics professor who helped the graduate students who created KMel Robotics. The swarm concept for autonomous drones has great potential in industrial and military applications. The U.S. Navy is testing its Project LOCUST (Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarming Technology). LOCUST is the navy's concept weapon for autonomous warfare using killer smart drones that hunt in packs. As of now, Intel is only proposing RealSense-enabled drones for surveillance or for the repair of navy ships. With Vijay Kumar's help, Intel and Yuneec could also probably create a swarm of very smart killer drones. Ascending Technologies, the first drone maker to use RealSense technology, says drones can be equipped with up to Intel Core i7 processors. Complex swarm artificial Intelligence programming requires high compute power. We all know that an Intel Core i7 has higher compute processing power than a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. The upcoming Skylake-U products from Intel has a Core i7 processor with a TDP of only 15W. Energy efficient x86 processors coupled with RealSense hardware/software could deliver the perfect smart drone for autonomous warfare and package delivery. RealSense technology is already used in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Hello no-password method of unlocking Windows 10 computers. The facial recognition and gestures interaction of a RealSense 3D camera is therefore also applicable to military surveillance/attack drones. Automated target selection needs accurate facial recognition to identify hostile targets. Intel and Yuneec can still go toe-to-toe with DJI in chasing the commercial/recreational market, but the big money is really in creating smart drones for the military market. The military market for drones is far more lucrative for Intel and Yuneec. Business Insider Intelligence says only 12% of the $98 billion that will be spent on drones in the next decade will be for commercial purposes. The partnership with Yuneec Electric Aviation is one more reason why we should all stay long on INTC. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, MSFT.
