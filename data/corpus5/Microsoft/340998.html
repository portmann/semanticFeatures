The most common reaction to signing an acquisition agreement is "congratulations!" Such congratulations often come from the very financial advisors who get paid for the deal, whether or not it works out well for the buyer. But the buyer's management and shareholders are the ones stuck with the deal once the ink dries. Under Steve Ballmer, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was given many such "congratulations!" for "winning" M&A battles (in the sense that it was willing to outbid anyone else). Microsoft valued aQuantive ( AQNT ) at 45x EV/EBITDA. It paid $6.3 billion and then wrote it down by $6.2 billion shortly thereafter. Overall, it took $14 billion of write-downs in four years. Other tech companies such as Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) have continued their frantic pace of price-insensitive purchases followed by inevitable write-downs. But not current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. He does not appear to see acquisitions in the same way. Most recently, enterprise messaging startup Slack wanted to sell to Microsoft for $8 billion. Discouraged from signing by Bill Gates, Nadella walked away from the deal despite enthusiasm from Microsoft's applications and services team. Instead of shelling out for Slack, Microsoft will invest in its own Skype business so that it can better compete with Slack in voice and video services for businesses. Slack will be fine; it has already fielded 10 takeover offers. But Microsoft is making it clear that it won't overpay. Ballmer would probably have bought salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) as well as Slack. Nadella's discipline and price sensitivity have enriched Microsoft's owners who are over 50% richer since he was appointed CEO. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this unBallmer-like behavior? Steve Ballmer who is now worth over 23 billion in large part is due to the change of direction charted by his successor. Nadella has been wise to stick closely to Gates on deal strategy. On November 6, 1980, Gates signed what may have been the greatest deal contract in history, creating an operating system for IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) PC on a non-exclusive basis. Gates slipped in the clause that allowed him to sell the operating system to others. No one at IBM objected... BASF ( OTCQX:BASFY ) is looking at making a takeover bid for DuPont (NYSE: DD ). Meanwhile, here is where things stand on the DuPont deal with Dow (NYSE: DOW ). The second amendment to the S-4 has been filed for the Newell (NYSE: NWL ) acquisition of Jarden (NYSE: JAH ). Shareholder votes are in April 2016. The $0.79 net arbitrage spread offers a 7% annual return if the deal closes in May. The preliminary S-4 has been filed for the Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) acquisition of Allergan (NYSE: AGN ). It pulled its HSR application on February 26 and re-filed it on February 29. The $36.56 net arbitrage spread offers a 15% annual return if the deal closes by year end. More to come in future editions of M&A Daily ...
