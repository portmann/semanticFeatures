Microsoft Is Dead Money - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's P/E is the highest it has been in a decade. Reason being, the market is anticipating a sharp rise in EPS over the next 12 months. However, it's more than likely the market will not bid up the stock any further, waiting to see what analysts think the company will do next year. As a result, even as Microsoft continues to do well, the stock at current prices is too juicy for any further run-up. One reason is if there is a fundamental change in the company and you expect its stock price to deteriorate as a result. Another reason might be if growth metrics have changed. For the most part, current stock prices reflect future growth prospects. Many times investors fixate on the past, disregard what might happen in the future and continue to hold their position, and find themselves with a position that either underperforms, or loses money. Another reason is because a stock has run ahead of itself. While growth, current profits, and future prospects might still be intact, many times the market rushes ahead of itself and bids up a stock more than warranted. In most cases, such a stock underperforms or produces losses for investors in the future, even if nothing fundamental has changed with the company. In Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) case, the last two paragraphs are what will determine the future trajectory of its stock. While there was a lot of fanfare from analysts as a result of MSFT's current quarterly results , what is important to notice is that growth has been derailed. Please notice that revenue for FY'16 Q2 was down significantly y/y, as was FY'15 Q1 and FY'15 Q4 on a y/y basis. In fact, MSFT's revenue for FY'16 Q2 is not significantly higher than what it was at the end of 2012. MSFT is one of the most followed stocks around. As a result, it is also one of the most heavily covered stocks by analysts. And while MSFT does surprise us here and there, for the most part, analysts get it right (on a revenue basis at least). So if we look at what analysts think MSFT will do in the future, the stock's growth prospects are not that rosy. According to the consensus (data from yahoo.com), analysts believe Microsoft will book about $22 billion in revenue for the quarter ending March 16 (y/y growth 1.6%), and about $23 billion the quarter after that (4.3% y/y growth), with revenue for the entire year coming in at about $92.6 billion, which is negative to the tune of 1.1%. To be fair, however, analysts do see growth for FY 2017 by about $5.4%. Also to be fair, while the current trailing P/E of Microsoft is about 38, the 12-month forward P/E falls to about 17. So analysts expect a big rise in EPS, even if revenue does not rise as much. Reason being, Microsoft's product mix is changing. The company is gaining ground in the cloud space, it is more involved in making and selling its own hardware, and is also in the gaming space. All these activities are of higher added value than the product mix the company had several of years ago. However, the question remains, by keeping your position and holding the stock, will you see much in capital gains over the next 12 months or so? I think not, even if the company is performing quite well. Now remember markets are forward looking and are future discount mechanisms. Especially for stocks like MSFT - where the entire analyst community is able to come very close to predicting what will happen in the future - most, if not all, of MSFT's future activity is baked in the stock already. MSFT is at its highest in a decade. Like I said, the market expects MSFT's EPS to increase considerably over the next 12 months, therefore, it is bidding up the stock and discounting the stock's value today. However, unless Microsoft can replicate this increase in EPS over the next 12 to 24 months, chances are its P/E will not be much above that. Also, the P/E of MSFT over the past decade has been between 8.5 and about 25 (not counting the current rise over the last 2 years or so). So in other words, MSFT's multiple will not be this high forever. If this year's rise in EPS will not be replicated next year, chances are the P/E will fall a lot as a result although not unnecessarily the price of Microsoft's stock. Then again, there is another reason to hold on to MSFT, and that is a shrinking float, right? As you can see from the above chart, even a shrinking float has not prevented the stock from trading at a P/E ratio far below of what it is trading today. In my opinion, a shrinking float cannot save any stock when it is overpriced. And that is the case today with MSFT. My guess is investors in Microsoft's stock have at least 12 months of dead money ahead of them. Unless we get some insight as to how the company will perform over a 24-month horizon (and I for one do not have such insight), I think the market will wait to see what analysts think MSFT might do next year, and then decide to bid up the stock or not. In the meantime, however, the stock will probably go a little up and a little down, but not really doing much, as it is killing time so the stock price can catch up to the fundamentals. No, I do not think MSFT can fall by a lot - unless we get a major market correction - however, I do not think it will do much of anything for at least the next 12 months. If that's okay with you, continue to hold the stock. If not, and you think you might do better buying something else, sell MSFT today and wait for at least 12 months, and re-evaluate the situation then.
