Apple Moves To Shore Up iPad Line - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is expected to introduce a successor to the iPad Air 2 in March. The need to halt iPad's sales decline seems to be driving the new iPad to be a smaller version of the iPad Pro. One of the more disappointing aspects of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) December quarter earnings report was the nearly 25% y/y decline in iPad unit shipments. Apple has clearly needed to do more than introduce the iPad Pro. Apple's next-gen iPad Air will be part this effort. Only, it won't be called iPad Air 3, if rumors are correct. Instead, it will be identified as an iPad Pro model, but with a 9.7-inch screen. Whatever the device is to be called, it will be considerably beefed up from the iPad Air 2. Rumor has it that it will receive the A9x SOC from the iPad Pro, and feature support for a detachable keyboard and Apple Pencil as well. As of my recent article on the iPad Pro , I had been expecting features such as Apple Pencil support to make their way into the rest of the iPad lineup. The rumor indicates that Apple is moving out fairly aggressively to enhance the utility of iPad. There have been rumors for some time of a March event, and it's now thought that the new iPad will make its debut then. Why the lag time between the large-sized iPad Pro and this new mid-sized version? I really think it was just due to A9x availability. The A9x is thought to be fabricated exclusively by TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). TSMC was still ramping their 16nm FinFET process as of the end of the year, and there just weren't enough of the A9x processors to go around. From the rumors, it appears that the mid Pro will share a very similar design to the large Pro with quad stereo speakers, and smart keyboard interface along one edge. Presumably, there will be a smaller smart keyboard to go with the mid Pro, but I can't imagine why anyone would want it. A smaller, more cramped version of the flimsy, plastic, Smart (Dumb) Keyboard is the last thing the world needs. Apple Pencil support, on the other hand, looks to be an easy sell. It's more compact and lighter than a keyboard, and well suited to text input as well as drawing. The mid Pro is in some ways better suited as a note taking tool than large Pro. I fully expect Pencil support to spread to all three sizes of iPad, which suggests that a mini Pro is also on the cards. In my last article on the iPad Pro, I spent a lot of time examining the issue of iPad Pro as a productivity tool compared with the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro, or any of the other Windows 10 tablets or convertibles that feature Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processors. Not to belabor the point, but the productivity gap between iPad Pro and Surface Pro (and similar devices) is still there and isn't going away. I can understand Apple not wanting to paste touchscreen capability onto Mac OS X. Apple seems to want to focus on iOS as its platform of the future. It's more advanced, secure, and certainly more lucrative than Mac OS X. But if Apple really wants to broaden the appeal of iPad and keep it competitive with the host of Win10 devices running Intel processors, it had better do more than it's doing now. Yes, Apple is going to keep advancing its processor technology, which is already very impressive. Processing power isn't really the limiting factor. Most likely, the next (A10) generation will move out in front of Intel's Skylake. (But maybe Kabylake will stay ahead.) By A10, Apple should have sufficient processing power to compete effectively with Wintel tablets and convertibles, even those featuring Core M series processors. Yes, Apple is going to continue to endow iOS with new features and make it more useful on mobile devices. But can iPad really compete in productivity staying within the strictures of the iOS touchscreen interface? I really doubt it. At some point, Apple will need to relax its self-imposed edict against "convergence". It can do that either through iOS or Mac OS X, but I think iOS makes more sense. That probably means support for an on-screen cursor. Using an iOS device with a monitor or TV screen is fairly painless through video adapters or Airplay, but it's hampered by the need to look back at the iOS device to make touch input. Would support for an on-screen cursor (which Android has had for years), be such a terrible violation of the convergence prohibition? For the time being, apparently yes. I maintain hope for the future, however. There's nothing like having your revenue and market share chewed up in the maw of the Wintel juggernaut to change your mindset. It's happened before. My prediction about the spread of iPad Pro features to other members of the iPad lineup came true so fast because of competitive pressure. That same pressure can be expected to eventually force a more flexible position on convergence. Despite Apple's protestations to the contrary, every WWDC for the past few years has featured increased convergence between iOS and Mac OS X, and I don't expect this year to be any different. IDC in its year-end report on the tablet market had some interesting things to say about the iPad Pro. IDC observed that while the pure "slate tablet" exemplified by the iPad was declining, the "detachable tablet" (tablets with a detachable keyboard) was growing very strongly, as the chart below shows. Despite lukewarm reviews, the iPad Pro was the clear winner this season as it was the top-selling detachable, surpassing notable entries from Microsoft and other PC vendors. It's also important to note that the transition towards detachable tablets has presented positive opportunities for both Apple and Microsoft. This clearly demonstrates that Apple has gone in the right direction with the Pro and explains why the iPad Pro lineup is expanding. Market forces are driving this, and will continue to do so. Eventually, Apple will relent on its convergence stance, and provide iOS users with the full-fledged productivity platform they want. When that happens, the combined benefits of Apple's processor and operating system expertise I expect to get iPad market share growing again. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy.
