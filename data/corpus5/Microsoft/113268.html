Microsoft 'Mobilizes' The PC - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's write off of the Nokia purchase serves to confirm that it has a new mobile device strategy. While the write off was not good news in itself, the new strategy is. The new strategy is to convert as quickly as possible its current Windows PC ecosystem into a modern mobile device ecosystem. Reactions to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Nokia write off have ranged from admiring to harshly critical here on SA. What has been lacking in these reactions is an understanding of Microsoft's new mobile strategy and how it differs from the Ballmer era. Microsoft's strategy is to "mobilize," as in convert to the mobile device paradigm, its current user base of about 1.5 billion Windows PCs. This strategy has many near- and long-term ramifications, which I discuss in this article. Reactions to the write off have ranged from Salazar's admiring Microsoft: Nadella Continues To Lead With Distinction to Hartung's critical Microsoft: A $7.6 Billion Write-Off Plus Layoffs Are Never Good Signs . I found myself enjoying both articles and agreeing in part with both. However, what both articles seem to lack is cognizance of Microsoft's mobile device strategy going forward. This is understandable. Hartung correctly takes Nadella to task for not articulating a strategy. I consider Nadella one of the most intelligent, if not the most intelligent, CEOs in tech, but he has a tendency to wax philosophical. The result is vague pronouncements and a lack of specifics. Part of this I'm sure is deliberate. Microsoft simply doesn't want to divulge important elements of its mobile device strategy. So a lot of sifting of clues needs to be done, and the best source of information about Microsoft's future directions in mobile devices (and PCs) came from its combined Build developer conference and financial analyst meeting at the end of April. The keynotes for both meetings provide the best set of clues to work with. It was clear to me after watching the keynotes that Microsoft was in full retreat on the smartphone front. In past Builds, developers were treated to a parade of the latest Windows phones. Not this time. While Microsoft still displayed a willingness to be cross platform (Windows 10 on Raspberry Pi), the emphasis was all on Intel based mobile devices, mostly tablets or 2-in-1 convertibles. The most significant demonstration involving Windows Phone was a demonstration of the Windows 10 Continuum feature involving a Windows phone. When a desktop monitor was plugged into the phone, the phone "transformed" via Continuum to a desktop mode, with windows and desktop like apps. During the demo it was made clear that the phone wasn't yet available. I believe this is the case because it was running an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processor, probably of the Atom X3 class (formerly known as SoFIA). The ability to smoothly transform from a tablet (tile based) interface to a window based UI is the hallmark of the Continuum feature. Probably Continuum only works well on Intel-based devices. Another important clue to the retrenchment was the stated goal to have at least 1 billion devices running Windows 10 in 2-3 years. This was very telling. It conveyed to me that Microsoft has finally realized that its most important imperative is to retain as many of its current estimated 1.5 billion Windows users and convert them to the modern platform of Windows 10. How important this is to Microsoft can be seen in the fact that Microsoft is going to give away Windows 10 upgrades for the first year of release. At the developer conference, Microsoft promised important ecosystem features for Windows 10 that are really only possible if Win10 is predominantly an Intel-based OS. The first was a greater degree of backward compatibility with older Windows apps. The second was the ability of developers to create truly "universal" apps that would run on all Win10 devices, from phones to PCs. Both of these goals imply that Win10 is mostly an Intel OS. Combined with the discontinuance of Windows RT and manufacturing of the ARM-based Surface tablets, the focus has clearly shifted back to Intel. The latest Surface 3 tablet now sports and Intel Atom X7 processor. While Microsoft left the door officially open to making Win10 available for non-Intel devices, there doesn't seem to be much interest, either from OEMs or from Microsoft. In many ways, the process of mobilization is already underway in the Windows PC world. Most Windows PCs sold today are already to some degree mobile. They are laptops, ultralights, 2-in-1s or tablets that run Windows 8.1. I've long advocated that Microsoft switch to an all-Intel approach. This would allow Windows to achieve true backward compatibility with existing PC software, something that Windows on ARM devices could never provide. It also would allow true universal apps that would run on all Windows devices. In this way, Windows developers would automatically become mobile app developers for Microsoft sponsored mobile devices. With Windows 10, the very strong indication is that Microsoft has embraced this approach. Why be so cagey about it? Well, primarily because Microsoft is still trying to sell a lot of ARM-based Lumia phones, designs inherited from the Nokia era. I consider it inevitable that just as Microsoft switched the non-Pro Surface to Intel, Microsoft will switch its smartphones as well. Windows 10 is primarily about achieving mobilization of the Windows ecosystem. It solves the ecosystem problem that Windows 8 never could. With Win8 Microsoft tried to coax its existing PC developers into developing for its Windows Phone and Windows RT ARM platforms by consolidating the development tools into one Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Merely co-locating the tools in a single software package wasn't enough. The underlying hardware differences between ARM and Intel meant that much legacy Windows code simply wasn't portable to ARM devices. With Win10 universal apps running on a unified Intel architecture, the promise of "cross platform" compatibility that was never achieved in Win8 gets much closer to reality. There may still be some hiccups in porting a Win10 app from a desktop to a phone, but the process appears to be much easier than with Win8. Most importantly, the process also appears to be much easier than what Apple developers face in moving apps between Mac OS X and iOS, which, of course, do run on different hardware platforms. Here we see an important benefit of the convergence that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has so often disparaged. Based on recent events, the Build/Investor Meeting conference, and my reading of Microsoft's strategy, I think it's clear that Microsoft doesn't have particularly high expectations for Windows Phone this year. If the intention is to create a discriminator for Windows Phone through its desktop Continuum feature, this does at least offer something fairly exclusive. On the other hand, the desktop capabilities of the phone are likely to be very limited in the near term. There's only so much processing power you can squeeze into a phone. If Microsoft doesn't have very high expectations (in the near term at least) for Windows Phone, neither should investors. The focus for Microsoft is clearly where it should be. Gone is the Ballmer hubris of assuming that Microsoft could conquer smartphones as it had conquered PCs. The realization has set in that the crucial battle for Microsoft is primarily defensive: preserving what is still the largest personal computing ecosystem on the planet. "Mobilization" of this ecosystem is the right strategy for Microsoft. I expect we'll here more about how this battle is going at Microsoft's upcoming earnings conference call, to which I will pay careful attention.
