Apple: 5 Is The Magic Number - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Key numbers for Apple revolving around "5." Can Apple top $50 billion in revenues and 50 million iPhone sales? We're just a day away from technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reporting its earnings, Tuesday after the bell. The company is expected to report another quarterly revenue record on the heels of continued strength of the iPhone 6. This quarter, an interesting theme has developed, with many of the key numbers involving a "5." Today, I'll detail how this is the case and how Apple must overcome very high quarterly expectations. The iPhone is obviously the key to Apple's quarter, with my model calling for the smartphone to bring in more than 63.4% of fiscal Q3 revenues. In the first two quarters of the fiscal year, the company reported 46% and 40% unit sales growth for the device. Thanks to continued problems at Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), Apple is expected to keep up its strong growth. A 40% increase over last year's period would put this quarter's number at about 49.3 million. Many expectations are for a "5" to be the first print for unit sales. In fact, fellow SA writer Mark Hibben believes that Apple's will report its best fiscal quarterly growth rate this year, more than 50% growth to 53 million sales. I think that's a little optimistic, as there was a report about Apple raising product prices around the globe due to the stronger dollar. Fiscal Q3 will be the first full quarter where those higher prices would be felt, which I think could hurt demand a little. I think a reasonable expectation is a quarterly growth rate of 43%, halfway between Q1 and Q2, which gives us 50.34 million iPhone sales for the quarter. The second key "5" revolves around the Mac line, as IDC has estimated Apple had more than 16% year-over-year shipment growth to 5.136 million units. This would put Apple in fourth place for global shipments, a tremendous feat given the 11.8% drop IDC estimated for Q2. Apple needs to ship 13.3% more units in the quarter to top 5 million, but Gartner didn't even have Apple in its global top 5, implying less than 4.56 million units. Apple will have a sizable market share gain, but even growth of nearly 8% to say 4.75 million units or so would be impressive. With the PC market showing a huge Q2 decline ahead of the Windows 10 launch, I just don't see Apple matching its 14% or 10% Mac unit growth rates from Q1 and Q2, respectively. The third "5" comes in relation to the Apple Watch, the newest product which has received a lot of negative comments lately. While Slice Intelligence did report a large drop in US sales as the fiscal quarter continued, the firm's estimates still had Apple at about 3 million US units or so for the quarter. I think it is reasonable to believe Apple could sell 2 million units ex-US in the quarter, especially with some late quarterly sales from the second round of countries getting the device. That would give us a total of 5 million, although Apple management has said it will be tight-lipped about sales of this device early on. If we do get financial data on the Watch, it will be interesting to see if the device has an average selling price of $500 and brings in 5% of Apple's quarterly revenues. When adding all of my above numbers plus about 10 million iPad sales, I get a total quarterly revenue figure just below $51 billion. This is a bit above the analyst average, but there are a fair number of those expecting a print higher than $50 billion. For shares to see a new all-time high, the top line number probably needs a "5" print. The final "5" comes in relation to Apple's buyback. When management raised the amount to $140 billion earlier this year, the program had $60 billion left for eight quarters. That's an average of $7.5 billion per quarter. Apple's daily fiscal Q3 closing price was about $128.50, so an average buyback would mean around 58.4 million shares. How does management feel about its share price? The number of shares purchased for the quarter will tell us. A number in the low 50 million or less probably means management is saving some powder for a pullback, while a number above a "5" print would say shares are undervalued. When it comes to current expectations, analysts are expecting $49.26 billion in revenues and $1.80 in EPS, compared to $37.43 billion and $1.28 in the prior year period. The street is well above the company's guidance range for $46 billion to $48 billion for the quarter. When Apple gave that forecast for the quarter, the average revenue estimate was $47.06 billion. That number has risen more than $2 billion since, seen below. Analysts are now more than $1.2 billion over the top of Apple's range. Since Apple detailed it would be giving more realistic guidance , we've never seen expectations this high. As seen below, this is the most bullish analysts have been going into a report since Apple's guidance mindset changed. The analyst estimate figure is from the day that Apple reported the respective quarter with the fiscal Q3 2015 number being as of Monday. 2.63% doesn't seem like much, but it is when compared to the prior two quarters under 1.95%, and the rest under the top end of Apple's guidance. It's not just that Apple estimates are at an all-time high, but Apple also is the only company seeing this kind of optimism. The table below shows a comparison of estimates for tech giants and their respective calendar Q2 quarters since their last report(s). Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) beat lowered estimates, but the EPS beat was due to a one-time tax rate benefit. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) beat reduced EPS estimates, but still missed on revenues. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) have seen both of their estimates come down, while Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) has seen a slight revenue rise. Apple is the only name where estimates on both the top and bottom line have increased significantly between reports. When it comes to fiscal Q3, the magic numbers all seem to revolve around five. There's a lot of optimism regarding Q3 for Apple, but comparisons start to get tougher in the current quarter. Analysts are expecting $51.06 billion in revenues for Q4, a nearly $2 billion sequential rise. With two months until the next set of iPhones are available, guidance will show what management thinks of potential sales for new products and services. Fiscal Q4 is the last quarter where the company has a shot to show decent revenue and earnings growth. December ending Q1 is where sales comparisons from the iPhone 6 start to get really tough. Apple faces its highest bar ever, with analysts expecting the company to come in well above its quarterly guidance. A strong earnings report Tuesday could send the stock to a new all-time high. I'm looking for $50.97 billion in revenues and $1.86 in EPS, so let's see if Apple delivers.
