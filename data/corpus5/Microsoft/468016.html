Box: A Stock To Avoid - Box (NYSE:BOX) | Seeking Alpha Since it went public in 2015, Box has been a disastrous investment. In a volatile sector, its lack of competitive advantage is fatal in the long run. Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX ) has seen its share price plummet by 55% since its IPO in January 2015. Last month, the share price fell 17.7%. To put it simply: this is not an investment that a profit-oriented investor (and there are other kinds, if you want to believe the reasons certain breeds of activist investor provide for buying into a particular stock) would want to have made. So why has Box stock collapsed like this? Founded in 2005 and based in Redwood City, California, Box Inc. is a cloud storage and services provider with a market capitalization of $1.32 billion and a 57,000-plus client list including such firms as Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), Alere Inc. (NYSE: ALR ), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK ) and Flir Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR ). Box's primary function is to provide a platform for its corporate clients to share and store documents and to collaborate online in creating content. To their credit, Box has managed to grow its customer base, grabbing 3,000 clients in the previous quarter. And they have been able to grow revenue. However, cloud-based storage solutions are not enough to sustain a business and growing revenue has not translated into profit. These issues are central to the problem with Box as an investment. The sub-heading in this instance is key to why Box has been such a disappointing investment. The firm possess no real competitive advantage in the sector within which it operates. Cloud storage and service provision is a market with low barriers to entry, and competitors that Box has to contend with include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Every one of those companies are much larger than Box and each possess a huge portfolio of products and services that permit them to offer similar cloud services at a discount to Box, undercutting them. Box has attempted to collaborate with some of its competitors, such as IBM and Microsoft. In June 2015 , Box and IBM teamed up to create a number of cloud-based solutions for corporate customers. Box would benefit from access to IBM's portfolio of security and content management tools, which could enhance their own cloud offerings, while IBM could utilize Box's platform by integrating it into their MobileFirst applications. The deal with Microsoft, also announced in June 2015 , involved deep integration of the Box platform with various Microsoft applications, such as Office 365. However, this has not stopped Microsoft from releasing a Sharepoint upgrade which has mobile applications and which allows free migration from Google Drive and from Box. In short, these joint ventures into cloud service provision have not shielded Box from competitive threats nor have they enabled the firm to become profitable, something it has never been in the 11 years that it has been in operation. Box is currently trading at around $10 per share, and earnings per share are -$1.59 for the last 12 months. The price-to-earnings ratio is -6.70. Basically, there is no margin of safety with Box stock whatsoever. Net income figures over the past three years reveal a trend that makes it seem unlikely that the stock will recover any time soon. Although revenue has grown, with year-over-year revenue growth of 35.7% in the previous quarter, the operating costs and ongoing reinvestment into the firm means that Box remains unprofitable. For the period ending 1/31/2015, net income was -$168,227,000. For the period ending 1/31/2016, net income was -$202,948,000. Furthermore, Box has a high debt burden of $52 million, with a debt-equity ratio of 0.38. Over the past 12 months, it has had an operating loss margin of -66.4% and an average net loss of -67%. Suffice to say, the company is in no position to pay a dividend, so all that is left to offer shareholders is capital appreciation. And the stock's trajectory since the IPO suggests that this is an unrealistic expectation too. Box's joint ventures with IBM and Microsoft have not provided it with the financial viability that the company hoped for as the firm is still unprofitable and the share price continues to decline. There are no guarantees that things will improve in the long run, either: the tech sector is very fast-paced and companies must innovate constantly to stay at the forefront. Only two companies are truly battle-tested within the tech sector: IBM and Microsoft. The likelihood of Box Inc. joining these firms as venerable blue chips is very slim given its current status. It has almost no competitive advantage within the cloud storage and services sector, it has never been profitable in the eleven years since it started operations, it has huge debt, its stock offers no margin of safety, pays no dividend, and has little prospect of providing capital gains either. Since the IPO, its value has declined by more than half. Consequently, investors would be well advised to act as though this company does not exist.
