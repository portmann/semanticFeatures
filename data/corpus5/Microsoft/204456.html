Down 20% Since Earnings, It's Time For Fitbit To Track Higher - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit's one-two punch seems like the right strategy for the company's future growth. There is a decline coming at Fitbit, but it's not what you think. For those who believe Fitbit will be killed by the Apple Watch, there is one number you need to know. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) investors are likely split into two camps. Those who bought shares near the IPO price, are up roughly 30%. Anyone who bought shares right before the company's recent earnings release is down just over 20%. This is a perfect example of what Peter Lynch observed about stock prices. He said that sometimes the movement of a stock price in the short-term, has nothing do to with the fundamentals of the company. In Fitbit's case, there are 3 reasons to believe the stock will get back on track. The first reason to believe that Fitbit may be about to surge higher, has to do with the company's ambitions in the $11 billion corporate wellness business. The Fitbit brand is primarily thought of as a retail product, with most of the focus around gift giving, and New Years' resolutions. However, if Fitbit can continue to sign new corporate wellness agreements, the company's sales and earnings should become more stable. Businesses know that employees who are more active, are less likely to have as many sick days, and medical issues in general. Fitbit brings the company the ability to track employees' activity, and drive a more health aware workplace. The company's strategy seems to be working, and the good news for investors is, there is a long way to go. Fitbit said it inked deals with companies such as Geico, Transunion, and several financial institutions. At present, Fitbit has agreements with 50 of the Fortune 500 companies . To give investors some perspective, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) seems to have taken the opposite approach with the iPad in particular. While the iPad's sales were growing, the company's focus seemed to be on the retail buyer. However, Apple reported an 18% annual drop in iPad units sold last quarter. Ironically, Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) said he was excited about the iPad's future, because of the business applications it could be used for. By contrast, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Office suite has been a commercial staple for years. Today, it's rare to find a company not using standard Office file formats. As users gained experience using Office at work, the product picked up steam in the retail space. When it comes to technology, familiarity breeds use. The point is, Fitbit seems to be taking a page from both Apple and Microsoft's playbooks. The company is pursuing the retail customer by placing its products in over 45,000 stores . At the same time, Fitbit is pushing into the commercial space, by convincing businesses to provide fitness trackers to their employees. One challenge Fitbit will face is, it may have to accept lower prices to continue signing up corporate accounts. That being said, the company's one-two punch of retail and corporate growth, seems like the right strategy to give investors a smoother ride over time. A decline that investors may have missed The second reason Fitbit appears on track to resume its move upward, has to do with the company's share count guidance for the next few quarters. In a growing company, it's not usual for the diluted share count to increase, as stock-based compensation is a common tool to attract, and retain talented employees. That being said, companies that are free cash flow positive will many times repurchase shares as a way to return cash to investors. For example, Apple's diluted shares declined by 4.6% annually, while Microsoft retired 3.4% of its diluted shares . Fitbit is free cash flow positive, and there is a hint that it may put some of this cash to work retiring shares. The company's core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capex) in the last three months was over $23 million . In the current quarter, the company's non-GAAP diluted shares were 243 million. Next quarter, Fitbit expects diluted shares between 247 million and 249 million. However, for the full year, Fitbit expects a diluted share count of 235 million to 240 million. If this prediction comes to fruition, this would imply a decline of between 1.2% and 3.3% compared to this quarter. This seems to suggest easier EPS growth going into the company's back half of the year. The third reason to believe that Fitbit is ready to run is, the company's average selling price should continue to climb. It seems like the overarching worry about Fitbit is, related to the potential success of the Apple Watch. In the fitness tracking market, Microsoft's Band doesn't get a lot of press, but has many of the features of the Apple Watch for 50% of the price. The good news for Fitbit investors is, the Apple Watch and Microsoft Band aren't real competition based on price. In the last quarter, Fitbit's average selling price jumped from $63 to $88. Fitbit's most popular models were the Charge, Charge HR, and Surge, which made up 78% of sales. This is very good news for investors, as these devices sell for between $129 and $249. Fitbit said it is finally able to keep the Charge HR in stock. Since this model sells for $149.99, thinking that the Microsoft Band at $199, or the Apple Watch at $399, are serious competition, seems misguided. The bottom line is, Fitbit reported huge growth in the current quarter. The company's pursuit of both the retail, and commercial wellness market, seems like the right strategy. If the company's diluted share count declines by the end of the year, investors could be pleasantly surprised. In addition, the company's average selling price should continue to rise, while its component costs should come down over time. The company will need to continue to innovate with new and updated products to maintain its edge. That being said, Fitbit seems to be hitting its stride.
