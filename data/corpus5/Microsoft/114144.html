Microsoft Announces Power BI And Desktop Summer Update - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft will release its much anticipated Power BI "summer update" in 14 days and I couldnâ€™t be more excited. Power BI and Desktop (formerly Designer) aren't just important as stand alone apps they're important to providing a funnel to the productivity suite. Microsoft has evidenced with commitment to the Surface Hub that Power BI and Desktop might become base platforms that open up an entire suite of ancillary revenue and retention drivers. Microsoft delivered in a big way with this update and potentially swung the best of breed pendulum in its direction. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) will release its much anticipated Power BI "summer update " in 14 days and I couldn't be more excited. It also looks like the update won't disappoint. Let's break it all down. First, really understand how important Power BI is to Microsoft. Microsoft has one goal right now and that's to unify its platforms into one, synergistic, closed-loop ecosystem. The reasons why the company wants to do this are obvious. That said, I think its SMB/enterprise strategies - which under one umbrella could be called its business or non-consumer strategies - are even more important to its long-term viability than the company's mobile and gaming strategies. CEO Satya Nadella has made this an overt priority in recent weeks through multiple mediums . It doesn't take much deep analysis to understand why. Microsoft's golden goose is its (enterprise) productivity suite. This is a high margin, recurring and defensible revenue stream for the company that can provide a base level of financials for everything else to build from. What the non-consumer segments do is allow the productivity suite a larger funnel and a new, whitespace funnel. Prior to Power BI and the former Designer (now named Desktop), Microsoft largely wasn't in the data or BI game. Now, it is. And it isn't just "in" the game, it's an All-American. So, knowing this, Power BI and Desktop aren't just important as stand-alone apps they're important to providing a funnel to the productivity suite. Further, as Microsoft has evidenced with its commitment to the new Surface Hub, Power BI and Desktop might become (and I anticipate they will) base platforms that open up an entire suite of ancillary revenue and retention drivers. This is a big deal guys. Now that we're all up to speed, let's talk about the summer update. So Microsoft has been testing and implementing new changes to both Power BI and Desktop the last several months at a feverish pace. Clearly and definitively setting a new standard for itself - distancing itself from the long-dated, comprehensive iteration updates that have plagued some of the productivity suite in the past. This too signaled a shift to both SMB/enterprise AND to the consumer that maybe, just maybe a new-Microsoft is here. I believe one is. These updates culminated in a final surveying of users that literally asked us what we wanted from both platforms. We asked for web authoring and data exploration enhancements - we got it. Microsoft has included an update to make creating and formatting visualizations for dashboards and reports though the browser much, much easier. We wanted the ability to bring custom visualizations to the platform - Microsoft made Power BI open source via GitHub. Further, we wanted more visualization options, the ability to format by color, legend creation, label creation, etc., and we wanted new data source support with integrations - Microsoft completely enhanced Desktop to now include all of this. We wanted a continuation of content pack integration and availability - very importantly Microsoft announced new content packs from Adobe, Azure, comScore, Sumo Logic, Insightly, and so many more . Microsoft is also allowing Power BI pros and system integrators to build their own packs. I can't tell you how huge this is, but if you're a Power BI user, you already know. And what a statement doesn't that make about Power BI, Desktop, and really the entire company-wide push to (re)capture the non-consumer demand it once owned. I think it further makes clear the new-Microsoft that partners can expect to deal with. A company willing to embrace change, innovation, and best of breed even if it means that isn't inclusive of only Microsoft product. All of this culminates in maybe the most important upgrade. Power BI will provide support for groups, enabling team collaboration and sharing of Power BI content across work groups. This is an absolute game changer and something I've been calling for across the BI space. Whether it be Tableau (NYSE: DATA ), Watson (NYSE: IBM ), or Statistica (privately held Dell, Inc. - formerly DELL), I've asked the BI gods for more collaboration. Now, I don't have specifics as to what the collaboration will encompass entirely but what I do know is it will be enough to swing the pendulum of best of breed in Power BI's direction. Maybe this is going to take me using the update to figure out if Tableau has serious competition on its hands. What we do know from a collaboration standpoint is that Power BI has created a quasi-chat function in which groups can view and alter data. This isn't what I think is the game changer and this isn't unique to Power BI. What is, however, as far as I know - and I have at least a base level of familiarity with all the BIs I've mentioned, is that Power BI will now allow full Excel support, enabling users to both import Excel workbooks to build Power BI dashboards and reports as well as view these workbooks through Excel Online as part of the Power BI experience. Plus, if the collaboration update is inclusive of not just the group workbook capacity but also a chat function in-app, I would think Power BI will be the platform of choice. I've recently opined that Tableau should consider a merge with Slack and even went further to say that salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) should buy Slack at any reasonable valuation all in an effort to establish a platform as the collaboration platform. Collaboration, in my opinion, is the missing piece to a BI being differentiated and the platform of dominance. I just think that would set a platform apart. It appears that Microsoft might be a first mover but again that much is unknown at this point. All told, though, this summer update was more than I could have expected. I think it speaks extremely well to the new-Microsoft that I've promoted in this article and that Nadella has promised the world. I also think Power BI can become exactly what Microsoft needs it to become - an introduction to the broader productivity suite and a base platform for ancillary revenue segments. Say what you will about some of the other core competencies at Microsoft, and some are more than deserving of the well-advertised criticism, but the SMB/enterprise segment is gaining momentum and is becoming a mission critical set of apps. I find myself more and more impressed with the suite as the company updates it and as I become more familiar with the overall cross functionality. I'm bullish Power BI and Desktop, and I'm bullish what it can do for Microsoft as a whole. I'll continue to update readers as new developments take place.
