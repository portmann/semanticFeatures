Microsoft Joins The Mobile Virtual Network Operator Industry - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Microsoft is preparing its pay-as-you-go Windows 10 mobile data service. The first version of the Windows 10 Cellular Data app from Microsoft only works with laptops and tablets. It also requires a Microsoft-branded SIM card. Windows 10 tablets with SIM card slots makes them more competitive against the iPad and Android tablets. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) might be plotting to augment its business by creating its own prepaid cellular data service. The Cellular Data app is hinting that manufacturers would eventually release Windows 10 products with SIM (Subscriber Identification Module) card slots. The Microsoft SIM will let people choose and buy prepaid mobile/cellular data plans from different telecom providers. I like the probability that the company could one day become a competent MVNO in the U.S. The MVNO industry in America is very healthy , with many players piggybacking on the nationwide networks of AT&T (NYSE: T ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), and Sprint (NYSE: S ). If dozens of players in the industry have been able to survive in America, Microsoft could also certainly build its own niche-focused MVNO. Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) now sell their own brand of SIM cards. It is only proper that Microsoft also builds its own MVNO division. There is money to be made in an MVNO service that could be leveraged through the company's excellent pool of enterprise clients. Even with the revenue sharing deal between Microsoft MVNO and the telecom partners, the economic benefit of millions of people doing repeat purchases of $5-30 prepaid cellular plans is a long-term winning proposition for Microsoft. If we estimate the company will get 20% cut from its MVNO partnerships, the future global annual revenue stream could be substantial. Microsoft, given its vast resources and clients base, has the potential to build a worldwide MVNO business with 30 million or more customers. If we estimate that a Microsoft SIM customer spends an average of $15 on his prepaid monthly cellular data, the company's potential monthly 20% cut could reach $90 million. My $1.08 billion/year estimate is reasonable because of the still-developing global MVNO market. Unlike other developed countries, the U.S. is also a growing market for these services. According to a 2014 report (pdf download link) from McKinsey, there were MVNOs or non-network operators in the U.S., but they only have 14% market share of the mobile internet business. Focusing On A Lucrative Niche Market Like Business Users The Microsoft MVNO's initial build-up could be done through enterprise channels. The company and its Windows 10 OEM partners could bundle the Microsoft SIM with hardware/software packages. Aside from selling software and hardware to enterprise clients, it could make good money from also selling cellular data services to corporations. The threats of industrial espionage and random hack attacks means there's a niche market for MVNOs who could provide flexible cellular data services. Public access Wi-Fi hotspots in hotels, airports, and other unsecured locations are not ideal for travelling employees whose laptops/tablets contain sensitive data. The business of mobile internet services is no longer the sole monopoly of telecom operators. Hardware/software vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are the best cellular data providers for consumers. Microsoft could offer many freebies to attract and retain the loyalty of MVNO customers. The other benefit of selling the Microsoft SIM is that it would also help improve the market viability of Windows 10 laptops/tablets. The pricey Surface Pro/Book Windows 10 products are popular among business users. However, they still do not have cellular data capabilities. By making Windows 10 products SIM card-friendly, the Surface computers become more attractive than SIM-card equipped Android and iOS tablets. I expect the company to also encourage its OEM partners to produce Windows 10 products with SIM card slots locked to work only with Microsoft SIM/Cellular Data app. Third-party carriers like Verizon will have to sell prepaid cellular data plans exclusively through Microsoft's Windows 10 store. Microsoft gets a commission from products/services bought through its app store. The Microsoft MVNO will eventually serve Windows phone users too. The Cellular Data app and Microsoft SIM should also work in Windows 10 Mobile devices. The idea is similar to what Cherry Mobile did here in the Philippines. Cherry Mobile, the biggest smartphone vendor in my country, launched its own prepaid SIM card in partnership with Globe Telecom last November. Cherry Mobile excelled in selling low-cost Android/Windows phones and tablets. It also has its own app/media store for mobile phones users. However, the company still needed the extra income from putting up its own MVNO brand to improve its operating margins. The same scenario applies to the emerging MVNO ambitions of Microsoft. This company has long-term benefits if it could also monetize the mobile/cellular data usage of all Windows 10 device owners. It is given that smartphones will always outsell tablets/notebooks. The growth prospect of the upcoming Microsoft MVNO is therefore a lot better if it also caters to all future Windows 10 Mobile handsets. The people who only buy unlocked sub-$200 Windows 10 phones are still potential customers for the Microsoft SIM. They could become repeat customers who spend $1-10/month for prepaid cellular data plans. On the other hand, the people who buy expensive Surface Pro products are the ideal customers for a postpaid Microsoft SIM. Xiaomi launched its own postpaid $10/month Mi SIM service last September in China. Microsoft could also replicate this and offer a postpaid version of its SIM card. Microsoft doesn't have a competitive mobile advertising business that could catch up with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet. It also has a far weaker app store economy compared to the iOS and Android platforms. An MVNO business might therefore be the better course for the company to find new sources of revenue. Like Apple and Alphabet, Microsoft has vast resources to help improve the growth of virtual mobile networks in America. Instead of relying mostly on tier-1 carriers to sell its products, the company should instead build its own MVNO to directly market its hardware and services. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
