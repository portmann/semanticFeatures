Yahoo: Low Bids Wouldn't Be Surprising - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Reports indicate bids could be in the $2-3 billion range. As delays mount, revenues continue to dwindle. Recently, the drama surrounding the bidding process for Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) has seemed to heat up a bit. Reports have indicated that bids for the company's core could be as low as $2-3 billion, well below the $4-8 billion many were originally projecting. If these reports turn out to be true, investors should not be surprised given the company's continued struggles. As the process continues to drag on, the company continues to see its top line estimates dwindle. With the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) spin-off failure setting the company back for 2015, the core business has fallen further behind rivals. Even a change to GAAP revenue estimates failed to prop up analyst forecasts. In the chart below, you can see how revenue expectations have dropped a bit over the last 10 months. Non-GAAP EPS estimates also have fallen. (Source: Yahoo Finance analyst estimates page) While Yahoo continues to move toward mobile, the firm's desktop business is losing out to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). If you take a look at the comScore archive , Yahoo's desktop search share was in the high 12% area and even at 13% during the first half of 2015. In the first few months of this year, the company has struggled to keep its head above 12.0%, so it wouldn't be surprising to see an 11 handle sometime this year. Another hit to Yahoo came recently when AT&T (NYSE: T ) announced it was unwinding a 15-year partnership with Yahoo instead going with Synacor (NASDAQ: SYNC ). One analyst recently estimated that the deal was worth about $100 million annually, much of which went straight to the bottom line because it required minimal resources from Yahoo. The above linked article states that according to eMarketer, Yahoo will claim just 1.5% of the global online ad market this year, down from 2.4% last year. That's a tremendous rate of change, which certainly explains why the Street is looking for Yahoo revenues to fall by more than 9% this year. Earlier this year, I stated how the Marissa Mayer era needed to come to an end , and I feel even more confident in that statement now. Results continue to struggle, plans for the Alibaba stake were a disaster, and the company continues to sit on more than $5 billion in cash. Yahoo could have at least bought back some more of its shares, but there have been no repurchases over the past four fiscal quarters. Mayer earned $36 million last year, according to reports, but is she doing anything really to earn that sizable check? If it turns out that bids for Yahoo are coming in low, don't put me in the group of people who would be surprised. As each quarter passes, the core business gets weaker and weaker, and management's lack of strategy seems to be making things worse. Yahoo lost a key deal with AT&T recently, while the company sits on billions in cash. Potential bidders may be realizing that there isn't much to work with here, probably a key reason why Yahoo shares have underperformed peers Microsoft and Alphabet as well as the Nasdaq over the past two years (as seen below).
