AMD: June 29th Release Of Polaris Just One More Step On The March To $10 In 2017 - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha At Computex 2016 AMD announces shipping of Polaris products on June 29th. Polaris based RX480 will be $199 retail less than half the price of competitive products. On May 31st AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) made a presentation at Computex 2016 in Taipei. During that presentation AMD demonstrated both of their new 14NM products, Polaris for GPU's and Zen for CPU's. These latest products place AMD right at the forefront of new lower priced VR (virtual reality) and desktop products. This is another good-news event following others such as the closing of the Nantong-Fujitsu deal for $320 million (" AMD Closes Nantong Fujitsu Joint Venture, Now Is The Time To Buy "), the signing of a Chinese Joint Venture (" AMD: The Good News Continues ") and two potential new game console contracts (" AMD: New PlayStation 4 And Xbox Consoles Should Boost 2017 Results Significantly "). In this article I will explain why this continuing good news is a trend and not an aberration as some would lead you to think. Raja Koduri, SVP and Chief Architect at Radeon Technologies Group (he's pictured above) explained how the new Polaris product the RX480 would be available on June 29th at a bargain price of $199. He then went on to explain the market for Polaris products going forward. As part of the presentation he brought in (via video) software developers from Doom. They were very upbeat about Polaris' potential as seen by these comments: "Want to play Doom on your laptop on the train home? Polaris plus Vulkan is going to make that possible." That was followed by Jim Anderson, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics at AMD. Anderson explained the latest iterations of AMD's APU line (not Zen) for desktops and laptops. And he brought out three representatives from large customers Microsoft, HP and Dell. Microsoft is interesting because they buy CPU's from both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) for their Surface line of laptops and from AMD for their Xbox game consoles. One has to wonder will the combination of Polaris and Zen lead to some AMD sales for Surface products in the future? Stay tuned. HP and Dell are interesting because they already use AMD APU's and combined represent $18 billion worth of Intel's sales in 2015 (per Intel 10K ). Compared to AMD's 2015 sales of less than $4 billion that represents a significant market opportunity for AMD's Polaris and Zen products. And that does not include Lenovo, another AMD customer that bought $7 billion in products from Intel. It would only make sense that AMD customers using the current product line successfully would be interested in buying even more technologically superior products in the future. Five percent of that $25 billion would be a game changer for AMD. Another common complaint of AMD critics is it has not announced a ship date for Zen yet. They imply this means a 2017 time frame. AMD actually ran a Zen desktop at Computex although admittedly it was portably cobbled together for the show. However the ever conservative CEO Lisa Su made this statement: "We expect to sample Zen to our priority customers in a few weeks and more widely available sampling in the third quarter." I am certain "priority customers" include the above mentioned HP, Dell and Lenovo. And sampling in June almost certainly means something shipping thus year. Yes the volumes will probably be small but the positive PR will be very large. No, AMD will never have the gross margins of Intel and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). In 2015 AMD's GM was about 28% vs. Intel's 62% and Nvidia's 56%. However in 2011 AMD's GM was 44% and they made .66 per share. I think their margin will expand to the mid-forties range with the new products. It will never be as high as the others because of their large and expanding semi-custom business including game consoles. But with their much lower CAPEX and OPEX AMD's margins will be able to climb back into the mid-forties going forward. And at that rate earnings should be at least $1.00. AMD continues to deliver on its promises while its critics continue to look in the rear-view mirror. In the past the company was often times pathetic, lacking direction and incapable of delivering quality products. But Lisa Su and her executive crew are now delivering on their promises and with a relentless focus are making headway in every department. The latest is Radeon RX "on shelf June 29th". With predictions of being cash flow positive in the 2nd half, $1.5 billion in semi-custom contracts beginning to ship next quarter, new game console contracts coming and now Polaris shipping superior low-cost graphic products AMD shorts must be getting nervous. A short squeeze should be here before the end of the year driving the price over $5. If you found this article to be of value please scroll up and click the "Follow" button next to my name.
