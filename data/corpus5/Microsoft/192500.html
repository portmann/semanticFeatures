Dear Google: Intel Can Build Your $50 Android One Phone - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Seeking Alpha Intel is now helping vendors like Cherry Mobile Create sub-$50 Android phones. Spreadtrum, in which Intel has a stake, is also helping vendors create $22 Firefox OS smartphones. Due to Apple's enthusiastic support for mobile browser ad blocking on iOS devices, Google has an urgent need for greater Android One phone sales. The Android One project was intended to expand the mobile advertising channels of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The pure Android OS in Android One phones was to guarantee that no Android OEM partners will try to steal advertising eyeballs from Google. The enthusiastic support of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for iOS Safari ad blocking makes it more urgent for Google to further increase the presence of Android One smartphones in the world. While Google sells premium handsets $275 stock Android OS phones like the Nexus 5 , it also tried to popularize $100 Android One handsets in India last year. Unfortunately, the MediaTek-powered Android One phones from Google's OEM partners in India failed to attain commercial success. The low market appeal of $100 stock Android OS phones prompted Google to reboot its plan. The company now intends to propagate Android One phones with $50 price tags . The problem now is MediaTek has yet to offer a processor to make it possible for Android One phone manufacturers to meet the new $50 Suggested Retail Price (SRP) of Google. While Micromax and Spice agreed to play minions to Google's $100 Android One ambition, those two India-based firms will find it very hard to make a profit in selling $50 stock Android OS handsets. Unless Google offers Micromax cash incentives or ad revenue sharing, there is no compelling reason for the latter to support the $50 Android One idea. Even if MediaTek supplies super cheap processors, Micromax would still rather sell its own brand of $50 Android phones and get paid by third-party companies to pre-install their apps. This is more financially viable than giving Google's Android One project a free ride. The better solution, therefore, is for Google to ask for help from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Like its approach with the Nexus, Google will just have to go all-in on its $50 Android One phone project. Google only needs to hire one or two sub-contractors to build its own $50 Android phone. LG ( OTC:LGEAF ) or Huawei could assemble the $50 Google phone and use Intel's super-cheap Atom x3 processors. I'm proud to report that my country's biggest smartphone vendor, Cherry Mobile , has teamed up with Intel to create an Android phone using the 3G-enabled Atom x3 processor . The Cherry Mobile MAIA Fone i4 has an SRP of only 1,999 pesos ($43). Cherry Mobile is Google's official partner for Android phones here in the Philippines. After the initial success of the first carrier-backed $100 Cherry Mobile One Android One handset, Google asked Cherry Mobile to release the more expensive $130 G1 Android One handset last month. Google also recently launched the $190 BQ Aquaris A 4.5 Android One smartphone in Spain and Portugal. I support its move to offer higher-priced Android One handsets. However, I still say the company has a compelling reason to make its $50 Android One phone a reality. The more people that uses a stock Android OS device, the more advertising eyeballs that Google could own. Intel and Cherry Mobile's $43 Fone i4 could serve as a template to create a little more expensive Android One version using the Atom x3. I believe that a $7 more expensive version of the Fone i4 will give it 1GB of RAM. More RAM should boost its performance as a stock Android OS device. ASUSTeK ( OTC:ASUUY ) has had great success with Intel-powered Android phones since last year. Intel's 64-bit virtualization of Android has helped Asus create 1GB RAM-equipped phablets and phones that run fast even under Asus's Custom User Interface and the usual bloatware of its own pre-installed apps. I hope Google will soon trust the 28nm 64-bit Atom x3 SoC that ARM-based semiconductor firm Rockchip helped design . Intel and Rockchip have created a dirt-cheap x86 mobile processor that is as energy-efficient as any MediaTek entry-level ARM processor. But just in case Google is still not fully convinced that an x86 chip from Intel could perfectly run on stock Android One phones, there are the Spreadtrum ARM-based processors. Intel owns 20% of Spreadtrum's parent company, Tsinghua Holdings. I'm sure Google and Intel can persuade Spreadtrum to sell its entry-level 64-bit ARM-based chips for $50 Android One phones. Cherry Mobile is using Spreadtrum's single-core 1.0GHz Spreadtrum SC6821 processor to help it create the 999 pesos only ($21.5) Fire OS smartphone, the Cherry Mobile Ace . I believe a single-core Spreadtrum SoC could decently run stock Android 5.0 OS if Google will give it at least 1GB of RAM. The threat of Fire OS smartphones is bigger than that of Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Tizen platform. Unlike Samsung, which is still by itself on Tizen, other companies are actually really selling Fire OS phones. The $50 Android One mission of Google is, therefore, also a defensive manuever against dirt-cheap Firefox OS smartphones. Intel's x86 chips helped Google Chromebooks win big in the education market. This is the peerless advantage of using x86 processors - they are compatible with almost any modern operating systems. Google knows all too well that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is ignoring the Atom x3 and Atom x5 for its Lumia smartphones. Google could really negotiate an advantageous supply contract with Intel, because that chipzilla is desperate to increase its market share in smartphone application processors. Microsoft continues to rely on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragons for its entry-level sub-$100 Lumia phones. I would appreciate it if Google uses Intel's dirt-cheap Atom processors to counter the threat of the $80 Windows 10 Lumia phones with $50 Android One handsets. Nadella's shift toward a freemium strategy requires Microsoft to be more like Google. Microsoft wants to sell as many Windows 10 devices as possible for data gathering/ advertising purposes. Microsoft aims to have 1 billion Windows 10 devices as soon as possible. Nadella's ambition further aggravates Google's future in mobile. Windows 10's free licensing adds to the threat of the iOS platform, which is now increasingly being antagonistic over Google's multi-billion dollar income from advertising to iPhone/iPad users. The person who could only afford a $50 Android phone is still a precious pair of real advertising eyeballs. Google needs the $50 Android One handset to further increase the 1.4 billion number (of people who already have an Android device). Unlike Apple, I do not think Google will ever allow greedy third-party browser extension developers to make selling ad-block tools on Android One devices. I rate GOOGL/GOOG as a Buy . This advertising behemoth's stock has outperformed its mega-cap peers this year. The majority of investors believe Google was, and still is, the grandmaster when it comes to digital advertising.
