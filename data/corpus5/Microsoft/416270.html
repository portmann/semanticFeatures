Microsoft, Facebook to build highest-capacity trans-Atlantic cable - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha May 26 2016, 13:18 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Microsoft ( MSFT -0.8%) and Facebook ( FB +1.2%) are teaming up to lay a new subsea cable across the Atlantic to set a new standard for trans-Atlantic data transfers. The MAREA cable combines eight fiber pairs and an initial transfer capacity of 160 Tbps, and is designed to be openly interoperable with a variety of networking equipment. It will run 6,600 km and take a more southerly route than other systems, connecting Northern Virginia to Bilbao, Spain, and then to other network hubs in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Telxius -- the infrastructure unit that subsea veteran Telefonica ( TEF +1%) is considering giving an IPO this summer -- will manage the new system. I have the same question, chinkchink.  With all the "dark fiber" from the dot-com/ telecom bust still laying around unused how can this be monetized?
