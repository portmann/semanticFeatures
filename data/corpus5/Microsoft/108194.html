Microsoft's Exit Out Of Display Advertising: A Win For Shareholders - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is exiting the display business and is gaining search volume from a transaction with AOL. This bodes well for Microsoft as search is a higher margin business, and scaling that business is extremely easy given Microsoft's expertise in hyper scale cloud. The various efforts to improve financial efficiency won't negatively impact growth as the company has demonstrated that it can be disciplined in scaling various businesses without reducing productivity. The stock remains a buy as the next fiscal year has positive earnings catalysts, the stock is relatively inexpensive and the company pays a reasonable dividend yield for income oriented investors. Honestly, I'm not really surprised that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is exiting out of the display advertising business, and who could blame them? The company hasn't been able to grow that business unit for years, as a new wave of competition came with better ad-targeting, greater availability of ad-inventory and more flexibility when it came to conversions. In other words, Microsoft over-extended into markets that weren't a part of its core competencies. Looking over the eMarketer table here, one can conclude that Microsoft fell behind over the prior three years as its market share declined from 3.9% to 1.7% in 2015. The declining share, and the immaterial amount of revenue Microsoft does generate ($440 million) explains why Microsoft isn't all that willing to commit more resources to a market that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) continue to dominate. Part of the problem with Microsoft's display advertising business is that it doesn't have enough scale in comparison to globally dominant web and mobile platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Furthermore, Microsoft doesn't have any real cost synergies to make the unit perform better aside from Bing. But unlike Bing, Microsoft's display advertising unit is more labor intensive as it's not a self-serve platform. Therefore, Microsoft's decision to completely abandon the market makes sense as it's not a rapidly growing unit for Microsoft, and attempting to compete with Facebook in social networking, YouTube in crowd sourced video and Twitter in micro blogging makes zero sense. All of these properties have been taken, and if you play the game of monopoly long enough, you find out that it becomes next to near impossible to buy out other monopolies or expand into parts of the board that have already been taken over. The lessons from that board game also translate into the boardrooms of big tech companies too. Of course the Microsoft display unit must have some value, and I'm guessing that instead of shutting the unit down Microsoft could turn around and sell the business to a strategic buyer or make a strategic trade. Microsoft is shutting down its Web display advertising business and handing operations over to AOL Inc. and AppNexus Inc., a person with knowledge of the matter said. About 1,200 jobs at Microsoft will be impacted, with some positions to be moved to AOL and AppNexus, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn't yet been announced. Some people will be offered other positions at Microsoft, while other jobs will be cut, the person said. Judging by the commentary from Bloomberg, they mention that a deal is in the works. So, it's not like Microsoft is deriving zero value from exiting the business as AOL has emerged as a key frontrunner to absorbing the company. In return Microsoft will be gaining search query share as AOL and various AOL properties will use Bing as the default search engine. So if they can create some value from the trade, while also lowering operating costs, that's a huge win. After all, Bing's costs are more or less fixed, and the cost of scaling the business plays into Microsoft's core strengths as a nimble data center provider. So, increasing traffic onto Bing, a platform that's easier to manage and has higher margins, while spinning off a non-performing unit sounds overwhelmingly good for Microsoft shareholders. Meanwhile, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) will try to use this incremental share in display ads to gain more of a foothold in the digital advertising market. The stock has been in a bit of a slump lately, which is partially driven by broader selling and continuing uncertainty over interest rates and Greek contagion fear. This is reducing confidence in global equity markets. There's also China, which has limited impact on U.S. investors, but fears of a lending bubble have led to a massive sell-off in Chinese equities. The weakness in foreign equity markets also has weighed on the performance of U.S. blue chip stocks in recent weeks. Despite the weakness in broader macro, I believe the underlying fundamentals of Microsoft remain attractive and will withstand the various downward moving forces. I also disagree with the comments of fellow SA contributor Brian Nichols: Long term I view Microsoft's willingness to exit a fast growing $74 billion market as a major problem. After all, spending on the cloud is forecasted out to 2019 where it becomes a $191 billion market according to Forrester Research. While large, that'll hardly carry the valuation of a $360 billion company. If you look at the figure for cloud, it would have to be inclusive of various cloud-based apps, like mobile apps and non-mobile apps like Office 365. From that context, Microsoft already corners a huge chunk of the global revenue share for various software that run on an annually recurring revenue model, like Windows Server for example, and Windows-as-a-service for commercial clients that want to mass license the Windows OS across a swath of computers. So, yes the market that was described by Forrester Research is what currently carries Microsoft and will continue to carry Microsoft into the future. Hence, Brian's remarks on the topic of cloud are inaccurate because a huge chunk of Microsoft's future earnings and revenue growth will come from Azure, Windows as a Service, Office 365 and various other enterprise apps that will be launched over the next three years, or are in the early growth stages like Power Business Intelligence. Microsoft has already converted many of its commercial clients into an annually recurring revenue model, and when you consider that falls under the broad definition of "cloud market," it becomes easier to understand what company already dominates the cloud (Microsoft). This is a market that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has difficulty penetrating into and Google has yet to come up with a licensing or direct sales model that works for its various web-based apps. Even bond rating agencies like Microsoft's business model more in comparison to the competing alternatives (Google and Apple) as Microsoft's credit rating has the coveted AAA rating. All the doom mongers sound either ridiculous, or extremely short sighted, as Microsoft's competitive moat is similar to a high-functioning oil producer (Exxon Mobil) and a company that owns a wide spectrum of biomedical and consumer non-durable products (Johnson & Johnson). In other words, Microsoft's business isn't on the brink of collapse, nor is the outward growth trajectory unappealing. Sure, it's recent spree of acquisitions have resulted in some charges on intangible assets, but those minor accounting blips should be excluded to smooth out the prior year comps and make current and prior year earnings easier to compare even if it were to be done on a non-GAAP basis. From that context, Microsoft is still doing alright, and FY 2016 will be better on consumer licensing due to the transition to Windows 10. To conclude, Microsoft's business is in a solid position and its efforts to reduce the size of non-performing segments have been interpreted negatively. There are very few mature tech companies that can notch respectable top line and bottom line growth rates over a sustained period of time. The company also trades at a seemingly reasonable valuation and pays a dividend yield that's competitive to long-term treasury yields. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on the stock.
