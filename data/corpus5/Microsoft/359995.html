Apple Will Increase Its Dividend This Month, But Don't Get Too Excited - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple updates its capital return program in April. This typically includes a dividend increase. Due to its free cash flow generation and low payout ratio, AAPL is ripe for a solid raise. But the level of the increase might be smaller than some expect. Apple's hands are tied because the vast majority of its cash is held offshore. And, management prefers to utilize the bulk of its capital returns for share buybacks. Each year in April, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) updates its capital return program. While the company does pay a dividend, which yields slightly less than 2%, its past two annual dividend increases were below what one would normally expect from such a prodigious cash flow generator. At first glance, there seems to be no reason why Apple can't raise its dividend by 20% or more. After all, other technology giants with less impressive growth in recent years, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), have had little trouble raising their own dividends by 15-20% in recent years. But there are some very significant caveats Apple investors need to know, particularly for those who want AAPL to raise its dividend at a high rate. Apple is very likely to hike its dividend again this month, but here's why investors should temper their expectations. Apple generated $23 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter alone. Despite not having a major new iPhone release to benefit from, the company still grew revenue by 2%. The results would have been even better if not for the strengthening U.S. dollar - constant-currency revenue increased 8%. This was a very healthy growth rate in a challenging global environment. And, Apple is generating solid growth from new products and services. Apple's Services business, which includes iTunes, the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music, grew revenue by 26% year over year. Separately, revenue from Apple's "Other" category, which includes the Apple Watch, iPod, Beats, and the Apple TV, was up 62%. In fiscal 2015, the company generated a whopping $70 billion in free cash flow, up from $50 billion the previous year. Its free cash flow growth over the past several years is truly a thing to behold. Last year, the company distributed $11 billion in dividends, which equated to a minuscule 16.5% payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow. And yet, Apple raised its dividend by 10% last year, and by 7% the year before. Those are decent enough increases if this were a stodgy consumer staples company. But for a company with the growth and financial strength of Apple, these raises likely disappointed income investors, and they set a precedent for AAPL shareholders not to get carried away when it comes to the dividend. A lot has been made of Apple's massive cash pile. Indeed, the company held $215 billion in cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments on its balance sheet at the end of last quarter. In theory, this cash would be a natural choice for supplying investors with higher dividends. But, unfortunately, while Apple's huge cash hoard is certainly impressive, it's largely not available for dividends, because the vast majority of it is held offshore - $200 billion of it to be exact. In order to bring this cash home to use for dividends, Apple would be subject to a significant repatriation tax. It has (understandably) shown little to no desire to do this. The next rational step then, if Apple were still intent on giving investors a large dividend raise, would be to take out debt and use the proceeds to fund its dividend program. It has already done this, and Apple's balance sheet reflects its use of leverage in recent years. In fact, at the end of last quarter, Apple had $63 billion in total debt on its balance sheet. Compare that to Apple's financial condition as recently as the second quarter of 2013 when it had zero total debt. Expect A Raise, But Don't Get Too Excited Not only is Apple's ability to raise its dividend by a large amount hindered by the fact that most of its cash is held offshore, and that it has already levered up its balance sheet, but investors also need to remember that management prefers to utilize the majority of its capital returns in the form of share repurchases. Since Apple embarked on its current capital allocation program in late 2012, it has so far returned $153.1 billion to investors - just $38.7 billion of it for dividends, and the remainder for share repurchases. Indeed, share buybacks have been an increasingly large slice of the Apple pie. As a result, Apple's ability and desire to provide stronger dividend raises may not align with investor expectations. I fully expect Apple to raise its dividend once again this month, but keep in mind this isn't Microsoft or Cisco. Expect Apple's 2016 dividend raise to be closer to 10% than 20%.
