Why Microsoft Remains A Solid Buy - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft reported a decent quarter, growth will be flat, but earnings are still durable. The company will gain some tax advantages from its recent restructuring, and the recovery in revenue will be driven by high growth businesses and FX stabilization in FY 2017. The stock experienced some headwinds throughout FY 2015, but the broader weakness in equities were the primary driver for weak YTD performance. I still like Microsoft, because it's a safe technology play trading at a reasonable valuation. The management team is conservative, and the stock is pretty resilient despite the market environment. Following the announcement of earnings the stock has held up quite fine. While, I'm not pessimistic on the company's upcoming fiscal year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) needs to develop more efficiency with its R&D, and look for ways to further expand into software related services. The high growth categories will likely offset the decline in consumer licensing revenue, and a more normal pattern of growth will likely emerge in FY 2017. However, there's no denying the company faces key competitive challenges in PCs, which will negatively impact the topline growth rate unless if Microsoft were to price more aggressively going forward, and mitigate the competitive disadvantages by generating greater productivity in its software design. The stock has been surprisingly resilient. Assuming the market eventually recovers the stock will likely pick-up some momentum going into the back half of the year. The 20-day moving average has been providing a lot of support, and while Chinese equity markets have continued to roll over, I don't think it's a precursor to a major sell-off where equities on global aggregate underperform. I project earnings to be flat in the next quarter, but could swing slightly into the positive assuming favorable FX impact, and aggressive cost restructuring. Reducing cost was the primary theme throughout the conference call, as it's extremely hard to beat prior year comps unless if Microsoft is able to report OpEx at the low-end of the range. I anticipate EPS to come in flat year-over-year. The revenue headwinds was mostly due to foreign exchange and partially driven by weaker consumer licensing revenue. However, the decline in consumer revenue will likely be shored up over the next five years, as the company has high growth business units that have reached enough scale to materially impact earnings favorably. I think Azure, Skype, Bing, Xbox, and Surface will be the primary drivers of growth going forward, whereas a mix-shift to office 365 will result in short-term revenue deceleration, but will accrue in meaningful revenue once a large enough of a subscriber base is reached. I think commercial licensing revenue, i.e. Windows-as-a-Service, and Windows Server will continue to grow at perhaps mid-teen growth rates, and other adjacent services for the enterprise will grow at a much higher pace. These factors will allow Microsoft to pivot into a growth business following fiscal year 2016, as the foreign exchange headwinds are expected to fall in the second half of FY 2016. Another saving grace was the company's low effective tax rate, which will likely hold up based on their creative tax strategies in foreign markets, and their recent $8.438 billion restructuring charge, which will result in a 15-year amortization period in which the effective tax rate will be reduced, as costs are going to be inflated by $562 million per year. However, the GAAP accounting treatment will be recognized in FY 2015 Q4, but the on-going tax benefits, i.e. the effective tax rate will be lowered for the next 15 years. However, those same costs are only going to be recognized in FY 2015 and will not be carried over into the next 15 fiscal years. The company had recorded $10 billion in total restructuring charges in FY 2015, so when spread out over 15 years costs are expected to be inflated by around $666 million, which will improve net income by $238 million, based on my calculation. Efficiency has been an on-going issue The company still outspends many other companies on R&D and it's not clear whether they've been able to generate meaningful results with that spending. I think a huge component of the R&D is being wasted. Just how many software engineers do they really need? The engineers just make minor adjustments to the user interface and reduce the lines of code needed to execute a command, which is important, however, this could be done with a much leaner organization. Sure, they could use stronger data security analysts, and more white hat hackers to identify holes in the software, but when it comes to the actual design of Windows not much has changed, and the feature additions have done more harm than good over the years. This trend will likely reverse in Windows 10, but going forward, Microsoft really needs to refocus the organization away from tweaking the OS to perhaps game development, or application development. There's more room for productivity enabling software, so building on that bread-and-butter franchise is more important than wasting resources on an overly bloated development team in operating systems. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is able to get by with a much smaller software deign team while creating relevant features for the average Mac user. My guess? Apple has a more productive workforce, and a better process for getting things from alpha to beta then into full release. The window isn't dragged out, which forces the teams to quickly develop and implement software, as they're going to be rolled out on an annual cadence versus Microsoft, which rolls out major feature additions every four years. The big releases have actually slowed productivity, and it's why Microsoft has looked flat footed since Mac Yosemite, and soon to launch El Capitan. In other words, it's hard for Microsoft to compound its know-how or expertise when they're not quickly releasing software. They've needed to transition the commercial business to a cloud business model, for quite a while now, because now it incentivizes them to quickly release updates rather than bundle updates based on the timing of upgrades. The mix shift to other commercial revenue is progressing smoothly, so given enough time I think Microsoft will roll out updates on a quicker cadence, which will allow the company to advance its OS much more quickly. Microsoft will rely on app store billings to replace some Windows revenue from consumer, and will also sell more applications as a part of the Office bundle. Of course, they've opted with the price tier strategy, in which they only collect licensing on Windows OEMs for devices above a certain price point, so they're already in the early innings of restructuring the business. I think Microsoft had a decent quarter, and while the company isn't blowing out Wall Street figures, they're still appeasing shareholders who want a very conservative style of management. The company's earnings are very diversified, which is why the argument over consumer licensing is moot, because it's not the biggest segment in terms of revenue, and composes about a quarter of all revenue. The decline in revenue will likely be mitigated with growth in the remaining segments, and when foreign exchange stabilizes the company will begin to report better numbers. In light of those factors I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation. It's a safe tech stock to hold onto, and the dividend yield and valuation are pretty good.
