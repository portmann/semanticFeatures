3 Things That Will Save Intel's Future - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is in a state of flux, but is its future really as bleak as investors and analysts assume? Where is the company positioning itself for the future, and how long will it take them to recover from the current decline? Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is in a state of flux. Just a quick look at recent articles on SA will tell you how bearish the sentiment has become, with some even going to the extent of predicting doomsday scenarios. Declining PC shipments have, indeed, taken the wind out of Intel's sales (pardon the pun), and the company is desperately looking for revenue streams outside of their core PC-based business. But how bad is the reality of the situation? How low will the chip maker go before it catches the next wave of success - and where will that wave come from? Intel is banking on their data center business and Internet of Things to get them out of trouble. With the company's mobile overtures failing to make the cut, Intel is more dependent on these two segments than ever. IoT is still in nascent stages, but the market is expected to explode in the next decade. Can Intel ride that wave to success? And how long will IoT take to compensate for the loss in their core segment of client computing? These are the key questions I will try to answer here. Before we start, let's look at some numbers around their current revenue segmentation and where IoT stands in relation to that. At the end of first quarter 2016, Intel's Internet of Things group had $651 million in revenues accounting for nearly 5% of total - that's $286 million more than what the company earned at the end of first quarter in 2013 . That's 78% growth in three years' time. Though the double-digit number looks attractive, it's still a long way from the over-50% growth rate the cloud industry is witnessing on a quarter over quarter basis. The reason I compare it with cloud is because these two industries are inextricably intertwined in a symbiotic relationship - IoT needs cloud in order to be truly accessible and cloud needs IoT in order to grow to its full potential. So, for now, Intel has a majority 55% of its revenue coming from its client computing group while less than a tenth of that comes from their presence in the Internet of Things space. The question now is: can Intel grow its IoT business as fast as its PC-based business is slowing down? First things first. What is the Internet of Things? To put it in simple terms, Internet of Things is a network of connected data-harvesting devices that can convert every measurable action into data and then collect, store, transmit, analyze and exploit that data to identify patterns and trends to ultimately create actionable intelligence - or, in some cases, cause actions to occur based on that intelligence. As you can clearly see, there are at least two parts to the IoT equation: one is the data generation and movement part, and the other is the data exploitation part. Companies such as Intel and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) fall squarely into the former part because their products help in the gathering, assimilating and transmitting that data into subsequent parts of a typical IoT system. There's a lot of hype around how fast the Internet of Things will grow, and there are even estimates that say it will be a $7.1 trillion opportunity by 2020. I think (and I have this on good authority - from IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) General Manager for Watson Internet of Things, Chris O'Connor, whom I interviewed earlier this week) that it may even be as high as $10 trillion. But the problem is, that's not revenues they're all talking about. According to Technology Business Research , total IoT revenue of the top 21 companies - which include Accenture (NYSE: ACN ), Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Dell, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ), GE (NYSE: GE ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), HPE (NYSE: HPE ), Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), OBS, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), SAP (NYSE: SAP ), Siemens ( OTCPK:SIEGY ), Symantec (NASDAQ: SYMC ), Telefonica (NYSE: TEF ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) - grew 14.8% year over year in 4Q 2015 to reach $6.7 billion. That's $6.7 billion spread across 21 companies, so each one only has a small piece of the pie. Intel's slice is less than a tenth of that pie - at $651 billion for Q1 2016. As for their growth in this segment, we already know that it took them three years to go from $370 million per quarter to $651 million per quarter - or 78%, as I mentioned earlier. That's a CAGR of 20% in an industry that has been growing at 14.8%. Keep that in mind as I now show you how fast their PC-based business is declining. So that $7 to $10 trillion figure I spoke of earlier is not the revenues that will be generated but the total volume of business that will be impacted because of the Internet of Things. Now, on to the PC side of Intel's business. How Bad Is The Downward Slope For The Client Computing Group? On the surface, it doesn't look too bad. Like most retail products, PC sales are cyclical and typically heavier during the second two quarters of the year. But if you look at their TTM revenues at the end of 2015 versus 2014 (table below), you'll see a loss of about $2.65 billion. That's about a 7.6% loss YoY - another figure to keep in mind. Investor-speak: Where Does Intel Stand, and Should You Buy or Sell? In summary, the gap between increasing IoT (and data center) revenues will need time to offset the decline in their core segment. Here's a summary of what we calculated above: IoT revenue is growing at a rate of 20%-plus year-over-year against an industry growth of 14.8% - a sign that they're at the leading edge of the IoT phenomenon. Client Computing (sales) is declining at nearly 8% year-over-year against an average industry decline (PC shipments) of about 11.5% . If you extrapolate that in a linear fashion, it will take them until the year 2034 for IoT revenues to fully compensate for the chip-related income decline. From that perspective, it looks like a lost cause. But there are other factors that come into play, and these are what we should pay special attention to because they make all the difference between a company on its way out and a company that will claw its way back up. First, personal computers aren't going to suddenly drop dead and make way for an exclusively mobile world. There are still things you can't do easily enough on a mobile device that's a breeze for PCs - like writing this article and submitting it to Seeking Alpha, for example. I can't do this effectively on even the most expensive mobile or tablet in the world, but I can do it on the cheapest PC in the world - which probably runs on an Intel chipset. The 11.5% decline in shipments is not sustainable and it will eventually stabilize. Second, IoT growth will accelerate even faster as we approach critical mass that everyone agrees will happen around the year 2020, when estimates put public cloud revenues at around $167 billion, up from $80 billion in 2015. Intel already is at the front end of that growth, so they'll continue to grow faster each year. That current rate of 20% CAGR is only going to get bigger by the year as the industry itself accelerates. With more than 20 big companies in the fray and hundreds more providing various components for IoT systems, that's inevitable. Third, their data center group also is growing at a healthy rate and will accelerate as more companies move to the cloud and the top three cloud players - IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Google - keep expanding their data center footprints around the world. Another point is that the company has made a $16.7 billion investment to acquire Altera , a specialist in field programming gate array (FPGA) technology, which allows quick reconfiguration of servers for varied workloads - something that is critical in a cloud data center environment. And yes, this segment will grow with or without Google . Combine these three scenarios and this is what we have: The offset between IoT growth and PC decline will happen faster over time, and the aggressive growth of cloud data centers will provide additional floor support for declining revenues. In my opinion, it will take at least five years for us to see the net positive effect of these on Intel's top line, but most of the downside has already been priced in at a forward P/E of 11.4 . My recommendation is simple: you can buy now on a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) over the next two to three years, but you'll need to wait another two to three years to see your investment start to pay off. After that five- to six-year period, I expect cloud and IoT to be significant top line contributors while their core PC business gradually takes a back seat to give them a dependable, albeit slow-growing, foundation. The senior management team has been shaken up lately by the exits of the IoT and Client Computing heads, but it seems that the board needs to shake the tree even more so the real fruit-bearing branches can grow in a healthy way moving forward.
