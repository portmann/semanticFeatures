Why Microsoft Is The New Apple, Except For The Valuation - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Jae Jun , Old School Value Stock Analysis Software (848 clicks) Why Microsoft's strategic shift to combine software and hardware is working. My intrinsic value range for Microsoft. I only have an old iPad 2 that I got from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is my second biggest holding and I outline why Apple is an obvious buy . 100% of my laptops have been Windows and I don't own any shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) - yet. Now that I'm a firm believer in Microsoft's shift into the hardware space, I'm having a big case of "shoulda woulda coulda" for not having bought Microsoft in the $20 to low $30 range. First, my biggest error was assuming that Microsoft would be stuck where it was forever. If you just look at the stock chart, it's easy to think that because Microsoft was stuck at $30 for a decade. Second was dismissing Surface Pro and their entry into the hardware space as a short-term test. "It's done nothing for 10 years, I've got plenty of time. I'll look into Microsoft when there is nothing else to invest in," I told myself. Keep in mind that I have no interest in making this into a tech gizmo article about specs, performance, future products and comparisons of the new Surface product line with the Macbook. What is happening and is becoming more obvious with each Surface model is that Microsoft's entrance into the hardware industry is revitalizing the PC space. Apple has shown how successful the business model is. Outside of the phone and computing industry, it's common sense to provide your own software and hardware. The Bloomberg Terminal provides HW and SW for a massive amount of money and is entrenched in the financial industry. Square provides fantastic looking and functioning credit card swiping hardware with quality software. Fitbit has a gorgeous user interface that functions seamlessly with the HW. GoPro will be stupid to distribute Adobe Premier Pro as their video editor. So it doesn't make sense to claim that Microsoft is copying Apple. To put it politely, Microsoft woke up from a 10-year beauty sleep. Just a few years back, it was unthinkable that Microsoft would be competing with their hardware partners like Dell and HP (NYSE: HPQ ). But you can't hide the cold hard facts that PC shipments dropped 11% last quarter and have declined for 14 quarters straight. But Microsoft did what no other PC manufacturer was able to do. They created a product that broke boundaries and illustrated the capabilities of their software. This is why Microsoft will succeed and why I'm a firm believer in them now. Until recently, pureplay hardware companies could only take their products and "innovation" to what the fastest chip was, how light and thin they could make the product. Their thinking and innovation was constrained to hardware specs instead of seeing beyond and breaking through convention. The Surface Pro and Surface Book is a glimpse of Microsoft's newfound sexiness and control over the entire product development. Microsoft is already a dynamite free cash flow machine thanks to Office, Windows and Enterprise business. The Office subscription model is growing and now add hardware revenue growth that is sprinting forward. Three years ago, the Surface business generated a whopping zero. Today, it's up to $3.6 billion in sales. (click to enlarge | Source: old school value ) At the moment, no company comes close to Apple in terms of FCF and the amount of money they hold, but this is a whole new revenue and FCF stream for Windows that is growing quickly. When you put the $3.6 billion in sales into context, it makes up less than 4% of total revenues today, but my sneaking suspicion is that it won't be so negligible in 3 years time and it will be another huge push to the bottom line. Microsoft Is Expensive With High Expectations ... Compared To Apple I would never have imagined saying this, but Microsoft is more expensive with higher expectations than Apple. Apple's only receiving a multiple of 10x EV/EBIT. Its highest multiple in the past 10 years was 27x in 2007. Microsoft ended 2015 with an EV/EBIT of 17x. The highest it has ever been in over 10 years, higher than Apple and above the industry average. P/FCF is at 16x which is outside of my desired < 15x range. Goes to show how quickly market sentiment can change for a stock. To prove this, one of the best ways is to perform a reverse DCF. A reverse DCF will show you what type of growth is expected from the current stock price. It makes it easier to understand whether a stock is over or undervalued. Looks like the market is pricing in a growth rate of around 16% for Microsoft. Office is a moat. Windows is a moat. Enterprise ecosystem is a moat. In the reverse DCF, I used the GAAP net income number as that's what the market uses to price stocks. Combine all these different angles of looking at valuation and the fair value range I get here is $52 to $67. Waiting For A Bigger Margin Of Safety In terms of margin of safety, a fair vale of $67 isn't out of the question, but it also requires a lot of things to in Microsoft's favor. Valuation is both art and science, and from the experience of having valued hundreds of stocks, my senses tell me that Microsoft is more in the mid $50 range. It also makes sense from a probability stand point too. Predicting the time to hit $55 is out of my control and valuation is a moving target. Even if I took $55 as my target, it only offer a 14% margin of safety to the current price. My fair values could drop or it could increase but my investment philosophy is to be disciplined and not chase. I miss out on a lot of investments, and by waiting for Microsoft to fall lower to be within my margin of safety buying range, I could be missing out on a great opportunity. But at the same time, having the willpower to say no and sticking with basic principles has saved my bacon plenty of times.
