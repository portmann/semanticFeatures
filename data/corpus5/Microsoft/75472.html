3 Reasons Office 365 Is A Key To Microsoft's Growth - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's Office 365 cross platform capabilities are a critical factor to future success. Truly unlimited storage and a top productivity suite equals a huge value for Microsoft customers. For years, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Office productivity suite was a software product that lived on the hard drive of each user's computer. Today, the Office 365 suite still gives users that PC based experience, but with far more perks. In fact, Microsoft has increased the value proposition behind Office 365, and now there are 3 reasons this service is a key to the company's future growth. Not that long ago if you wanted Office on an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Mac you had to settle a somewhat outdated software package. Many Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) proponents still scoff at the idea of paying for Office 365 when they can use Google Docs for free. Still other users might save their work from an open source solution like OpenOffice to their Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Cloud Drive to avoid the issue all together. On the mobile side of things, there wasn't such a thing as Office apps on iOS. Android users had Office apps, but they were limited to smartphones and not full featured. Even once Office came to the iPhone, iPad users were left using the web versions of the Office programs. The first reason Office 365 is key to Microsoft's growth is the productivity suite can now be used on all devices with similar capabilities. There are slight differences in format of course, but in large part if you want to get work done, it no longer matters what device you use. This is a more significant development than some investors may realize. First, it means that Microsoft's Office suite and the huge profits from its sale are no longer limited to PC or Mac users. A few years ago the idea that someone could subscribe to Office 365 from iTunes or Google Play would have been laughable. In Microsoft's last earnings report, consumer revenue increased 8% but was held back by weakness in the Windows division. Going forward as Windows revenue stabilizes (from the pre-XP support levels), Office 365 stands to generate a bigger piece of the Consumer & Devices pie. The fact that this cross platform idea is working is obvious from the number of Office 365 users. In the last year, Office 365 users jumped by more than 180% to 12.4 million . This level of growth is significant because users that are subscribing to the service are less likely to switch to a competing option. In addition, these subscriptions allow Microsoft to generate predictable annual cash flow as opposed to unpredictable upgrade licensing sales. When Office 365 only offered the user multiple installs of these Office programs, it might have been difficult to justify this price relative to $139 for a single software license. Many Google users would laugh at the idea of paying $99 a year for something that Google Docs does for free. Apple users might look at the option of paying around $20 each for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote and think Microsoft users were crazy. However, the value proposition changed dramatically late last year when Microsoft announced OneDrive would offer "unlimited cloud storage to Office 365 subscribers." This is the second reason Office 365 is a key to Microsoft's future growth. Popular cloud backup services by companies like CrashPlan or Carbonite cost around $60 a year. To purchase 1 terabyte of storage through Google or Apple costs $119.88 and $239.88 respectively on an annual basis. Amazon offers unlimited storage for $59.99 a year. That being said, at this price Amazon offers no productivity suite, and also limits video storage to videos of 20 minutes or less . With the top productivity suite and unlimited storage at a price its competition can't match, Microsoft should continue to see increased growth in its Office 365 user base. That is very good news for Microsoft's future earnings, and could steal customers from Amazon Cloud, Google Drive, and iCloud all at the same time. Did Microsoft just hurt PCs and improve its chances in the tablet and smartphone business? As if the PC business didn't have enough problems, Microsoft might have just struck another blow toward the death of this business. Ironically, this is the third reason Office 365 is the future of Microsoft's growth. Each of the companies we've looked at has a business model that encourages users to move toward cloud based solutions. Amazon Prime uses cloud storage for Amazon Prime Video, as well as Amazon's Cloud Music and Photos. Google's Drive, YouTube, and Google Docs are all cloud based solutions. Apple's iCloud is based on the ubiquitous availability of information. That being said, Office 365's unlimited storage combined with tablet and smartphone apps for Office begs the question…why use a PC? As more customers move toward using their smartphone and tablets, and Microsoft continues to develop better Office apps, users won't need a traditional PC to be productive. Since users also won't have to worry about localized storage, hard drive size ceases to be a consideration. In the end, Microsoft's Office 365 and its upcoming unlimited storage abilities should continue to move traditional Office users toward the subscription model. This strong value proposition also should bring in users that otherwise might subscribe to online backup systems, Google Drive, Amazon Cloud Drive, and others. This should produce a more consistent cash flow and earnings stream for Microsoft going forward. Needless to say, better earnings and cash flow is something Microsoft investors will gladly welcome.
