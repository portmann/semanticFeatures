Apple's September Event: iPad Pro Steals The Show - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's iPad Pro is aimed at creative professionals in the enterprise. iPad Pro continues the trend of Apple's custom designed processors that are ever more capable and competitive with Intel. Although the iPad Pro won't arrive until November, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) chose to thrust its new tablet into the limelight at its September 9 event . For good reason, since the new iPad has the star power Apple has needed for some time. Now the question for Apple investors becomes, how will the Pro do at the box office? In introducing the Pro, Tim Cook declared that iPad is the "clearest expression of our vision of personal computing." This is perhaps the most explicit statement made by Apple that its iOS devices are a direct challenge to the Wintel enterprise hegemony. Even as PC sales have faltered, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) have fallen back on what they apparently regarded as an unassailable bastion of "productivity". iPads and iPhones were mere toys for consuming content. For "real productivity", a Windows PC was required. iPad Pro is a direct assault on that bastion. It borrows unabashedly from a machine I greatly admire, the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. The Pro has a large 12.9 inch diagonal screen, and with iOS 9, will be able to multitask between two apps in a split screen mode. The Pro also has provision for a removable keyboard like the Surface Pro, and a stylus, called Apple Pencil. Apple has set its iPad Pro against what could be viewed as tough competition. iOS 9 vs. Windows 10. The ARM architecture A9X system on chip (SOC) vs. Intel Core processors. Is this really reasonable? Ultimately, the market will decide, but just the fact that Apple thinks that the Pro represents the future of personal computing says a lot. It says that fundamentally, they're in agreement with Microsoft that touch screens will become ubiquitous in personal computing. There the agreement ends, however, as Microsoft has chosen to adapt its desktop OS to the needs of the touchscreen. As such, even Windows 10 still has a poorly integrated feel to it. But at least you can use a mouse or trackpad with it, and sometimes you just need that. Apple is set on maintaining the purity of the iOS experience, so no touch pad on the detachable keyboard accessory of the new Pro. iOS 9 is a wonderful touch screen OS, and with split screen multitasking, it will be much more capable as a productivity platform. But it's still not quite in the same league as Win10 or Mac OS X. I still maintain, as I did in Apple: Thinking Outside The iPad Box , that a touch screen equipped Mac OS X convertible would be a better bet in the enterprise. But Apple clearly is positioning the iPad Pro for that role. This may not matter to many prospective customers. The demos of the Pro at the special event mostly focused on creative professionals. Graphic design and page layout featured prominently. For this type of enterprise customer, the Pro could be an easy sell. Especially because the Apple Pencil appears to be the stylus done better than anything that has come before. This is where Apple's control of hardware and software design really pays off. The Pencil is both pressure and tilt sensitive, so that it can be used more like a physical writing instrument. The Pencil is going to be enormously popular. While the Pencil is a nice touch, it's the A9X SOC that really sets the iPad Pro apart from its Intel based competition. It's low enough power to be fanless, of course, which puts it in the same group as the new Skylake Core M series of SOCs. Quite possibly, the next gen Surface Pro 4 will use Skylake. When Intel rolled out Skylake at the beginning of the month, they took pains to point out that the Core M7 was twice as fast as the previous generation A8X in the iPad Air 2. Apple appears to have closed that gap with the A9X, since it also claims twice the performance of the A8X. The A9X is fabricated on a 14 nm FinFET process (probably Samsung's), allowing it to be more powerful and more energy efficient. We'll know more about the performance of the A9X once Apple starts shipping devices, but probably the A9X and the Skylake M7 are roughly comparable. Here, I give Apple the advantage based on what is typically the lower cost of ARM architecture processors of equivalent performance to Intel. The A9X also incorporates all the motion sensing functions that were carried in the M8 motion coprocessor for the iPad Air 2. In this we see a fundamental advantage of Apple being a system integrator for SOCs. As process nodes shrink, Apple can take advantage of this by incorporating the functionality it specifically wants on the SOC, rather than accepting an array of functions it doesn't need in a generic commodity processor. So the Pro doesn't quite have the industrial strength caliber of Windows 10, but it has better hardware than the Surface Pro 3, and possibly better hardware than the Surface Pro 4 when it comes out. iOS 9, while lighter weight, has the advantages of not having a lot of legacy software baggage to lug around, and a much cleaner and more intuitive user interface. On the face of it, it might be a tight race, only I don't expect it to be at all. This really has mostly to do with Windows 10. Now that I've been using Windows 10 for a while, I've realized that it's not really that much better than Windows 8. I upgraded the one PC I had that was running 8.1. My other machines that are running Windows 7, I'm going to leave alone. I expect that most enterprise users of Windows 7 will probably do the same thing, especially since enterprise users of Win7 and Win8 don't get the free upgrade . Windows 7 is looming as an even bigger problem for Microsoft than Windows XP. In the consumer market, I don't expect Win10 to be a catalyst for new PC sales growth, including Surface and Surface Pro. Most value conscious Windows users will choose the free upgrade to Win10 instead of buying a new machine. This only makes sense. Win 10 provides a host of modern features such as an app store, and a performance boost compared to Windows 7. As I pointed out in Apple: The Stark Contrast Between iPad and Surface Sales , even with the sales declines iPad has suffered in the past year, iPad still outsold Surface and Surface Pro 5/1 in terms of revenue in the June quarter. At the very least, I expect the iPad line, bolstered by iPad Pro to hold this ratio. Now that I've seen the iPad Pro and understand what the hardware can do, I'm standing by my prediction made in that article that the iPad Pro will halt the y/y decline in iPad sales for at least the next few quarters of Pro availability. Whether iPad unit sales in the December quarter will equal last year's 21.4 million will depend on availability of the iPad Pro. If the Pro isn't supply constrained, total iPad sales could easily exceed last year's amount. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
