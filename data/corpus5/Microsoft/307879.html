Alphabet Trumps Apple, Cruises To World's Largest Company Title - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long XOM, BRK.B. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Alphabet has passed Apple to be the world's largest company. What company will reach the trillion-dollar threshold first? Markets were basically flat to kick off the new week. We started the day with another oil-driven sell-off, but by the end of the day, markets had recovered, with all three major indices posting minor gains. Despite the rather minor gains, the market continues to calm down. The VIX closed under 20 for just the second time this year. The volatility ETFs (NYSEARCA: VXX ) (NYSEARCA: UVXY ) were down a fair bit on the day despite the flat market. And perhaps more remarkably, the market was flat despite oil (NYSEARCA: USO ) getting pounded. WTI crude was down 7% on the day, and is down more this evening, with crude now back to $31 after hitting $35 just a couple days ago. Pay attention to the WTI/Brent (NYSEARCA: BNO ) spread, particularly if you own refiners. Brent is holding up better lately, and now fetches a $2.50/barrel premium to WTI crude. In the past, a big oil drop, such as this, would have sent the market right back into a tailspin. Instead, the market managed to hold its ground despite oil, natural gas (NYSEARCA: UNG ), and energy stocks (NYSEARCA: XLE ) all selling off. As of this writing, the ES S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) futures contract is down around 10 points, or half a percent. Perhaps, the market will try to sell off with oil down again tonight. At this hour, reports are coming in that BP (NYSE: BP ) missed on earnings with the income figure down an eye-catching 91%. This will likely hurt energy sentiment as well. But it seems the general trend is that the market is decoupling from oil and China (NYSEARCA: ASHR ) and concentrating on earnings. For the health of the market, that's a good development. Speaking of earnings, Google, or Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) if you prefer, is now the world's largest company. Following a strong earnings report, shares jumped in the after-hours session. The move was sufficient to allow Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to be overtaken in the top of the market cap list for the first time in several years. Apple first topped the list in 2011, passing Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) for the honors. Its stock initially continued to rise after passing Exxon, but it's been mostly dead money since then. Anyone that invested in Apple once it hit #1 has lagged the market significantly. This chart from Quartz shows the evolution of Apple and Alphabet's market caps over time. After that strong run in 2011-2012, it's been slow going for Apple. The rule of large numbers applies in cases such as this. Once you're already the biggest, it's hard to meaningfully continue to expand. A strategy of buying the market's largest company and holding it has been shown to vastly underperform buying a basket of stocks. Take this comparison from the Hulbert Financial Digest: Also of note, in roughly 67% of years since 1981, the largest market-cap stock entering the year has underperformed the broader index. It's a well-known phenomenon that small caps tend to outperform large cap stocks. Naturally, these extend even within the large cap space. Buying the largest of the megacaps seems to degrade your returns even further. If you are into this sort of data trade, you can argue for a short Alphabet, long market trade. Based on past history, it seems likely to work. I don't see Alphabet's valuation as particularly wild though - at least not compared to other FANG and tech momo stocks. It more passed Apple because Apple is falling rather than GOOG going crazy. I've long been skeptical about Apple. Many value investors say the stock is cheap and with further financial engineering, more value could be unlocked. But I'm not sure I see it. The company's main product, the iPhone appears to have reached a sales peak. Other lines such as iPad are in rapid decline. The company will continue to be a cash cow, but with such a huge valuation already, if you want upside to the stock, you need something new to drive growth. Last year, analysts were pointing to the auto market as the magic bullet that would fix Apple's growth problem. It's unclear what the new solution will be. Until they figure something out, I struggle to see why I'd rather own Apple than an index fund. As for Alphabet, it's a company I'd rather invest in than Apple. There's more upside, as the company has a lot more innovation and new potential revenue streams in the pipeline. However, I don't really trust the company as capital allocators, and if I were long, I'd fret that they might invest my money poorly in unsound new initiatives. To put it frankly, I'm unlikely to own the world's largest company - by market cap - for quite a while longer. If oil and Exxon come back into favor, I'd be long the world's largest company again. Or perhaps Berkshire (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) will be able move to the top. As far as handicapping the race to be the first trillion-dollar company, I'd put Alphabet as the favorite, followed by Exxon and Berkshire as the two next best possibilities. I see Apple as distinctly unlikely to hit the trillion-dollar market cap anytime soon. They'd need a whole new category - iPhone won't do it alone. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is in the current market cap top five, but again, I struggle to see what would fundamentally shake up their valuation enough to double the market cap to a billion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is one more darkhorse pick to be the world's first trillion-dollar company. It's hard to imagine quite how outlandish its valuation ratios would appear at that figure, but as 2015 proved, that stock doesn't seem to be limited by traditional financial logic.
