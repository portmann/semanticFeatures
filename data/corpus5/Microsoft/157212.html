Intel Inside The iPad Pro? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has unveiled the best reference design for Apple’s long-rumored iPad Pro high-end tablet. Unlike Apple’s A8 processor, Intel’s x86 processor is compatible with industry standard software like AutoCAD and Adobe Photoshop. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo again hinted that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Pro will go into commercial production next month or by October. Kuo also said the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will come with a Force Touch-enabled Stylus. The inclusion of a stylus is a clue that Apple intends to market the iPad Pro to the creative industry. Unfortunately, in spite of Kuo's Apple-related scoops, he has yet to provide us with an official render/picture of the alleged iPad Pro. On this note, may I dare say then that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) new reference design for next-generation 2-in-1 tablets could also serve as a reference for the iPad Pro. Below is a screenshot of Intel's latest reference design for 2-in-1 tablet/notebook. The aesthetics rendition of Intel's new reference design somehow mimics the iPad Air 2, only thicker. Intel's concept design features wireless charging, wireless display mirroring, fingerprint sensor (TouchID?), USB Type C connectors, 2D/3D capture/sharing, and an Active stylus. Intel's hypothetical iPad Pro design is also similar to the high-end Wacom Cintiq products. Cintiq products are often used by professional artists and media editors. They are priced even higher than Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro 3. The Cintiq Companion 2, with Intel Core i7 and 512MB GB of storage, sells for $2,499.95. Apple is known for selling high-priced hardware and the alleged iPad Pro will also come with a 4-foure price tag. The persistent rumor of a high-end iPad Pro can lead to Apple being forced to use an x86 processor from Intel. Up until now, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ), and Apple has yet to find a way on how to recompile full versions of x86-only industry standard software (Photoshop CC , AutoCAD, Final Cut Pro) so they will work on ARM-based processors like Apple's A8. Graphic artists will deride a $1,499 Apple iPad Pro that cannot even run Adobe Photoshop CC or Illustrator CC. That is now the predicament of Apple. Without full compatibility with x86/x64 software, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro is just a glorified iPad Air. It's only purpose would be to run light duty tasks such as Office 365 applications. The surging sales of Microsoft' Surface 3 Pro and Surface 3 should motivate Apple to really come up with a neutralizer. The majority of creative/design professionals will only give serious thoughts of buying an iPad Pro if it runs native x86 industry standard programs. The ideal iPad Pro therefore should be a detachable version of the fanless Intel Core-M powered MacBook 2015. It ought to run Mac OS X (not iOS 9), have an stylus and touchscreen support, and a Core i5 processor. Other Tablet OEMs Will Offer Cheaper Clones Of Surface 3 Another positive scenario is that Intel's more expensive processors will find new buyers eager to copycat the Surface Pro 3. Using the new reference design from Intel, Asus can create a very pricey 12.5-inch Windows version of the $299 ZenPad S 8 Android tablet. The 8-inch ZenPad S 8 has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of flash storage, microSD slot, and a Stylus. It only needs a bigger display size, an upgrade to a Core i3/i5 processor, and a change to Windows OS to become a potent rival to the Surface Pro and Cintiq Companion 2. Other PC manufacturers will also eventually make a cheaper clone of the Surface 3. The nature of the computer industry is for companies to always imitate the successful and popular. Microsoft is planning to release the Surface 4 Pro later this year . The combined threat of top OEMs creating affordable Surface (detachable tablet/2-in-1) clones and Microsoft pushing for Surface 3 and Surface Pro 4, could hurt Apple's iPad/MacBook sales. For those creative professionals that do not rely on Apple's Final Cut Pro or Logic, buying a Windows/Intel hybrid 2-in-1 tablet is obviously more cost effective than buying an ARM-based iPad Pro in tandem with a MacBook. Apple Should Also Compete With The Surface 3 Microsoft's success with the stylus-enabled Surface proved that there is a multi-billion-dollar market for expensive Intel-powered tablets. Intel's latest reference design is a good template for Apple to create its own flagship iPad Pro tablet that can match the features of the Cintiq and Surface Pro 3. Apple can improve on Intel's design to suit its own vision for the iPad Pro. Apple can remove the secondary 6-inch e-ink display from Intel's design, but keep the best features like the inclusion of a full-side SD card slot and wireless charging. Intel's leaked Skylake-U processor roadmap revealed that more energy efficient processors are coming soon as alternatives to current Core-M products. If Apple is still not satisfied with current offerings of Intel for its iPad Pro, next year's releases of Skylake-U might finally deliver an Intel-powered iPad The best benefit an Intel processor getting inside the Apple iPad Pro is that is always better to sell higher-margin processors to manufacturers who have a track record of selling high-end products in 10-figure volumes. Intel's bottomline could improve if Apple starts making bulk orders of the $200-to-$390 Skylake processors bound for the iPad Pro or 2-in-1 version of the MacBook. Apple is allegedly already sold on using Intel LTE modems inside some of its upcoming iPhone 6S. Intel again benefits if Apple would use a high-priced Intel SoC for its iPad Pro. The global brand power of Apple makes me believe that an Intel-powered iPad Pro could outsell the Surface Pro by leaps and bounds (5x-to-10x bigger sales volume). Intel remains an attractive long-term investment. This company is not in any danger of extinction in this age of mobile devices and smart things. The universal appeal of Intel's x86 processor for mobile and pc products is that it works with almost all operating systems. This is something that ARM-based CPU producers cannot claim. Take for example the new Jolla tablet . Instead of using an ARM-based SoC, the people behind the Jolla tablet opted to use an Intel quad-core processor because it works well with the Sailfish mobile operating system. Sailfish is also similar to Android OS because both are based on Linux. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, AAPL, MSFT. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
