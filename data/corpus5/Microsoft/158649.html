The New Apple TV 4 Could Rival Xbox One And PlayStation 4 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A motion controller-enabled Apple TV 4 is a great alternative to the Xbox One. The rumored $199 price tag for the upcoming Apple TV 4 hints that it has a more powerful processor and GPU. The spies of 9to5Mac are saying that the upcoming upgrade to the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV 3 will come with a higher $149 and $199 price tags. The Apple TV 4 will allegedly be unveiled this coming September 9 and it will be launched in October. The new iOS 9-powered Apple TV box will also be bigger than the current sub-$70 Apple TV 3 . It will tout a better CPU/GPU and a new remote control. The new Apple TV will also support Siri/Proactive digital assistant and have its own dedicated App Store. A software development kit (SDK) for Apple TV will be made available to developers. Apple apparently wants third-party developers to create custom apps and games for its new TV box. The reason why Apple wants a separate App Store is that, unlike iPhones and iPads, people will be using the Apple TV box in conjunction with television sets that have various display sizes greater than 10 inches. Third-party developers will have to create specific iOS 9 apps that will scale properly even on a 50-inch Ultra HD 4K TV set. A separate SDK for the Apple TV platform also allows third-party developers to create iOS 9 apps or games that will work with wireless motion controllers. TechCrunch reported last week that Apple has a Wii-like game controller for Apple TV. Apple was already granted a patent on a Kinect-like motion sensor controller in 2013. Techcrunch's rumor is therefore somewhat believable. Apple originally created its TV box as a streaming video gadget for the living room. It is high time to upgrade it to become a total entertainment package. I opine that a motion controller-enabled $199 Apple TV 4 is a serious alternative to more expensive console products like the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Xbox One and Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation 4. Microsoft and Sony upgraded their consoles to become more than just gaming devices. It's only logical that Apple should also transform the Apple TV box into a full-fledged entertainment system that goes beyond simple video streaming. I already envisioned this possibility of a hybrid gaming/streaming Apple TV last April 2014. Apple can continue selling the entry-level Apple TV 3 product to compete with sub-$100 Android streaming devices. However, offering a $199 iOS TV box that lets big-spending iPhone/iPad gamers enjoy motion controller-enabled games on big-screen TV sets is a great expansion idea. Letting third-party developers maximize the Metal SDK to create console-quality iOS 3D games for Apple TV will make even Xbox one addicts take notice. The Metal API from Apple has enabled developers to create advanced 3D games for dual-core A7-powered iOS phones. Metal-optimized games tout 3D graphics quality that rivals that of games on the Xbox One and PC desktop platforms. Vainglory , Plunder Pirates, Modern Combat 5: BlackOut , and Battle Supremacy are just some of the Metal-optimized iOS games. The efficiency of Metal API low-level graphics processing is also going to be introduced in the next Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan Release. This makes me believe that that the Metal API is not only limited to optimizing games on small iOS devices. Apple has the patents, engineers, hardware/software assets, and the marketing savvy to sell a potent rival to Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Console gaming is still a $13 billion/year industry. According to NPD Group's latest report, hardware sales of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are selling faster than previous generation consoles. After 21 months since they were released, aggregate sales of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is almost 50% higher than the sales of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on their first 21 months in the market. Microsoft even said U.S. sales of its latest console were up 44% for the month of July compared to last year's. The favorable market for console gaming is a nice opportunity for Apple to really upgrade its connected TV box to include gaming features. Future Market Insights (FMI) still see a CAGR of 11.5% for connected consoles until the year 2020. FMI says gaming is an important component of the connected console concept. Newzoo says mobile gaming will overtake console gaming this year. However, the chart below from Ars Technica reveal an uptrend for console sales. It's only smart that Apple also expands its business to connected console/TV products. The weakening demand for iPhones in China means Apple needs a new product to help offset the expected decline in iPhone's global sales. A motion controller-enabled Apple TV 4 is an obvious expansion product that still has a surging market. Sales of PlayStation 4 helped boost Sony's PlayStation division post +16.8% revenue Y-o-Y growth this year. Even though Apple generates most of its profit from selling high-priced iPhones, selling higher-margin connected TV boxes is a notable diversification move. Aside from the higher hardware margins from a $199 console/TV box, the additional revenue from app/game purchases adds further importance to Apple TV 4. I already discussed that Apple is the biggest beneficiary in mobile gaming. Porting popular billion-dollar generating iPhone games to Apple TV 4 is another way to encourage family members to spend more money so they can better enjoy their living room gaming sessions. Apple's 30% cut from app store purchases was $1.7 billion last July. Adding a new Apple TV device for app purchases could further boost this 9-figure monthly commission. If and when Apple starts its $40/month streaming TV service, it will also be better for security/control purposes that future subscribers use Apple-made TV boxes. AAPL remains a Strong Buy for long-term investors. This company will not remain hostage to iPhone sales for long. Apple has solid fundamental numbers, over $200 billion in cash reserves, and is expanding beyond phones and tablets. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT.
