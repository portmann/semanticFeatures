Microsoft's Great Leap Forward In Gaming - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha At E3 2015, MSFT blows away audiences with new releases and new technology. Gaming will now integrate Xbox One and Windows 10, along with virtual and augmented reality devices. MSFT enters holiday season with new Halo, Tomb Raider, and Fable games, as well as backwards compatibility and system upgrades. Long thought of as a side project, MSFT is out to show investors that gaming is now a significant aspect of its business and should be treated as such. If the pre-Monday events at E3 2015 were any indicator, this year's edition of the convention was going to be of greater significance to gamers than last year's edition. In fact, given the hardware rollouts, it might be closer to 2013, when the current generation of consoles was first debuted to an eager gaming public. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) press conference was first on the day's docket in Los Angeles, just a few days after announcing their partnership with Facebook's Oculus Rift for virtual reality gaming (NASDAQ: FB ), so it was unclear what else they would reveal. As it turned out, Microsoft had a lot more in the tank, from completing its atonement for the infamous backwards compatibility snafu, to an impressive lineup of exclusive content such as new Tomb Raider and Halo titles as well as further independent gaming development. Viewers could tell which games were the most important for Microsoft to show off judging by which ones premiered with actual gameplay rather than pre-rendered cinema trailers, which included Halo 5: Guardians, the newest entrant in the massively popular Microsoft franchise. After over a decade of Halo being the crown jewel in the Microsoft gaming empire, one can be forgiven if the 5th chapter didn't sound as mouth-watering as previous incarnations, especially given the numerous offshoots each generation of the game has come out with such as ODST and the real-time strategy game Halo Wars. After peaking at nearly 12 million copies of Halo 3 sold upon its 2007 release, subsequent editions haven't hit that point, with Halo 4 selling only 9 million copies , though the $220 million in gross sales in the first 24 hours did set a new single-day record. Also, 343 Studios, the caretakers of this franchise, have a lot of trust to earn back from the loyal gaming public due to the glitch plagued rollout of The Master Chief Collection back in November. Meant to be a package of every Halo game within the Master Chief's story arc, re-mastered for the Xbox One, it became more known for multiplayer functionality that crashed upon release, with resulting patches making the collection almost unplayable. For such an iconic series, and for a game that was marketed in Xbox bundles on the heels of Ubisoft's bug-prone Assassins Creed: Unity, it was a heart-breaking disappointment . So how does Microsoft try to right the ship? By throwing a new twist into the Master Chief story-arc through gameplay that has the player in the role of Sargent Locke, who has usually been a non-player character (NPC) in the story, trying to find the AWOL Master Chief. Why he has gone AWOL has not been revealed, and gamers responded well to the new wrinkle. In addition to the new story, there is also a new multiplayer experience called "Warzone", which appears to mix player vs. player combat with NPC enemies like The Covenant to create a frantic free-for-all fighting experience. Add in the fact that this will be the first member of the franchise made specifically for Xbox One, and there should be enough reasons for the gaming community to flock to this game on its October release, even if it might not be the record-breaker other editions have been in the past. A major theme of Microsoft's hardware announcements is that it is trying to become like Sony (NYSE: SNE ) in terms of appealing to hardcore gamers, while at the same time stitching PC and console gaming together as one universe as well as fixing old sins. In terms of repenting for old sins, Microsoft announced that backwards compatibility for Xbox 360 games will be made available for free starting this holiday season, and Xbox 360 games will still have access to Xbox One features such as storing gameplay videos and multiplayer ability. This is a welcome turn of events after this was initially deemed impossible, and allowed Sony to use it as a bludgeon in the console wars for the past two years, and integrating Xbox One functions is a nice cherry on top. Granted, this is the kind of development that should have happened when the console first came out, but credit where credit is due. Looking to the future, Microsoft announced numerous games that will be both Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusives such as Fable Legends, complemented by the ability to play console gaming opponents from one's PC and having single player achievements transferred to the console. Not only does this break down the barrier between two in-house products, but it also shows that Microsoft's plan for the new Windows OS is to build a whole ecosystem around it with gaming as its focus, touched on already by the Oculus announcement. Furthermore, it means that Microsoft is moving gaming into a core part of its business rather than a side project, which means that investors may have to start looking at the gaming division with as much scrutiny as the company's more traditional aspects. This is especially true if HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality device that enables users to project games on any flat surface and whose Minecraft demonstration amazed and baffled viewers, winds up being the future of technology. Microsoft followed up its pre-E3 Oculus partnership with a deeply informative press conference that mixed advanced technology with interesting new editions of popular titles that sets the company up very well for a good next 12 months. From an investment perspective, the integration of Xbox, Windows 10, and the new virtual and augmented reality devices will be key in driving people to upgrade their consoles and PC operating systems. In fact, the conference ended with Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, imploring those in attendance to upgrade if they haven't already, signifying the hopes for the company to get the ecosystem up and running as soon as they can to dominate the supposed new frontier of gaming. In terms of titles, one can't go wrong with a new Halo game for the holiday season despite the hiccups from the last release, as well as new editions of Tomb Raider and Fable, which will make Microsoft competitive on Black Friday even if Oculus and HoloLens are likely not going to be ready in time for the Christmas rush. As such, Microsoft remains a long play into 2016 just like it was after the Oculus release, but now there is a lot more upside than previously thought given the renewed commitment to games and the importance Windows 10 will have going forward. Gaming is now a central component of Microsoft's mission, and the events of the past week show the company wants to be the gaming company of the future.
