Historical Comparables For Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha It is difficult to find a contemporary comparable to value Facebook. An alternative is to look at historical comparables. If you're like me, you've probably been scratching your head the past 2 years trying to figure out how to value Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). I think most people would agree Facebook has a unique product marked by unprecedented growth and a growing monetization opportunity. In short, it's the type of business any investor would like to buy at the right price. But naturally, different investors will have different perceptions of the right price to buy. I consider myself a value investor. By its nature, fundamental valuation relies strongly on cash reserves, debt levels, and low to modest multiples of free cash flow and EBITDA. It is rare that a value investor will make the assumption of continued growth. However, I recognize that businesses with strong or exponential revenue/earnings growth and a monopoly-type product may trade at multiples well outside the "value range" for extended periods, if not indefinitely. This means I will probably never buy Facebook or most other rapidly growing technology stocks. But apart from evaluating the margin of safety, I also like to characterize the upside, i.e. where a stock is likely to trade under realistic market conditions. The determination of the appropriate PE ratio for a given business is inherently problematic. The difficulty is magnified if earnings are accelerating or decelerating. And of course, uncertainty has a tremendous role to play. Uncertainty may be related to general market sentiment, to changes in operations, or to almost any other factor. It's very difficult to capture all this information in a DCF model, making the conclusions highly suspect at best. Another approach is comparables, which works quite well if you can find a number of comparable businesses in the sector/industry. Perhaps the most important criterion for a good comparable is that its forecast future cash flows should be similar. This may allow us to say that similar multiples may be used in valuing the compared businesses. Here we come to the fundamental problem with Facebook. How many other companies with similar market cap and growth prospects can we find at the present time? Very few large companies are capable of 30-50% YoY revenue growth. Many (if not most) large companies depend on revenue streams from many small projects, but the law of averages works against the business as it grows and diversifies. To avoid this "size problem" over a period of years, you need a single, homogeneous, scalable product. Think Coke (Coca-Cola), Google Search (Google), or oil (Standard Oil). It needs to be a near-monopoly with great pricing power. And it needs to have a huge market. Only a handful of businesses in the past century have fulfilled those criteria. When people look for a comparable on Facebook, the first company that comes to mind is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Similar market cap, similar business model based on ad revenue. But as many have pointed out, Facebook's growth profile is very different from Google. So you can't directly compare them. Or can you? As others have pointed out, Facebook looks a lot like the teenage Google. Both are/were companies with tech founders and a head start on technological revolutions (search vs. the social network) that grew by leaps and bounds as they changed the lives of billions of people. In fact, as Bill Gates has pointed out, the growth of Google had some similarities to the growth of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) thanks to Windows and the Microsoft Office suite in the 1990s (note that Microsoft's early business was contract software development and it later transitioned to a product business). It's possible that non-tech businesses could be referenced, but best to keep the comparables as focused as we can. So, if I were trying to value Facebook on a comparables basis, I would want to look back to when Google and Microsoft were growing at comparable rates. It would also be nice if the absolute magnitude of revenues at the time of comparable growth rates were similar; as you may note the absolute magnitudes are remarkably similar in this regard. For years 2015+, I assumed that FB's YoY rev growth remained at 58%, that Net Inc/Rev was about 25%, and that Sh Outstanding remained constant. No special logic went into these - I was just trying to be as nice to Facebook as possible. I pulled the rest of the numbers from ADVFN. I could spend pages and pages poking holes is this comparison. Comparables is, by its nature, a very imperfect science. But looking at this table, I make the following observations: 1. If "Best Sh Price" is taken as the absolute best case historical valuation for FB's shares, FB has remained below this curve for the most part. 2. If "Worst Sh Price" is taken as the worst case historical valuation (considering the market conditions during the periods respectively described for Google and Microsoft), FB's shares have remained above this curve. 3. If "Av Sh Price" is the average of the two valuations, FB has remained above this curve but seems to be moving closer to it. 4. If we assume "Av Sh Price" is representative of intermediate market conditions and such market conditions should prevail over the next few years (a big assumption), then a valuation of FB around 90/sh (no dilution considered) by the end of 2015 would not be unreasonable. When I did this analysis, I thought it would make the case for an obvious overvaluation of Facebook in a historical context. If you look at the numbers above, it actually looks like Facebook is not at too much of a premium to "typical" conditions. My biggest concern, however, is the growth rate assumption; if you look at GOOG and MSFT they quickly tapered rapidly off anything close to 50% revenue growth over subsequent years. So to believe FB will perform as above, you have to assume that FB's growth prospects are bigger than MSFT's or GOOG's were at similar points in their lives. For all I know, this may well be true. Zuck is certainly a visionary and has strong motivation to grow the company. As a value investor, I will obviously be more conservative for my own account. I see that in the roaring 90s leading up to the crash MSFT traded at PE multiples up to the mid-60s and then pulled back to the mid-30s afterward (see ADVFN for later years). Since GOOG recovered pretty quickly from the drop in 2008 but had slowing growth afterward it tended toward the 20s and 30s. If FB should dive to 20-30 times earnings with continued excellent growth during a downturn I might jump on it. Otherwise I'll probably never buy the stock. But if you're a growth investor, as shown above, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect solid growth stock returns on investment if revenue growth remains around 50% YoY and market conditions remain similar, etc. Source: Historical Comparables For Facebook Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
