Intel Investor Meeting Part 1: Mobile Device Retreat - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha At Intel's 2015 Investor Meeting, the company indicated that it was shifting investment out of phones, tablets and into growth areas such as Data Center. Intel hasn't given up on mobile devices, but its strategy has changed. At Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Investor Meeting on November 19, Intel management indicated that it was shifting investment out of money-losing areas such as smartphones and into three key areas of growth: data center, Internet of Things and non-volatile memory. This is an intelligent move on Intel's part, but the retreat on mobile devices should concern Intel investors. What exactly is Intel's mobile device strategy going forward? It was Intel Chairman Andy Bryant who first dropped the bomb at the meeting. He stated in his matter of fact and direct way that Intel was reducing investment in money-losing businesses like smartphones in order to focus investments in the key areas of growth for Intel. As I have considered Intel's mobile device strategy to be a failure, I was gratified by Chairman Bryant's candor. My gratification was short lived. Very quickly, it became apparent that Intel management was conflicted about how to present the shift in strategy. Since the beginning of the year when the Mobile Computing Group and the PC Client Groups were combined, there has been a tendency to dissemble about the losses associated with the mobile business. This reached new heights in certain euphemisms that were employed in this year's presentations. As of 2014, Intel set a goal of an "operating margin improvement" of $800 million for the mobile business in 2015, as highlighted on page 40 of CFO Stacy Smith's presentation . Coming off 2014 with a $4.2 billion operating loss for MCG, no one doubted that the $800 million was a reduction of losses. As of this year, that $800 million goal has been transmogrified into the "2015 $800 million Mobile Profitability Goal," which Intel claims it is on track to exceed, according to page 16 of CFO Smith's 2015 presentation . In addition, Smith's chart promised another $800 million in "profitability improvement" for 2016. The unsuspecting investor might construe that Intel's mobile business is on the way to achieving an $800 million profit for the year. Analysts were quick to pounce on this point. During the first Q&A an analyst asked why mobile losses weren't going down by more than $800 million in 2016. This would have been the right time for Intel management to correct the supposition of the analyst, but management did not. Instead, CEO Krzanich acknowledged that yes, contra revenue was going away, but there was still spending on modems, a big push for Intel. He also acknowledged that phone processor and modem shipments would not have sufficient volume to provide profitability. And that's the way it went in the Q&A sessions. When confronted with the fact of the continuing lack of profitability of the mobile business, Intel management didn't flinch or recoil, but there were still these euphemisms of "mobile profitability" floating around in the presentations. The stark reality of the shift in strategy in mobile was captured in another chart by Stacy Smith showing qualitatively the shifts in investment: Intel's product plans for 2016 also reflected the de-emphasis on mobile products. SoFIA production will move to 14 nm and SoFIA will receive an LTE modem, but the product is almost DOA as it stands. Almost no phone manufacturers have adopted the Atom X3 (SoFIA), and there isn't a single X3 equipped phone available in the U.S. At the Investor Meeting, Intel execs talked up the Asus Zen Phone 2 , but this doesn't use the X3, but instead an older Atom series processor. Even the latest Atom X7 tablet processor manufactured on Intel's best 14 nm process is no match for the performance of the best smartphones such as the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy S6 or the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6s. In the chart below I compare benchmarks for a variety of devices, including two tablets that use the X7, as well as the ZenFone 2, the Galaxy S6 and the iPhone 6s. In all but one category, 3DMark Physics, the iPhone 6s is the best, usually followed by the Galaxy S6 in second place. I've included the Acer Predator 8 tablet , even though benchmark data for the tablet is incomplete, because it's an Atom X7 tablet that runs an Android 5.1 64 bit rather than the Microsoft Surface 3 which runs a Windows 10 64 bit. I did this to illustrate that Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 10 does not penalize the performance of the processor, as some commenters have alleged. SoFIA appears to be a complete dead end since it won't offer competitive performance in 2016, and Intel doesn't seem to have anything planned beyond it. Many Intel advocates have assumed that all Intel had to do in order to build a smartphone processor was to dumb down its desktop processor sufficiently to squeeze into the smartphone form factor. Intel has done that, but I think it's significant that Intel has not been able to build a truly best in class smartphone processor at any price. The lack of a class-leading processor conveys that Intel may still be unable to achieve the power efficiency of ARM processors. I've inferred from the lack of cost competitiveness in tablets and smartphones that Intel Architecture is fundamentally disadvantaged in cost relative to the simpler ARM architecture. Another series of charts presented by Bill Holt, General Manger, Technology and Manufacturing Group, may inadvertently demonstrate the ARM advantage. Holt, as he has in previous years, put up a series of charts claiming in effect that competing 14 nm processes from Samsung and TSMC are not as good as Intel because they don't truly scale as small as Intel's 14 nm process. These charts are based on theoretical scaling relationships. Then Holt showed a chart based on actual measure transistor density from real devices. Lo and behold, the transistor densities for the ARM chips (all based on Apple SOCs) were actually quite a bit higher than Intel Broadwell or Skylake. Holt explains this by observing that the Apple A8 and A9 have more inherently dense elements. He argues that if the Intel architecture is "normalized" to the same composition as the A8 and A9, it achieves higher transistor density. The trouble with this argument is that there's really no way to "normalize" the Intel Architecture devices to have the same composition as the Apple A8 and A9. To a large extent, the composition is a function of the architectural differences between Intel and ARM as well as specific implementation choices each company makes in its chip designs. Key elements of the Intel devices such as the so called "tall cells" and "Reg. Files" are not even used in Apple's ARM based SOCs. Holt's charts highlight the fact that ARM architecture devices can overcome a process disadvantage and achieve higher transistor density and therefore be lower cost devices. In semiconductor manufacturing cost scales with surface area of the chip. This points to an inherent cost advantage for ARM devices. Much of the dissembling and mixed messages of the Investor Meeting presentations appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain the appearance that everything is going fine and is on track. But clearly, Intel has hit a major roadblock in its assault on mobile devices. This is nowhere more apparent than in tablet processors. At the investor meeting, Intel reiterated the "success" of its tablet processor strategy and boasted that 26 million processors had been sold through Q3. However, Intel is projecting only 4 million tablet processors will be sold in Q4, a 75% drop in units y/y. As I noted in my Q3 earnings article , as Intel withdraws contra revenue, it doesn't have much to show for it in terms of ongoing sales. Last year, Intel force fed the mobile device industry 46 million tablet processors, yet somehow this wasn't enough volume for Intel to break even, and it lost $4.2 billion in MCG. This past year, even through Q3, I've shown that Intel's mobile losses have continued, and I believe this is generally accepted by the analyst community. Although it's circumstantial, the evidence just keeps mounting that Intel simply can't be cost competitive with the ARM world, even when it offers products that are inferior to the class leaders such as Apple and Samsung. And with the Holt data on transistor density, we have the first concrete physical explanation of why Intel is more expensive. Intel processors are inherently bulkier and therefore more expensive. Despite the effort to keep up appearances, we saw at the Investor Meeting Intel pivoting away from mobile and wanting to focus its efforts, and investor attention, on what it considers its key growth areas. Investors may choose to consider Intel's mobile retreat as temporary, but if the company isn't competitive in mobile, and is reducing the investment required to be competitive, that implies that the retreat will be permanent. The mobile device market is a huge market to be locked out of, especially when Intel's expectations are for basically zero growth in the PC market. This could represent a failure of monumental proportions. Will the growth areas Intel has targeted compensate for missing out on mobile? In part 2 of this series, I'll look at Intel's strategy in Windows client computing, which to some degree substitutes for mobile devices.
