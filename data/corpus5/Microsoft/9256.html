Polycom's Expanded Agreement With Microsoft Positive For Investors - Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCM) | Seeking Alpha Polycom said it has entered into an expanded relationship with Microsoft for offering customers Polycom RoundTable. RoundTable, a Skype-based videoconferencing tool, will boost Polycomâ€™s revenue significantly in the growing videoconferencing market. Polycom (NASDAQ: PLCM ) said it has expanded its relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and will start delivering a new series of videoconferencing solutions for Skype. The development, known as the Polycom RoundTable, is expected to help Polycom boost revenue significantly. The first device in the RoundTable series, the Polycom RoundTable 100, will help small to mid-sized businesses expand their videoconferencing capabilities. Leveraging Microsoft's Skype platform, Polycom is looking to expand its customer base and product portfolio. Currently Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) dominates the corporate video conferencing market with its Cisco TelePresence Systems (CTS). Polycom is not targeting the whole corporate sector including large corporations in the initial stage. Instead, it is targeting the SMBs (small to mid-sized businesses) to popularize the platform with Skype's existing user-base in SMBs. However, we believe Polycom RoundTable will gradually become CTS' chief competitor. Cisco offers a live and face-to-face videoconferencing experience via CTS. However, the drawback of implementing CTS is that it requires advanced knowledge of the latest networking technologies. Skype, on the contrary, is easy to use and hugely popular in SMBs. We believe Microsoft's endeavor will be to transform Polycom RoundTable to a user-friendly and affordable videoconferencing solution by combining it with Skype for Business and Microsoft Lync 2013. The Polycom CX series will also be a part of the Polycom RoundTable, which is expected to bring more than 50 million meeting rooms under the umbrella of Polycom and Microsoft. Polycom RoundTable will see fierce competition from Cisco, which introduced Cisco TelePresence back in 2006. Cisco has vast experience in developing online videoconferencing solutions. In 2007, Cisco acquired WebEx and began offering a variety of Unified Communications products to its clients. In 2009, Cisco acquired Tandberg which positioned Cisco to offer industry-leading videoconferencing products. The Tandberg content server helps organizations access on-demand video presentations, corporate training sessions and distance education classes, which are essential parts of the whole videoconferencing experience these days. We believe if Microsoft acquires Sonic Foundry (NASDAQ: SOFO ), the Polycom RoundTable experience could get even better and more competitive. Sonic Foundry's cloud-based Mediasite would be able to make RoundTable more interactive. Further, with Mediasite, past videoconferencing sessions would be searchable. Polycom's 2014 full-year revenue was $1.35 billion and currently its EBITDA margin remains at 9%. According to a new report , the global market for videoconferencing equipment and services is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 9.36% between 2014 and 2020. With Polycom RoundTable continuing to evolve, we believe Polycom's revenue will grow at a CAGR of at least 10%. At this run rate, the company's full-year 2015 revenue will be around $1.49 billion, and EBITDA will be $135 million. We believe Polycom will enjoy an EV/EBITDA multiple of around 15x, the multiple at which it trades on an average. Applying the multiple on the 2015 EBITDA, we get its enterprise value of $2.025 billion, which translates into a share price of $18, with net cash of $390 million on the balance sheet and 134.18 million shares outstanding. The share price represents an upside of ~33% from the current price level around $13.50. Polycom's fourth quarter 2014 revenue grew satisfactorily across all product lines except the UC platform. With its RealPresence platform gaining traction and RoundTable platform continuing to evolve, we believe Polycom's future is bright in the growing videoconferencing equipment and services market.
