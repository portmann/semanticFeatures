Microsoft In 2018 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft started the hardware shift with the Surface, new Windows 10 smartphones are the next step. Microsoft Office has always been a cash cow, Office 365 seems poised to take this to the next level. It's the year 2018, and it has been an interesting last few years for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Three years ago, the company's business was beginning to change, with roughly 60% of its revenue generated by the Commercial division . On the Devices and Consumer side, Microsoft's Surface, XBox, and Office 365, businesses were the star performers. In 2018, things have become very different. Microsoft's cloud business is the main driver of revenue, as its Commercial business now represents more than 70% of the company's total. There have been some challenges along the way, but overall investors are pretty happy with the end result. In 2015, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO made the difficult decision to take a huge write down of its Nokia investment. In addition, he essentially said the company's current smartphones weren't good enough. Specifically, he said the company would, "generate new growth…on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio." Many investors read in-between the lines, and realized this meant the company would release its own smartphones for Windows 10. A few years before, Microsoft surprised many with the first Surface tablet. Investors were skeptical that the software company could compete with the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad, and the slew of tablets running Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android OS. Though the Surface RT was a huge misstep, once the Surface 3 came out, the tide began to shift. In 2015, Google was focused on YouTube, and its search business. With YouTube viewership rising by 60% year-over-year , and paid clicks up 18% in the middle of the year, Google was keeping its investors happy. Apple sold over $4 billion worth of iPads , but with revenue and units down on an annual basis, the focus was on the iPhone and the Apple Watch. In 2016, Microsoft introduced the first Surface smartphone. Knowing that it had to compete with the likes of the iPhone 6S and the Google Nexus 6X, Microsoft went big. The first Surface phone had a 5.5" Ultra HD display, a quad-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 or 128 GB of storage. Where Microsoft really won the day was in making two things happen. First, unlike the Nexus and the iPhone, the Surface phone supported Micro SD cards up to 128 GB. Second, the company finally made porting Android apps, to Windows Phone apps, an easy process for developers. This was a watershed moment, as developers finally could get on the Windows app bandwagon. In 2018, the app store for Windows sits at over 750,000. The gap between the three big ecosystems has finally begun to close. With only about 8% of the global smartphone market, Microsoft has a long way to go. However, keep in mind Windows had less than 3% market share in 2015. One thing that hasn't really changed in 2018 is the fact that consumers and businesses use Microsoft Office as their productivity suite. In 2015, Office 365 was beginning to gain significant traction, as consumer Office subscribers topped 15 million. On the commercial side, Office 365 was slowed by the Windows 10 launch, but once businesses realized that Windows 10 was a solid upgrade, Office 365 commercial grew by leaps and bounds. Three changes in the last few years have really solidified Microsoft's hold on the productivity business. First, in 2017 Apple decided to shutter its productivity suite. Though hard core Apple fans loved Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, these software products no longer fit Apple's hardware core business. Second, in late 2017 Google decided a free productivity suite no longer made sense. The company was making so much money on its self-driving car technology, and from YouTube subscriptions, that giving away Google Docs was no longer good business. Third, by 2017 Microsoft finally managed to fully integrate Cortana and Skype into Office 365. With voice commands through Cortana to accomplish simple tasks, and Skype for real-time collaboration, Office 365 has become an even bigger cash cow for Microsoft than before. Investors love the stability of the company's subscription revenue model, and constant updates and new features keep users happy. The future is cloudy, and that's a good thing Microsoft's biggest transformation, has been the growth of its commercial cloud business. In 2015, the company generated about $8 billion in annual cloud revenue. Somewhat surprisingly, by 2018, Microsoft surpassed its goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud revenue. The company's deep knowledge of CRM has helped its Dynamics CRM Ultra business to explode. In 2015, CRM was a $20 billion market and Microsoft had only a small part of the pie. Today, CRM is a $35 billion market, and Microsoft owns 20%. Microsoft's reputation in the cloud computing space has helped Azure become a monster business for the company. In fact, between Office 365 Commercial, Dynamics CRM Ultra, and Azure, Microsoft posted an annual run rate of $20.6 billion in commercial cloud revenue based on the second quarter of 2018. It hasn't all been roses for Microsoft on the path to 2018. Windows 11 wasn't that well received, but Windows 12 seems to be a strong upgrade. When the second iteration of Surface smartphones came out, the Surface X was compared to the Zune media player. When Apple released the Apple Watch 4, with a screen that expanded to 4", but could be folded to wear on the wrist, all of the smartphone industry shuddered. When Apple announced the price would be $999, some of these fears were lessened. That being said, Microsoft's Office 365 is now the undisputed leader in the industry. The company's commercial solutions are well regarded, and Microsoft's Commercial revenue growth of $17 billion in the last three years is remarkable. This significant revenue growth, combined with impressive margins, has led the company to earnings per share of nearly $4. As investors have realized Microsoft has become a growth story again, the P/E multiple has expanded to about 20. With the stock above $80 a share, investors who bought in 2015 are up more than 75%. This company once thought to be dead money, has turned into a market darling once again. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT.
