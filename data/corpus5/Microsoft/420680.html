Augmented, Virtual Reality - The Sizzle To Sell The Microsoft Steak - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha At CompuTex, Microsoft pushed its HoloLens technology for Augmented and Virtual Reality. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is trying to embrace-and-extend Windows 10 into Augmented and Virtual Reality using the same strategy that powered it to the top of the PC stack decades ago, Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs. Microsoft was the main attraction at the recent CompuTex show in Taiwan, where it demonstrated its HoloLens technology and suggested 80 million such devices, tied to Windows, will be in use in four years. This was music to the OEMs' ears. The Taiwanese manufacturers have been suffering as PC sales have declined, and they need a growth story to keep believing Microsoft can pull them out of the swamp. The Microsoft Holographic Platform , a version of Windows 10 tied to the technology, fits the bill. The message was that Microsoft is not going to be making the hardware, so guess who will? An Augmented Reality headset adds data to a real scene and can be useful in business, allowing a repairman to "see" the manual and what he has to do while he's working on a repair, for example, putting data where it's needed, between a worker and their hands. It is a natural fit for Windows, on which most existing business applications are written. A Virtual Reality headset creates an entirely new world for entertainment to play in, and many see it as the future of entertainment and communication. It certainly represents the future of the Xbox technology and boosters are trying to sell it to Hollywood as well. Between them, AR and VR represent a new client device gold rush. By tying these technologies to Windows, Microsoft hopes to dominate that world no matter who wins. While pulling Taiwan in with dreams of glory, Microsoft also wants to push them from behind, on the cost side. That's what I believe lies behind its new agreements with Xiaomi , the Chinese cell phone company. This week Microsoft sold Xiaomi the 1,500 patents that will make its legal teams competitive in the West. Helping it sell phones in competition with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android is just the first piece of the alliance. That is because Xiaomi's (Private: XI ) ambitions go well beyond phones. The company has gone into the drone market , it has an Android streaming box for the U.S. market , and it is ramping up the advertising budget with the aim of becoming a full-service consumer electronics company. Privately-held Xiaomi is reportedly worth $45 billion, its phone business is not meeting those valuation expectations, and it badly needs new revenue streams. By helping Xiaomi turn around the phone business with its patents, and offering a vision of Augmented Reality for Business and Virtual Reality for consumers, Microsoft hopes to turn this low-cost manufacturing power on for its Windows software teams. As I noted a few weeks ago , Microsoft's stock only seems expensive, because the Price/Earnings multiple of 40 includes massive write-offs from a year ago on the phone business, write-offs that helped clear the desk for the Xiaomi alliance. Take out those write-offs and the company should be earning about $3/share this year, a P/E of 18 and close to the tech market averages. So all this talk about AR and VR isn't essential to the case for buying Microsoft, but it's the sizzle that helps sell the stake. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL.
