Microsoft: More Layoffs Equal Higher Shareholder Returns - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft may announce another round of layoffs. Historically, this has been good for big companies and bad for small companies. Layoffs will improve profitability without any compromises in sustaining its competitive advantage across core markets. If Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) were to go through another round of job cuts, I'm almost certain the stock would move higher. This is driven by the size of the company and perhaps the overly excessive workforce needed to maintain certain Microsoft products like the Office Suite and back-end OS for server cloud platforms. In other words, even if Microsoft were to reduce its headcount, it's unlikely to come from the faster growing business units like Bing, Skype, Office Business Intelligence, Azure and Surface Pro. In other words, Microsoft could use a leaner organization and conserve the cash spent on the wrong hires in favor of building a more profitable cloud and mobile business. When looking back, Microsoft's net profit margin has been higher historically. Returning to a more profitable business may need to be driven by a combination of attrition and launching more enterprise software products. Ideally, that strategy would at least maintain a level of decorum among the employee ranks. However, the company really needs to rationalize the cost of having an excessive number of people working in sales and various areas of the organization. I'm almost certain there's both a combination of overlapping departments and redundant business units that don't justify the cost. Furthermore, Microsoft's revenue per headcount figure has trended lower. So reversing this trend either has to involve rapid top line expansion or reduction in headcount. I think it's fair to say that the company may need to go down the headcount route if it wants to improve its efficiency. At least, according to the Clute Institute, Journal of Applied Business Research (vol. 20 number 1): Conversely, in both simple regression (Panel B) and multiple regression (Panel C) results, there is a significant and positive relationship between firm size and cumulative prediction errors. The larger the size of the firm, the more positive the stock price reaction to the announcement of the layoff. This is consistent with the hypothesis that as the level of predisclosure information (firm size) increases, negative states of nature existing prior to the layoff are known and are already incorporated into the stock price. Therefore, the announcement of the layoff is viewed as a "fix" to an existing problem, with the market reaction being positive. This is referred to as the potential benefit hypothesis, which states that to the extent the layoff itself is perceived to provide a potential benefit, there will be a positive reaction to the announcement of the layoff, (Iqbal and Shetty (1995) and Caves and Krepps (1993)). So, Microsoft is as big as "big" gets. There aren't that many other big companies that could benefit from layoffs, and when based on empirical research, the data supports that small businesses who lay off employees are signaling a response in light of weakening demand for products and services due to the economic environment. However, when big companies lay off employees it's usually driven by the need to appease shareholders, and scale back the business, so that's it's more efficient. There's additional research on the topic from the Leeds School of Business (University of Colorado) that supplements the research by helping to analyze the contagion effects of firms that downsize. Quoted from the Intra-Industry Contagion Effects of Layoff Announcements: The negative impact of stock returns from mass layoff announcements comes from announcements in which the firm cites adverse market conditions as the main reason for the layoff. Layoffs in which the announced reason is related to efficiency improvements actually presented positive abnormal returns. As there is no cost but reputational costs for misleading announcements, it seems reasonable to ask if the announced reasons are actually related to future performance. Palmon et. al. provide an analysis that corroborate the relationship between the announced layoff reason and measures of future profitability and sales. Similarly, Farber and Hallock (2009) find that the market reacts less negatively to mass layoffs in which the announced reason is other than demand slump (Page 6). In the case of Microsoft, it's hard to argue the company is downsizing because of the economy or because of demand-related issues. Therefore, in the case of Microsoft abnormal returns may occur following the announcement of layoffs in non-performing business units. The company is heavily diversified. While PC licensing is performing horribly the various other segments are growing at pretty respectable rates: Cloud, mobile, tablets, search, gaming, Skype. Looking over Microsoft's historical profitability one could easily argue that Microsoft could be doing better. Furthermore designing software isn't very labor intensive, so Microsoft should have a broader portfolio of products by now. Microsoft tends to concentrate its time and energy on a small portfolio of products. The concentration of labor has generated marginal returns, so it may make more sense to maximize the utility of labor across certain business units by reducing headcount, then look to make acquisitions, as it wouldn't be reflected as an operating expense but rather a transaction that would involve a change in cash and goodwill on the balance sheet. So, therefore, if the rumors are true and Satya Nadella is prepping for another round of headcount reductions it's fair to assume the stock will react positively. Improving efficiency will give Microsoft more free cash flow in which to buy back shares or acquire companies. Microsoft does make deals every year, and hopefully they can add momentum in areas pertaining to hardware and IT infrastructure. Furthermore, Microsoft's IaaS and PaaS business is doing phenomenally, and as such I can't help but reiterate my buy recommendation. It's a safe Dow stock that pays dividends, generates reasonable growth and trades at a reasonable valuation. The recent pullback is a great opportunity to buy a high quality business at a cheaper price.
