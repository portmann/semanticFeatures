Microsoft: What's The 2015 Dividend Raise? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Balance sheet weakened a little over past year. Management's decision on buyback is crucial for dividend. Next month, I am expecting technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to announce its annual dividend raise. Last year, the company did exactly what I expected , raising its dividend to $0.31 per quarter. The company has more than doubled its dividend since 2010, as seen in the chart below. Today, I'll look at Microsoft's key financial data, and provide my prediction for this year's dividend raise. The year provided is for the majority of payments, so the $0.31 value represents the 3 payments coming in 2015. *According to Microsoft's dividend history, the first payment in fiscal 2006 was $0.08, before being raised to $0.09 for the final three payments. The chart above uses the $0.09 figure for fiscal 2006. When determining any potential dividend raise, a review of the company's balance sheet is definitely needed. In the table below, I've detailed some key numbers over the past year, taken from the company's most recent 10-K filing . Dollar values are in millions. The "domestic held" value is the amount of cash located inside the US, which is total cash minus cash held by foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to material repatriation tax effects if brought home. Microsoft ended its fiscal Q4 with a very low domestic cash balance. However, the company does produce a lot of cash quarterly, and can obviously issue debt if it needs to. The two key items I'm focused on are the decline in the net cash balance, and the rise in the debt ratio. This reduces the company's financial flexibility a little, which could have a negative impact on this year's potential dividend raise. The second item to think about is the company's buyback, which can have both positive and negative effects on the dividend. During the fiscal 2015 period (ending June 30th, 2015), Microsoft bought back more than $13.2 billion worth of shares. That was more than the $11 billion spent in the prior two years combined. The company did take on a bit of debt to accomplish this program, taking advantage of lower rates earlier this year. Also, when the stock pulled back early in 2015, the company stepped in and bought a large chunk of shares. A little more than 70% of repurchased shares were bought in the second half of the fiscal year. This year, the company has already stated on its Q4 conference call that the stronger dollar will negatively impact results. Also, the stock is back near $47, just a few dollars away from its 52-week high. When you combine this with the expectation that interest rates will rise in the next few months, I'm not sure the company will borrow as much to repurchase shares. I would expect a more "normal" level of buybacks, as opposed to the big year we just saw. On one hand, less share repurchases could free up more money for the dividend. On the other hand, the share count doesn't come down as fast, which negatively impacts the dividend. So what could a potential raise look like? Well, last year's raise was 3 cents per quarter. Given the slightly weaker balance sheet plus currency issues, I think that would be the largest raise we would see. Since the company probably wants to go with whole cents for its dividend, it's possible to see a step down to a 2 cent raise. In the table below, I've modeled what a potential raise could look like, based on quarter-cent increments. The yellow range is the $0.33 to $0.34 per quarter area where I think the new dividend will land. Given what I've presented above, I would go with a 2 cent raise if I was deciding on the dividend. With the uncertainty around the Windows 10 launch and its impact on the PC space, I'd rather the company take a more conservative approach at this time. In the chart below, I've compared where Microsoft's current and potentially raised ($0.33) dividend compares against the following tech peers as of Friday's close: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), and IBM (NYSE: IBM ). The other five names average about 2.84% currently, which would basically be where Microsoft's annual yield would be with a $0.33 quarterly dividend, based on current stock prices. In the end, I think Microsoft investors would be more than satisfied with a roughly 6.5% dividend raise, which would put the annual yield just below that of a 30-Year US treasury bond. Microsoft is a cash generating machine currently, and even despite some balance sheet weakness, next month should see a dividend raise. Source: Microsoft: What's The 2015 Dividend Raise?
