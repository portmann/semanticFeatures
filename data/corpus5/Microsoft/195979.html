Microsoft: What Is The Market Potential Of HoloLens? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Although HoloLens is still in development, the technology behind it is very impressive and has great potential. To be widely adopted, HoloLens must overcome technical limitations that have been observed in the early prototypes by the media. If these limitations can be overcome, Microsoft may have achieved a quantum leap in computer interfaces akin to the mouse and touchscreen. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) HoloLens is the most technically innovative wearable tech introduced this year. Secrecy surrounding the device and its limited exposure to the media make it challenging to assess its market potential. The market potential could be huge, but this is contingent on further technical advances. In this article I give my initial assessment of the technical issues and promise of HoloLens. Microsoft's augmented reality goggles HoloLens featured prominently in the October 6 hardware event . A mixed reality game called Project Xray was demonstrated that looked like a lot of fun, at least as seen in the video. As an electro-optical engineer by training, I continue to be blown away by the technical daring of HoloLens. I'm so impressed that I can even forgive Microsoft's misuse of the term hologram. The virtual stereoscopic objects seen through the goggles are not true holograms. But the usage of the term does accord with the popular conception of holograms that goes back to Princess Leia's emergency message projected by R2D2. Other writers have not been so kind. Daniel Eran Dilger dismissed HoloLens as derivative and deceptive in what has become all too familiar Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fan parochialism. Despite being an Apple investor and frequent writer on Apple topics , I can't do the same. As an engineer, I have to acknowledge technical excellence, whatever the source. But as I've pointed out so many times, mere technical innovation does not guarantee success in the marketplace. HoloLens poses considerable difficulties in trying to assess its market potential. Microsoft has not been very forthcoming about the technology behind HoloLens, and there are no publicly available units for a teardown. I'm not even sure how it works, although the Wikipedia writeup is probably a good summary, as far as it goes. However, one aspect of the HoloLens has received considerable media attention since journalists were first allowed to try the system out, and that is the narrow field of view of the system. What this means for the user is that with the goggles, the user has a sort of tunnel vision for the "holograms". If the user isn't looking more or less directly at the hologram, it will tend to disappear. The goggles are transparent, so the user has the normal field of view for the real world, and therefore normal peripheral vision. The fact that the goggles offer no peripheral vision for "holograms" makes the experience very unrealistic and non-immersive. This has been pointed out in various media outlets, and perhaps the best discussion of this is in Ars Technica . I bring up the issue of field of view because I consider it absolutely critical to the question of the broad market appeal of HoloLens. Field of view is what is going to make or break HoloLens. If HoloLens can achieve the field of view of typical virtual reality goggles, about 90 degrees horizontally, then it stands a very good chance of gaining wide adoption as a display medium for a wide variety of computing-related applications, gaming not the least. Without the wider field of view, the applications for HoloLens become much more limited, and so does the market. This has not been lost on the tech media, which has pointed out the somewhat deceptive nature of the video demonstrations that Microsoft has put on with HoloLens, as in this write up in the Verge of the October 6 demo. Writers have pointed out that what is shown in the way of hologram visibility (over a much larger field of view than the HoloLens system has) is not what the HoloLens user can actually see. After studying the Verge video clip of the demo, I've come to the conclusion that the special HoloLens camera used to capture the action must have a much larger field of view than the prototype HoloLens itself. I estimate the camera field of view to be about 90 degrees (horizontal), based on the location of the camera relative to the HoloLens user and other elements of the set in the demonstration. Unless the demonstration is a total fake (which is not inconceivable) then this means that the camera system demonstrates that the field of view limitation in the current HoloLens system can be overcome. There might be limitations in packaging such as system, but these limitations can probably be overcome in future iterations of HoloLens. If the field of view limitation really can be overcome (and that's still a big if), then I believe the market potential for HoloLens becomes huge. For one thing, it basically takes over virtual reality, since external light can be easily blocked out with a different visor. So HoloLens becomes a dual mode virtual/augmented reality device. But it's also a better VR device by virtue of being lighter, more comfortable to wear, and not needing to be tethered to a PC. In augmented reality mode, the Project Xray game that was demoed only scratches the surface. Imagine something like this, as a multiplayer game, with virtual costumes and weapons. It's laser tag taken to a whole new level. And under the right circumstances, players wouldn't even need to be in the same physical location. The MMO also gets taken to a whole new level. With sufficient resolution and processing power, HoloLens could be a platform for a new type of virtual surround video entertainment. Imagine a movie, where you're in the movie. There are also plenty of serious applications of course, such as virtual video conferencing, and any number of engineering and scientific applications where HoloLens would be a useful instructional and visualization tool. But it's the broader entertainment applications, both interactive and non-interactive, that really make the market for HoloLens. The market for augmented and virtual reality has been estimated to be $150 billion by 2020. With HoloLens technology, that becomes a converged market. The HoloLens technical approach is so superior in my view that it represents a quantum leap compared to anything that has come before by way of virtual reality goggles. The VR market is already being disrupted before even becoming a market. The technical approach of putting a heavy LCD screen into a heavy set of goggles that blinds the user is already DOA. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) might as well start over. Microsoft has jumped so far out in front of its competition that it's hard to imagine that it will not own the AR/VR market for the next five years or more. Five years is the lead time that Microsoft has amassed by virtue of starting on HoloLens back in 2010. Microsoft has done nothing less than invent a fundamentally new way for humans and computers to interact. This is as revolutionary as the mouse or the touchscreen. This is virtual 3D rooms rather than virtual desktops. The transition to ubiquitous use of HoloLens type systems may happen slowly. At $3000, the first developer systems are not cheap. They're also still clumsy and bulky, too bulky probably for most people to want to wear for day to day use. But assuming that field of view can be improved and bulk reduced, it appears that Microsoft has this market to itself. That makes Microsoft a long-term buy for the investor that shares Microsoft's unique HoloLens vision. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
