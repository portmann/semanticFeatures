Hardware Is Vital To Microsoft's Future - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Mac sales have quadrupled in the last ten years, and with cheaper solutions, Macs are now becoming a viable option to Windows machines. Microsoft's Surface has the ability to grow with the same foundation that Apple has had, but has a larger user base to work with. Microsoft's innovation is inspiring new Microsoft fans, which have never been seen before due to Microsoft's formerly indirect relationship with the customer. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) efforts to rapidly expand the Mac into the consumer and enterprise markets have delivered exceptional progress and could start placing further pressure on Windows in the coming years. In the last ten years, Mac sales have more than quadrupled, and in its recent earnings, Apple explained that its enterprise tactics are now bearing fruit, noting that IBM has more than 30,000 Macs deployed in its offices with more than 1,900 being added each week. IBM's transition was driven by lower costs and higher residual value, which were valued at almost $300 per computer. With Apple's prestigious brand name, and the new halo effect that will undoubtedly come from record iPhone sales, it looks as though Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) could be in trouble. Unlike before, the Mac is now offering viable alternatives to Windows computers at allegedly better value. Fortunately, Microsoft has spent the last several years bridging these gaps as the Surface lineup has been executed brilliantly. I expect to see massive growth to come to the Surface with the very same foundations that helped the Mac grow: brand equity, residual value and the halo effect. With Microsoft's shares trading near all-time highs, it's difficult to recommend buying it due to the Surface. Instead, I would like to focus on the growth potential and benefits that the lineup will bring Microsoft in the years to come. The hardware innovation is exceptionally good and with the arrival of the Surface Book laptop, it's clear that we will see the ambitious lineup engage new form factors such as all-in-one desktops, workstations, and likely a solution for every Mac on the market. There's no wondering why - in the last twelve months, the Mac generated $25B in sales in spite of its tiny 6.9% market share. With Microsoft holding the lion's share, this is a huge opportunity that could be very beneficial to shareholders in the long run. Perhaps the greatest benefit of Microsoft's hardware strategy comes from the brand equity that it can yield. Apple proved that hardware is incredibly important, and as unfortunate as it may be, the hero in the eye of the customer is the hardware innovator. As such, when it comes to Android, Samsung often takes the spotlight instead of Google. Before Microsoft's Surface, its relationship with the customer was limited to what unmotivated OEMs provided. As a result, customers had poor experiences such as dealing with outsourced call centers when they needed computer support. When compared to Apple's simple Genuis Bar solution, Microsoft's image takes a hit. Thankfully, the Microsoft Store and Surface were inspired to take action and with an identical approach to Apple I strongly believe that customers will come to associate themselves with Microsoft - not Dell, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )( OTC:SSNNF ), HP (NYSE: HPQ ), Sony (NYSE: SNE ) or any other OEM on the market. Another fact working in Microsoft's favor is its inspiring level of innovation. The devices keynote for the Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and HoloLens were arguably the greatest technology presentations of the year. The rare standing ovations and loud cheering for a Microsoft event serves as proof. Furthermore, as Apple is now seemingly following Microsoft's lead with products like the iPad Pro, we will come to see fans pride themselves in Windows in the very same way that Mac users did in the Mac vs. PC days. This equity will work wonders in Microsoft's favor as the Mac is now growing to be a viable and affordable alternative to Windows solutions. If Microsoft doesn't arm itself with an equal level of loyalty, it will struggle should Apple and Microsoft be on the same playing field. One of IBM's decisive factors in owning Macs was due to its cost savings for IBM noted that it saves almost $300 per Mac. The first two iterations of the Surface and Surface Pro were poorly received among customers so residual value has taken a hit, but the strong reception of the Surface Pro 3 in addition to its high-quality design has played a valuable role in its exceptional residual value. The SP3 has been around for 16 months, but its value has barely fallen according to this Los Angeles area Craigslist search , which is very much in line with how Mac products perform. Surely, when it comes to most consumers, the thought of residual value doesn't come to mind. However, many Apple product users come to realize that the computers and iPhones have very good value retention, which in the end boosts brand loyalty. This only reminds me of my $850 broken Toshiba laptop from 2008. If I had bought Apple's entry-level MacBook (the white one) at the time for $1,100, and if it were still working, I would be able to sell it for up to $400 according to LA Craigslist results, while the working Toshiba wouldn't even go for $100. Fortunately, those who own Surface products following the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3 will be very pleased to know that they won't be suffering from big depreciation down the line. I know that residual value played a small role in my loyalty towards Apple and I'm glad to see that it can do the same for Surface users. Prior to the successful Surface Pro 3, Microsoft stated that it's "not interested in competing with our OEMs when it comes to hardware. In fact, our goal is to create new categories and spark new demand for our ecosystem." The Surface Pro 3 fell exactly in line with that statement. But in spite of its marketing claims, it couldn't replace the laptop for everyone. And since OEMs were still failing to compete with MacBooks, I wrote that Microsoft should create its own laptop as well. I'm very excited to see that they followed through with the Surface Book, but I think that Microsoft can expand the Surface into a whole new array of products, at least one for every different kind of Mac on the market. The next steps that we may see Microsoft make are a high-end all-in-one desktop PC because OEMs are failing dramatically when compared to the 4K and 5K iMac on the market. On Microsoft's behalf, this would be a long-term investment into the future of its hardware development as there are many benefits from a broader portfolio of products. First, revenue wouldn't fall 26% sequentially as it did last quarter due to the Surface Pro 4's market anticipation. Secondly, it would allow Microsoft to pioneer technologies that could be strategically spread throughout all of its products such as Apple's Force Touch, which started in the Apple Watch and made its way to the MacBook Pro and iPhone 6S. Thirdly and finally, Microsoft can develop a product ecosystem that would rival Apple, and Microsoft could use its billion-plus users to channel a halo effect into its hardware, just how the Mac benefits from the hundred-million-plus iPhones on the market. Apple's market cap is a clear example of what happens when hardware is entered into the equation and if Microsoft continues to successfully execute its hardware strategy, I believe that it can easily grow from its current levels. Last quarter, Apple's Mac generated more than ten times Surface revenue, which is actually quite low considering the life of each lineup, and largely due to the Lion's share potential that Microsoft has. In spite of what's said, I can't simply recommend buying shares based on Microsoft's hardware approach because hardware is a small portion of Microsoft and shares are trading near all-time highs. However, it's something that investors should keep in mind because hardware is really important, so should shares pull back and if Surface revenue continues to grow, it could just be one act in favor of buying.
