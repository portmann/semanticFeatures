Microsoft's Alteryx-Power BI Integration Is An Example Of Satya Nadella's Core Strategy - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has announced Power BI has integrated with new partner Alteryx. Alteryx is a follow-on addition of mission-critical, business management functionality following Microsoft's recent VoloMetrix acquisition. Microsoft, while helping its new partner Alteryx, also is going to make a run at Alteryx's customers in that no other Alteryx BI partner has a complete software/hardware ecosystem. If you missed out on the big Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) device event a few days ago you might want to catch a recap video or spend some time breaking out what all was announced because the device story directly plays into the software/platform story at the company. I know that sounds obvious but with CEO Satya Nadella's vision of Microsoft understanding the connectivity of everything - the devices, the productivity suite, the general software spectrum, etc., is huge. In fact, it's everything. That is the "new" Microsoft. The one-platform, one-experience across devices cure-all to the need that confronts you. At least that's the goal. Along these lines, a few weeks ago Microsoft dipped its figurative toes into the waters of helping run a business for its users. Now, I'm not talking about providing the productivity suite that helps "run the business" - Office and all its variations, etc., but the actual systems to make underlying business decisions. Things like hiring and firing, like managing productivity of human capital, like managing collaboration across teams. This is something that's becoming more apparent by the development - device announces, software updates, partner integrations, etc., as hugely important to the Microsoft market share capture strategy. Was this ability available to users prior? Sure. I guess. To power-users who knew exactly how to funnel Microsoft's overall capacity into what they needed from it, maybe. But that's not good enough for Microsoft, that level of low visibility and access. So it bought VoloMetrix - an organizational analytics startup with a unique tech. Analysis of the acquisition has been linked above. And the VoloMetrix purchase plays as everything Microsoft is doing these days into the broader picture that Microsoft is trying to express and illustrate. At full integration, VoloMetrix will make the productivity suite a better solution for a wider base of users, it will make the productivity suite more efficacious, and it will bring its own value-add to the ecosystem as a whole that it didn't have prior. Microsoft would love to continue to find ways to embellish other tools' efficacy with VoloMetrix (or any other part of the ecosystem), especially if that tool is its all-important Power BI. This week's Power BI ecosystem partner integration should help this goal as well as help embellish the value-add of VoloMetrix. Don't think that's coincidental either - the timing that is. Power BI has announced that it has partnered with "Workflow" engine Alteryx. I wasn't all that familiar with Alteryx prior to the announcement but after chatting with a friend in high frequency trading in Chicago I've come to find out that Alteryx "Workflows" are incredibly powerful and incredibly helpful to sorting out data prior to the visualization of the data and specifically when you know what you're looking for. Remember, BI is generally used when you don't know what you're looking for - as a way to ask questions of the data quickly and with easy to read outputs. An incredibly easy to follow video explaining Workflows has been linked. My summary analysis of Alteryx is that it acts as a silo engine that can help answer data specific questions, which BI can do as well, but from an extremely granular standpoint as well as a standpoint of completely open architecture. Again, the above linked video is worth a watch. But what does this do for Power BI? Well, Power BI is now a data output destination for Alteryx Workflows which becomes incredibly powerful to those who need to view/present/collaborate the Workflows derived data with parties who maybe don't "do" data for a living. Power BI can now help take the value-prop of Alteryx to the next level and with that the business/data specific Workflows to the next level. That said, Alteryx also is integrated into Power BI competitor solutions by Tableau (NYSE: DATA ) and Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ). What those competitors don't have, however, is a full productivity ecosystem complete with outside hardware and outside software. They also don't have any other mission-critical assisting tech like what Microsoft just bought and is likely to acquire more of or partner more with - Alteryx is a nice example of this. Alteryx is a great example of Microsoft the umbrella, the ecosystem, allowing a particular tool (Power BI) make a run on a partner's customers without 1) hurting the partner in any way but also 2) hurting its competition in a direct way. This is how the Satya Nadella vision is playing out. That matters. Microsoft also has the added bonus of being able to acquire, via partnership, even more ability to help a user "run" their business - again, that's shaping out to be a major strategic initiative for the company. For me, this wasn't "just another" partner integration to Power BI - and admittedly a few have been. For me this partner integration was a microcosm of the Satya Nadella Microsoft strategy. I also really see it being meaningful to those who spend their day lost in a world of data. That should work well for Power BI, for the user, and for Alteryx.
