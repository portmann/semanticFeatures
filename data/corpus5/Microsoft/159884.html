Benefits Of Apple Enterprise Deals Flow One Way - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Cisco is very happy to be creating a "fast lane" for iOS devices. This will be of enormous benefit to Apple, but benefits to Cisco are negligible. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has another big enterprise deal, this time with Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), which brought former CEO John Chambers out to hug Tim Cook like it was Christmas. Cisco is creating a "Fast Lane" within its enterprise structures that will let iOS devices communicate with corporate offices. Enterprise networks can do this, as they have no requirement to be neutral regarding devices. The idea, for Cisco, is to demonstrate the benefits of secure, structured Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and thus sell more of its gear to enterprises. The hope is that it becomes the "only choice" for companies that standardize on Apple for field equipment. For Apple, the benefits are more immediate. Many of its customers have already standardized on Cisco. Now those customers will standardize on Apple as well, ditching Android devices (or making employees ditch them) in the process. But is this a reason to buy Cisco, either now or when the current bear market correction ends? Not really. Cisco is what it has been for some time, an average big company. You like the dividend, which yielded 3.34% at the start of trading? That's a reason to buy Cisco. Just don't buy it for growth, especially not on the back of this deal. After all, we have seen this movie before. We saw it last year regarding IBM (NYSE: IBM ), which said it would start selling Apple gear to users of its enterprise systems. Where have IBM's shares gone since then? They are down 25% over the last year. But the yield is up to 3.5%. The hope in all this is that these enterprise deals will get these enterprise players serious about security, in more than just their advertisements (which right now are all about it because it's a primary pain point). But the primary impact of these enterprise deals is for Apple to suck the lifeblood out of the old enterprise players, companies like IBM and Cisco whose customers have been demanding a more up-to-date client solution for field work, and find they must support Apple as much as they can in order to deliver that. It really means that Apple doesn't have to worry about building the enterprise cloud support and enterprise network support to crack the enterprise market, it doesn't have to do the hard work of system integration in order to become an enterprise standard, as many of those advocating Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have been arguing. Apple has gotten a short cut to the enterprise. This benefits Apple. For Cisco, as for IBM, it's all defense, and if they use this to actually develop some better security tools, maybe they can get back in the game. But not until then. For now, they're giving their reputations to Apple and getting almost nothing for it but a pat on the back. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
