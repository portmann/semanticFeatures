Apple's VR Opportunities - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A number of virtual reality systems are about to begin shipping to consumers. Some of these make use of a smartphone to provide display, processing or both. At this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC), much of the buzz was about things connected to smartphones, rather than the phones themselves. The most important of these were virtual reality (VR) headsets of various types. Many of the major consumer electronics companies have virtual reality systems shipping or about to ship. But not Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Apple is hanging back at the moment, despite acknowledging interest in the field. This is probably a good strategy for now. With Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive about to ship, and Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Gear VR already available for free with a Galaxy S7 purchase, the huge gamble VR makers are taking may not be apparent. Many assume that VR will be the next big thing, and it was clear at MWC that many smartphone makers wanted to climb onto the bandwagon. Whether the smartphone companies were quite ready was another matter. LG's 360 VR headset, introduced at LG's splashy MWC event , seems to have fallen on its (virtual) face. It seemed like a good idea to use the LG G5 smartphone as the computation and graphics engine for the headset, but the G5 doesn't seem up to the task. The 360 VR seems like a good idea poorly executed. The headset is very compact, since it doesn't use the large displays found in other VR systems, and doesn't use the smartphone display, as in the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Gear VR, but reviewers have complained about light leakage (fixable), and poor performance of the G5 (harder to fix). I expect LG will keep evolving the product. With all the new product introductions and impending products such as the Sony (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation VR and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Hololens, one could construe that Apple has fallen terribly behind. Apple is reported to be working on VR and has hired staff for VR research. CEO Tim Cook even allowed at Apple's last earnings call that VR was interesting and not a niche. This was roughly what Cook was saying about wearables in the year before Apple Watch was unveiled. There's good reason for Apple to let the rest of the industry take the plunge first. The reason is that no one really knows what the VR market is. A recent article in Ars Technica reveals the deep ambivalence among many in the industry regarding the market potential for VR. There's a fundamental problem with VR, and it's the same problem that 3D TV has, which flopped big time in the market. This problem is the reason why stereoscopic 3D systems don't look or feel completely natural. The problem is called vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC). Vergence is the angle that your eyes converge or point to when focusing on a nearby object. Vergence is one of the ways your brain determines how close objects are (depth perception), and it's the mechanism that gets spoofed in 3D systems such as 3D movies and VR goggles. Accommodation is the focus of each eye on an object. Objects at different distances require different focus settings for your eyes, just as they do for cameras. Normally, vergence and accommodation work together and reinforce each other, because they both need to arrive at the same "distance setting." In 3D systems such as VR, vergence and accommodation become decoupled. The reason is that while the apparent vergence angle can change, the actual screen distance (which is what your eye has to focus on) is always the same. This is illustrated in the chart below from a UC Berkeley research presentation : VAC is what makes stereoscopic 3D seem unnatural, despite the fact that your brain is being fooled into perceiving depth where there is none. VAC can produce a wide range of symptoms from "eye strain" to headaches and nausea. All of the current generation of stereoscopic 3D systems, whether TV and computer screens, or VR goggles have the problem. No one's figured out a good solution yet, although there is ongoing work to solve the problem. It's very possible that VAC is what killed the market for stereoscopic 3D TV and computer displays. People just get tired of looking at 3D displays after a while, even if they don't suffer overt symptoms. VR goggles do solve one problem with 3D TV, which is image leakage through the glasses. This produces a "ghosting" effect, with the severity of the effect mostly depending on the simulated distance of the object. By using separate screens (or parts of a single screen), VR goggles can eliminate ghosting entirely. VR goggles combine this benefit with wide field of view and low latency head tracking to provide a much more immersive experience than is possible with a stereoscopic 3D screen. Will this be enough to overcome VAC? In effect, the entire industry is betting that it will, but no one really knows for sure. Interestingly, true laser holograms don't have the VAC problem. Laser holograms can be viewed without special glasses. The subjective impression is that you're looking through a window at objects in the background. You can focus on those objects as you would normally, and even see parallax differences as you move your head (look around objects in front to see other objects behind), within the limits of the physical frame of the hologram "window." I point this out because of the deliberate misnomers that Microsoft has been engaged in with the Hololens augmented reality (AR) system. Microsoft calls the virtual objects you see with Hololens "holograms." They are not. They're just stereoscopic 3D images overlaid on a real background. Hololens has the same VAC problem as any other stereoscopic 3D system. However, there is some reason to believe that Hololens might provide a better experience for users with less noticeable VAC. The reason has to do with the design philosophy of augmented vs. virtual reality. Hololens isn't trying to create a full 3D panorama, but only a set of virtual objects within a relatively narrow field of view. If those objects are projected at about the same distance required for the user's eye to focus, VAC can be reduced or eliminated. In many of the applications that have been demonstrated for Hololens, such as virtual screen projection overlaid on a physical wall, this can be a minimal VAC application. More importantly, the user is still able to look around at the physical world where there is no VAC. This gives the user's eyes a "rest," and probably lengthens the time that the goggles can be worn. Perhaps the most appealing aspect of VR/AR for a mobile device maker such as Apple is that VR/AR provides a large screen viewing experience in a mobile device. This solves a fundamental conflict we're seeing in mobile devices between mobility and screen size. The phablet is the current compromise of choice, but if smartphone users have the option to offer comfortable and compact glasses for viewing smartphone content, then this compromise might shift in the direction of using the glasses. So far, the glasses options haven't looked very good. The big VR systems are obviously too heavy and bulky. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Glass was too limited, by virtue of being self-contained, as well as too conspicuous. Hololens looks to be the most interesting, although it's also way too bulky, once again, by virtue of being self-contained. Ideally, Apple wants to build on the iPhone platform, but not in the way of the Samsung Gear VR, which just slots the smartphone into the goggles. Apple won't want to just provide a VR solution that users will only use under very limited circumstances. A Hololens system seems closer to what Apple would want, except not as a self-contained device. So Apple's logical path forward is a Hololens-type augmented reality system tethered wirelessly to the iPhone. The iPhone would provide the computational and graphics horsepower, while the glasses would provide the AR type display of the iPhone's data. This data could be either a full iPhone display or selected data and notifications. Assuming that this system is for purposes of the iPhone display, rather than simulated "holograms," then latency and head tracking become less of an issue. However, there's certainly potential for real time overlays for things like directions and object tagging. Eventually, one could foresee the system evolving along the lines of Hololens-like AR capabilities. The key for Apple would be to create something that people would be willing to use in public without embarrassment. Creating relatively inconspicuous glasses that people would wear is probably where Apple is directing its research. In this scenario, VAC ceases to be a problem, because the virtual iPhone screen being viewed by the user through the glasses becomes just one more object to look at. The key interest for Apple is not trying to do VR so much as solve the mobile device screen size conflict. Doing that makes the mobile devices much more useful, and therefore expands their target market. Being able to use AR glasses to create a subjectively large screen experience, being able to interact directly with that virtual screen through the same type of gestures used for the iPhone, would make the iPhone even more useful as a PC substitute. How close is Apple to this? Probably not that close. Much of the image forming technology in Hololens appears to be very advanced and not being duplicated elsewhere in the industry. The ability to create a bright, high contrast image against a fairly bright natural background is an achievement for Hololens that no one else has duplicated. That's what any kind of "Apple Glass" solution would need to achieve, and it would need to achieve it in something people would wear. In the mean time, Apple would probably opt to provide iOS support for third party VR goggles that would be physically tethered to an iPhone. This gets Apple into the game at minimal risk, and allows Apple to provide a VR experience that would use the iPhone's processing power to its best advantage. This is the LG 360 VR solution done right. Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster has projected that this is the approach Apple will take in the near term. We could see these APIs start to appear as early as this year's WWDC in June. With indications that iPhone sales growth is slowing (or worse), Apple is clearly motivated to build as many related services and products into the iPhone ecosystem as it can. VR/AR fits the bill nicely, which is why all the other smartphone makers are going in this direction. Apple has a key advantage in its control over the design of its processors for its iOS devices. Apple can ensure that any VR solution using the iPhone or iPad will actually work. VR and AR look like productive areas for Apple to expand into. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy.
