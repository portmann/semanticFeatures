Apple: Thinking Outside The iPad Box - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iPad's sales declines point to the need for Apple to do more to stay relevant to the evolving tablet market. The expected iPad Pro will boost sales, but probably not enough. Continuing declines in iPad sales point to the need for constructive action to reverse the trend. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) appears to be on the verge of taking that action in the form of a larger iPad Pro, equipped with true multitasking via iOS 9. In late 2014 I had hoped Apple would stem the decline of iPad sales this year. However, I'm no longer convinced that a refreshed iPad lineup and new iPad Pro will be enough to restore sales growth. Neil Cybart wrote a very thought provoking article about iPad ( Apple: Finding iPad's Future ) in which he observed that iPad was at risk of becoming irrelevant without a "new direction for iPad". I found myself agreeing that a new direction is needed. Where I disagree with Neil is in some specific data and perhaps in my disposition towards the iPad. Neil says there's "something about the iPad that just doesn't sit right with me." He then goes on to voice the oft-repeated criticism that iPad is just for content consumption. In contrast, I've never seen the content consumption aspect of iPad as a negative. I've owned 4 iPads and still have 3, although the older ones are mostly used for app testing. I've seen how the iPad enables uses of personal computing devices that just weren't possible with a conventional laptop, such curling up with a good ebook or an episode of Marco Polo. For me the iPad has all but taken over PC functions such as web browsing, email checking and instant messaging. It's also the only thing I use for video calling via Facetime. As much as some may disdain content consumption, it is, after all, what most of us were doing with our PCs outside of work before the advent of the iPad. The iPad has made those activities both more convenient and more environmentally friendly, reducing energy consumption. From my personal standpoint, there's no danger of irrelevance. However, Cybart puts forth a broader case than his personal viewpoint, and that needs to be addressed. For one, Cybart points to the declines in year over year sales growth as proof that iPad has long been in decline. I have a problem with his methodology. As a product's sales grow quarter after quarter, the y/y comps become increasingly difficult. Rarely does a product manage to sustain percent sales increases, since this requires greatly increasing sales in absolute terms. Most consumer products go through a sales trajectory that is parabolic. There is an initial rise, then a leveling off, followed by a decline. This is illustrated in the chart below of iPad sales since inception, plotted on a quarterly basis based on Apple's earnings reports . I've also provided a smoothed curve fit of the data that illustrates the parabolic trajectory of iPad sales. Although I would argue that a parabolic trajectory is normal for most consumer products, the brevity of iPad's trajectory I don't consider normal or natural. I consider it primarily an effect of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) tablet processor giveaway that began in 2014 Q1 and continues to the present . In the red line, I show what Apple's sales trajectory would have looked like if Intel's tablet processor unit sales (reported in Intel quarterly earnings ) were added to iPad sales. The plot represents an upper bound to iPad sales without the effect of Intel's subsidized tablet processors. It's arguable, of course, how much of the Intel tablet sales Apple would have captured. It could be argued that Intel's tablet processors went into low cost tablets where Apple wouldn't have been competitive anyway. But I wouldn't conclude that Intel based tablets therefore had no effect on iPad sales. Through giving away highly capable Bay Trail processors, Intel created a special category of low cost tablet that was much more capable (and competitive with iPad performance) than would otherwise have existed. The effect was to drain away a significant portion of iPad sales. This was illustrated by IDC's research findings for the tablet market in 2014 Q3, the "back to school" quarter. IDC reported: The top 5 was rounded out by RCA, which achieved its position by shipping 2.6 million units primarily in one country, the US. The RCA tablets featured Intel's nearly free tablet processors and were dirt cheap. Budget minded parents apparently bought them assuming that they were an acceptable substitute for iPad. 2014 Q3 was the first and only time that RCA has appeared in IDC's top five list of global tablet vendors. Even though I believe that iPad sales have declined prematurely based on the Intel effect, there's no doubt about the overall decline in the tablet market that started in Q4 of last year. Cybart points to the lack of utility for work and content creation as the culprit. He thinks people might well prefer a combination of smartphone and ultra portable laptop. I'm inclined to agree that the pure tablet form factor doesn't lend itself easily to traditional work place tasks, and this is certainly true of the iPad. This isn't really true in the Windows world, where Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has essentially solved the problem of how to make the tablet relevant in the workplace. Through Windows 10, Surface and the host of Intel based 2-in-1 hybrid laptops, Microsoft has demonstrated how the tablet stays relevant through convergence. Apple has kind of painted itself into a corner on this topic. By eschewing convergence, Apple has limited the market for its tablets unnecessarily. That's going to begin to change with the next generation of iPads, especially the much rumored large size (~12 inch) iPad Pro. In addition to the larger screen, which is really essential for a lot of content creation tasks, the Pro will feature iOS 9 multitasking, also essential for doing real work. Whether the iPad Pro will be competitive with Windows 10 tablets or convertibles remains to be seen. I'm inclined to think not. Windows 10 is a full fledged desktop class OS that is provisioned with full tablet support. iOS isn't really in the same league of capability, even though it's an excellent tablet OS. Apple's decision not to build touch screen capability into Mac OS X is really what's hurting it the most. Sure, a Mac OS X laptop or hybrid with a touch screen would cannibalize iPad sales. So what? That's just the price of innovation. iPhone cannibalized iPod, but looked at another way, iPod simply evolved into iPhone. Ironically, I believe that Mac OS X would require very little modification in order to be touch screen enabled. OS X already seamlessly integrates standard touch screen UI features such as app full screen mode and an icon based app launcher. As a hybrid OS, OS X would provide a better integrated and more consistent UI than even Windows 10. I believe that market forces will eventually compel Apple to change course on touch screen equipped Mac OS X devices. For the time being, Apple seems to want to approach the problem from the other direction, building more capability into iOS. This may work, but I'm doubtful. Increasingly, the problem for iPad, especially in enterprise, is that Apple is trying to compete iOS with Windows 10. That's a very lopsided competition. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
