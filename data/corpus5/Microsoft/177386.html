Microsoft Is Back To Fair Value And Could Stay There For Quite Some Time - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Having dipped back to a price of $43 since November, it could be a while before Microsoft regains growth from here. While dividends have continued to increase, earnings growth has so far been lackluster. In November of last year, I wrote an article arguing that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) may be trading at a significant premium with a price of $49 at the time. The reason for my argument was that with a P/E ratio of 19.4x and an absence of an increase in dividends and earnings, investors were potentially placing a premium on future growth which was bidding the stock upwards. Subsequent price action has supported my assumptions; Microsoft has since fallen back to a price of $43.48 at the time of writing. When I first used the dividend discount model to forecast an eventual price target of $53 for Microsoft, the below is the model that I used to do so - forecasting a hypothetical 10 percent year-on-year growth in both dividends and earnings per share: Source: Author's Calculations (November 2014 Article) It is appropriate at this point to compare actual performance in 2015 to what I had initially predicted. We can see that while predicted EPS for 2015 was $3.21, actual EPS for 2015 has come in at $2.46. Additionally, projected dividends per share were calculated at $1.23, with the actual figure of $1.24 meeting expectations. Therefore, we can see that while dividends have continued to increase, earnings have lagged behind expectations. In this regard, it is futile to assume price will rebound to a level of $49 given current earnings performance and indeed it could be a year or more before we see such appreciation. I had put a caveat on my last article, in that investors are expecting significant earnings performance from Microsoft to continue growing. I had previously expressed positive sentiment regarding Microsoft's new product line including the Surface Pro tablets. However, in spite of general excitement ahead of the release of the Surface Pro 4 tablet next October, investors are clearly not sharing such a sentiment. With a current P/E ratio of 18x, this has dropped slightly from that of last year which means investors may not be as keen to bet on future earnings. While the Surface Pro 4 is a step forward for the company; the idea of a tablet-computer hybrid in itself is not unique to Microsoft. Companies such as Asus, Lenovo, Apple, etc, are already getting in on the game and there is little inherently unique about Microsoft's Surface compared to these products. Moreover, Microsoft has not succeeded in building the brand loyalty enjoyed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and the iPad Pro could well have more success in this regard. Ultimately, Microsoft needs to continue to be more innovative in further building its cloud initiatives as the opportunity for differentiation in the hardware space becomes increasingly narrower. While Microsoft has been making inroads in this regard through its recent acquisition of Adallom , competition is still becoming increasingly crowded in this space and Microsoft risks losing its once coveted monopoly in the computing industry on a holistic basis. Ultimately, Microsoft could well continue to deliver solid dividends and could serve as a good income stock over the coming years. However, earnings at this point in time are neither here nor there, and on this basis I would not be overly optimistic on Microsoft at this point in time.
