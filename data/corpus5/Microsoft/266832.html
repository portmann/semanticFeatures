What To Expect From Automakers At CES Relevant To Tesla - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha Faraday Future to show â€œconcept carâ€?, which sounds totally unrelated to its much-expected practical production car. Volkswagen to show all-electric minivan, which will be major competition for Tesla when it eventually enters production. GM to show 200-mile range, $37,500 (or less) Chevy Bolt, which beats Teslaâ€™s Model 3 to market by at least one full year. Ford likely to show software update to Android Auto and Apple CarPlay for all of its cars going forward. Kia to show its self-driving car program, which will take a few years to materialize into a volume production car. CES is starting to compete with the NAIAS (North American International Auto Show), otherwise referred to as The Detroit Auto Show, as a key venue for global automakers to unveil new products. January 2016 will prove this thesis to a more significant degree than ever. This privately held startup has announced that it will show a concept car at this year's CES. It even says so on the company's home page : "Faraday Future will unveil a concept inspired by our design and engineering vision." In other words, what we will see at CES will obviously not be the production car, but rather an unrelated concept. As concept cars go, they can sometimes be impractical de-facto race cars with little applicability to real-life practicality and competition for regular cars. As such, if people are expecting Faraday Future to show its Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Model S-equivalent production car at this event, I think they will be disappointed. Faraday Future will likely show its practical production car some time later in 2016. It had previously spoken about having this car in production by the end of 2017, although it is no longer promising this delivery date. With the factory in Las Vegas not breaking ground until early 2016, it is unlikely going to be producing cars from that factory until early 2019 if everything goes well. Therefore, if Faraday wants to have this car in production by the end of 2017, it would have to happen from some other factory. More about this later. VW has teased us with a picture of what appears to be the front of a small minivan. It has also said that it will show an electric car concept. Numerous articles in recent weeks and months have plenty of evidence for this being a car that will enter production probably by the end of 2017 as a 2018 model. The main questions about this Volkswagen electric minivan are (1) What's the range? and (2) How large is this minivan really? There is certainly space in a vehicle of this size, to make the range at least somewhere around 200 miles on the US test cycle (300 miles on the European test cycle) -- and hopefully a lot more. In addition to this kind of near-production car (still called a "concept", technically), Volkswagen would also likely want to show more futuristic technologies -- ones that won't go into production until after 2017. That could entail an additional concept car and beyond. The big news here will be the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt. This one was recently leaked. The Bolt will have approximately 200 miles of range and cost no more than $37,500 before tax adjustments (and GM has on occasion hinted the price may even be less). It will be the first car of this kind (200 miles of range at this price), as it is expected to enter production around the end of 2016, which would be at least one full year before Tesla's equivalent Model 3. Perhaps the most interesting thing would be if GM were to announce, in conjunction with the Chevrolet Bolt, that it is investing in a charging network to compete with Tesla. Presumably GM would not build this network by itself, but rather in conjunction with the other major automakers, such as Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ), VW, BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ), Ford, Honda (NYSE: HMC ) and Mercedes. I am not expecting the complete details of such an announcement at CES this year, but perhaps some encouraging tidbits about what to expect later in the year. In addition, one might speculate that GM will talk about how OnStar will evolve. For example, allowing an owner to move between several GM cars and keeping settings for various preferences ranging from radio presets to seat adjustments. One year ago, Ford showed its new infotainment system called SYNC-3. Instead of being based on Microsoft, it is now based on BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) QNX. During 2015, this system was implemented in five Ford vehicles, and Ford said that it will be upgradeable to Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Auto and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CarPlay at some point in the future. Well, that "point in the future" is obviously now, at CES 2016. I expect this to be one of Ford's major announcements at CES this year. Unlike Kia and Hyundai upgrading their systems in the near future to Apple CarPlay, which will require a USB stick, Ford will do it over WiFi. This new infotainment system will continue to roll out across the rest of Ford's US lineup in 2016, so that by the end of 2016 almost 100% of Ford's US sales will have it. Kia will unveil its self-driving car program at CES 2016. For as far as bragging rights go, Kia has set expectations "low" in the sense that it does not see a seminal car in this field until 2020. It all depends on what you mean by "self-driving" however. Different definitions will yield different years, ranging from almost-today, to many decades from now. Kia is part of Hyundai and they are selling more cars in the US than you might have thought. For the first eleven months of 2015, Kia sold 571,577 cars in the US, and Hyundai sold 698,202 cars in the US. That points to full-year 2015 sales at 1.375 million cars, or not too far from 10% of the US car market. Therefore, when Kia and Hyundai do eventually make moves in this market -- both in terms of self-driving cars and electric cars -- it is likely to have a significant market impact. Hyundai has scheduled a press conference for the Detroit Auto Show the following week. Stock market conclusion: Incremental negatives for Tesla Tesla pulled out of the Detroit Auto Show (January 11-12), where it had exhibited in each of the last years. When we tally up what the competition will show at CES the week before, one might start to see why. There will be lots of new product to compete with Tesla, whether the current Model S or the future Model 3. Yes, not all products will be the same as the Model S, but that does not mean it's not competition. Some people have bought the Model S when they would have bought a product that was "close enough" in terms of range or some other metric, had such product been available. Two houses that are on the market, do not need to be identical in order to constitute comps. In the meantime, based on reading the owner forums , Tesla does not appear to have delivered more than approximately fifty Model X minivans to date (Founder Series, not Signature Series). The expectations used to be for Tesla to deliver at least approximately 5,000 Model X units by the end of this year. These expectations clearly came down in recent months, but if Tesla is only able to deliver as few as a couple hundred Model X cars by year-end 2015, that can't be a positive either.
