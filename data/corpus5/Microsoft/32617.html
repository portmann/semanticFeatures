AMD Versus Intel: Here's Why David Won't Slay Goliath In 2015 - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha To be realistic, FY 2015 is going to be a bad year for AMD, as broader weakness in tower and notebook PCs is going to weigh on year-over-year comps. Back-half results may not improve by much, as I anticipate market share loss in both laptops and towers due to inferior designs. There's limited flexibility to drive improvement in the cost structure, which indicates that investors shouldn't anticipate fattening margins through better efficiency. The console business is going to peak this year, with expectations of declining shipments and ASPs from this year forward. The launch of Skylake will negate whatever performance advantage AMD is expected to get from shifting pre-existing designs to a more advanced process node. Adding further examination to AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) earnings would be redundant, so I'm going to focus on the long-term one-year outlook I have on the stock. And for what it's worth, it's not pretty. It will be a while before we reach the multi-year refresh point that's indicative of replacement demand. Management mentions that the second quarter isn't going to be as good, as OEMs are likely to burn through inventory in anticipation of Windows 10, which will come with coveted features and marketing hype by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). So, timing is crucial on the part of OEMs, because they want to market newer computers that have the latest in features. It's easier to move product when Microsoft is throwing marketing dollars out from the rooftops of their Redmond headquarters. Clearly, AMD's second half may look a little better sequentially, but I'm hesitant to say it will be a good year for AMD. The company doesn't really operate a fab so there's limited flexibility to drive operating improvements on the back of higher fab utilizations, which drives average total cost lower. The cost of components is low relative to the depreciation of the equipment and facilities. Since operational improvement will be driven by higher sequential comps on the licensing side, where AMD has really high margins, the operating performance is going to improve based more on a mix-shift in segment recognition of revenue versus structural changes in operations. Also, the licensing business faces considerable challenges going forward, as consoles aren't going to perform as well due to falling ASPs, and shipments are expected to either decline or grow at an anemic pace in the upcoming fiscal year. Here's a direct quote from the Q&A from SA Transcripts: When looking at the above graph, handhelds are expected to decline, and consoles are expected to stagnate over the course of the next three years. In fact, this is normal because annualized shipment volume usually peaks within the first two to three years of launch, which is modeled into JPR's research, hence investors should be nervous when management tries to paint a brighter picture at their mid-year analyst day event. This puts pressure on AMD to come up with new ideas to generate revenue, but how, and where? The semiconductor market is highly specialized and dominated by a small number of companies that specialize in mobile communication, general purpose computing, application specific integrated circuits, fabrication facilities, printed circuit board assembly, micro electromechanical systems, micro controller units, and commodity parts for none-cutting edge use. Either people are competing on economics or value in the space, and in many cases the larger players are able to package an end-to-end solution that provides both value and economics. AMD doesn't have that many play options, and using standard football logic, it would be nice to have a flexible playbook. In the case of AMD there are constraints, because competition is going to prevent AMD from gaining design wins in many of the high volume, high margin markets that do exist. Either AMD doesn't have the necessary feature set, or it doesn't have the necessary pricing mechanism in place to gain significant orders. Sure, AMD's embedded graphics business has found its way into iMacs, but for the most part, it's not present in the high margin, fast growing laptop market. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) gains the embedded graphics business from all of the major PC OEMs because power efficiency is extremely important in that form factor. Sure, Carrizo promises better performance, but in comparison to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) product stack, I don't anticipate significant design wins as Intel has targeted the lower pricing tiers with an end-to-end system on chip solution through the Atom X5 and X7 series. In cases where pricing on notebooks exceed $700, Broadwell-U and M will remain untested, and unchallenged, as the performance characteristics at the 4W-15W power envelop is hard to match, which is why AMD is non-existent in the high-end of the laptop market as power efficiency is given higher priority due to battery life and size constraints. Also, AMD is going to get squeezed in the desktop PC business as the company is exposed to the upcoming launch of Skylake, which is where Intel will showcase both a transistor density advantage through second generation FinFETs paired with a design overhaul driving significant improvement in performance. Typically, Intel CPUs have a lot of room for over-clocking, which is why enthusiasts tend to build their PC rigs with a low-end Core i7 and start cranking the voltage. A typical PC enthusiast can spend less than $100 for an after-market water-cooling set-up, which allows the PC user to send the CPU's clock speed into the 4-5 GHz range, which is enough to drive significant performance improvements on various benchmarks. Intel's release cadence is vicious, here's what VR World recently reported: Instead, the vendor will focus its efforts on the Skylake architecture, the tock in Intel's tick-tock release cadence cycle. Skylake will also be fabricated on a 14nm process, but will usher in significant CPU and GPU improvements along with lesser power consumption. To expedite the launch of Skylake, Intel is rumored to move up its annual Intel Developers Forum to mid-August, where it is officially set to unveil the new CPUs. Skylake for the desktop will be offered as fully unlocked versions with TDPs of 65W and 95W, with a 35W SKU also planned for low-power devices. The chip vendor is set to begin producing the hardware in June or July, with retail availability set to commence from October. Honestly, AMD is in a lot of trouble. On a performance per dollar basis, AMD will fall further behind. In a market that's highly sensitive to the performance per dollar aspect of a PC build, AMD will lose its footing in the tower PC business, which translate into further market share deterioration, which may negate whatever back half uptick in volume that management anticipates as various OEMs will be making orders in Q3 FY 2015 for Skylake CPUs. It's highly likely that the vast majority of the PC market volume will go to Intel as the company is improving all aspects of its PC-class CPU line-up from design, process node, to 3-dimensional scaling of transistors. My somber outlook is mostly driven by AMD's heralded history of over-promising on its designs and under delivering on performance. It's always good to compare the relative performance of AMD to Intel because at the very end of the day, PC OEMs are going to go with the better performing chip on a per dollar basis. In that case, Intel's performance will continue to scale exponentially because it has made various foundational investments in both foundry and chip design over time. This is why AMD is unable to bridge the gap with a reduction in pricing, because the differential in performance is too vast between generations. Also, consumers want the best PC experience they can get. And quite frankly, OEMs aren't going to risk the loss of customers to competing brands by jumping on the AMD bandwagon to save what could amount to a couple dollars. It's better to go with a proven strategy than to rock the ship, especially when a slight change in design could amount to a reduction in shipment volume. When you operate at the scale of HP and Dell, the loss of customers even if it amounts to only a couple hundred basis points is a huge deal.
