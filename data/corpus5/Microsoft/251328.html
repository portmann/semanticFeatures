Amazon Continues Its Winning Streak, And Shows No Sign Of Stopping - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha This has been a pretty solid year for Amazon investors: better profitability, FCF improvement, more cash sitting in the bank. The improvement in cash management, ramping profitability in AWS, and resurgence in media resulted in a rally in the stock price. The most surprising aspect was the media component as it has been stubbornly stagnant over the years. However, various efforts by Amazon to improve its positioning has resulted in growth. Furthermore, e-commerce data also supports a high possibility of Amazon reporting at the high-end of sales this year, perhaps beating on earnings too. While valuation has been a contentious issue, I believe that on a P/FCF basis it trades at a reasonable value when compared to other high-quality growth businesses in its space. For the most part, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) addressed a lot of issues in the past year. The cash issue has been resolved, and free cash flow metrics have improved. While there's a degree of subjectivity to Amazon's own reported FCF, I'm going to save that for another time. After reconciling the data, I have found that the cash balance increased, so the improvement in cash flow isn't imaginary accounting manipulation, but actual efforts to improve upon balance sheet fundamentals. In terms of growth, we're starting to hear from industry analysts such as comScore that the retail season was strong. Obviously, a lot of discount purchasing has occurred, and various viral video uploads on YouTube confirmed how difficult it was to shop for bargains at brick-and-mortar. I, on the other hand, would prefer avoiding black Friday closeouts due to the convenience of shopping online, and the patience needed to wait in front of a PC is a lot less strenuous than camping out in front of Target (NYSE: TGT ) or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) for that matter. While I can acknowledge that Target and Wal-Mart put on some phenomenal door buster sales in the consumer electronics category, I am woefully hesitant to rely on black Friday sales for both margin and sales uplift for well-established retailers. Not only do retailers report very narrow margins, it's difficult to beat prior year comps on well-established retail brands. Strong E-Commerce Growth Trends Heading Into Holiday 2015. U.S. ecommerce sales posted 15% Y-o-Y growth in 3Q15, flat from 2Q15 on a 1-point harder comp. Desktop e-commerce slowed to 8% for the quarter, but mobile commerce accelerated to make up the difference. Looking ahead, comScore, expects Y-o-Y growth of 13-15% for the Nov-Dec holiday period, aided by low gas prices and an extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. The Mizuho figures are based on comScore data. Furthermore, Adobe recently released data indicating that Black Friday and Thanksgiving sales, when combined, grew by 18.5% from prior year. Amazon offered guidance of roughly 14% to 25% y-o-y growth in their Q3'15 earnings release, so they're on solid track to deliver top line figures. Thankfully, no data point sticks out that indicates cyclical weakness or faltering consumption patterns among U.S. consumers. While weather played an important role in assessing the lead-up to black Friday, it doesn't seem to affect e-commerce companies as much. Nonetheless, it's fair to mention that worsening weather conditions can impact the pricing of shipments due to delays, but much of that abnormality tends to be balanced out with Amazon's ability to secure large-scale shipping contracts from the various carriers. It's also worth mentioning that Amazon's actual revenue is usually several points higher than the comScore figures for retail. This is mostly driven by Amazon's ability to gain market share due to its ecosystem tie-in of Prime, which lowers shipping rates for average consumers. The company also competes aggressively on price during the holiday quarter, which is enabled by their large-scale warehouse infrastructure and pricing discounts due to their well-established wholesale network. In a sense, I view this competitive advantage as a key reason for holding onto this e-commerce retailer when compared to alternatives like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ). Nonetheless, some view these companies under the spotlight of deep value, but given the way tech companies have been discounted aggressively for poor market positioning or weak growth prospects, I would be hesitant to buy deeply discounted e-commerce companies. There are significant advantages to scale. Amazon was also able to accelerate both domestic retail and media in the past couple of quarters. In the case of media, I think this was due to the increasing penetration of Amazon Fire/Kindle e-Readers and tablets paired with its relative strength in the book publishing industry. Much of the industry has moved over to Amazon's publisher ecosystem due to ease of deployment and high royalty rates. In the past, digital media consumption was dominated by Amazon, but over time the game industry opted to sell games via their own channels via Steam, Origin, PSN, Xbox Live, and movie publishers got steamrolled by VOD and to a smaller extent piracy. However, these headwinds have been mitigated by Amazon's strengthening presence through its Kindle Platform, integration into TV-sets and boxes, along with its Prime Streaming service. The degree to which these factors impact media is hard to read into, but basically, Amazon's efforts to bolster its media segment by competing in key categories while experiencing some encroachment from competition seems to have stabilized. Hence the healthier pattern of growth. The stock continues to rally and much of this was driven by profitability, which I had alluded to in the earlier parts of this article. I think there's more room to expand the margin thus normalizing valuation making it easier for analysts to make valuation comps. I go over this in more detail later on in this article. Also, it's worth noting that Amazon's AWS segment increased operating profitability (432% y/y) and has been able to ramp revenue (78% y/y) at a pretty steady pace. This segment is important due to its growth potential, but margin potential as well. The retail segment has a pretty low ceiling to profitability. However, leasing out data center architecture becomes more profitable due to vendor lock-in and platform specific advantages. The various companies competing in the cloud segment have moved towards profitability, so while competition does become an interesting dynamic to watch, it seems microeconomic themes will continue to play out in the segment. Given the limited number of competitors, I feel like the industry will stabilize to a much higher profit rate of which, Amazon will likely generate the bulk of the profits in the IaaS category. When dealing with valuation comparison, Amazon is actually a lot easier to work with this year. The company's reported FCF has improved pretty significantly, so it becomes easier to compare with some of its industry peers. When compared to old tech rivals like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) who also happens to be a direct competitor, Amazon still seems quite expensive. However, Amazon does seem to overcompensate for this due to their improving margins in cloud and e-commerce. They've also expanded their online catalog in various international markets to increase international e-tail sales growth. I believe the opportunity in mobile commerce is also under stated, which implies that Amazon could increase sales assuming they're able to convert more of their mobile shoppers over time. While valuation remains a contentious issue among Amazon's investors. I think it's worth mentioning that the company isn't expensive when compared to other quality growth stocks like Facebook and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Also, Amazon has been able to execute on generating cash to reduce on solvency risk and has also improved its positioning in media.
