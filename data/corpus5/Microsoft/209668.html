Can The Battle Between Shorts And Longs On Sphere 3D Be Settled Once And For All? - Sphere 3D Corp. (NASDAQ:ANY) | Seeking Alpha Sphere 3D is a battleground stock between investors with firm convictions on both the long and the short side. Many of the developments are interpreted rather differently by both sides. Sphere 3D (NASDAQ: ANY ) is an amalgamation of different companies: The original Sphere 3D, providing a virtualization platform called Glassware, and V3, a desktop virtualization provider, Overland (and its take-over Tandberg) traditional storage solution companies. Sphere 3D is a hotly contested stock by both bulls and bears, and each side has considerable ammunition in the battle for supremacy. The shorts think putting four losing companies together cannot amount to much and the longs see Glassware, the virtualization solution from Sphere, as the next big thing in virtualization. It's not unusual that some of the developments are interpreted quite differently by longs and shorts, for instance: Where shorts see continuing losses, cash bleed and significant dilution, the longs see the building of a base, cost savings and the making of a turnaround. Where the shorts see isolated deals in the education and healthcare sector, the longs see a host of partner and distribution deals laying the framework for a dramatic ramp-up in sales and possible ubiquitous presence for Glassware. Where the longs see a strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), the longs see this deal as Sphere being a customer of Microsoft's Azure, having to bring its own customers to the platform. Where the longs see market manipulation, "wash trades" and naked shorts, the longs see just market activity reflecting investor skepticism. Is there any way we can settle this debate? At the end of last year and beginning of this year, there was a flurry of deals and it seemed like the long case for Sphere was winning investors over. However, since then, the flurry has almost dried up and promises about a turnaround at Overland, the storage company that Sphere 3D took over at the end of last year, haven't materialized. Quite the contrary, sales have kept on declining and losses haven't diminished, raising the specter of significant new financing. There have been several private placements and there is a recent shelf registration already. This has been reflected in the share price. As you can see clearly in the weekly chart, it's dominated by lower highs and lower lows. This isn't the only negative. So far, there is no sign of Glassware. Central to Sphere's value proposition is registering sales of any significance (at least not in the financial statements up until the second quarter). Equally worrying is the lack of ICT press coverage of what Sphere claims is a rival containerization solution to the much more well-known Docker. We have consistently called the Glassware technology promising. We are fairly sure that Glassware, at the minimum, is very useful technology, and we wouldn't discard the possibility that it can be something very significant. This is panned out by a few public reviews by customers or tech experts, such as from Novarad, Caney public schools and Simon Bramfitt, an ICT expert who is now CTO at Sphere. We're also fairly sure that some of the longs have a better grip on what the technology can do simply because they have better access to the company. So our base case on Glassware is that at the minimum it's competent tech, and it could have the potential to be something considerably bigger, which is what the longs bank on and is absolutely crucial for their case. Can this be settled? On the one hand, Glassware has seen some take up, but the main deal with medical imaging company Novorad is already more than a year old and generated some positive noise from Novorad customers . There's also a recent deal with another (although related) medical image company ( iPro ), and there is a deal with New Caney , a school district. But none of these deals have yet resulted in significant financial results. Since these are mostly master agreements, none were expected, for now. The hopes of longs have been pinned to a significant extent on a deal with Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. The shorts see nothing special in this, virtually any party can use that platform to partner as Microsoft will be happy to host all kinds of applications that can boost its sales on Azure. The longs argue that there is something more substantial going on here. Cormark research noted the following after a presentation from Larry Orecklin, VP at Microsoft: Specifically, Mr. Orecklin highlighted the use of Sphere's technology in extending the capabilities of the Azure platform that Microsoft otherwise could not do on its own, particularly on enabling the hybrid cloud model, whether it be on-premise, in the cloud, or some combination of both with scalability being one of the key benefits. Recently, Glassware is available on the Azure platform, and the announcement on the Microsoft event calendar (for a presentation on October 15) argued the following: • 50-80% lower TCO : Mobilize your workforce on any device with a cloud-based application delivery infrastructure with drastically lower TCO compared to existing solutions on MS Azure. • Virtualize apps in minutes: Virtualize production applications including legacy business applications in minutes. • More application sessions per Azure VM: Drastic ROI benefit from high application session density per Microsoft Azure VM compared to standard Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) solutions. • 16x faster data mobility: Increase collaboration and security for BYOD initiatives with secure global data access sync and share capabilities up to 16x faster than Dropbox. • Your virtual datacenter in the cloud: Drastically lower operational costs with "single pane of glass" central management of the hybrid cloud infrastructure ranging from remote offices and central data centers to public cloud instances. Now, while this was on the Microsoft website, it's not clear (at least not to us) whether this comes from Microsoft or from Sphere 3D itself. But it should be clear that if these claims were vetted by Microsoft and/or can be verified independently, the whole short-long debate will be settled in a rather emphatic fashion. There's little doubt that there is a significant market opportunity for legacy applications and organizations that want to move to the cloud (whether private, public or hybrid). Containers (see here for a useful technical introduction) threaten to upstage older virtualization solutions like hypervisors. Dockers provides the most well-known container solution. However, it's a Linux solution : A constraint of containers is that you cannot mix and match operating systems. In the world of virtual machines, it's quite usual to have a Windows host support a virtual machine running Linux or an OSX system running a Windows VM. Not so with containers because, by definition, a container uses the host kernel. Thus, you need to match up operating systems. Linux containers run on Linux hosts. You can run Windows containers on Windows Server as of Windows Server 2016. This could provide a significant advantage for Glassware : Though the industry has been abuzz with the premise that Linux containers are the new and efficient way to deliver application virtualization, it's often missed that these Linux containers do not apply to the majority of Windows based applications that are in production in corporate IT infrastructures around the world. However, Docker seems to have a way around this : Because the Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, you can't run Docker natively in Windows. Instead, you must use docker-machine to create and attach to a Docker VM on your machine. This VM hosts Docker for you on your Windows system. The Docker VM is a lightweight Linux virtual machine made specifically to run the Docker daemon on Windows. The VirtualBox VM runs completely from RAM, is a small ~24MB download, and boots in approximately 5s. The upshot is simply this. Containers are here to stay and they face a large market opportunity. Whether Sphere's Glassware is able to tap into this opportunity in a significant way depends largely on whether the claims, as presented above, about its simplicity and economics pan out. Many longs seem to think that this debate is already settled in their favor, largely, it seems to us, on the basis of private demonstrations. We surely hope they are right. But for us, it still needs some of the above public demonstrations. An independent benchmarking effort could be especially useful here.
