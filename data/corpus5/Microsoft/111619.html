Why Microsoft And Google Couldn't Emulate The Apple Mobile Device Model - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's write off of the Nokia Devices acquisition underscores Apple's unique advantage in mobile devices. Apple's organic capability in hardware/software integration has not been duplicated by either Microsoft or Google through their acquisitions. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) announcement that it is writing off the Nokia devices acquisition represents commendable candor on the part of CEO Nadella. It also represents only the second time that a major competitor to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has thrown in the towel on emulating the Apple business model, the first time being Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) sale of Motorola. Vertical integration of hardware, software and services in mobile devices has fueled unparalleled profitability for Apple. Why has the formula not worked for Apple's competitors? The simple answer is that being an integrated mobile device maker isn't as easy as Apple makes it look, but the simple answer, while it may appeal to Apple fans, kind of ducks the question. Google and Microsoft don't lack for brains, ingenuity or competitive drive. It would be hubris of the sort Apple is sometimes accused to assume that Apple's competitors were simply incapable of reproducing Apple's success. I think it's more likely they simply made bad decisions. What was bad about the choices was not immediately obvious either to the companies involved or to the tech media. Even now there isn't much in the way of intelligent post mortem for the Nokia and Motorola acquisitions. Fans of the respective companies mostly want to put it behind them. This is understandable but leaves the fundamental question unanswered. Investors in technology really owe it to themselves to try to answer the question of why these acquisitions failed since this speaks to the competitive landscape for mobile devices going forward. I don't claim to know the answer with certainty, but I'm curious about it. The Motorola and Nokia deals have a lot in common, and these are mostly negatives. Both were fairly large acquisitions: $12.5 billion for Motorola, $7.17 billion for Nokia. Both companies were losing money at the time of the acquisitions, so the acquiring companies were burdened with not only integrating the business units but also turning around their financial performance. Both companies maintained their own far flung manufacturing facilities, having already offshored much of their manufacturing to places such as China and India. For some reason, the offshoring didn't help profitability. The internationalization of manufacturing in these companies may have been a double-edged sword: it reduced labor costs, but made the management of the company's internal supply chains more difficult. Unlike Apple, which relies mostly on contract manufacturing, maintaining proprietary manufacturing facilities deprived these companies of a certain amount of flexibility and agility. Both Nokia and Motorola seemed burdened with over capacity they were reluctant to pare down. The acquiring companies were subsequently burdened with the task of shuttering this excess capacity. But I don't think the manufacturing approach of the companies really gets to the heart of the problem of their profitability once acquired. The problem for both Microsoft and Google was that Motorola and Nokia smartphones had to be steeply discounted in order to sell. Although initially billed as producing "flagship" premium smartphones, the output of Motorola and Nokia invariably went into lower price tiers. Both Microsoft and Google accepted the resulting losses in order to move phones, apparently assuming that eventually they would gain enough market share to become profitable. The market share gains never occurred, and neither did profitability. This speaks to the basic competitiveness of the devices themselves. Apple had worked to improve the appearance, manufacturing quality and ease of use since the inception of iPhone in 2007. Arguably, iPhone was pretty much alone in terms of design and execution by the 2012-2013 time frame of the acquisitions. Why that is has primarily to do with the difference in business model between Apple and its competitors. Prior to acquisition, both Motorola and Nokia functioned on a commodity business model that was similar to the PC model that had worked so well for the Windows ecosystem. In this model, the device operating systems came from another business under some form of license. The creators of the operating systems, Microsoft and Google, weren't responsible for integrating the OS with hardware, and basically couldn't do much more than create a "one size fits all" OS. On the hardware side, the commodity business model seemed to mandate making the devices as cheap as possible. Build quality, design and reliability all suffered as a result. The commodity model invariably led to a "race to the bottom" that both Nokia and Motorola were losing. The commodity PC model, as applied to smartphones, was successful in capturing market share, but not profit, as the profitability of Apple demonstrated from 2012 to the present. One way to look at the Motorola and Nokia acquisitions was that they were fundamentally acknowledgments of the failure of the commodity model. They were attempts to break down the barriers between OS provider and hardware manufacturer and bring about the greater level of hardware/software integration that Apple exemplified. Doing so would presumably make Motorola and Nokia devices more competitive. Microsoft and Google approached their respective acquisitions in two different but fairly normal ways. Google took a deliberately hands off approach, maintaining the separate identity of Motorola, as well as a separate organizational structure. Microsoft attempted a fuller integration into the parent company. Neither approach worked. My conclusion as to why this is based on the observation that Apple had grown its hardware/software integration expertise organically over decades, from the early days of the Apple II and the Mac. Apple had always viewed this as a positive discriminator, and Apple's flat organizational structure was geared to reducing barriers between hardware and operating system development. The attempt to develop this capability by acquisition was probably doomed to failure by human nature. The personnel of the acquired companies naturally retained a sense of separate identity as well as a tendency to pursue business as usual. The organizational separation maintained by Google and the built-in geographic separation of Nokia made vertical integration even more difficult. Neither Microsoft nor Google really tried to achieve true integration. Both Nokia and Motorola maintained separate management structures. There seems not to have been a sense of urgency about this in either company. It's as if they thought that mere ownership would be enough. The write off of Nokia and the spin-off of Motorola leave significant unanswered questions about the mobile device strategies of Microsoft and Google going forward. The key takeaway for Apple investors is that Apple is endowed with a powerful advantage in smartphones that no other company has been able to duplicate. Apple's chief competitors in mobile device operating systems are Microsoft and Google. If they've given up on emulating Apple, who is left? The obvious answer is Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and based on my last article , I view Samsung as a diminishing threat. I don't see any other company overcoming Apple's advantage in the next five years. Apple's advantage is the key reason it's doing so well in smartphones. Smartphones are where Apple's hardware/software integration expertise has the most leverage. Apple critics, with some justification, characterize Apple as "one product company." Having such a secure bastion is something that Apple's competitors would envy. Apple does need to demonstrate that it can continue to build on that secure bastion. The Apple Watch is a case in point. Some have raised doubts about the success of the Watch. I believe the Watch is just getting started. We'll have a better idea of the success of the Watch when Apple reports earnings later this month.
