Oppenheimer, Cramer trumpet Microsoft's cloud opportunity - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Mar 17 2016, 14:13 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "Ultimately, we believe MSFT will be successful in driving the only true unified hybrid cloud platform," writes Oppenheimer's Tim Horan, assuming coverage on Microsoft ( MSFT +0.7%) an Outperform rating and $62 target. Horan: "Instead of fighting the inevitable shift to the cloud, MSFT is fully embracing it, enabling enterprise adoption of a fully integrated hybrid stack (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) and using the power of the cloud to introduce an overall better operating system (for both developers/ customers) which works across all Windows devices ... While execution is the biggest risk, a seamless, integrated cloud offering, combined with a unified development platform across devices is the right strategy for the future." Jim Cramer said he concurred with Oppenheimer, and that he considered it misguided to view Microsoft as a PC play. He added a declining dollar - the dollar is now at $1.13 against the euro - will give a lift to tech giants in general. Microsoft is coming off a calendar Q4 in which Azure revenue, fueled by the cross-selling of Azure services to Microsoft's large on-premise enterprise base, rose 140% Y/Y in constant currency. That helped offset a 5% revenue drop for the company's More Personal Computing unit (covers Windows and hardware).
