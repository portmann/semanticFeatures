Alphabet: Is Its Near Record Enterprise Value A Problem? - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,635 clicks) Alphabet is quickly catching up with Apple for the largest market cap and, more importantly, enterprise value in the stock market. The key trend that hurt Apple at its peak value in 2012 isn't forecast to impact Alphabet anytime soon. The biggest issues for Alphabet reaching record enterprise value and market cap are spending habits and a stretched multiple, not sheer size alone. The market has long debated the market size issue with regards to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) large market cap. The stock hit a huge market cap of $650 billion in 2012 and has had a difficult time appreciating from that level ever since. One part of the story is the ongoing questions about market and growth potential at that point in time. The other part of the story is the inability to generate stock gains at the largest valuation in the stock market. Apple requires a massive $6.5 billion investment to acquire a small 1% position. So while Apple has repeatedly maxed out in the $650 billion range, Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is quickly approaching that size under the radar. The Internet search giant is quickly seeing its enterprise value surge towards the value of Apple. The key being that the latter has had a sizable cash position for a long time now. The interesting part of the recent surge in Alphabet is that not a lot of discussion exists around the market cap reaching $530 billion. The market cap is actually close to where Apple started facing the size debates back in early 2012. The hidden difference is that Apple built a sizable war chest with over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet and started returning the cash to shareholders. Alphabet has a nice cash position now, but the difference creates a situation where the enterprise value is quickly merging. At the end of the September quarter, Apple had $131.7 billion of net cash and Alphabet had $70.8 billion of net cash. The initial surprise is that the cash balances are getting closer due to Apple returning $17 billion of capital in the last quarter alone. For now, though, removing the cash from the market cap provides the value for the business. The enterprise value for Apple is $527.0 billion and Alphabet is $462.3 billion. Suddenly, the enterprise valuation difference between the two technology titans is only $64.7 billion. A roughly 10% change in value by one of the stocks in favor of Alphabet would place the enterprise values near even. Alphabet gaining 5% and Apple losing 5% is very reasonable and would do the trick. RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney even forecast the possibility of Alphabet reaching $1,000. The ironic part of his research was the lack of mention regarding the enterprise value surging past Apple to over $600 billion. In that scenario, with Apple trading flat to down, Alphabet would even take over the largest market cap. I'm sure most market participants will debate whether market size matters. Ultimately, the bigger a market valuation, the more investment it requires to produce a gain. Looking back at the debate on Apple in 2012, I found this piece from Bill Maurer regarding Apple. Bill made an interesting point about the weight of Apple in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ). The Apple weight in the ETF is now 18.3%, meaning that, if anything, the ideal scenario is a reduced weight for Apple, causing automatic selling of the stock. The interesting point is that the combined Alphabet investment sits at 12.2%. The combined GOOG and GOOGL shares slightly surpass the value of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). I don't think any laws of numbers require that Alphabet hits a wall soon due to market cap similar to what happened to Apple. After all, my previous research highlighted that the change in the earnings trend was the culprit for Apple hitting a wall in 2012. Nothing in reality prevents either stock from reaching a valuation of $1 trillion. In the case of Alphabet, the theory that the new CFO would bring adult supervision to the story helped usher the stock to the current level. Within months, the stock surged from $550 to over $775 now. The reality, though, is the change of the corporate name to Alphabet and the recent re-acceleration of hiring questions whether grownups are actually in charge now. As this chart highlights, Alphabet isn't facing the negative EPS trend that hit Apple. Analysts expect rather solid growth for the next fiscal year. Using non-GAAP numbers, analysts forecast Alphabet generating a 2016 EPS of $34.24 for 18% growth. If anything, the Internet search business avoids a lot of the pitfalls that hitting a large market size hurt Apple due to selling electronic components. Search doesn't have the cycles like smartphones and computers. Ultimately, though, the market cap size is indicative of huge profits that only get more difficult to grow. If Alphabet was to grow the stock 10% to grab the enterprise value similar to Apple, the stock would reach $850. At that price, the stock would trade with a P/E multiple of 24.8x the current EPS expectations. With roughly $100 in cash per share, the stock would trade at a multiple of 21.9x the enterprise value. Not exactly expensive for the growth rate, but the multiple is more than double the rate achieved by Apple. At this rate, Alphabet undoubtedly overtakes Apple with the largest enterprise value in the next year. With estimates that the digital ad world still has plenty of growth backed by the forecasts of RBC, Alphabet isn't likely to run into the dip in earnings that hit Apple on its historic run. Ultimately, Alphabet is going to start hitting a ceiling inherent with the laws of large numbers. The issue, though, will come more from revenue growth than market size.
