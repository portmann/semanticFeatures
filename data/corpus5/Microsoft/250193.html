An Accurate Breakdown Of Apple iPhone Costs - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mark Hibben incorrectly believes that cost breakdowns are only inclusive of hardware costs. That's not the case whatsoever and while bill of materials is not enough to deduce the cost of an iPhone in isolation, it gives us a great starting point. We can find the remaining costs of an iPhone using accounting and mathematics (more specifically Algebra). After doing my own due diligence, I believe the iPhone segment generates a 47.6% gross margin. Furthermore, I believe the valuation seems stretched as we're going through the trough parts of a device cycle, and currency impact limits sales upside. Therefore, I'm initiating a sell recommendation. From my perspective, I find it interesting that Mark Hibben would continue to assert his stance on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sales while there's enough evidence to the contrary that Apple won't generate the same kind of unit demand/growth we've seen in recent years. While I can acknowledge that these figures from the bill of materials aren't all-encompassing on their own, they give us a starting point from which we can deduce the remaining costs of an iPhone. Needless to say, I feel like the risk-to-reward is not compelling at these levels. The stock is in the beginning stages of forming another downtrend. As such, it may be time to reassess the risk-to-reward as there are many other opportunities that carry more upside with much less downside. I'm going to clarify my cautious stance in this article, and I'm going to break out the remaining iPhone costs, so it's logically consistent. In a sense, the two companies (Apple and Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF )) are linked, because if Foxconn's cost per unit goes up, so does their bill of materials. This also favorably impacts revenue. As such, I believe that Foxconn's sales growth was mostly generated by a pricing improvement in the case of Apple handsets. In the case of Android handsets, the pricing dropped, but volume continued to grow as indicated by third-party smartphone forecasts. On balance, Foxconn grew sales due to component costs increasing and not as a result of handset volumes. If there was volume growth it was mostly driven by low-end Android handsets. Mark Hibben questions the integrity of channel-based analysts. By the way, I've talked to real expert consultants within the semiconductor space, and the way they deduce cost is by taking real order invoices and matching them up with handsets. In other words, these data points can be interpreted as being derived from real world invoices, therefore I wouldn't be so sure that these figures are made up. Furthermore, I've had numerous conversations with the individual, and it's possible to gain access to this type of data, but you have to pay thousands per year to maintain subscription fees. Either IHS is just a facilitator of the research or they check directly into the order figures to understand the costs, but in a sense, there's no questioning these figures are relatively accurate once you start breaking down the remaining cost drivers. I'm going to directly refute Mark's comments from his prior article: The cost estimate that Cho cites is just one of many that are produced from outfits such as IHS and Techinsights. These sites typically come up with iPhone manufacturing costs that are in the $200-250 range. Despite Cook's admonishment, the cost estimates continue to be produced and continue to fall in roughly the same range. What are the problems with the estimates? The most obvious problem is that the gross margin for the iPhone would exceed 60%. If that were the case, and given that more than 60% of Apple's revenue typically comes from the iPhone, Apple's corporate gross margin would probably be much higher. - Mark Hibben He's mentioning the logical consistency in which these estimates are figured into Apple's actual consolidated COGS, which they report on a quarterly basis. From my perspective what he's presenting isn't an argument, but an appeal to authority with his reference to Tim Cook, as he hasn't pieced together the remaining components of COGS. An article going back a couple years from Digital Trends tries to break down the costs to the operating profit level. I'm going to get rid of the overlapping OpEx factors and work my way up to the actual gross margins. Apple doesn't recognize its revenue at the retail price point, but rather the wholesale price point. Digital Trends estimate this cost to be $68.90, but it's actually a little less than that when based on a percentile basis and handset distribution model from UBS. I figure the wholesale to retail markup averages around 7.51% on a consolidated basis. So, Apple's actual net revenue on a $650 handset is closer to $601.18. The bill of materials on the base handset was $234 for iPhone 6s. So, if we deduct $234 from the $601.18 we arrive at a 61.2% gross margin figure. And yes, that's way too high indeed. So, I turn over to an accounting reference from Stanford when pertaining to the treatment of cost capitalization when pertaining to software development, which is the accounting that's used by both Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple to articulate the cost of revenue for software alone. Yes, I've verified that these methods are put to use by both companies by reviewing the accounting notes from Microsoft's and Apple's 2015 annual reports. The problem with bill of materials data is that they pertain only to the cost of manufacturing a handset and the component costs. They don't offer any additional insight beyond that, but if Apple had not kept its cost of manufacturing down it's probable that the gross margin figure would have worsened over the years. In fact, I believe Apple wasn't able to increase gross margin outlook precisely because material cost inputs increased. There are three main stages of computer software development. These stages are defined as (1) the preliminary project stage, (2) the application development stage, and (3) the post-implementation / operation stage. Only costs included in the application development stage are eligible for capitalization. Capitalization of costs begins once management authorizes and commits funding and the preliminary project stage is completed. Capitalization should cease when all testing is substantially completed and software is ready for intended use or it becomes unlikely that the project will be completed. Once management authorizes and commits funding and the preliminary project stage is completed: Design of selected software, including software configuration and software interface, Coding, Installation of software, Quality assurance testing. iOS is a fairly expensive platform to maintain, which drives up the iPhone cost. The cost of software development gets capitalized on a straight-line basis for each iPhone unit sold, which impacts cost of revenue. However, Apple estimates these costs pertaining to the development of software on a per unit basis, which is why the ongoing development of new versions is also figured into the cost per handset. The cost of providing software updates is estimated, but reflected in each handset on a quarter-by-quarter basis. There are other costs such as warranty, projected product returns, and servicing devices (like when you call Apple's helpline) that go into the cost of revenue figure for Apple. This is why Tim Cook says that the bill of materials alone is not sufficient for understanding Apple's gross margin figure. And to that effect, he's telling the honest truth. According to Apple's Form 10-K 2015: For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch ("iOS devices"), Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device's essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product's essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method (page 45). Apple then goes on to state when pertaining to software development costs: Research and development ("R&D") costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers (page 46). They repeated the general treatment of software capitalization that was mentioned by Stanford earlier in the article. This means that Apple's actual R&D when pertaining to software is substantially higher than what the R&D indicates. This is because the cost pertaining to the development stage is what's being capitalized into the cost of goods sold figure. As such, Apple's development of software is what's resulting in a much lower gross margin figure than what was indicated by just the bill of materials or retail markup in isolation. After doing a lot of Algebra, and digging into various research papers pertaining to PC failures rates, and handset manufacturing cost my gross margin is 47.62%. The remaining segments drag that margin figure down. I feel confident that supply chain details when pertaining to Foxconn are a negative indicator and not refutable based on claims of credibility. With component costs increasing from the prior year model, Apple will struggle to mitigate some margin contraction. Furthermore, I can't imagine how Foxconn's figures are confirming of strength in handsets. The October numbers are pretty revealing because that's when production ramped and sell-in was at its highest for CY 2015. I believe that if Foxconn's next month sales were to weaken even further we can understand the degree of softness in iPhone sales for Q1'FY16. I'm fairly certain that after reading this article, investors can agree that these manufacturing costs can be rationalized into Apple's consolidated income statement. I have also checked in with other sell-side sources, and they also believe that gross margins for just the iPhone alone are in the upper-40 percentile range. Furthermore, I believe that Apple's valuation trades roughly in line with peers like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ). I think that the market is valuing Apple roughly the way it values other companies who are dependent on a recurring hardware cycle. Most of Apple's revenue is derived from selling hardware, not software. While Apple does have a software business, it doesn't compose a meaningful percentage of sales (roughly 10% of sales). As such, Apple's business model is more hardware dependent and operates on a cyclical dynamic. This dynamic is driven by device refresh, which will require a strong product launch in the iPhone 7 generation to lift sales in FY'17. While there's repeatability of business you could also argue the same for Intel and Hewlett-Packard. However, for more mature device categories there's the possibility that device refresh can become more elongated. Therefore, Apple needs to deliver a stellar product in their upcoming device otherwise it will be a so-so year for Apple consumers and investors. Given the weakening dynamic of sales, and F/X headwinds I anticipate sales will decline by 5% this year. I don't anticipate a smaller variation of the handset to offset weakness in consumer spending. And while the device will appeal to some handset owners, I see no reason to anticipate that it will offset currency headwinds. In other words, if you've witnessed how investors have reacted to quarterly disappointments, now is probably the opportunity to get out and reassess other alternatives. There's no denying currency is a subjective argument, but in the past, Apple has used currency impact to report stronger sales. Therefore, Apple can't use constant currency adjustments to inflate sales growth in the upcoming year. This seems fair, and while the company's fundamentals aren't completely broken, the valuation could trend even lower as indicated by the price chart. I'm initiating a sell recommendation and lowering my price target from $116.34 to $103.50 (11.61 times earnings). I imagine further downside from here, and while I'm open to the idea of changing my stance, I'd need to see the stock price come down further and a build up of anticipation for iPhone 7 to justify both a higher valuation and stronger earnings/sales.
