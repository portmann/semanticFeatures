Microsoft details HoloLens; first-hand impressions arrive - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha May  2 2015, 14:58 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) HoloLens augmented reality headset relies on an advanced optical projection system to "generate multi-dimensional full-color images with very low-latency so you can see holographic objects in the physical world," the software giant states in a blog post released amid its BUILD conference. HoloLens also supports spatial (location-specific) sound recognition. Other features related to capturing real-world data include a depth sensor used to "spatially map your environment and interpret your hand gestures," head-tracking cameras, and an "internal measurement unit" (IMU) sporting an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Processing power is provided not only by a CPU and GPU, but also by a Microsoft-designed holographic processing unit (HPU). There's still no word on HoloLens' exact launch date or pricing; a Microsoft exec told the NYT the device will cost "significantly more" than a console. A slew of first-hand impressions have arrived from writers trying out HoloLens prototypes at BUILD. The consensus: HoloLens has tremendous potential, but its limited field of view for holograms is a major handicap for now. "Within carefully managed conditions, HoloLens is one of the most amazing pieces of tech I've seen," writes The Verge's Adi Robertson . "But HoloLens only feels natural when you're not handling anything much bigger than a basketball. It produces a magic square the size of a large TV screen, and the moment something slips outside, it disappears." Paul Thurrott , who tried out a bulkier demo unit in January, is a big fan of HoloLens' spatial sound support. But he adds the newer hardware prevents users from seeing holographic objects that aren't "right in the middle of your field of vision." Microsoft is relying on a feature called Gaze Control to keep a user's field of vision focused on holograms. Gesture and voice controls allow users to manipulate objects. Business Insider's Julie Bort and Matt Weinberger provided one of the more positive takes. "HoloLens is about getting specific tasks done ... Air-tapping to select and open holograms in the air felt surprisingly natural, as did talking into the microphone. Using it in conjunction with a standard mouse/PC setup felt very natural ... The HoloLens, or something like it, is the future." They also observe Minecraft can function as a "hologram-creation engine" for HoloLens. Separately, Microsoft has confirmed its acquisition of Surface stylus chip developer N-trig. The WSJ reports the purchase price is $30M, much less than the ~$200M reported in February .
