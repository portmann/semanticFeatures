Microsoft's HoloLens To Dominate Enterprise - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Investors need to determine what success is defined by for the HoloLens. At $3,000 a unit, it’s safe to assume that HoloLens won’t be as mainstream as its computing operating system. While many virtual/augmented reality headsets have yet to ship in mass production, the big players in the market are already carving out their own space. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) version, the HoloLens, is an augmented reality system. The first developers' kit is priced at $3,000, compared to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) $600 Oculus Rift. The only other relevant player in the high-end VR/AR space is HTC, which has priced its virtual reality headset at $800. With the drastic difference in price, it's clear that Microsoft isn't looking to get its device into the hands of every person, at least initially. However, there's one space I see the HoloLens owning; training. By distinguishing itself as an augmented reality device, Microsoft has set itself up nicely to dominate this areas. (For those who are unfamiliar, augmented reality lays images over your actual surroundings, whereas virtual reality completely immerses the user.) Microsoft will be successful in the training segment for two specific reasons. The first is, as I mentioned, the fact that it is an AR system. Not only that, but it is the only AR system with the scale and means to actually succeed. Whereas the Rift and the Vive will duke it out over the virtual reality space, Microsoft's path is nearly clear. As an AR system, the practical applications are vast. For example, let's say you are a mechanic trying to fix your first car. You could view the car's actual engine within the headset and observe virtual arrows pointing to different parts while audio instructions play. It's a bit difficult to express in words, so maybe this video will help. Microsoft's integration of Skype will further enhance the experience. The dual-channel feature enables both the user and the trainer to interact more closely. Now here's the value proposition that Microsoft needs to make to corporation in order to successfully market its product. Let's imagine a company that installs machinery and employs thousands of workers. Training these workers is a lengthy process, and requires a lot of trainers. What if, instead of a trainer standing next to you, employees wore a HoloLens? The visual and audio instructions would be able to direct employees on how to install the equipment. In the event that they have a question, they could pull up Skype to communicate with an on-call trainer. Now instead of 100 trainers per 1000 employees, the company could provide HoloLens devices and only require 20 trainers to be on call to help with any issues. The new efficiencies in this system are something to salivate over. The reduced need for trainers would lower labor costs significantly. If we imagine a $45,000 salary per trainer, the company would save $3.6 million every year in labor costs. This would be more than enough to offset the cost of providing a HoloLens to every employee ($3 million) in the first year. This is where Microsoft will have to excel to make its HoloLens successful. Its device is priced at a place that really only makes sense for larger companies to purchase. Hopefully investors understand that this is the goal, and don't punish the stock when the HoloLens doesn't become the mainstream device they thought it would be. I'm happy with Microsoft's attempt at augmented/virtual reality. It may not be the must-have product for normal consumers, but it sees very little competition in the spheres that it wants to dominate. In just four years, the combined virtual/augmented reality market will be worth $30 billion. The countless applications of VR/AR will only present Microsoft more opportunities to make the HoloLens desirable as a product.
