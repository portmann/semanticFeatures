ETF Hub Oct  6 2015, 02:45 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) big event in New York City today (10 a.m. ET) will display a full range of devices that run across the tech giant's new, flagship operating system, Windows 10. What's on tap? Two new versions of Lumia smartphones (featuring Continuum), an updated Surface Pro tablet and the possibility of more details regarding HoloLens - an augmented reality headset. Microsoft brand excitement doesn't stop at today's showcase. The company's first flagship store will open in NYC on October 26. Windows phone penetration is too slow. They have failed to gain the attention, not very optimistic outlook of Windows Phone. The Fitbit is absolutely useless for anyone that does anything other than running (i.e. kickboxing, high intensity interval training, dancing, Fitbit is so inaccurate it's useless). At least with the Band, it'll sync calendar and email and the added GPS and heart rate monitor is a better value.
