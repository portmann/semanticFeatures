Why Windows 10 Will Power Microsoft's Stock Even Higher - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Windows 10 adoption has been strong as 75 million devices are currently running the OS. This is driving positive reports from various supply chain sources, which could be indicative of unanticipated sequential growth in laptop units. However, Microsoft's revenue recognition principles have changed, which will dampen the immediate impact on revenues in FY Q2 2016. I'm very optimistic on Microsoft as it trades at a reasonable valuation and has various growth catalysts. Momentum is starting to return to Windows, as Yusuf Mehdi recently announced in a Twitter post that there are 75 million devices running on Windows 10. Of course, users upgrading their operating system from Windows 8 to Windows 10 drove most of this momentum, as many did not like the Metro interface of Windows 8. Also, many were eagerly anticipating the additional features, which explains the rapid adoption of Windows 10. Furthermore, chip orders for notebooks are starting to pick up according to a report from Digi Times: IC demand for notebooks is picking up, and the outlook for replacement demand triggered by Microsoft's Windows 10 is more positive, according to sources at Taiwan-based PC-related IC suppliers. IC orders for notebooks started to grow in the latter half of third quarter 2015, with order visibility becoming clear to the fourth quarter, said the sources. Judging from orders received thus far in the second half of 2015, the sources estimated that notebook shipments worldwide will likely register single-digit sequential growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Overall this is pretty good news for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) as sequential growth is kind of startling given the broader consensus view that inventories on notebooks from prior quarters was high. At least, according to Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) PC volumes will take a while to pick up as the release window was relatively short when compared to prior OS transitions. However, the report from Digi Times contradicts the negative outlook from IDC, as IDC stated on Wednesday, "In addition to economic issues, free upgrades of Windows 10, a relative dearth of newer models in the short term and channels that are reluctant to take stock also makes the prospect of growth unlikely through 2016." So who's right? Well, the rapid adoption of Windows 10, paired with the fact that Digi Times does have reliable supply chain sources, indicates that there could be some modest acceleration in terms of unit growth in the next quarter or two. Also, IDC has been known to make inaccurate projections in the past. The revenue recognition principle is different between Windows 10 and Windows 8. While Windows 8 generated immediate revenue without any deferred revenue balance, Windows 10 will have a deferred revenue balance, which will require a number of quarters to pass in order for revenue to fully match the increase in cash. Of course, financial analysts will be able to discern between next year's and prior year's comps, so the impact on the stock will be relatively minimal so as long as Microsoft is able to demonstrate in their quarterly earnings report acceleration in PC volumes. This seems likely, based on the earlier reported figures by both Microsoft and Digi Times. The stock is starting to recover following the recent market selloff the underlying fundamentals still seem strong but will require investors to see past the discrepancies in various accounting related charges and changes in revenue recognition principles on a go-forward basis. That being the case, the stock trades at 14.15 times forward earnings, which is somewhat cheap and also pays a 2.9% dividend yield. I anticipate that growth will accelerate due to the revenue mix shift to cloud or annually recurring revenue models, growth in gaming and search related revenue, recovery in PC volumes and growth in nascent business categories like Azure. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on Microsoft. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
