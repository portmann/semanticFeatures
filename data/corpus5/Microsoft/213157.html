Microsoft At 15-Year High After Earnings Beat - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft beat estimates and marked fifteen year highs today. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) today reported third quarter earnings after the market closed (read the ER here ), and then Microsoft's shares did what they haven't done for more than 15 years: Break $51. In the third quarter Microsoft grossed revenues of $21.7 billion, which is a 7 percent decline yoy. When we adjust for currency, revenues were down 2 percent yoy. Operating income grew slightly to $7.1 billion, net income came in at $5.4 billion. Microsoft's (adjusted) earnings per share came in at $0.67 (for a $2.68 annual run rate), or $0.08 above estimates - this 14 percent beat is what propelled Microsoft's share price up today. On the first look a revenue decline (even after adjusting for currency) is not a good sign, but there are a couple of things we have to consider here: Microsoft reported a small revenue decline and yet Microsoft's (operating) earnings were up (both adjusted) - this means Microsoft has been able to grow its margins versus the prior year. This is something we haven't seen in a long time: Microsoft's operating margin has been declining for more than two years, which was unfortunate, since this means that the company's earnings were performing a lot worse than Microsoft's revenues (which were aided by the Nokia acquisition). Microsoft's margins were still pretty good, but not at the levels seen a couple of years ago. This quarter Microsoft's operating margin was 32.6 percent (using non-GAAP numbers using GAAP numbers Microsoft's operating margin was 28.4 percent). In any case this is a great result and one of the factors that allowed Microsoft to beat estimates so handily today. What were the reasons for Microsoft's higher margin? First, Microsoft's focus on the cloud allows for high growth in a high margin area: Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment reported revenue growth of eight percent yoy (to $5.9 billion, revenues were up 14 percent adjusting for currency), which makes Intelligent Cloud the best performing reporting segment. Intelligent Cloud also is the segment with the highest operating margin: Operating income of $2.4 billion means that this segment has an operating margin of 41 percent. When the segment with the highest margin is the segment with the highest revenue growth rate, this is beneficial for the company's overall margins, as high value revenues make up a higher portion of Microsoft's revenues now (in comparison to the prior year's quarter). Second, Microsoft's cost saving efforts are paying off. Microsoft cut 7,800 jobs earlier this year, which impacts the company's expense side: In the third quarter Microsoft's operating expenses declined about $600 million yoy - R&D expenses declined $100 million, G&A expenses declined $100 million and sales expenses declined $400 million. I'm not a fan of lowering R&D expenses, but as this hasn't been a huge reduction I wouldn't read too much into it. The SG&A savings of $500 million on the other hand are very attractive as this means a nice boost to the company's operating (and thus also net) profit. We will likely continue to see this positive effect over the next quarters, until it's included in the comps. Apart from the margins, another positive fact I want to look at are Microsoft's stock buybacks: Microsoft has been accelerating the pace of its stock buybacks in the recent quarters, and once again did so in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months Microsoft has spent $13.8 billion on share repurchases, which is a lot more than the company did over the last four years. In this year's third quarter Microsoft spent $4.8 billion on stock buybacks (which brings the annual pace to $19.2 billion), which is another increase. This higher spending is showing results as Microsoft's share count has been dropping a lot faster over the last year as it did in the years before. Since a lower share count means that the company's profits are distributed over a lower number of shares, each share's portion of Microsoft's earnings grows, which makes each share more valuable over time. At the current pace Microsoft is able to buy back about 5 percent of its common stock each year ($19.2 billion versus a market capitalization of about $400 B), which means earnings per share will grow 5 percent annually even if the company's net earnings were to remain flat (which seems unlikely). With Microsoft's low leverage and huge cash pile of $99 billion (which is up $3 billion over the last three months) Microsoft is easily able to finance these stock buybacks, along with its also attractive dividends and its operating needs. Microsoft is up substantially today, but I believe the company's shares have further upside: Using the finbox valuation model I come to a fair value of $56 (upside of about 10 percent), with assumptions I rate conservative: Long-term revenue growth of just 3 percent, small margin increases (due to the reasons explained above, higher revenues from high margin businesses such as the cloud and cost savings) and an exit multiple which is below the peer group average. Using the trailing PE ratio is not recommended here because Microsoft faced a huge one-time charge during the last 12 months but when we look at Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 16, we can confirm that the company has some upside. Paying 16 times forward earnings for a company with a huge moat, attractive dividend and AAA-worthy balance sheet is not an expensive price, I believe. Microsoft's shares marked a 15-year high today after the company reported great third quarter results. The key points, I believe, are the ability to grow the company's margins, strong growth for important segments such as Microsoft's cloud business and Microsoft's attractive shareholder returns via dividends and stock buybacks. I believe Microsoft still trades below fair value. It's thus not too late to buy into this tech heavyweight with a wide moat and a safe business model.
