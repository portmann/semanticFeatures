A Leaner Microsoft Equals A Better Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha With fewer employees, Microsoft can restructure the business to be more focused and disciplined. Microsoft will need to invest in areas outside of its core competencies while trimming the fat off of a non-performing segment in order to win more mobile share. Therefore, scaling back and repositioning the business so it can grow organically sounds practical and will likely add some shareholder value. Also, the goodwill charge was already priced into the stock, and partially counteracted the positive momentum that would have resulted from the layoff announcement. I'm still optimistic though, as I think Microsoft trades at a decent value in the mid-40s. Back-half volume may improve depending on how much inventory was burned in FY Q3. For the most part, I'm a huge fan of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) restructuring announcement, and headcount reduction. FY 2015 was bad anyway, so they might as well pile on a couple other things to make next year comps look that much better. Some of you will probably chuckle about this, because you know what I'm talking about. For one thing, the reduction of 7,800 job positions is pretty huge. I'm not sure if the handset segment will do better after cleaning out that many employees, however, some organizations within a company perform so poorly that you just can't help it, you have to send some of them home. In a capitalist society, your income and expenses have to balance out. You can't reward bad behavior with paychecks and pay raises. As Jack Welch likes to say, you take the bottom 25% and you fire them. You take the top 25% and you reward them excessively. You take the middle 50% and try to develop them into all stars. I think he had different ratios than that, but I think you guys get the point. A large scale house cleaning was in order, and an effort to rebuild the organization from a smaller base is the most practical thing they can do. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) had to substantially restructure its business in the mid 1990s and bring back the original founder to really get the balls rolling again. So, your first step is to cut aggressively and try your best to retain the top performing employees. Second, you gain more nimbleness, which is needed to make quicker decisions, and more efficiently optimize resources for the few activities that are likely to work. Third, you identify the core strengths of the business and build the entire organization around that core competency. In the case of Lumia, I see an organization that has produced way too many handset variations, the marketing is off, and efforts to rebuild the product have to start with a fresh set of eyes. It needs fewer people and not more. It needs a strategy that can be executed for marginal gains and not overly aggressive targets that are hoped for by MBAs in one of the finance departments. Everything needs to be built from the bottom and from scratch. Microsoft has a really great track record of growing nascent businesses into really huge businesses. It's a company that entered into console gaming 10-years later than Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ). In the following 15-years it crushed Nintendo and pushed Sony (NYSE: SNE ) aside for similar market share figures. Microsoft is much more profitable from gaming than Sony, and while it's not always a fan pleaser, it treats its shareholders better. It's also a company that beat back IBM (NYSE: IBM ) in the enterprise while being a smaller company at the time. It built out the Office Suite from scratch and that is now the biggest business unit at Microsoft. In FY 2014, the Office Suite generated $24.22 billion in revenue. Microsoft knows how to win at business and how to work with smaller organizations before they become big. According to Glass Door, the average Microsoft salary is $100K +. So, if we are to assume that's accurate, the company could be saving anywhere from $780 million to $1.17 billion per year from the recent layoff announcement. That's quite a significant figure assuming the company can at least stabilize the handset business, so revenues are at least growing at mid-teen or single-digit rates. Of course, that's going to be really difficult, and we haven't seen that happen yet. Everyone knows Microsoft can create and monetize software like no other company. However, Microsoft will need to hire different people if it wants to build more proprietary hardware inside of its handsets. For example, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) technically designs its own app processor, memory, display, battery, external casing, camera, and various other handset components. Microsoft on the other hand has to outsource all of those capabilities, so it can't really differentiate Lumia handsets, and quite frankly, none of the employees at the Lumia division know how to design top-tier ICs, displays, or various other components from scratch. So, strategically speaking, Microsoft needs to develop alternative ways to build a phone from the ground-up. For the most part, the gains from the layoff were netted out by the $7.6 billion goodwill impairment charge. The write down was already built into the stock price, as evidenced by the lack of reaction to the news. Furthermore, Microsoft has had a rough year due to foreign exchange and falling PC volume. So, it would have been hard for impairment to cause any additional downward momentum on the stock price. I think analysts have modeled in the negative impact from falling earnings and revenue from the handset segment. Therefore, handset weakness is already built into the stock price. Microsoft has had a tough year, but is attractive at these valuations. I think investors should consider buying in the mid-40s, as the company is unlikely to get any cheaper. Nascent opportunities in enterprise, cloud and software paired with potential PC volume recovery in the back-half of the year may carry the stock price higher. Time will tell, but I don't think Microsoft has hit a wall quite yet.
