Intel: The PC-On-A-Stick Revolution Is Here - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha In spite of the proliferation of cheap Android HDMI dongle sticks and smart TV boxes, Intelâ€™s Windows Compute Stick has a very promising future. Amazon and Newegg are now accepting pre-orders for the $149 Intel Compute Stick. A Windows or Linux OS-powered Tiny PC concept is still a better traditional productivity tool than Android-powered products. I am a happy owner of a 32-inch Android Smart TV. However, I still look forward to buying the $149 Windows Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Compute Stick . Newegg is selling a $110 Linux OS Intel Compute Stick. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is also one of the online sellers slated to sell the Compute Stick. I want a PC-on-a-Stick that runs Windows to make up for the limited Android OS experience on my current smart TV. I believe that a tiny, energy efficient, HDMI device that can run Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop CC on a 32-inch full HD 1080p monitor is a very useful productivity tool. As a freelance graphic artist, showcasing portfolios to prospective clients is convenient when one can just stick in a 5.8 x 3.4 x 2.8 inch device like the Intel Compute Stick into a client's HDMI-equipped TV or computer monitor. The most obvious advantage is that I do not have to carry a laptop or tablet when I have the Compute Stick. The Intel Compute Stick is not much bigger than a regular USB thumb drive and could easily fit the small coin-pocket of my jeans. Impressing clients is better done when you can do on-site demonstrations of Photoshop image manipulation of wedding photos or product ad layouts. Since Adobe has still refused to port Photoshop CC to Android or Chrome OS architecture, no Android TV dongle stick could help me do this 'wow-the-prospective-client' trick to get a paycheck. Tiny PCs like the Compute Stick have a place in the corporate environment. The quad-core Intel Atom SoC of the Compute Stick plus the 2GB of RAM makes it strong enough to run most Windows 8.1 applications. Budget-constrained corporate IT managers could do well in buying $149 Compute Sticks to cheaply upgrade 5-year old office desktop computers that still run on Windows 7 hardware configurations. The Intel Compute Stick has more useful peripheral ports than Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) new MacBook Air. Adding a wireless or non-wireless keyboard/mouse is not a problem. Apple's Intel Core M-powered MacBook Air 2015 has only one USB-Type C port for peripherals like keyboards or external DVD-writers. USB Type-C is not compatible with regular USB 3.0 or 2.0-standard input or external storage devices. My point is that the Intel Compute Stick has the potential to be a business-oriented product. It is not only a mere dongle stick to turn dumb TV sets into smart appliances. The Intel Compute Stick has one full-size USB and one micro-USB port for power. The micro-USB power supply says this computer is far more energy efficient than any desktop or laptop computer. The Compute Stick also has a microSD slot for storage expansion to add to the 32-GB internal flash drive of the Windows Compute Stick. The cheaper Linux version has only 8GB of internal storage so the micro-SD slot expansion port is very useful. I firmly believe that the PC product is not dying. I say it is maturing to include non-traditional form factors. IDC keeps reporting that the PC market continues to decline . However, I am confident that Intel's revolutionary Compute Stick concept has the potential to help reverse this downtrend. The portability, energy efficiency, and full-size PC productivity capability of the tiny Compute Stick is ideal for school, home, and office use. Furthermore, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is enthusiastically backing the Compute Stick concept. Microsoft has partnered up with Daewoo Lucoms to create a clone of the Intel Compute Stick in South Korea. Moneybags Microsoft has the marketing budget to make the supersmall Windows PC-on-a-Stick a mainstream global computing product. Another company, BeeLink , is also coming up with a clone of the Intel Compute Stick. The BeeLink product has the same specs of the Intel one. Since Microsoft is behind the Lucoms Windows PC stick, I expect it to be cheaper than the $149 Intel Compute Stick. After all, Microsoft owns the Window OS. The reason why the Windows Intel Compute Stick is a lot more expensive than the Linux version is that Microsoft's offer of free Windows 8.1 license is not yet applied to HDMI sticks because they do not have display screens like 8-inch or 7-inch tablets. Once Microsoft rectifies this glaring mistake, Intel-powered PC sticks sales could take off. The issue of non-qualification of screenless PC sticks has inspired Chinese OEM firms to create cheap $90 Trial Version-only Windows 8.1 OS-powered PC HDMI dongle sticks. The easy method of cracking and making a trial version of Windows 8.1 fully functional means Intel could be selling a lot of its Atom chips to whoever is making those cheap $90 clones of the Compute Stick. Microsoft does not make money from cracked trial versions but Intel benefits if more OEMs continue to bypass Windows OS licensing to create cheaper versions of the Compute Stick. I believe that Windows 10 Compute Stick products could hit below $100 once Microsoft finally realizes that PC Sticks are a good way to get more advertising eyeballs. Microsoft is planning to give free upgrades to pirated copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8 computer users once Windows 10 is released. It might be inevitable that Microsoft will have to give away free Windows 10 licenses to tablets, smartphones, computers, PC sticks, and other computing products like HDMI dongle PC sticks. After all, Microsoft's arch nemesis Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) already gives away free Android and Chrome OS licenses to all OEMs regardless of what products they create and sell. INTC is a Buy. Microsoft's eventual shift toward free OS for everything is great for Intel's x86 processor business.
