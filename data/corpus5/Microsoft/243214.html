Microsoft: Windows 10 Mobile Campaign Still Vulnerable To Weak App Store - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has decided to indefinitely postpone its Project Astoria or Windows Bridge for Android program. Project Astoria was supposed to help Android developers quickly port their apps to the Windows 10 app store. Sales of Windows 10 phones are unlikely to improve if the Windows 10 mobile app store continues to have fewer apps than the Google Play Store. Sources of WindowsCentral said Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is indefinitely postponing Project Astoria or Windows Bridge for Android. WindowsCentral might be on the money with this rumor because even the website for Windows Bridge for Android is no longer active at Microsoft's site. Project Astoria was supposed to be the magic pill from Microsoft that would encourage developers to port current Android apps to the Windows 10 Mobile app store. With the indefinite postponement of Project Astoria, there is very slim chance that Android app developers will help grow the Windows 10 Mobile app store. Sales of Windows Phones have struggled largely due to the face that fewer apps available for them, relative to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Play and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) App Store. The indefinite suspension of the Project Astoria program is therefore another setback for Microsoft's overall mobile campaign. Investors should not count on Microsoft to sell more phones because its promise of Android apps compatibility for Windows 10 phones is not going to happen anytime soon. The substantially lower number of apps available for Windows handsets (compared to iOS/Android phones) will again limit future sales of Windows 10 phones. Without more successful Android apps and games being ported to the Windows 10 Mobile app store, the Lumia division will likely continue to be a money-losing venture. Consequently, as long as Microsoft cannot build a bigger user base of Windows 10 mobile users, advertisers will continue to ignore Bing in favor of Alphabet's mobile search engine. Furthermore, the original July 2015 Windows Bridge for Android SDK allow developers to easily replace Google's AdMob API with Microsoft's Ads in Apps service. Microsoft urgently needs more mobile apps to attract more buyers for Windows 10 devices. Consequently, Microsoft needs more Windows Phone users to attract advertisers. Microsoft's freemium strategy for mobile is not going to happen if it cannot build a robust ecosystem for its own mobile advertising services. Alphabet's free giveaway of the Android OS and other mobile apps was a profitable decision precisely because it was able to grow its mobile search and apps-based advertising. Microsoft investors has every right to get discouraged over Project Astoria's indefinite postponement. There is a huge opportunity in the app store business. The mobile games industry alone was estimated to generate sales of over $30 billion this year. After the cancellation of Project Astoria, Microsoft is unlikely to get a Windows 10 Mobile port of, among others, the $5 million/day Clash of Clans Android game. Without a robust Windows app store, the multi-billion app store business will remain a duopoly between Alphabet and Apple. Microsoft's targeted attempt to win the support of Android app developers with Project Astoria was a great decision. Android apps are now emerging as strong cash generators. Having successful Android apps ported (via Project Astoria) to Windows 10 Mobile could have substantially helped Microsoft grow its own app store business. Apple and Google gets 30% cut from that $30 billion/year from games-related app purchases. Pushing through with Project Astoria could have been an easy way to benefit from the popularity of Android apps. Once Alphabet's special Play Store for China gets operational, the global Android mobile platform could really generate more global sales than iOS devices. As of now, App Annie's chart below only calculates the global app revenue generated by the official Google Play Store. App Annie's claim that Apple's App Store generates 80% more sales than Android is because Apple operates an official app store in China, which is counted by App Annie. As per a 2014 Digi-Capital report , Android apps actually generate more sales than iOS apps when sales from China's numerous Android app stores are included. The original design of Project Astoria was to let developers use their existing APK (Android Application Package) for Windows 10 Mobile devices. Windows Bridge for Android/Project Astoria's Software Development Kit allows Android developers to quickly replace the Google Mobile Services Application Mobile Interfaces ((APIs)) with Microsoft's own mobile services APIs. Replacing the APIs was necessary to make sure these Android apps will process in-app purchases only through the Windows app store. Unfortunately, illegally distributed developers-only copies of the SDK allowed ordinary but tech-savvy Lumia users to actually sideload Android games' APKs on their Windows 10 phones. This abuse of the Project Astoria SDK also allowed direct in-app purchases from the Google Play Store using Lumia phones. The indefinite postponement is therefore only logical. Microsoft will be the laughingstock of the tech industry if it allows Windows 10 phones to be used for direct in-app purchases from Alphabet's app store. Microsoft still needs more time to fix the exploits that allowed non-developers to use the Project Astoria SDK. Project Astoria was very important feature toward attracting more buyers for Windows 10 mobile phones. Microsoft now has a more difficult path toward building a competent mobile app store. Without Project Astoria, sales of Windows 10 mobile phones will again be burdened by fewer apps available for them. I expect Microsoft's Bing and Ads in Apps services to also continue to struggle against Google's dominant presence. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
