Microsoft Introduces The 'Holy Grail' Of Mobile Computing - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft introduced two new Lumia smartphones this week. Ordinarily the world would yawn. But the new Windows phones are powerful and flexible and for the first time permit wireless connections to a keyboard and monitor. Smartphones that can act as a desktop are a major paradigm shift in mobile in my view. Microsoft also introduced a powerful new first - a Microsoft hybrid laptop - targeting the MacBook Pro. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has introduced the "holy grail" of mobile computing - a smartphone that will connect wirelessly to a keyboard and monitor and act as a desktop. I had predicted years ago that someone would develop such a product and that the company that did would enjoy a major win. The Lumia 950XL is a flagship product by any measure, sporting the latest Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) processor, 3GB of RAM, and plenty of storage and connectivity with support for SD Cards up to 200GB. On the basis of specifications alone, the new Lumias outclass every existing iPhone with a better screen, longer lasting battery, and, more storage options. At $549, the new Lumia phones are also aggressively priced versus all major competitors. If that were the end of it, I would expect only modest sales of the Lumia. Windows phones have not captured much attention in most markets with notable exceptions in Russia, Brazil, Italy, and Argentina according to Kantar Worldpanel who puts Windows OS phones ahead of iOS in each of these countries. As recently as last August, IDC was forecasting Windows phone would take some share from iOS through 2019 with its then existing devices. But these new Lumias are not the legacy Windows OS phones and the jury is out just how well received they will be. First, they are Windows 10 phones and capable of running all Windows software natively. That means full support for Office, Outlook, and a host of other key programs. Second, the new phones can connect to a keyboard and monitor wirelessly, allowing them to replace the desktop and eliminate the need to synchronize data between desktop and smartphone, since the new Lumia is both desktop and smartphone. And, finally, with a 5.7 inch screen the new Lumia's a large enough to replace most tablet functions. In a nutshell, the new Microsoft smartphones will test whether there is in fact a market for a flagship Windows phone. If there is, this is a big deal for Microsoft. At a $649 selling price for the 950XL and $549 for the Lumia 950, I expect the new devices to return margins north of 30%. Sales of 10 million units in the first year are within the range of reasonable possibility adding $5 to $6 billion to revenues and $1.5 billion to margins. The Surface Book is a compelling design. Microsoft says it has 12 hour battery life and is twice as fast as the latest MacBook Pro. Throw in its larger screen, higher screen resolution, and lighter weight it could become a serious contender for the MacBook. Priced at $1,499, I would expect sales of 1 to 2 million units annually, adding $1.5 to $3.0 billion to Microsoft sales and based on a 20% margin guess, $300 to $600 million to operating income. Don't expect any "launch weekend sales" announcements from Microsoft or any other hype. Microsoft is not that kind of company. Instead, just follow the quarterly releases and see whether these new products gain any traction. If they do, Microsoft stock is cheap.
