Moody's reviews Microsoft rating after LinkedIn deal - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Jun 14 2016, 05:49 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Moody's has placed Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) 'AAA' credit rating under review for downgrade following the software giant's deal to buy LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) for $26.2B, citing concerns that it would be funded through new debt. Why is Microsoft taking out such a big loan is it has enough cash to buy LinkedIn 4x over? Bloomberg's David Kocieniewski says it could lower the tech giant’s tax bill (it will avoid paying a 35% tax rate to repatriate cash from overseas and could also deduct interest payments).
