Why Dividends Are Important For Every Investor: Microsoft Case Study - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft squandered more than $27B on acquisitions and failed products under former CEO Steve Ballmer. When companies make paying dividends a priority, it means less money to waste on other ventures. It's not just Microsoft under Ballmer; most companies fail to generate high returns from mergers or stock buybacks. When I meet with new clients and we go over my proposal for their portfolio I sometimes encounter a bit of pushback when I suggest investing a portion of their money in our dividend portfolio. I think a lot of this stems from the misconception of dividend paying stocks as safe, boring, low growth companies for widows and orphans. They want high growth stocks and think dividend investing is the antithesis of that. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) recent announcement of a $7.2B write down related to their acquisition of Nokia, it got me thinking that Microsoft is a great case study on why dividends are so important no matter what your investing goals are. Microsoft is a company that meets many of the characteristics investors look for. The company earns high returns on capital and has lush profit margins due to its three powerful franchises: the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, and its commercial software suite. The company has enjoyed steady revenue and profit growth throughout the last decade. Of course, because of the sky high valuations due to the tech bubble, Microsoft stock has not really been attractive until the later part of the last decade. Also, under former CEO Steve Ballmer, the company was known for one thing: wasting an astonishing amount of money on acquisitions and ill-fated consumer product launches. Over the past ten years the company has: Taken $13.8B in write downs including aQuantive in 2012 and Nokia in 2015 Lost $11.3B+ on Bing (excludes write down of aQuantive accounted for above) Incurred ~$1.5B in estimated losses on Zune Will be taking ~$800M in restructuring charges related to Nokia Microsoft has wasted over $27.4B of shareholder money on acquisitions and on failed products in an attempt to enter already saturated consumer markets that had no real synergies with the company's existing products or services. This would have been enough money to give every current shareholder a $3.38 special dividend (based on 8.09B shares outstanding). That's about a 7.5% yield based on Microsoft's share price as of this writing. It also would have been historically significant, occurring a decade after Microsoft's other special dividend of $3 in 2005. Of course, during the time period we've been discussing Microsoft has been a dividend stock. Over the past ten years Microsoft has paid out over $84B in dividends. But could you imagine the damage Ballmer could have done if Microsoft didn't pay dividends and he had a spare $84B lying around?! It's not just Microsoft under Steve Ballmer that makes terrible decisions with shareholder funds. A 1999 KPMG study found that "83 percent of mergers were unsuccessful in producing any business benefits regarding shareholder value." A McKinsey & Company study (no date given) found that 61 percent of all acquisition programs were failures because the acquisition strategies did not earn a sufficient return on funds invested. Here are some other quotes about the dismal rate of success when it comes to mergers and acquisitions: "70 percent of mergers fail to achieve their anticipated value…" from the Weekly Corporate Growth Report and "Most [mergers] fail to add shareholder value…" from Harvard Management Update. Companies also like to tout stock buybacks as similar to dividends. They are not. A June 2012 study by Credit Suisse analyzed the $2.7T in stock buybacks by S&P 500 companies from 2004 to 2011. They found that only 61 percent actually made money; that is, the company bought back stock and the share price rose above the buyback price. Not too bad. However, only 36 percent of companies actually managed annual returns of 7 percent or more to their shareholders with their buyback programs. In the real world, letting company management spend shareholders' hard-earned money on stock buybacks or acquiring other companies is usually wasteful. Dividends serve as a tried and true method for companies to return profits to shareholders and enhance their returns. Dividends also help protect investors from management making poor capital allocation decisions, which as we can see is shockingly prevalent throughout the corporate world. By investing in companies that make paying dividends a central part of their strategy, investors can minimize the impact of the Steve Ballmers of the world (that is, management that has poor capital allocation skills).
