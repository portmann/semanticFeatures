Down 44.5%, Is Apple Supplier Skyworks Still A Sell? - Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha Apple Supplier Skyworks' shares are down over 44.5% from their June 2015 highs. Skyworks is heavily exposed to Apple as well as to international sales. Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ) shares have dropped 44.5% since June 19, 2015, from an intraday high of $112.88, to a close of $62.60 on July 1, 2016. While Skyworks shares were making new all-time highs one year ago, many analysts and investors expected the shares to trade even higher. As a matter of a fact, as per below table, multiple analysts (with the exception of Goldman), recommended buying Skyworks shares between May 2015 and February 2016, while the stock was continuously trading down and making new relative lows (as per chart further down in this article) Analysts recommendations for Skyworks - Source: Yahoo Finance Meanwhile, we had published an article on December 1, 2014, recommending to our readers to sell shares and book 169% in profits from our prior buy recommendation stated in our earlier article of October 2013. Although Skyworks shares did trade higher following our Dec. 2014 recommendation to sell to book profits, they ultimately did reverse, and today the shares are trading at about 4% below such 2014 levels. Meanwhile, we now believe that despite the substantial drop in Skyworks during the past year, the outlook for the shares for the next several months is even less compelling than it was in Dec. 2014, and hence we favor selling Skyworks. Skyworks stock from 9/1/2013 to 7/1/2016 - Source: Yahoo Finance Skyworks is estimated to generate over 44% of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), according to BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava. When including Samsung, such share is estimated at 54%. Furthermore, according to Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell, it is estimated that Skyworks total exposure to the slowing mobile market could be as much as 80% . Although Skyworks has been attempting to diversify its exposure to Apple and the mobile market through penetration into the Internet of Things sector, it is very evident that Skyworks remains highly impacted by Apple iPhone sales. Following its Q2 2016 financial results (ending March 2016), Skyworks announced: During the June quarter we expect to be impacted by an inventory adjustment at a large customer, partially offset with gains across broad markets and crisp operational execution Skyworks designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products. Its primary revenue generator are RF chips (radio frequency) products, such as SkyOne Ultra front end module found in Apple's iPhone 6s. Skyworks also caters to low and mid-range smartphones, such as Huawei and Xiaomi. RF products are estimated to have grown at about 18% in the past, but such growth rate is slated to slow to 11% during the next several years. Skyworks is primarily counting on growth in the Internet of Things,"IoT", in order to offset the expected drop in mobile market. In a recent Skyworks presentation, the company underlined that connectivity spread along diversified markets is expected to expand at 35% CAGR (2014 to 2019), driven by primarily by IoT, as per below company slide.

Our company Bachar Samawi Innovations is involved in enabling innovative companies, with state of the art products, penetrate new markets. We currently have several IoT related initiatives, and we do know first-hand that the product adoption timeline is often longer than most would expect, while the funding environment is quite challenging and competitive. Recent macro uncertainty relating to Brexit, strong dollar and the upcoming U.S. elections will likely cause additional challenges for the several few months (at least until November). In out recent article " Apple Stock: Still Too Risky ", we stated: During the next several months, the macro environment presents substantial challenges relating to Brexit, Europe and even the upcoming US elections. Such uncertainty is likely to provide strength to the US Dollar, while possibly also having a negative impact on consumer spending (especially in Europe). Apple's international revenues accounted for 67% of Apple's $50.6 billion in revenues for the latest quarter ending March 26, 2016. With such a large share of its revenues being derived from international sales, an appreciation of the dollar, coupled with weaker international consumer spending, can weigh heavily on Apple. Most macro related headwinds will not be specific to Apple, but for the entire market. Nevertheless, Apple's reliance on international sales, as well as pessimism related to Apple's next iPhone 7 release, certainly elevate the risk factors for Apple shares during the next several months. The same challenges faced by Apple will be faced by Skyworks, first due to Skyworks' high dependence on revenue generated from Apple, and second, as those same headwinds challenging Apple will also challenge Skyworks in its international sales, as well as relating to potential slowing consumer spending. Skyworks currently has a market capitalization of about $11.9 billion. With analysts' earnings estimates of $5.49 and $6.16 per share for the years ending in September 2016 and 2017, Skyworks boasts forward P/E ratios of 11.40 and 10.16 respectively. Both from a market capitalization perspective, as well as forward P/E perspective, Skyworks seems to have a cheaper valuation today than it did in December 2014, where its market capitalization stood at $12.86 billion, and its forward P/E ratios stood at 15.19 and 13.44 for September 2015 and 2016 respectively. Skyworks' P/E ratio also looks attractive when compared to its range during the past five years, where it has typically fluctuated between 12 and 35, as per below chart.

What will ultimately matter for Skyworks from a valuation perspective is the macro environment, the outlook for the smarthphone industry, and competitive trends. We have already addressed the negative prospects for the macro environment and smartphone industry, while on the competitive landscape, Skyworks seems to be facing increased competition from Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ). Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh expects Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) to take 30% of the iPhone 7 mix, boosting Qorvo at the expense of Skyworks, due to Qorvo's legacy relationship with Intel and in making chips compatible with Intel chips. Skyworks could be losing some of its edge to Qorvo, while Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) newly formed RF venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, will present Skyworks additional challenges. Qualcomm is the largest mobile application processor and wireless modem manufacturer in the world. According to the Motley Fool : If Qualcomm also adds its RF chips, sensors, and wireless charging tech into single reference designs, the solution could be considered more cost-effective for margin-hungry smartphone OEMs. While Apple is unlikely to use an all-Qualcomm reference design, many low to mid-range OEMs could do so and throttle demand for Skyworks' One Mini modules. It seems Skyworks will face multiple challenges, in the smartphone industry in general (including high-end units from Apple, as well as mid-range to low-end units from other manufacturers), as well as potential slower growth than expected in the IoT sector, as well as macro related headwinds. Despite Skyworks' attractive valuation at current levels taken from a 5-year perspective, a longer 13-year history of Skyworks valuations has provided instances where Skyworks' valuation was actually half of the current valuation levels. Given our negative outlook for the next several months from a macro perspective, as well as for Apple (which drives 44% of Skyworks business), as well as elevated competitive risks, we favor selling Skyworks shares at current levels, despite them having already dropped by 44.5%.
