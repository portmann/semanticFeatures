The ARM Triumvirate Of Growth - ARM Holdings, plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) | Seeking Alpha ARM Holdings reported y/y revenue and operating income growth greater than 20%. The success of ARM and key partners is part of the ascendancy of the new semiconductor paradigm over the commodity Intel model. Even as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported flat revenue for Q1 , ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ) has demonstrated impressive growth in revenue and income . ARM, together with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) forms a triumvirate of growth in semiconductors. The paradigm shift away from commodity processor makers such as Intel has been underway since Apple introduced the iPad using its own custom System On Chip (SOC). In the new paradigm, processor design IP is the new commodity. Mobile device makers such as Apple and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) use that IP to design custom, or at least customized, SOCs for their devices. Then silicon foundries such as TSM build the SOCs to order. In the new paradigm, there's no room or need for an Intel. The force of the paradigm shift can be seen in the profitability and growth of the ARM triumvirate: *Apple's guidance as of the December quarter earnings report . For TSM, I converted their results stated in NT$ to US$, and I did the same for ARM's results just reported on April 21. I've chosen the members of the triumvirate based on their success in adopting or adapting to the new paradigm. I could have selected other players such as Samsung or Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), but haven't for two reasons. The first is that each has, to some degree, resisted the paradigm shift rather than embracing it fully. The second is that the members of the triumvirate stand out for their growth, while Samsung and Qualcomm have suffered somewhat impaired growth. The fortunes of Samsung and Qualcomm might change this quarter (for better or worse), so I'll be very interested in analyzing the earnings reports of these companies when they come out. And of course, I'll have my Apple earnings preview on Friday. Although Apple is clearly the big dog of the triumvirate, ARM continues to "wag the dog" by virtue of its position as sole source of ARM processor IP. This brings in revenue to ARM in the form of licensing fees for any company that wishes to build an ARM processor. Some companies such as Apple license only the right to use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which is just an agreed upon set of numerical codes that tell the processor what actions to perform. Apple then designs its own silicon implementations of the ARM ISA. Whether a company licenses only the ISA, or an actual design implementation from ARM, ARM also receives a royalty for every processor produced. While total technology licensing has slowed down to 7% y/y growth, total technology royalties have grown by 40% y/y. This in turn is fueled by processor shipments which stood at 3.8 billion in Q1, a 31% y/y growth. ARM's leadership position has been cemented by its introduction of the 64 bit family of processor designs based on a 64 bit enabled ISA, called ARM v8. The importance of 64 bit processing in mobile devices can be seen in Apple's success with the latest generations (iPhone 5s and 6) which used Apple's custom implementation of ARM v8. The entire mobile device industry has moved to catch up with Apple, and this has led to a new generation of 64 bit processors from Samsung, Qualcomm, and others. One of the interesting points that ARM made at its Q1 earnings conference call is how rapidly 64 bit ARM processors are being introduced. In Q1, only about 3.4% of all ARM processors, about 130 million, were 64 bit. By the end of the year, ARM expects about half of all smartphones to use 64 bit ARM processors. ARM v8 has also enabled a number of server products from EZChip, Annapurna, and Cavium. The offerings from these companies will not upend Intel's dominance of servers, but may make inroads this year. One analyst asked an interesting question about how ARM v8 processors compare with Intel Core M. I had made the observation , subsequently verified by testing a review unit , that the Core M in Apple's new Retina Display MacBook only performed about as well or a little better than Apple's A8x in the iPad Air in Geekbench. Some have been inclined to quibble about specific test results, and whether Core M might be better than the A8x using other benchmarks. I'm sure one can find a specific Core M processor and a specific benchmark where the Core M scores better than the A8x. This is missing the big picture takeaway that Apple achieved roughly comparable performance to the Core M using an inferior process technology (planar 20 nm TSM vs. 14 nm FinFET Intel). While the ramifications of this may have been lost on some readers, it clearly hasn't been lost on ARM's management. They pointed out that new Chromebooks are being introduced using a Rockchip 64 bit ARM processor. (Yes, Rockchip is covering its bet on SoFIA, that is, if they ever produce a SoFIA chip.) ARM also feels that its next generation 64 bit design, dubbed Cortex A72, will be performance competitive with Core M. ARM also pointed out it has started to receive royalties from processors produced on a 14 nm FinFET node, which undoubtedly is Samsung's, since it was the only one in production in Q1. This is also an area that will see very rapid adoption in the mobile device industry in the latter half of the year as TSM ramps production of its own 16 nm FinFET process. ARM is primarily a research and development organization. As such, it invests in near-term technology innovations that will pay off in product royalties in a 5-year time span. R&D headcount and cost is growing proportionally to revenue growth, as they should. ARM recently acquired Wicentric and Sunrise Micro Devices specifically to bolster ARM in the Internet of Things (IoT). Sunrise has hardware radio IP that can be integrated into SOCs. This continues the longstanding trend of integrating more and more functionality into the SOC. Wireless communication through WiFi, Bluetooth, or LTE is increasingly being integrated into the SOC itself. Eventually, I expect standalone wireless modems to be superseded by wireless IP that SOC integrators such as Apple will pick and choose for their devices. How companies such as Qualcomm adjust to the new reality where wireless is just a functional block on an SOC belonging to someone else is a good question going forward. The ARM triumvirate represents the future of processor manufacturing, not just for mobile devices, but for most computing devices. Intel represents the past. It may be a profitable past, but it's a past that is rapidly receding, like a train station viewed from the train that is pulling away from it. The train of the new paradigm has left Intel standing at the station. It is symptomatic of companies in decline that they begin to market themselves to investors based on hope for the future rather than current results: things will get better next quarter, in the second half, next year. We've heard all of those statements from Intel. The ARM triumvirate doesn't have to do that. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
