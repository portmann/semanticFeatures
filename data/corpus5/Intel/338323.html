At More Than ARM's Length From Apple - ARM Holdings, plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) | Seeking Alpha Anandtech has finally compared the Apple A9X with Intel Core M using SPEC2006 suite. Anandtech compares A9X with a MacBook powered by a Core M 5y31, but that laptop is one of the worst examples of Core M potential. Comparison with the still old 5Y71 used in Asus Transformer T300 shows an average advantage of 107% for the old Core M (similar TDP). While it would be suitable to see a comparison with the latest m7 6Y75, Intel still has a great advantage for the desktop and workstation environment. The website AnandTech has always been meticulous in its reviews. For example, it has always used reliable benchmark suites (SPECInt2000 and SPECInt2006, which are a better performance index compared to Geekbench) to compare ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) to x86 architecture (mostly for desktop/workstation/server workloads). Now that the iPad Pro has been released, AnandTech did the comparison between the ARM Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) A9X and some Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core M SoCs. What comes from this comparison is very interesting, but we must pay attention to how the comparison is made. With a fine analysis, it becomes clear that Intel still provides a consistent performance/watt ratio, which is good for keeping actual server and desktop market share. If you take a look at the above table, you can see that A9X is faster in certain benchmarks, slower in one benchmark and much slower in the other four. On average, it performs -11% against the Core M 5Y31 that powers the MacBook, early 2015. AnandTech states that A9X has a TDP that is entirely comparable to the Core M series, thus the comparison is somehow correct from the power consumption point of view. From this comparison, we can say ARM is already there in some cases, or that it is even more convenient, while in other fields it has to work hard. Obviously, once the comparison switches from the Core M 5y31 (old generation) to the other Core M (m3 6y30 and 5y71), the situation is consistently more favorable to Intel. The point is that from such a comparison, it looks like ARM (and Apple) have reduced the gap and it is now a possible and affordable solution even for ultra low-power laptops (and servers in the near future). However, my advice is that there are some flaws in this review, flaws that affect the comparison and the performance analysis. First of all, if we are talking about architectural performance, taking an old low-end Core M as a reference cannot provide the right level or potential that Core M is actually capable of. In addition, the old series had the same price for every SoC. At the same time, it is difficult to find Core M devices with a fine and correct passive heat dissipation system: Apple MacBook, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface 4 Pro and Asus T300 are rare examples of what is a well-engineered device thermal profile. Apple is a master when we consider this aspect. Generally, when a faster device is set as the reference, its advantage in those benchmarks where it is really strong is somewhat "reduced." The percentage disadvantage of the slowest device does not linearly grow with the score difference between the devices, therefore the comparison becomes less clear and the differences become less evident. For example, if the faster device is +10% over the slower one, the slower device is -9.09% over the faster one. But things get consistently different already when the faster device is +20% over the slower one, but the slower device is -16.69% over the faster one. If the difference is higher, the discrepancy gets a lot higher too. Here you can see the AnandTech comparison table with A9X set as the reference. It comes out that the Core M 5Y31 performs 44% better on average, because it is a lot faster where it wins, while the A9X wins are not so relevant in comparison. The worst benchmark is the 445.gobmk, where Core M 5Y31 is 28% slower (or A9X is 38% faster), but there are four benchmarks where Core M is completely devastating: In particular, the libquantum benchmark tells us ARM architecture still has a lot of issues for with regards to vectorizing capacities. It is correct when AnandTech states (in this specific comparison) that the ARM architecture is already good in some aspects, but the overall picture tells us that the slowest Core M is consistently faster on average. An advantage of +44% is more than the difference we can see between top AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Intel APUs/SoCs, and we know how it is the actual market balance. In any case, the previous point is somewhat a "mathematical exercise." But if we advance and also consider the new m3 6Y30 or the old, but fast Core M 5Y71, Intel generates outstanding performance: the m3 6Y30 performs 71% better (and it is the Core M 5Y31 successor), while the Core M 5Y71 (4.5W TDP) wins every benchmark, performing 107% better. In my opinion, the A9X must be compared to the top Intel SoCs, because the top Core M SoCs are the highest potential attainable by Intel at the moment, as it is A9X for Apple. In addition, m3 or m5 or m7, is practically the same piece of silicon. Therefore, ARM still has a lot of work to do: The pure performance and performance/watt comparison is still consistently in Intel's favor, moreover if we consider the top SoCs. And it must be remembered that the Core M series is on the market only from the end of 2014, which means that Intel is still a "newbie" in this TDP range. In the comparison there is still no m7 6Y75. Looking at its better efficiency and the overall improvement from Broadwell to Skylake in SPEC 2006, the m7 6Y75 will likely provide 15% more performance than the Core M 5Y71, reaching a +138% over the A8X. Obviously, if there is no game between 5Y71 and A9X, the new top Core M will be even better, it is granted. Obviously, it is not only a matter of performance, but of price per unit: the Core M is very expensive, while the A9 and A9X cost around 20-30$ (but we are not accounting for R&D, employers and so on, it is only the price paid to TSMC (NYSE: TSM )). From this aspect, there is no match for Intel SoCs. Intel wants very high margins and it decides different prices over the same silicon. Intel doesn't sell 200 M of Core M SoCs or more, therefore, the scalability is not big here and it has to spread the various fixed and relative costs over a relatively small volume. There are specifics features for the desktop environment (not useful at that low TDP). The 2-in-1 market is rich and is growing. Since Intel has no relevant competitors in this segment, it is able to push hard on prices. Therefore, if Apple is thinking about using the A9X or something similar for its MacBook lineup (and potentially other laptops), Intel could decide to lower its prices to maintain Apple as its customer for a longer time. But the focal point is another one: Apple has been always keen to improve its devices from the performance/watt aspect, providing very fast and performing machines, using top performing components. Switching from Intel x86 to ARM for the desktop environment would bring a lot of issues: The need of a bridge from x86 to ARM. No Windows x86 compatibility (which has been an extremely important factor for OSX expansion since the (NYSE: IBM ) IBM-Intel switch). But most of all, it would have a notably slower SoC. Top Core M and A9X are on two completely different performance/watt classes at the moment. The last point is very important: Apple spends a lot advertising its hardware, which is always at the top at each release: Apple ARM SoCs have been the fastest in CPU single core (at least for Geekbench) and from the GPU side (at least for GFXBench). The MacBook Pro 13" was the first to introduce the Intel Iris GPU. The MacBook Pro 15" has been the first quad-core laptop to adopt the Iris Pro graphics and it is the only laptop able to mix good graphic performance, a quad-core CPU, a great display, fine craftsmanship and long reviewed battery life (DELL has just arrived with its XPS 15, but it still does not provide comparable battery life). The MacBook is one of the best examples of how building an efficient small laptop around the Core M series (the 5Y71 inside the top tier MacBook is very fast). The iMacs are always the fastest all-in-one on the market with very high craftsmanship. For what concerns the ARM architecture, things may be even different from previous forecasts, since Intel and Microsoft ( MSFT ) look to be quite serious about high-end x86 smartphones. You can read a summary here . It is clear that if Microsoft is going for an high-end Intel chip, it means Intel is running fast and closing the gap even at very low TDPs. Maybe not the best moment for an ARM switch. It is true that Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) signed an agreement in China for less than $300M, but it is a province agreement, which is believed to be driven substantially by "personal" influence in Qualcomm. It would be nice to see something consistent at national level. Anyway, the various ARM licensed server chip builders are still struggling at the moment. They are generally behind schedule, they have underperformed their past promises without attacking Intel's dominion. AMD has just released its Opteron A1100 series, but it is an old project, which has arrived very late and it has to face Xeon D (Atom Avaton not anymore). The comparison is simply nonsense, since Xeon D provides a performance/watt and price/performance advantage that outclasses the new Opteron series and it outclasses even the "old" Xeon series: take a look here , the performance per watt ratio with recent Xeon D increases over +200%, which is astonishing. AMD hopes are obviously posed in K12, which must enter the market within the end of 2017, but K12, CaviarThunder, Qualcomm Kryo and Broadcom Vulkan will have to face not only the entire Xeon D line up which is growing and covering a lot of market sectors, but also the next generation powered by the Skylake architecture: we know that the Skylake architecture brings a very good boost for low power consumption per each core, therefore, ARM life will not be easy at all, even at the micro-server level. A9X is still no match for top Core M 5y71, and the comparison with the Skylake top Core M will be more devastating with the same TDP. Surely, Apple A9X is a very fantastic ARM SoC and it testifies that the ARM architecture is very good, but the performance/watt difference is so large that the price difference becomes not relevant in a lot of markets: Apple has to provide top performing devices, and if Intel will provide a consistent performance/watt advantage over ARM, Apple will continue to adopt the Santa Clara products for its desktop environment. If we also consider that Microsoft may ditch ARM/Qualcomm for its Surface Phone (and high-end phones) in order to adopt some upcoming high-end Intel products in the near future, it is probably not the best moment to make such an adventurous Intel x86/ARM switch for the MacBook lineups. We must also consider that Intel is working hard on winning some chip production from Apple (maybe A11 and relative modem) and that Intel 10nm is significantly denser than the 10-7nm from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC. Lastly, given the Xeon D performance/watt ratio, the enterprise sector will be solidly confined to Intel systems in the short and mid future, preserving one of Intel core business. For what concerns the consumer PC business, the market is expected to start a real recover in 2H 2016, in relation to new upcoming Nvidia and AMD graphic cards. At the same time, Windows 10 adoption is set to proceed steady in the enterprise market, given that companies have already taken their time to test/develop under Windows 10 (not to mention the upcoming Redstone update that improves a lot of productivity features). Intel is still a solid choice for Apple desktop devices, it will be hard for ARM to attack this kind of market. For what concerns this aspect, ARM will likely earn nothing from this point of view.
