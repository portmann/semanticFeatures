Intel IoT: Third Wave Of Computing - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Data... lots of data... collected by machines, processed by machines and analyzed by machines to help humans. Is IoT past the peak of the hype cycle or rising on the slope of enlightenment? Security may be one of the areas most benefited by IoT. IoT building blocks for Americaâ€™s Greatest Makers. First a few observations comparing the 2014 Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) IoT Insights to the 2015 Intel IoT Insights . In 2014 the Intel CEO was not present. In 2015 the Intel CEO was present in body but seemed preoccupied with other matters (maybe 14 nm yields). In 2014 the slides were more complex and yet more compelling. In 2015 the Things to Gateway to Cloud is presented as a less daunting challenge using the latest Intel developer tools. In 2014 security was stressed. In 2015 security was addressed by an Enhanced Privacy ID that specifically confirms the identity of each person, each device, each software, each set of data and each "Thing" in multiple ways. In 2014 IoT was near the peak of inflated expectations. In late 2015 IoT seems to be starting the climb up the slope of enlightenment . The IoT Insights presentations were impressive in December 2014 helping to shine Intel stock into the upper $30s. It seems that 2015 was the trough of disillusionment and now we are starting up the slope of enlightenment to increased profits. Machine Collection, Processing and Analysis Video taking, processing, pattern recognition, analytics and 3D video are all coming into real world applications. Drones can now autonomously survey agricultural fields and collect huge amounts of data for analysis and development of action plans to increase yields and use just the right amount of water. The drones fly autonomously using 3D cameras and collect mountains of data including video. This data is then processed in an Intel Gateway processor and important data is sent to the cloud for further analytics and comparison with data from other fields. Actions are then developed and implemented through Things like water valves that have microcontrollers connected to the cloud. This type of monitoring and action used to be done by a farmer riding a horse around his fields and opening ditches to allow water to reach parts of his field. Now much larger agricultural areas can benefit from increased monitoring and action based on observations. Quark microcontrollers to collect data and control Things Linex system to collect and process the information Platform of connections to the cloud Simplified cloud where networks, computing and storage are all virtualized on general purpose processors with specialized FPGA chips for cost effective and fast development of actions to benefit humans Similar applications were shown for First Responders where data is automatically collected from microcontrollers on a first responder and transmitted about temperatures, posture, breathing, heart beat, air quality, location and movement back to a Gateway where real time information is available for analysis (automatic warnings/alarms) and decision making by supervisors. Building HVAC systems, human bodies, retail sales ( Levi ), oil platforms (NYSE: SAP ) and many other systems can benefit from such automated machine data gathering, analysis and actions. This IoT roadmap provides some sense of the wide breadth of processor, microcontroller and sensor products Intel is providing into the IoT platform. Intel has now assembled a critical mass of processors and platforms necessary to quickly implement and scale IoT applications. Previously installing field data collection devices was a daunting task requiring conduits, wiring, circuits and disruption which led to lost productivity. Intel provided a video demonstrating how 100 data collection devices were installed around the Intel building in a half an hour. The devices were made by Yanzi using Intel IP and chips. The devices now either plug into outlets or use such low levels of energy that battery powered units can last for years. A 3D model of the building then allows easy access on a touch screen to pinpoint data from each unit and control various devices. This type of a building installation is now something that is ready to be scaled to tens of thousands of buildings around the world to reduce energy use and create a more comfortable and customized environment. Intel also has focused on making the IoT platform easier to connect to the Cloud and easier to analyze data once it is in the cloud. 73 % of corporations surveyed believe they have valuable data but they think it is too hard to get the value out of the data. 70% of the effort is in data cleaning and organizing. Intel has provided free open source platforms for development and sharing of cloud systems including: Platform Management, Security, Orchestration One very popular open source platform is TAP (Trusted Analytics Platform) where users contribute and all benefit from sharing what they have individually or jointly developed to address data analytics needs. Since TAP was announced mid year there are 68 corporate engagements. The response has been huge. The First Responder system described above developed by Honeywell took less than two weeks to develop and deploy using exiting sensor units and data analytics tools. Intel has developed the platforms, microcontrollers and processors that can scale IoT out to the world. Intel presented a new to me approach to security. This approach provides every person, thing, software and dataset an enhanced ID that can be analyzed in relation to its surroundings. Pattern recognition algorithms then compare patterns with accepted patterns to prevent privacy/security breaches, monitor for potential breaches and take action to resolve such breaches. The attack surface is bigger with IoT so the methods to secure privacy must address the enlarged surface. The protect-detect-correct security process must be repeated quickly and continuously. This new and necessary approach to security requires high levels of communication and pattern recognition computing. IoT creates the need for this new approach to security and provides the tools needed to address the need. Intel has the IoT systems ready to work with others in the cloud community to meet current and future needs through this system wide approach to security. In August Intel and Mark Burnett (Survivor creator) announced a TV reality program called America's Greatest Makers to launch in 2016. This series will pit makers against each other in a bid to produce a cutting-edge wearable - and the winner will take home a $1 million prize. The IoT devices and platforms revealed by Intel during their IoT Insights presentations will likely be used to make the million-dollar prize device. Intel has a strong track record of using innovation and integration to grow. IoT is no exception. Simply innovating to create individual components will not produce the scale of implementation necessary to support 50 billion connected devices in 2020. Intel has shown great strides in achieving an integrated IoT system with a wide variety of devices and platforms working in concert to meet the diverse need of an IoT universe. Intel's approach will accelerate IoT with Intel at the leading edge to profit from IoT growth and IoT induced growth in data centers. The slide below is almost a year old but it illustrates the size of the IoT market as it grows to include 50 billion connected devices by 2020. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MSS (Market Segment Share) and SAM (Served Addressable Market) are shown for each sub group of the IoT market. It appears that Intel is poised to grow its market share served while the served addressable market grows to achieve a compound annual growth rate that is in the 15% to 20% range. This growth rate would take IoT from $2.1 billion in 2014 to ~ $6 billion in 2020 with an MSS of less than 20%... plenty of room to grow.
