Why Intel Will Recover In FY 2015 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel had a rough start to a year, but there's room for surprise in the PCCG in the back half of the year. Also, expanding operating profits paired with a slight reduction in capex gives management added flexibility to increase its share buyback authorization. I anticipate that volume and improvement in yield will ultimately result in a slight surprise on gross margins above the mid-point of the guidance range. When combining all these factors, bottom line results are likely to improve considerably over the short-term. Long-term, the infant business opportunity in both mobile and storage will offset stagnant to low PC growth, implying reasonable growth rates when operating on a five-year time frame. I guess anyone looking at Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock chart would scratch the back of their head, and say, "sheesh" why is this stock performing so badly? It carried the Dow Jones last year, and now it's the dog this year. Talk about a change of events. Despite short-term price action, the business does have sound fundamentals and certain business segments will carry the company going forward. Hence, there are logical reasons for why investors should jump back in at the low 30s. The capital intensity of moving to more advanced nodes is expected to decline as Intel addresses the issue with more density. This sort of counters the arguments that were made by McKinsey & Company, where the analyst asserted that moving to more advanced nodes will cause capex to increase significantly. As mentioned by Stacy Smith (CFO of Intel): We are moving to reuse capital by rolling forward to 14-nanometer and to align overall capacity with demand. We are now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior outlook. We do agree capital intensity is going to go up as measured by capital cost per square inch of silicon. We believe that through 14, 10 and with some insight all the way down the 7 nanometer we can offset that increase in capital cost per square inch of silicon by improving our density. And so we can keep the cost per transistor coming down at the historical close. Assuming Intel can stabilize sales coming out of the PC Client Group, while capex drops significantly year-over-year, there's decent suspicion that there will be extra free cash flow for share buybacks. In FY 2014 capex was $10.2 billion, so capex will decline by roughly $1.5 billion. Operating income will likely increase by perhaps 5% to 10% year-over-year, which is somewhat dependent on PCCG. Growth in the bottom line is highly likely, as the higher margin business units are growing sales at pretty healthy rates. So operating margin expansio, paired with additional free cash flow will drive share buyback increases. And while the management team didn't offer much outlook on share buybacks on the conference call, I'm willing to throw in the speculation that Intel can offset the lack of sales growth in the back half with an even more generous share buyback authorization, improving sentiment around the stock on the basis of EPS expansion. Furthermore, the PC Client group outlook is based more on open-ended speculation on business customers in comparison to consumers and with an aging number of computers that are more than four-years-old, there could be ample justification for better than expected inventory build-up going into the holiday season, i.e. Q4 FY 2015. This could drive the short-term argument for investing into Intel, as better than expected FCF and a moderate surprise on the top line, will also drive the gross margin figure by a single percentage point or two. After all, margins should technically improve on the back of better yields at the 14nm node, but with the drop-off in utilization for 22nm, and the shift in costs for 10m, the two cancel each other out (at least that's what was mentioned on the earnings conference call). So the only logical reason to anticipate some improvement on gross margins is if the PCCG comes in at 0% to -4% y-o-y, so a beat on that segment would significantly alter growth assumptions and would increase gross margins as higher utilization of fabs increases gross margins, because the cost of revenue operates on a curve in which higher total volume will lower the average total cost. Admittedly, there are various reasons why third-party research firms like IDC are pessimistic on PCs. Tower PCs don't appeal to consumers and consumers simply don't have the spending power to justify the purchase of a laptop, a tower PC, mobile devices and various other consumer electronic devices. But that doesn't mean that between both laptops and towers that the market itself is set to contract. I think ASPs should eventually trend higher, as Ultrabook's which have higher storage capacity, beefier CPUs, better screens and similar portability to tablets will attract consumers (ultimately dragging ASPs higher). However, if that argument doesn't satisfy the skeptics, there's simply no replacement to the productivity that either a laptop or desktop PC provides. In the case of desktop PCs, there's always a market for workstation-oriented people who need the additional screens, graphics capability and CPU power to get highly complex tasks taken care of. So therefore, the productivity oriented PC market should be growing at a somewhat linear pace based on the broader growth in consumption globally. I don't understand why this hasn't happened, which is why I think PC demand tends to be cyclical but isn't really linked with the economy, but rather the age of the installed base of computers. In that case, refresh isn't as tied to broader macro issues like GDP and is more tied to the willingness of consumers to replace a computer with a better computer. PC refresh points may have gotten a little more elongated, but eventually the growth will likely return at some point and will likely be tied to a set of features like Direct X12, universal apps and cloud storage. Personally I think cloud storage is a huge deal because it makes it easier for users to migrate over files from one computer to the next as accessing the information is based on user account information rather than a lengthy process of file transfers from one external hard drive to the next. Admittedly, there are other businesses that I haven't discussed in this article. For example, the 3D NAND business is set to take-off as both the feature-set and economics of SSDs will destroy the market for mechanical drives in both enterprise and consumer. There's also the fact that the mobile business is set to improve its profitability as contra-revenue support will decline and improvements in cost structure due to overlapping R&D and intellectual property paired with volume ramp will turn the business into a major profit center. Overall, I plan to address the other business units in a more comprehensive article. The Micron partnership is a little more nuanced as Intel and Micron will share revenue. Also, determining the size of the storage and mobile market and the impact on revenue will require extensive wok to fully quantify.
