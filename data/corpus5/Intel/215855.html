Apple Watch: Putting A Dent In The Swiss Watch Industry - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch sales for the September quarter could double the June quarter. Apple Watch could generate nearly $2 billion in revenue. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is expected to sell about 4 million Apple Watches for the September quarter. If it does, this will represent a huge victory for the company. Apple will have established that it really can successfully enter new hardware categories. Within the span of a single quarter, Apple has established not merely a new product, but almost a new industry, with unit sales more than half of total Swiss watch production for the quarter. In the process, Swiss watch exports declined by 7%, and even more in the price range of a typical Apple Watch. Apple is no longer merely a competitor for single companies, but for entire industries. The estimate of 4 million Apple Watches sold in Apple's fiscal 2015 Q4 comes via Philip Elmer-DeWitt and represents a rough median of his poll of analysts. This is almost double what I estimate Apple sold in the June quarter, 2.1 million units. At an assumed $450 ASP, this will add another $850 million to Apple's top line compared to last quarter. In the same quarter, Swiss watch exports declined y/y about 8% to 7.1 million units, according to data supplied by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Although the unit decline was not large (about 600,000), most of the decline was in the critical price category of 200-500 Swiss Francs ($210-524), right where the Apple Watch ASP sits. This can be seen in a chart for the month of September provided by the Federation. Geographically, the declines in Swiss watch exports have been most pronounced where Apple is very strong. In September, exports to the U.S. were down 17.6% y/y, exports to China were down 13%, and exports to Hong Kong were down 18.2%. The advantage of Apple Watch has been that it simply provides much more functionality than conventional medium-priced watches. In addition to being an extremely accurate timepiece, the Apple Watch can remind you of appointments and show upcoming events on the user's personal calendar. Combined with all the other features the watch provides, it's an unbeatable value. The superior value proposition of Apple Watch will continue to erode other advantages of style and status that expensive mechanical watches, mainly Swiss, have hitherto enjoyed. Yes, the Apple Watch is kind of chubby, and it will never have the cache of a Rolex. So what? The Apple Watch has gone for the sweet spot, and the entire industry, not just the Swiss, are going to be bleeding profusely as a result. This isn't just about the Swiss. As this report on 2014 global watch production makes clear, watches are a huge business. In 2014, the top 6 exporting countries, produced a total of 1.05 billion watches, of which about 770 million were electronic. Smartwatches have made the electronic watch obsolete. I believe that most electronic watches will be smartwatches in a few years. So the total addressable market for smartwatches is about 600-700 million per year, including the upper end of the e-watch market and the lower end of the mechanical watch market. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android Wear smartwatches may get more of this, simply by virtue of the larger installed base of Android phones (over a billion). Apple's available watch compatible base can be estimated as follows. Apple has shipped a total of 774 million iPhones, as of the June quarter. Of these, about 500 million are iPhone 5 or newer generations that can run the newest iOS 9 and be paired with Apple Watch. Assuming an attrition rate of 90% for these newer iPhones, this leaves Apple with 450 million available customers for Apple Watch. So Apple could go on selling Apple Watch at the rate of 4 million a quarter effectively forever. Except that, I expect Watch sales to accelerate. Since the early sales in the June quarter, Apple has been accelerating the availability of Apple Watch, first to its own stores, and then to large retailers such as Best Buy. Putting the Apple Watch on display in retail stores has been critical to building the audience for Apple Watch. The watch was just a little too expensive for most to buy exclusively online, as Apple required at launch. Most importantly, the Apple Watch is only going to get better with each succeeding generation. Following Apple's usual practice, succeeding generations will be sleeker, be able to do more, and have better battery life. As Apple adds value to the device, I expect sales to increase. Even as Android takes most of the unit sales of smartwatches, I expect Apple to take most of the profit, as it does now with smartphones. The reason for this will be as it is for smartphones. Apple Watches will all contain Apple's own custom designed processors, just as iPhone does. These processors will have superior capability to any commodity smartwatch processor, especially from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). The Apple watchOS will provide superior integration with the rest of the iOS ecosystem, and the abundance of apps will also be an edge. Combined with Apple's design flair and obsession with quality, Apple Watch will be a smartwatch apart from the rest of the commodity Android Wear watches and will continue to command a premium price. Apple reportedly had early production problems that limited the gross margin of the watch. These problems have apparently been resolved, judging by the wide availability of the watch. Therefore, I expect Apple Watch gross margin to converge to Apple's corporate average of about 40% for the September quarter. At sales of 4 million units, that's $720 million in gross profit from this new product line. Apple Watch sales alone could add $540 million in operating profit, using Apple's typical operating margin of about 30%. These are excellent results for a brand new product category.
