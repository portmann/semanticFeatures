Intel Didn't Fail In Mobile, It Was Preparing To Conquer IoT - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel bears are arguing that Intel has failed in mobile, but that's more hype and less fact. Intel's recent decision to abandon Atom mobile SoCs is a part of accomplishing its long-term objective. The objective was winning the IoT and connected devices market (originally the communications market). Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has made a bold decision to scrap the mobile version of its Atom SoCs, codenamed SoFIA and Broxton. Intel bears are suggesting that the company has failed to survive in the smartphone and tablet market after spending billions of dollars. I believe Intel's decision is nothing more than a change in business strategy. And that's good news, given that global smartphone market is witnessing zero growth, according to IDC . If Intel can afford to change its business strategy even after spending a few billion dollars, that makes it a better company for long-term investment with a market cap of more than $140 billion. In today's dynamic business environment, only deep-pocketed companies like Intel are investment-worthy for the long term. Intel seriously jumped on the mobile bandwagon in 2012 when it introduced Atom mobile SoCs specifically for powering smartphones running on Alphabet-owned Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL )(NASDAQ: GOOG ) Android OS. Intel officially launched its x86-based Atom chips back in 2008 for netbooks, embedded devices and MIDs (mobile Internet devices). Atom chips are predominantly based on CISC (complex instruction set computer) architecture, although some elements of RISC (reduced instruction set computer) are incorporated into the chips. The Atom story started way back in 2004, when Intel took its long-term initiative to build a chip having multiple x86 cores that consume very low power. The company also designed a low-power core in 2004, codenamed Bonnell. Intel's aim was making the chip highly efficient in terms of performance per watt. The initiative finally gave birth to an architecture codenamed Silverthorne, which was branded as Atom in 2008. A 2008 AnandTech article explained how Atom emerged. If someone tracks Intel's activities prior to 2004, it would be clear that the company's original aim was conquering the communications market. The smartphone and tablet market, which came into existence in 2007 with the introduction of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone, actually marks the initial stage of the communications revolution. Intel knew that without embracing the RISC architecture, growing in the communications space would be impossible in the initial stage. RISC was far more efficient compared to CISC, with its fewer instructions to run the communications devices with low computing horsepower. Intel therefore developed the XScale chip line based on ARM's (NASDAQ: ARMH ) RISC architecture. Unfortunately, Intel had to leave the communications market in 2006 when the company sold off its XScale chip line to Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL ). Intel knew that it's not necessary to win every battle to win a war. The company might have lost the mobile battle temporarily, but certainly not the communications war. The question then arises why Intel wanted to develop an x86-based CISC processor like Atom in 2004. I have been tracking Intel since 2002 and therefore I am well aware of the fact that Intel was ahead of its time when it started developing Atom. At that time only a few industry experts knew how the communications industry would shape up. Click here to learn how an industry expert correctly predicted in 2004 that Internet-connected devices (the term "IoT" wasn't coined then) will eventually rule the communications industry. Intel knew very well that the Internet-connected devices of the future would need significantly high computing horsepower, compared to the mobile communication devices developed in the initial phase of the communications revolution, such as smartphones and tablets. The company also knew that eventually the power of CISC would be required to support the high computing horsepower of the devices. That's why it took a long-term initiative back in 2004 to develop something like Atom. When Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in the Q1 earnings release, "We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices," he actually echoed Intel's long-term goal to win the communications market. And I am confident that Intel is fully prepared this time to achieve the goal. To strengthen the transition process, Intel has announced a restructuring initiative. Atom started gaining traction in the smartphone and tablet market in the second half of 2013. Intel sold millions of Atom SoCs in the last few years and several smartphone OEMs released handsets powered by Atom. Atom adoption was on the rise in the smartphone and tablet market, despite the fact that ARM-based chips that are based on RISC architecture were more suitable for smartphones and tablets than Atom. Intel provided Atom SoCs to smartphone OEMs at subsidized prices for gaining market share. Inspired by the initial success, Intel planned to diversify the Atom family with SoFIA and Broxton. It launched SoFIA last year and Broxton was due this year. Why would Intel suddenly abandon the Atom SoCs for mobile devices when the going was good? I believe Intel made the decision since smartphone shipments witnessed zero growth in Q1. At the end of April, IDC released its worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker, which revealed that in the first quarter of this year vendors shipped 334.9 million smartphones worldwide, compared to 334.3 million units in first quarter of 2015, representing zero YoY growth. IDC observed this was happened due to "strong smartphone saturation in developed markets." Why would Intel allocate resources to a market that's on the verge of registering negative growth? Instead, doesn't it make sense to allocate the resources for a market that's rapidly growing, i.e., the IoT and connected devices market? Intel's Opportunities In IoT And Connected Devices Are Huge Intel remained unsuccessful in the first round of the communications game because it couldn't displace ARM after selling off its own ARM-based XScale chip line in 2006, just one year before the first iPhone arrived. Despite that the company continued to spend billions of dollars to develop Atom. Why? Well, Atom is the name of the game in IoT and connected devices. Intel has already built a strong ecosystem around Atom for next generation devices, such as Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) HoloLens, which runs on Atom. Atom is already an established name in the connected car market, which is poised for huge growth in the coming years. In addition, Intel will use Atom in telecom by introducing 5G compatible modems and SoCs based on the upcoming Atom architecture, code-named Goldmont. The advantages of the CISC architecture will be required to run many of the connected devices, such as HoloLens, because they will have significant amount of computing horsepower. The coming years will see the rise of CISC via Atom, making Intel's long-term plan commercially viable. According to a Pocketnow article : All these devices that enable our mobile lifestyles require chipsets of their own - many times a RISC chipset isn't the right choice for one of these embedded solutions. In my opinion, that's where Intel's Atom processor family fits in. Intel is well-positioned for the IoT and connected devices market. Although Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) could pose some challenges for Intel, they're not going to be significant because Qualcomm's strategy is different. Intel has built a robust IoT ecosystem, which will act as one of the pillars of its next success. Whenever that happens, that would be a long-term dream come true for Intel.
