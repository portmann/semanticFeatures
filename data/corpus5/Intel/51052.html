AMD Product Roadmap Leak: Some Salvation For 2016 - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD's product roadmap leaked. I'm still bearish on the company's fundamentals despite the positive news. The company will move to a more advanced 14nm node, which will result in power efficiency gains, with a marginal improvement in performance. It will be late to the party, but at least the company is keeping up. In the leak, AMD will release a 14nm ARM-based tablet CPU, which will compete directly with Qualcomm and TSM. Needless to say, AMD will find that it's difficult to engage Qualcomm in mobile devices. AMD's low-margin, low-end PC business could run into a shrinking tower PC market. AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) product roadmap leaked on an off the radar website. The initial leak came from the forums of Planet3DNow (a foreign website) on April 29th, 2015. Now I have never heard of this website until recently. But, with other reputable sources like Extreme Tech, Fudzilla, and Digital Trends jumping on the leak, I'm taking the liberty to update my stance on AMD. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will be running on 2nd generation architecture at the 14nm node by the end of 2015. So it doesn't necessarily mean that AMD is going to be getting the better of Intel quite yet. But at least, AMD has a plan, and while it's not getting ahead of its rival, it's at least keeping up. In terms of density, Intel will have an advantage, as it's on a 2nd generation FinFET. GlobalFoundries is still on a first generation process when it comes to 3-dimensional transistor layering, and while performance does scale with 3-dimensional transistors, it's not exactly clear whether AMD will keep up, much less pull ahead. Since this is leaked footage of AMD's upcoming roadmap, we don't have projected performance figures from AMD. At best, we can anticipate modest improvement from AMD's prior generation products. Increase in performance will be in terms of power efficiency, but IPC (instruction per cycle) will improve marginally. AMD will operate on a 14nm node. Yields won't be great, as it takes a while for fabs to optimize yield/cost ratios. Intel anticipates that its gross margins will be as good as Haswell at 22nm, by the end of 2015. Also, Skylake will be an improvement to architecture, and will be rolled out in conjunction with Windows 10. The timing of Intel's more advanced CPUs is impeccable, but the drop-off in demand for tower PCs doesn't really help, as various industry reports indicate that PC demand could shrink for the current year. Admittedly, we will have to wait until we're within months away from the holiday season to get real supply chain confirmation. Inventory is going to be burned in the upcoming quarter, which will result in falling profitability and revenue. There are no notable upside catalysts in play, as AMD hasn't developed enough scale to become a truly disruptive competitor in the desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile space. AMD will need to improve its cost to performance ratio in order to gain laptop/tablet design wins. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) remains dominant in tablets, with Intel a distant second. The slides indicate that AMD will design an ARM-based chip for tablet devices, and quite frankly, I wish them luck. Qualcomm's ability to bundle IP across MEMs, MCUs, modems, CPUs/GPUs lowers cost, and increases performance. TSM (NYSE: TSM ) operates its fabs extremely efficiently, which is why I believe the Qualcomm & TSM duo will be difficult for AMD to compete with (even if they were to sacrifice gross margins). Intel is still bleeding money in mobile, and if AMD were to engage, I can't imagine the situation to be any different. For now, AMD is doing its best to survive. I think AMD will at least make it to 14nm, and will continue to generate volume in budget oriented PCs. It's certainly not a winning strategy, which is why I remain skeptical and bearish of AMD.
