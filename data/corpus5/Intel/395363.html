Intel Made A Tactical Retreat On Smartphones - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha With MediaTek unveiling LTE-integrated SoCs fit for $50-$60 phones, Intel had to scrap SoFIA and Broxton processors. It is a tactical retreat to protect more important assets. Intel needs time to build a smartphone processor with an integrated5G modem. The phone form factor is the next evolution of the desktop PC. The iPhone 4G/LTE modem deal with is in the bag. Intel wants to focus on modems to keep Apple happy. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported decision to cancel further development of SoFIA/Broxton SoCs is misunderstood by other writers. They think Intel already surrendered on smartphone processors. In my view, Intel simply made a strategic retreat to fight another day. The 9-figure operating losses from subsidizing Atom chips has drained (but not defeated) Intel. The cancellation is likely due to MediaTek's upcoming entry-level LTE-equipped SoCs. I suspect Intel and Rockchip are nearly done with the final design of the SoFIA Atom x3-C3440 LTE SoC. However, it got shelved to save money. The MT6738 SoC will get inside $50-$60 Android phones by summer. Unlike before, Intel cannot afford to subsidize SoFIA processors against this kind of cutthroat pricing from MediaTek. The ever-declining sales of traditional PCs and emerging threats to its x86 server business are forcing Intel to rein in costs. Intel needs to conserve resources to build a moat around its server sales. Making the best data center chips is the only way it could protect its lead. Intel cannot stop Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) from licensing x86 SoC design to other firms. Aside from THATIC, AMD also could create joint ventures with other firms. Intel therefore needs more manpower and resources to develop best-in-class Xeons and microserver Atom processors. Keeping its big lead over AMD Opteron chips is the only way to neutralize the THATIC joint venture threat. Discontinuing the SoFIA processors is a no-brainer. Some key features of the Atom x3-C3440 made it inferior to MediaTek's latest entry-level LTE-ready SoC. The cheapest 28nm MediaTek MT6738 SoC comes with a Cat.6 LTE modem and Mali-T860 MP1 GPU. The top-end SoFIA Atom x3-C3440 only comes with a Mali-T720 MP2. GPU disparity is important because gaming performance is a big selling point even on entry-level phones. Consequently, (even with equal price tags) OEMs will still choose the ARM-based MT6738 over the Atom x3-C3440. Avoiding a bloody price war now (over phone SoCs) is a laudable move. Instead of wasting eight-figures on contra revenue for SoFIA/Broxton SoCs, Intel could use the money to improve its standalone modem products. Becoming a long-term co-supplier of iPhone modems will require Intel to constantly come up with better designs. Keeping Apple happy will let Intel earn $600-$900 million annual sales supplying modems for the iPhone. This is enough to augment this year's revenue from supplying 5 million x86 processors to Asustek's phones. Yes, even with Intel's cancellation of SoFIA/Broxton, Asustek will still use Intel SoCs on 20% of its target 25 million phones for 2016. The cancellation of SoFIA/Broxton chips could be compensated by sales of Intel-powered PC sticks, Chromebooks and mini-PCs. AMD still has little interest in ultra-small/pocket Windows/Linux computer products. The upcoming release of Apollo Lake processors will also let Intel further dominate the low-end PC market. The 6W SDP rating of Apollo Lake makes it ideal for stand-alone tablets and 2-in-1 tablet/laptop products. Sales of detachable laptops continue to rise and majority of these products use Intel processors. I do not expect Intel to ever abandon smartphone processors. The phone form factor is the next evolution of computers. Laptop shell products will run under the power of smartphones. The $119 Nexdock and $99 Superbook are good examples why productivity-focused smartphones will replace the traditional laptop. Windows, Android and Linux can run on smartphones. Next-generation phones can work with laptop shells and standalone monitors. Intel's x86 processor IP is the only chip versatile enough to run any operating system. Without a strong presence on smartphone processors, ARM-based Android handsets that run Remix OS could become the next standard for productivity-focused phones. Intel therefore still needs to create an integrated phone SoC to protect its core desktop PC business. Failing to do so means ARM-based Android phones that operate like keyboard-and-mouse computers will make x86 even less attractive to OEMs. Looking forward, Intel and Rockchip could covertly work on integrating a 5G modem inside a 10nm or 7nm x86 phone SoC. The future of Intel's x86 chip business depends a lot on how soon it could create processors with integrated modems. It might take 2 or 5 years but it is a very important venture. It will be useless of Intel to have the best discreet 5G modem when a majority of phone manufacturers want integrated Modem/GPU/CPU SoCs. Even Apple, should it get to buy its own modem IP, will try to incorporate modems inside its custom A-series processors. Cost concerns, space-savings and energy efficiency favor the all-in-one integrated phone SoC. The temporary respite from smartphone chip development is not a reason to go bearish on Intel. On the contrary, it should inspire us to buy more INTC shares. Intel is simply putting its money where it can make money. SoFIA/Broxton were bad bets that needed to be folded. By doing so, Intel gets to use more money in defending its 90%-plus share in x86 server chips. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
