Intel Needs Famous Brands Like Fossil To Improve Its Wearables Strategy - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Wearables are important for Intel's future. Even after buying Basis Science, Intel's wearables campaign still needs more famous brands to help it sell more IoT-centric processors. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) made a strong case for its Internet of Things strategy last December. The sad fact is no major smartwatch or fitness tracker vendor has taken up Intel's offer of energy-efficient chips like the Curie . Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) and other Android Wear watch makers all use ARM-based processors. It is therefore an important development that Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ) recently announced that its Intel-powered Fossil Q line will be available for purchase starting October 25. Helping newcomers like Fossil make it big in Android Wear watches and health tracker bracelets is for the long-term benefit of Intel's chip business. The watch and fitness tracker bracelet-type products are the major growth drivers for the $16.1 billion wearables industry. The x86 Atom chip's still dismal market share in smartphones should prod Intel to work harder to get its processors inside the next big thing - wearables. Fossil and Tag Heuer are newcomers to the smartwatch industry. However, these two are important partners toward improving Intel's overall Internet of Things strategy. Intel bought smartwatch maker Basis Science in March 2014 likely because it wanted to build a platform/reference design for x86-powered wearables. More than a year after the Basis Science takeover, there is still no design win for Intel's Curie from top-selling smartwatch vendors. I speculate that Intel needed the famous brands of Fossil and Tag Heuer to convince other established smartwatch vendors like Samsung or FitBit to consider x86 chips like the Curie for their next generation wearables. I also theorize that by helping new rival products (from new entrants like Fossil) compete against ARM-based wearables, OEMs like Samsung/Fitbit might finally notice that x86 chips are good enough for watches. The sub-$300 price tags of Intel-powered Fossil watches make them the ideal equalizers against ARM-based smart watches like the $349 Samsung Gear S2 , the $250 Pebble Steel , and the sub-$1000 Apple Watch models. Affordable $125 Intel-equipped fitness tracking bracelets are also great. Cheap fitness tracking devices helped Fitbit become the world's top vendor of wearables this year. Xiaomi, a leading global smartphone vendor, is the second biggest vendor of wearables thanks to its $25 Mi Band. The potential economic benefit to Intel is that the Fossil Q products could sell least 2 million units/year. This guesstimate is quite reasonable since Apple sold 5 million smartwatches this year. Samsung sold 1.2 million watches/fitness trackers last year. My guesstimate is also not limited to the Fossil brand. The Fossil Group sells fashion wristwatches under other famous brands like Adidas, Diesel, DKNY, Burberry, and EMPORIO ARMANI. I speculate that the wearables chip supply deal with Intel could also extend to other watch brands that the Fossil Group also uses. Every partner that signs up to use an x86 processor for their wearable product is important toward increasing Intel's overall IoT campaign. Fossil clearly gives Intel-powered wearables a bigger total addressable market than Basis Science could ever achieve. Intel's IoT division's revenue contribution (which contributed $581 million in Q3) is likely to improve further once Intel-powered smartwatches/fitness bands become affordable enough even for price-sensitive buyers in emerging markets like the Philippines.
