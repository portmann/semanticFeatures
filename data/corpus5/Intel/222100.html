Intel Goes Ex-Dividend This Week: How To Double Your Dividend And Earn Over 15% - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Double Dividend Stocks , Double Dividend Stocks (2,104 clicks) Intel goes ex-dividend this week. It has outperformed the market handily over the past month. You can more than double its next two dividend payouts with a strategy that yields 16%-plus annualized. In one of our recent articles , we showed how you could double your dividends on Microsoft, (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and increase its modest yield considerably. This article will take the same approach for another tech giant, Intel, (NASDAQ: INTC ), which, like MSFT, whose dividend yield doesn't approach the levels of the high dividend stocks which we normally cover. Intel designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. It operates through the PC Client Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Mobile and Communications Group, Software and Services, and All Other segments. The company's platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, transportation systems, and retail devices. Intel hadn't been getting much support from the market in 2015 until the past month, during which time it has surged over 16% and outperformed the S&P 500. Even with this jump however, it's still virtually flat over the past year, and is still negative for 2015: Analysts Earnings Estimates: INTC has beaten earnings estimates three out of the past four quarters and has received many upward earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days. Dividends: INTC has an "OK" 10.38% five-year dividend growth rate, (MSFT's is over 27%), and a conservative 40% dividend payout ratio but as an income investor, maybe you would want to earn a higher yield than the current sub 3% that INTC offers. Options: That's where selling covered calls comes in. We've just added this February $35.00 covered call option trade to our Covered Calls Table , where you can learn more details about this and over 25 other income-producing trades. This option pays you $1.20, which is over 2x the amount of INTC's next two dividends. The combo of the dividends and the option money offer you a yield of 4.94% in less than four months - over 16% annualized. Since the $35 strike price is $.97 above INTC's price/share, you also have the potential for some price gains. Looking at this from another angle, if your shares were to get assigned/sold before either of the 2 ex-dividend dates, you would be amply compensated for the loss of the $.48 in dividend by the $.97 in price gains. The table below details the three main scenarios for this relatively short-term trade: A lucrative alternative to selling covered calls is selling cash secured puts. By selling puts below a stock's price/share, you can achieve a lower breakeven cost and hedge your risk. Many professional investors, including Warren Buffet, use this technique to "get paid to wait" on a stock which they feel may be a bit pricey at present. This February $33.00 call pays $1.54, over 3x INTC's next two dividends, and offers you a $31.46 breakeven. Unlike selling covered calls however, put sellers don't receive dividends. Earnings: Even though it has beaten estimates in three of the past four quarters, it hasn't been a smooth ride for INTC earnings-wise as it transforms its business from being less dependent upon PC sales, which are fading. The big drag on earnings has been the Client Computing Group due to lower PC sales. The Data Center group, which earned over 50% of INTC's Operating Income for the first nine months of 2015, has shown promising growth, capitalizing on the continued build-out of the cloud. Operating Income for the Internet Of Things group is up 4.14% and is up 252% for the Software & Services group in 2015. But these two groups comprised only about 6% of the pie: Valuations: INTC's Forward P/E (based on 2016 estimates) and its price/sales are both in line with industry averages. Its EV/EBITDA ratio looks cheap, but it does command a premium price/tangible Book. Historically, its current 14.54 P/E is toward the high end of its five-year range of 9.49 to 16.22. Financials: INTC's ROA and ROE ratios look strong vs. broad industry averages as does its operating margin. It has low debt and an in-line current ratio.
