According To Intel, 'PCs Aren't Dead Yet' - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha There's no question that PCs have struggled over the past couple years. However, shipments are setting up for a recovery due to a large/old installed base, new technologies, and better product segmentation. Furthermore, Intel is better positioned to capitalize on this cycle due to cross-sell opportunities of other components (storage, network connectivity, Iris Pro, Real Sense). As such, I feel fairly confident that CCG will grow as there's some upside to Intel's outlook for the segment. For the most part, I'm starting to get more optimistic on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) due to recovery in PC demand, blistering growth in the DCG segment, and fab margin improvements. All of these pistons are starting to operate more properly, and as such, I see pretty solid upside to the stock as a result of a combination of all these factors. However, the segment that has been a sore spot for investors has been the CCG. For the most part, mobile is a major contributor to operating profitability in the CCG segment next year, which is why they're able to forecast low-teen operating margin growth for the consolidated segment. This was driven by a $800 million reduction to mobile costs, much of which is pertaining to the fab R&D component. As such, I feel fairly confident that CCG will have a solid year in terms of profitability and sales next year. We also have enough visibility to anticipate stabilization in PC demand, which is what Kirk Skaugen (Senior Vice President and General Manager of Client Computing Group) went into great detail explaining at this year's investor day. Intel mentioned that the PC installed base has expanded quite significantly over the past couple years. The market seems positioned for a rebound and quite frankly, I could see the CCG posting some shipment growth next year, as there should be consumer refresh demand beyond just the XP refresh we saw in enterprise computers during 2014. The cyclicality of this business makes it hard to predict. However, a stable growth trajectory in CCG should begin to form over the next couple years. Furthermore, supply chain sources also indicate a pattern of shipments bottoming out, whereas Intel uses a conservative guide of low single-digit PC shipment declines. The number of PCs older by three years or more was 1 billion in 2015 according to Intel, and even more interesting is that the amount of demand for 2-in-1 notebooks has been relatively astonishing. This part of the market is particularly attractive to Intel because the ASPs in the segment are strong and it cannibalizes a segment Intel never had a meaningful presence in (the tablet). So, if Intel is able to grow 2-in-1 PCs they mitigate demand for mid-tier clamshell laptops, but through segmentation they generate higher ASPs. 2-in-1s grew by 40% over the course of 2015, but Intel anticipates the 2-in-1 segment's growth rate to accelerate by 50% or more over the course of 2016. This will be done off a higher revenue base plus higher ASPs, which implies meaningful impact on both shipments and sales for notebooks. The incremental impact from 2-in-1 PCs was also able to offset a reduction in demand for conventional notebooks in 2015. It seems consumers are either opting for tablets or 2-in-1s. The ability to hold onto a handheld computer is a factor to marketability, and for the first time in a while, it seems consumers are entering the market to upgrade as opposed to buying a PC to replace a broken PC. I've had to replace two of my non-functional laptops in 2014 with a MacBook Air, so I understand the broad consensus in sentiment among consumers wanting to wait until it breaks as opposed to upgrading. The various efforts with technology has resulted in unexpected demand for mid to high-end laptops. Understandably the better security features due to real sense, power efficiency in a better form factor, and performance at the high-end is driving demand for laptops that are optimized for gaming and work. Combining these features has created new categories in the high-end of the segment, and various efforts to develop technologies to reduce the number of connectors will create a better experience for consumers. Part of the reason why PC sales have dried over the past couple years was the lack of innovation in the segment, but it seems Intel has taken over the reigns so there's more consistency in developing better platform-specific technologies so consumers are quicker to refresh PCs. Furthermore, due to the high demand for 2-in-1s, Intel has the ability to ramp 4G modems into the Windows tablet and 2-in-1 PC ecosystem. This has favorable implication on Intel's ability to leverage mobile IP, as they're working out ways to improve WiFi and offer wireless connectivity for monitors (Wi-Gig). The wireless connectivity to external monitors creates added incremental revenue for embedded chipsets in laptops, which creates a better value proposition for enthusiasts hoping to connect two additional monitors to laptops without using HDMI cables. Furthermore, Intel will be marketing an Optane line of SSDs using their recently unveiled 3D XPoint technology, and will also remove power cords by replacing them with thunderbolt 3 ports. Given the technological improvements, cross sale opportunities, and various efforts to move pricing higher, I think there's a fairly solid chance that the CCG becomes a bigger contributor to revenue growth going forward. While the stock didn't react much following the Intel investor day, I view the additional insights as offering enough visibility so investors can rally around the strengthening fundamentals. While others have mentioned that the PC market could worsen, I view the PC market as a strategic asset that allows Intel to fund development in new product categories allowing them to sustain revenue growth. Given all of these favorable dynamics I continue to reiterate my $42.87 price target and high conviction buy recommendation.
