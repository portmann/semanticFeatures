Microsoft Ditches ARM On Its Smartphone Lineup? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Actual Lumia high-end products are ARM Qualcomm powered. Capossela (Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft) admits that Microsoft is working on a smartphone that must be the spiritual smartphone counterpart of the Surface tablet lineup. Eldar Murtazin claims that the Lumia will be stopped and Intel SoCs will be adopted in place of ARM Qualcomm chips in its devices. A possible high-end lineup based on Intel SoCs (maybe Morganfield/Goldmont or a special Core M) foresees high performing mobile products from Intel finally. Microsoft is following in Apple's footprints. If it will be able to gain high market share from the future "Surface Phone", it will be good news for both Intel and Microsoft. That Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is working on deeply changing its mobile environment is not a secret. During the last quarter, Microsoft managed to ship only 4.5M Windows Phone units, achieving a nearly non-existent market share. The Windows mobile has various issues that affect its market performance, but most of all, the apps availability and their quality level, which is fast improving recently. At the same time, there is no "wow" factor able to drive the sales, apart from Continuum which is a very interesting feature, but still too limited due to the low availability of universal applications. However, it is clear that Microsoft is working on something new that could be able to change its destiny in the mobile market, which is the Surface Phone or something similar. MSDN document shows that a Windows 10 Mobile x86 is a "work in progress"; Daniel Rubino could affirm that Microsoft is working on a Surface Phone; Glimpsed Surface Minis and other prototype phones at Building-87; Kevin Gallo stated that Microsoft is considering making Continuum Win32 compatible (which means that it is working on it and evaluating the achievable performances); Intel is working on lower TDPs with Core M ; The Lumia team is flowing into Surface team. Just from here, it is easy to think about a new Microsoft phone generation that will be in line with the Surface lineup. In an interview on GeekWire, Chris Capossela (Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft) stated that Windows Phone needs a spiritual equivalent to the Surface lineup. "We need some sort of spiritual equivalent on the phone side that doesn't just feel like it's a phone for people who love Windows... It's got to be a phone where it's like, 'Wow, that's a real shock or that's a real breakthrough, and that's going to make me pause before I buy my 17th iPhone.' And we need time to actually go build that." First of all, the Surface Phone (or the upcoming phones that are designed by the Surface team) will be consistent with the Surface tablet design. We will likely see a magnesium or aluminum chassis, a sturdy construction and a premium craftsmanship. At the same time, the new Windows Phone will have to implement new integrated features to trigger the wow effect and make people think that the Windows Phones will not be for Windows fans only: it is already known that the Redstone update (and further minor updates) will bring various features like a contextual Cortana (a sort of Now on Tap), Microsoft Edge extensions, a highly enhanced OneCore and Continuity-like features. The enhanced OneCore may come with an enhanced Continuum, able to run X86 applications: while it is very unlikely that Continuum will be able to run x86 traditional applications out of the box, it is quite possible that it will exploit the Project Centennial bridge. This bridge will permit to adapt traditional apps Win32 - .NET - COM to the Universal Apps, putting them into a single and "simple" package: this is probably the most speedy and efficient way to adapt the traditional applications to the new platform. I am going to explain why Project Centennial is a very good project and it will be able to massively easy developers' lives, but keep in mind that the following part is quite technical, even if it is of fundamental importance to understand the mechanism. Project Centennial is a tool that permits the conversion of the Classic Windows App (CWA) to the Universal Windows App (UWA), in order to be distributed through the Windows Store. But, how does it works? The converter tool analyzes the installation file, it records what happens during the installation, what resources are installed, what modifications are performed, including directories, libraries, registry strings and so on. At the end of the operations, an AppX is generated (even with its related live tiles). Once the app is installed, the various resources are not installed throughout the entire system partition, but they are stored in the app's directory, while the OS makes the app to believe that the resources are in the expected original positions. For what regards the registry keys, the keys are not registered in the Windows registry, but into a different and separated registry file, related to the specific application, therefore, this special registry file will be read only by the specific application, but with a transparent access as if it was in the Windows Registry (without being loaded at the system startup, implying a light and speedy Windows). In addition, the CWA part will be run with full-trust isolation environment, similar to App-V 5. Substantially, these Universal Apps will be able to be completely installed and uninstalled without affecting the system files/architecture and the inherent system performance, permitting to do a lot of things that CWAs are able to do today. During the first months, developers will be able to simply maintain the CWA into a sub-package, paired to a UWA sub-package, avoiding deep code changes. In the meantime, developers could work on converting the application code in order to put the entire content into a pure UWA application, but it will take more time. To sum up the previous technical insight: The Universal App is composed of two parts: the Universal one and the Classical one; The Classical part is the traditional application that runs like in a sandbox; The traditional application resources and registry keys won't be installed in the system but they will be stored within the application directory; The transition of the Classical part into the Universal part could be done gradually while being already present on the Windows Store. The fact that millions of applications are liable of being converted into Universal Apps in a very short period of time, it enables the independent software vendors to quickly provide their applications on the Windows Store. Obviously, the "full" conversion of their applications will take a considerable period of time, but in the meantime, every Windows 10 x86 device will be able to run these applications. It is not difficult to see the entire picture: the operative system becomes a little more controlled, but more stable and performing on the long term and it becomes quite modular. At the same time, even the x86 mobile phones become eligible to run these apps. Obviously, not all the applications will be converted: for example, Windows NT Services, drivers, software that does not run at user context or operations that causes a normal user to get the UAC prompt will not be supported. Another example is the personalized licensing system: the Photoshop Elements preview for Centennial did not need any code change apart from the adoption of the Windows Store licensing system. Another important future characteristic is the Continuity-like feature: it will be possible to make phone calls, send SMS and catch up what we were doing on the smartphone without any interruption. This is practically what Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Continuity actually does: it permits to tie Windows Mobile to the desktop counterparts with a double wire, massively improving the ecosystem and the productivity and providing a tempting feature for the Windows 10 users. Some days ago, Eldar Murtazin ( ex-Nokia insider, Journalist and Blogger) wrote an interesting article , referring to some of his Microsoft insider contacts. While he has not been always right, he has made various scoops and his news are in line with what is going on. In his article, he stated that Microsoft will stop Lumia projects (as they were from the previous teams), which means that the Lumia 650 will probably be the last Lumia in history. Obviously, if an hypothetic Lumia powered by Snapdragon 820 is already at an advanced state, it could be released, but it is clear that the Lumia series is going to die. But the real deal of this article is about the SoC and development choice: according to Murtazin's sources, Microsoft is going to chose Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 SoCs in place of ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) SoCs for the upcoming Surface Phone(s), meaning that the ARM architecture would be completely excluded in the entire Microsoft lineup. This doesn't mean that the ARM architecture will not be supported, on the contrary, it is already known that Windows Mobile is going to support ARM64 architecture, therefore, the various OEMs will very likely continue to adopt the Windows Mobile ARM version for future devices. However, Microsoft would implicitly declare a preference for the x86 support and it would draw a more consistent lineup where the Surface Phone would likely be a very high-end product with the unique feature of a "full-power" Continuum. At the same time, the fact that Microsoft could choose an Intel SoC for its high-end upcoming smartphone makes me think that Intel is preparing something interesting, powerful and efficient: it may be a "special" Core M or the new Morganfield platform, powered by the new Goldmont cores. Today, top performances with synthetic benchmarks are an important product advertisement, even if it doesn't imply better usability and system fluidity or "real" better performance. In addition, synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench are quite unreliable: a top first generation Core M outscores the A9X by only 7-8% in Geekbench 3 multicore, but it outclasses it in SPEC2006 suite by 107% (average) with peaks of 538% (pure vectorization). In any case, being a top-end product, the expectations for the upcoming SoCs are quite high. We can say that Microsoft is aiming to follow the same steps of Apple, or at least something similar: High engineering (Surface 4 Pro and Lumia 950 XL are at the top for heat dissipation engineering) This is probably the right path to follow. But, even if I am confident that the future Microsoft will be very good from the hardware/engineering point of view, the software side is to be seen: the Continuum x86 compatibility with Universal Apps from Centennial will be a "wow" feature for sure, but it is to be seen when Microsoft will release such tool and how much time it will take for developers to release the various universal application versions. Anyway, the Surface Phone has high chance to gain some market share in the high-end market. If such an event will happen, Microsoft would be able to spread Windows Mobile even at the mid-end and low-end of the market through the OEMs and, at the same time, the OEMs would be pushed to reach Microsoft devices level. Think about the Surface lineup and compare it with the various 2-in-1 generation: the first 2-in-1 from the OEMs were quite underperforming and of lower quality, but the latest Skylake generations from Lenovo, HP and Dell are finally comparable to the Surface lineup. It is possible that Microsoft will focus its Surface Phone line not only on the very high-end of the market, but also on some mid/high, like the rumored 850 model. It is also possible that all the 2015 Lumia projects will be simply finalized without developing any further Lumia device. Anyway, the route for the high-end market is quite clear. If Microsoft does manage to bring on this roadmap with consistency and quickness, it may exploit a waterfall effect through the other OEMs in a catch-up run. It would be able to tie more smartphone users to its Windows Desktop environment also, increasing customer retention, productivity and relative revenues from the services. Given that the smartphone sector has always been quite soft for Microsoft, good results from this segment would consistently increase the stock valuation and related sentiment. At the same time, Intel has a lot to earn from this roadmap: it has never been able to place its SoCs into a high-end smartphone and its entire smartphone market share is quite negligible. If the future Microsoft high-end products will adopt the Intel SoCs even in the mobile sector, Intel will be able to exploit a multiplier effect since various OEMs would be tempted to adopt its x86 SoCs in order to have the x86 Continuum feature. If we also consider that Intel will move SoFIA to 14nm node and it will cover the mid-end offer, the Santa Clara company has the chance to revolutionize its mobile situation.
