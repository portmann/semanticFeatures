Acer's CloudBook Will Help Microsoft Recover From Chromebook Setbacks - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft Windows has been losing ground in the U.S. education market due to the popularity of cheap Chromebooks. Acer is the worldâ€™s biggest vendor of Chromebooks. The continuing surge in sales of Chromebooks is a thorn in Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) sales to the K-12 education market. Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) giveaways of free productivity apps, educational tools, VPN, cheap maintenance and cloud storage are greatly boosting the appeal of sub-$200 Chromebooks. The education sector has helped Chrome OS/Android tablets and computers reach 30.3% market share in the Business-To-Business (B2B) U.S. market. This is at the expense of Windows and Mac/iOS products. In spite of their limitation as cloud-centric computers, Chromebook sales posted a double-digit growth rate since 2013. Acer, one of the world's largest PC manufacturers, also is the biggest vendor of Chromebooks. Acer helped Google increase the presence of Chrome OS computers in the all-important education market . This is true not only in the U.S. but also in other countries. As per the May 2015 report from Gartner, the education market in APAC and EMEA countries accounted for more than 68% of the global sales of Chromebooks last year. The good news now for Microsoft shareholders is that Nadella was able to persuade Acer to also create the affordable CloudBook Windows 10 laptop. The $190 Acer Cloudbook is now Microsoft's equalizer against the increasing popularity of Chromebooks. Like the cloud-centric concept of the top-selling Acer Chromebook, the CloudBook is an 11.6-inch laptop with 2GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB/32GB of SSD storage. Microsoft also is as generous as Google when it comes to the CloudBook. The $190 price tag comes with a free one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal and 1 Terabyte of cloud storage. The CloudBook also has a SD card slot for easy storage expansion. Acer's cheap Windows 10 laptop is $30 more expensive than the Acer Chromebook . However, the CloudBook has twice the amount of internal storage and also uses the newer 14nm Braswell Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Celeron n3050 CPU. Intel sells the Celeron n3050 for $107 per tray so the CloudBook has a decent SoC. It should satisfy the needs of students and teachers. Unlike Chrome OS computers which rely on virtualization technology to use industry-standard Windows-only software, the Windows 10 OS of the CloudBook lets it run any customized legacy x86 programs from schools and universities. Microsoft has a vested interest to protect the dominant position of Windows in the education market. The goal now is not to let Chrome OS get too successful that enterprise buyers will notice it. This can only be done through the cooperation of PC makers like Acer. Microsoft must retain the loyalty of the world's top computer assemblers to ensure that Windows do not lose out to Google's Chrome OS in the desktop PC market. Windows already lost to Android in the mobile arena. Emboldened by the overwhelming success of its Android OS, Google's Chrome OS campaign is now encroaching on the enterprise/consumer PC territory of Microsoft Windows. Coming up with cheap cloud-centric Windows 10 laptops is an easy way to negate the only real advantage of Chromebooks. Microsoft cannot expect budget-constrained school administrators to go for the $499 Surface 3 when there are $160 Chromebooks. I do not think Microsoft wants to tarnish the luxury branding of the Surface by coming up with a $190 version of the Surface 3. The Windows 10 Acer CloudBook therefore serves as a proxy in Microsoft's fight against cheap Chromebooks. Acer sold 2 million Chromebooks last year. I expect the CloudBook to also achieve the same commercial success. Cheap Chromebooks are a threat to Windows and Nadella is addressing that menace with equally cheap Windows 10 notebooks. The danger of Chrome OS displacing Windows is a serious matter for Microsoft. The price assault against Chromebooks was already started by Microsoft last year . In spite of Nadella's mobile-first, cloud-first vision, he is not letting Google have an easy time in its attempt to penetrate the consumer desktop PC market. The generous giveaway of cheap/free Windows 10 licensing, free cloud storage and Office 365 subscriptions serve only to negate the free apps bundled with Chromebooks. Furthermore, Microsoft's minions of PC manufacturers would become discouraged if Nadella approves a $190 version of its Surface 3. The reason why no major phone vendor took Windows Phone 8.1 seriously is because of Microsoft's current bad habit of churning out sub-$100 Lumia smartphones. Nadella is not repeating the same mistake of competing against his partners in the notebook/PC industry. A non-compete promise from Microsoft should inspire PC manufacturers to increase their support for Windows 10. Aside from Acer, Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ) also is coming up with sub-$200 Windows 10 notebooks. The OEM partners are getting free rein on how low they can go to sell Windows 10 alternatives to the Chromebook. MSFT is a buy . As of September 18, the algorithmic analysis of I Know First Research also gives MSFT a favorable one-year outlook.
