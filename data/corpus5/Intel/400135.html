Asteroid Insurance For Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha contributor Sameer Advani says Intel is doomed: PCs are in decline, it's facing competition in data centers, and it failed in mobile. A recent Re/Code article offers a few glimmers of hope for Intel longs though, including the possibility of the company becoming a supplier for the next iPhone. We present a couple of ways of hedging for Intel longs who don't believe the asteroid has hit yet, but want to limit their risk over the next several months. Seeking Alpha contributor Sameer Advani painted a dark picture for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in his recent article ( Intel: A Dinosaur Headed For Extinction ): At this point, I would say Intel is a dinosaur headed to extinction. Just like the dinosaurs, extinction won't be immediate, but it could be fast. The asteroid has already struck, and the long dark winter is setting in for the PC era. Intel will go down with it. Advani noted Intel's failure so far in mobile, despite spending $10 billion developing chips for that market, and based his extinction argument on that, combined with Intel's declining PC business, and tough competition in data centers and the Internet of Things. Re/Code (the site started by former veteran Wall Street Journal tech reporters Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher) cited the $10 billion down the mobile drain as well in their tweet screen captured above, but the article their tweet linked to said Intel hadn't entirely given up on mobile. On the contrary, it said Intel may have won some business from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as an iPhone supplier, at the expense of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ): Intel isn't out of the mobile business entirely. Although it has canceled several families of chips designed to serve as the main processor for phones and tablets, the company is still pushing hard to gain share in the market for modem chips, a secondary but nonetheless important part of phones. Many believe it has even landed some share of the next iPhone, stealing business away from rival Qualcomm. Intel also says it is investing in next-generation 5G technology in hopes the shift to a new approach will give it another bite of the mobile apple. Even if Intel is a dinosaur, dinosaurs had a good 135 million year run before the asteroid hit, so where we are on the chronology is probably the more salient question for Intel investors. Sameer Advani says the asteroid has already hit. But the Re/Code article gives Intel longs some hope that the company hasn't gone extinct in mobile. For Intel shareholders looking to stay long while limiting their risk in the event of an asteroid strike over the next several months (say, news refuting the rumors about Intel getting a piece of the iPhone), we'll show a couple of ways doing that via hedging. If you'd like a refresher on hedging terms first, please see the section titled "Refresher On Hedging Terms" in our recent article on hedging Apple - Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings . We'll use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge INTC here, but you don't need the app to do that. You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to take the time and do the math. Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process in that article or use the app, an additional piece of information you'll need to supply (along with the number of shares you're looking to hedge) when scanning for optimal puts is your "threshold," which is the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 14%. If you are more risk averse, you could use a smaller threshold. And if you are less risk averse, you could use a larger one. All else equal, though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge. Here are the optimal puts as of Wednesday's close to hedge 500 shares of INTC against a greater than 14% drop by late October. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $535, or 3.58% of position value. A few points about this cost: To be conservative, the cost was based on the ask price of the put. In practice, you can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and ask). The 14% threshold includes this cost, i.e., in the worst-case scenario, your INTC position would be down 10.42%, not including the hedging cost. The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts, so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines significantly in the near term, when the puts may still have significant time value . When searching for an optimal collar, you'll need one more figure in addition to your threshold, your "cap," which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge. For example, if you're hedging over a six-month period, and you think a security won't appreciate more than 5% over that time frame, then it might make sense to use 5% as a cap. You don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that. We checked Portfolio Armor's website to get an estimate of INTC's potential return over the next several months. Every trading day, the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the U.S., and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return. One of those screens looks at price performance over the last six months, and based on that, Intel didn't pass, so the site didn't calculate a potential return for it. So, instead, we derived a potential return from the median Wall Street price target for the stock, screen captured from Yahoo Finance below. That median price target of $35.50 represents a 19% potential return over the next 12 months from Intel's May 4th closing price of $29.85, which implies a potential return of about 7% over the time frame of our hedge. So we used 7% as a cap. As of Wednesday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of INTC against a greater than 14% drop by late October, while not capping an investor's upside at less than 7% by the end of that time period. As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $415, or 2.78% of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit higher: $490, or 3.28% of position value. So, the net cost was negative, meaning an investor opening this collar would have collected an amount equal to $75, or 0.5% of position value. A few notes on this hedge: Similar to the situation with the optimal puts, to be conservative, the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls. In practice, an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so in reality, an investor would likely have collected more than $75 when opening this collar. Although the 14% threshold takes into account positive hedging cost (as we noted above), it doesn't take into account negative hedging cost. So, taking into account negative hedging cost of 0.5%, the worst-case scenario for the investor hedged with this collar would be a drawdown of 13.5%. As with the optimal puts above, this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security plummets in the near future due to the put leg's combination of intrinsic value and time value (for an example of this, see the section titled "More Protection Than Promised" in this article ). However, if the underlying security spikes in the near future, the combined time value and intrinsic value of the call leg can have the opposite effect, making it costly to exit the position early (for an extreme example of this, see the section titled "Cost of Exiting Early" in our post on hedging the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull ETF (NYSEARCA: NUGT ), Gold Miners Head To The Moon ).
