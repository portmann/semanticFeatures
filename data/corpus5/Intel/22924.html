ETF Hub Apr  6 2015, 18:36 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Compute Stick (first unveiled at CES) is just slightly larger than a USB flash drive, and can turn any monitor/TV set with an HDMI port into a PC. Newegg has begun taking pre-orders for a $150 Windows 8.1 model, and a $110 Linux model; shipments begin on April 24. Intel manages to cram a Z3735F Atom CPU (22nm, quad-core, up to 1.83GHz.), 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth radios, a USB port, and a micro USB port (for power) into the stick. The product arrives as Google and Asus get set to launch a sub-$100 Chrome OS PC stick. Historically, Intel's goal with such hardware hasn't been to sell huge volumes, but to provide proof-of-concepts that compel OEMs to launch similar hardware (while using Intel silicon, of course). Aside from the Compute Stick, Intel has also launched a new mini PC (NUC) sporting a Core i7 CPU with Iris 6100 integrated graphics; it's expected to sell for ~$500. Separately, Intel has detailed a new reporting structure that will be used in its April 14 Q1 report. Sales will be reported via 5 operating segments: A Client Computing Group (PC CPUs, mobile chips, connectivity chips); a Data Center Group (server CPUs, networking/storage processors); an Internet of Things Group (embedded CPUs); software/services (McAfee, other software, various services); and All other (flash memory, new devices, various corporate expenses). The new structure allows Intel to avoid separately breaking out the top and bottom-line performance of its mobile chip ops, by merging them with those of its (very profitable) PC CPU ops. With tablet CPU marketing subsidies weighing on results, Intel's mobile chip reporting segment posted a $4.2B 2014 op. loss; losses are expected to narrow in 2015, but not evaporate. This mean for Intel nothing, stick revenue is very very small, they compete with their own OEMs like they are doing with the NUC, and reporting structure is changing so they can hide the loses, contra revenue, in the mobile. It's meaningless technology.  Nobody who uses a computer seriously needs a funky underpowered TV-connected stick acting like a computer, and nobody who uses a computer less seriously needs a funky underpowered TV-connected stick acting like a computer either. Funky TV-connected sticks like chromecasts are useful precisely because they don't try to be general purpose computers.  Their functions are targeted and their usefulness is due to that targeting.  There's nothing special about a stick trying to act like a computer verses a small black box with a few more wires, mainly for two reasons.  (1) Consumers don't need 'optimized' TV installations which are already hardwired in that manner.  Smaller isn't better when set-top boxes are already tiny.  And (2) General purpose computers aren't useful without a good screen with relatively close-up viewing, keyboard, and mouse.  And by the time you add all that stuff in there is no longer any convenience factor associated with the stick verses a small black box. I agree with everything that you said, except the last part. There is definitely a niche for these products... and it's about 100,000 units large. It will be very useful and popular, I believe, because it means a tiniest computer with a size optional monitor. Furthermore, it is just at its beginning - it can be smaller and smaller, and more and more powerful with Intel's leading technology.
