Qualcomm May Suffer A Long And Slow Descent As Its Core Technology Loses Luster - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm license revenues have been its mainstay and largely result from its CDMA patent portfolio. Over time, CDMA will be replaced by IP solutions. Last April I wrote an article putting out the thesis that Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) faced tough sledding in 2015. At that time QCOM stock was about $70. Today it is struggling to hold the low $50's. My analysis then was that fiscal 2015 would miss estimates. I wrote then: I expect to see Qualcomm revenues for fiscal 2015 fall below $26 billion with a $1 billion sales miss taking a $0.26 per share bite out of profits. That is precisely what happened. Sales for fiscal 2015 landed at $25.3 billion and net income of $5.3 billion lagged estimates. I suggested at that time that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) were the key threats to Qualcomm, but many disagreed. Today, Samsung has emerged as a serious threat with the launch of its Exynos 8890 chip complete with a modem that rivals Qualcomm's best. Samsung is making it clear (at least in my opinion) that it will build future Galaxy flagships using its own AP's and modems. Intel is working hard to become a serious threat to Qualcomm, targeting the next generation iPhione. If Intel succeeds in that effort, Qualcomm will face another serious loss. My view is that outcome is unlikely but no one should conclude it is not possible. Intel can be formidable when the company targets a technology and an iPhone win would be a major one. CDMA (an acronym for Code Division Multiple Access) technology has been Qualcomm's bread and butter for a long time and likely will remain so for quite a while, but there are signs that in the long run CDMA will be replaced. CDMA dates back to 1930's screen actress Hedy Lamarr who was among the first inventors to conceive of the basic roots of the technology. While once considered among the world's most beautiful women, Lamarr was more than just a pretty face. The latest HTC phone offered through Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is the first non-CDMA phone to be offered on Verizon's network. I don't think it will be the last. The industry will eventually transition to an all IP solution . CDMA's sweet spot has been voice and text messaging with LTE providing data. The advent of voice over LTE has the potential to make CDMA redundant. That transition might take a decade or more given the widespread use of CDMA worldwide, but to me it seems inevitable. If it occurs, Qualcomm's technology advantage may fade away. In the meantime, companies like Mediateck, Rockchip and Spreadtrum are eating away at Qualcomm's volume base while Samsung and Intel forge ahead with competing technologies. Qualcomm's expected decline may be another classic case of living off past patents while competitors innovate and eventually surpass. I think the stock is dangerous even at today's prices and while I have no position today, I will short into any strength.
