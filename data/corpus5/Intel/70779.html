Why Krzanich's Intel Has Become Interesting - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel's possible buy of Altera is not earth shaking. Its deal with China, and willingness to listen, could be. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has long been one of the most popular stocks to boost here at Seeking Alpha. Its potential acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) has the boosters going all-out. You should buy the company after the deal. After all, it's not going to threaten the dividend . The growth story is not over. I had been bearish on Intel for some time, but my view has become far more constructive since Krzanich and President Renee James took over. The last time I focused on it, a month ago, I even recommended it for conservative portfolios. Intel's problems have laid in mobility, an insular corporate culture, and the fact that it is the only company today that both designs its own microprocessors and manufactures them. The foundry and design businesses today are very, very different. Moore's Second Law, under which chips get exponentially more expensive to produce as their complexity grows, has made chip plants ferociously expensive, to the point where there are now only three competitors. Design has moved from the general to the specific, with chips now created for specific applications, or specific products, rather than in the general way Intel has preferred to make them. As a result, Krzanich is having to buy growth, and Altera is an example of that. If the New York Post report is accurate Krzanich is willing to pay $15 billion, about 35 times earnings, for a company that had sales of $1.9 billion last year and will struggle to reach that level this time. It has attractive margins, bringing $95 million of the $435 million it brought in during the first quarter to the net income line, and it has customers in mobile markets Intel badly wants to serve. The numbers won't provide a big boost to Intel, which had sales of $55.9 billion last year, and net income of $11.7 billion, $2.31 per share, on which it paid 90 cents in dividends. What the deal mainly reflects is a new direction, Intel absorbing a design-oriented corporate culture. Of far more interest to me is last fall's $1.5 billion investment in China's Tsinghua Unigroup last fall , under which it gets 20% of companies like Spreadtrum, and a coveted spot under China's government for building that nation's own semiconductor infrastructure. Spreadtrum CEO Leo Li was profiled at EE Times this week , basically lecturing the company, saying he would pick and choose which Intel technology to use and "they can't force us" to abandon the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) designs it has used in the past. Li is more interested in Intel's foundry business, the move from 14 nanometer manufacture to 10 nm, which he will start using next year. It's an attitude which, expressed in public, which would have infuriated Andy Grove's Intel. But Krzanich takes it on, treating Spreadtrum, and China, as equal business partners. And it's this attitude that offers hope for Intel's future. Not because China knows more about making chips - it's trying to learn Intel's foundry technology, not the other way around. It's because China does know how the OEM business works, how to drive chips from the design bench into real products, and this "secret sauce" is what Intel desperately needs to power growth. That's why I continue to call Intel interesting. It's for a conservative portfolio, not one focused exclusively on growth. Why is it shorted so avidly? Because, like many other popular shorts it provides protection against sudden negative market moves, like the one that might happen today with China's own stock market tanking. It's crash insurance.
