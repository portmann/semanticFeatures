I'm Interested In Buying More Intel, But Should I Wait? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is down 20% year-to-date and around 15% in the last year. Sentiment is shaky on the stock because of several factors including falling component prices and declining PC sales. It looks to me that Intel is inline with historical metrics and, I believe, actually at the true average of its historical fundamentals. I began accumulating shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) at the beginning of the year when the yield was just under 3% and industry sentiment was still balanced. I detailed this addition in my " Young Investor's Portfolio " series where you can see that it is currently a very small percentage of my overall portfolio. After mid January though there was a decided drop in share price and sentiment based on the outlook of the industry as a whole. Intel has since dropped around 20% YTD. Though I decided to make one purchase more recently to lower my cost basis, I have now halted my accumulation and plan to reassess where I want to go with INTC. I want to better understand the situation and my strategy going forward before adding more. My initial reasons for buying Intel had much to do with dividend income and long term capital gains in a strong company. Intel generates billions of dollars in free cash flow and commands an undisputed lead in its industry while providing a decent dividend. These were just some of my reasons for beginning a position in the stock. However, I now need to reassess the situation in order to understand whether I should go all out and bring my position to an even lower cost basis while subsequently upgrading it as far as making it a core holding or continue my halt and wait to see if sentiment and outlook turn around first. Let's see if the numbers, research, and analysis of it all make a case for continuing to accumulate shares of the company. I'll start with the metrics of the company and stock to see where they fall in the current numbers game. Starting with a P/E ratio we see that Intel trades at a current ratio of 12.3. This compares to a current P/E ratio of 16.94 for Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and 18.23 for Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ). If the chip industry outlook is not looking as good as it was late last year on several accounts then it seems the market has attributed Intel the most susceptible. To me this makes sense since Intel is at the epicenter of most of this industry and market. As a direct supplier to many OEM's, many of which having a market in PC sales, these initial metrics account for the market outlook affecting Intel the most. Let's continue to compare some metrics. On a price to sales basis INTC stands at 2.47 while QCOM is 3.67 and TXN at 3.98. It seems the gap is a little larger here. On a price to book value INTC is shown at 2.47 where QCOM 2.48 and TXN at 5.00. We can see there is a varying degree of what looks to be INTC trading at a discount to these peers. I think the most interesting point would be to now look at where these companies traded compared to each other when Intel was higher in price. Let's looks at the historical numbers from the beginning of last December. On a price to sales basis INTC traded at 3.40 while QCOM traded at 4.66 and TXN at 3.64. On a price to earnings platform INTC traded at 17.44, QCOM at 15.47, TXN at 23.85. To round out our numbers we'll finally compare price to book ratio again. INTC comes in at 3.16, QCOM at 3.05, and TXN at 5.45. So what are we seeing? It seems that Texas Instruments trades at a multiple so much higher compared to the two others consistently in both industry seasons that we'll look closer at Qualcomm to get a better idea. To recap the current multiples QCOM trades at a higher valuation on a P/E basis to INTC, an even higher valuation on a price to sales basis, and on price to book its dead even. Now in the previous industry environment P/S seems to be about the same as the current margin and book value INTC had a slight premium but very minimally. The biggest difference is on earnings where INTC traded at a premium in the previous season where now it is at a discount. Overall I'm seeing that comparing Intel to peers doesn't net us too much in the way of finding a discount or being on sale, necessarily. The industry outlook has affected all of these companies. Intel seems to have taken the hardest hit to multiples because, as I said earlier, Intel is the most susceptible to this downturn so a peer comparison doesn't net us too much investment analysis ammo; it's a wash. The other angle we can look at is Intel's longer term historical averages to see if the current valuation is on par for its history or at a discount. To better summarize this I present the following charts to visualize the last several years. I used the same three metrics as before. It looks to me that Intel is inline with historical metrics and, I believe, actually at the true average of its historical fundamentals. This isn't really helping me decide if accumulation of shares would be at an undervalued point, though, in order to really load up. Let's look at some more tools. Chuck Carnevale was one of the first authors I read on Seeking Alpha when I began reading about two years ago. After reading many of his articles I became almost addicted to viewing his F.A.S.T. graphs which gave a really quick and efficient way of viewing a stock's value. It became a way of life to view the price and immediately find if it is below or above "the line." With that said I decided to use this opportunity to integrate my first F.A.S.T. graph in an article. I looked at the last 10 years of information in the graph and used it to get a historical average of its performance. If I go back too much further I get a skewed average from the dot com bubble where its P/E was extravagant. As we can see from the F.A.S.T. graph Intel is currently below its normal P/E ratio over the last 10 years as well as the Graham Dodd formula with its growth taken into consideration. This graph makes me feel like INTC is at a good point to accumulate and gives me a better idea of its history and trend line. However, this kind of analysis is only half the picture. The other half is the outlook and the company's future. I could be buying into the company at a time when its earnings are on the decline and its adaptation to future markets is not being fruitful. I am also aware that this is the debated part of the investment theory since some believe Intel is not staying current and its attempts into the future markets - such as mobile - are at a great expense. Others subscribe to the idea that Intel is a large player in today's semiconductor market and will be for years to come as it controls many of its markets. Of course the Gartner forecast revised its growth estimates downward as they didn't see the growth they expected in the second quarter. This was mainly due to weak PC sales and a strong dollar. In my opinion, though, I believe the weakness in PC sales is not a prominent as some would like to believe. According to the report, production units were down 8.7% but it also admits a strong dollar has played a role in revenue from this market. The strong dollar is something that will ebb and flow with this world economy and isn't something that is permanent. Any reversion in this metric would bode better revenue for any US based company, not just Intel, and that could boost future growth and earnings just by that change alone all other things being equal. The report continues on to say though that smartphones and solid state drives will drive semiconductor market growth. Intel seems to be on the cutting edge of this after their recent announcement of their 3D XPoint technology. If this is where the growth is and if Intel produces what it says is a breakthrough then the company and stock could be poised for a bright future. This is all well and good but I'm still not totally convinced that loading up on Intel has high conviction for me. However, there is one more point that seems enticing for me. Intel has a current dividend of $0.24 per quarter or $0.96 annually. This equates to a current dividend yield of about 3.3%. In my young investor portfolio I detailed how I had a portfolio yield of just over 3%. Adding Intel here would help my overall yield and allow me to get on the train of dividend growth. According to F.A.S.T. graph calculations INTC sports an annual dividend growth rate of 10.8% over the last 8 years. I do like that. Even if I accumulate here and have to wait out a downturn in the industry I would be getting a nice waiting incentive. Also keep in mind that I'm in this for the long haul, as in many many years, as long as nothing drastic changes in the industry or within the company itself. While I'm not a real relier on analyst opinion for topics I feel I can better research individually, I do like to see where their opinions lie in order to create a loose guideline. It seems analysts are predicting a drop in revenue and earnings for the current year compared to 2014 but they expect the drop to be short lived as 2016 estimates are for a high single digit growth over this year and a low single digit growth over 2014. Price targets vary but the average target is currently $33.61. Sentiment is clearly mixed among the analyst group but I suppose it could be much worse for the doom and gloom I hear on some of the issues. With that said, if I'm in it for a longer term investment than these short term estimates will only show me what I should be paying for the company. Otherwise, dividends and years of patience should pay off. Currently I'm leaning towards continuing to wait or wait until Intel shows a better price. However, if I become too picky in my waiting Intel could revert to its fair value multiple that we saw above. According to the tool though it shows that Intel is indeed undervalued at this time and accumulation would not be terribly risky. In Chuck Carnevale's world, this is a good value. I'm seeing it as maybe not the best value as INTC has traded much further under its average before. I could wait for that to happen again or I could start a slow and steady accumulation with some large buys as the price presents itself. Either way I write this in hopes of starting some discussion on this hot button industry and even more hotly debated company in order to understand the long term value found in the company. Its possible my decision lies more in the points of discussion than the metrics and fundamentals of the company. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC.
