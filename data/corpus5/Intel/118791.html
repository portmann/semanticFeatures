What Intel's Q2 Call Told Us About 10nm And Beyond - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Process technology challenges have pushed out 10nm production to the second half of 2017. Don't expect EUV until 7nm (at the earliest). The Q&A portion of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q2 results call was full of interesting insights into Skylake, SoFIA, and the anticipated impact Windows 10 will have on PC sales. But, I found the insights regarding Intel's future direction in regard to process technology to be the most interesting and potentially the most important from the standpoint of a long-term investor. Tick-Tock-Tock - Recently it was revealed that Intel will be inserting a third generation of products dubbed Kaby Lake (a second Tock) onto its 14nm node. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI asked if this Tick-Tock-Tock cadence will be a "temporary phenomenon" to which Brian Krzanich and Stacy Smith both said we are not sure. It depends on the maturity of materials and tools when the transition to the next node is pursued. 7nm and EUV - Which brings us to EUV. In response to a question by the same C.J. Muse, Krzanich stated that Intel is trying to bring EUV technology into the 7nm node. This actually surprised me because of the huge amount of materials and engineering obstacles that must be overcome before EUV is feasible for mass production lithography. Perhaps the uncertainty that still surrounds EUV materials and tools is the major reason there is still so much uncertainty about the possibility of another Tick-Tock-Tock at 10nm. 10nm and FinFETs - Which brings us to the transition to the 10nm node. Krzanich stated prior to the Q&A portion of the call that the first 10nm Cannonlake products would launch in the second half of 2017. Thus, he confirmed what most of us that closely follow Intel already suspected, that 10nm production has been pushed out. Importantly, Krzanich told us that this was due largely to the same challenges Intel faced at 14nm due to multiple patterning and the like, and also stated that this would not materially affect Intel's process lead relative to competitors [read Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )/GF and TSMC (NYSE: TSM )]. You may be thinking, "Of course he is going to say that." His justification for this assessment is based on his confidence that Intel's 10nm process will have more aggressive scaling then the competition's. This seems reasonable given the very different metrics Intel has been trying to achieve with each of its shrinks lately compared to others. Krzanich also stated that Intel's definition of the availability of a node is very different than the definition that others use (full production versus product sampling for example). Regardless, the push out and Perestroika regarding 10nm is good in my opinion as it suggests that the launch will happen when they say it will happen, thus injecting some much needed certainty into the minds of OEMs and investors. Remember that Krzanich previously said that Intel was going to keep specifics regarding timing of future nodes more secret so they don't enable the competition. This new openness is a big departure from this prior position. "Transistor Enhancements" - In addition to proclaiming Intel's scaling and volume production advantage over the competition at 10nm, Krzanich also hinted that Intel's 10nm node will feature certain "transistor enhancements", a tantalizingly tidbit but materially void of any details to satiate the curiosity of materials science geeks such as myself. There has been speculation of Intel adopting quantum wells, III-V semiconductor materials , and/or gate-all-around transistors at 10nm. Perhaps some of this may come true. However, during the call Krzanich specifically said in response to a question that 10nm would be Intel's third generation of FinFETs. So, the gate-all-around transistors at 10nm seems to be off the table. Unless, Brian considers gate-all-around to be just a special variety of FinFETs, which it kind of is. I guess I wouldn't be surprised if Intel tries to aggressively push out some kind of advanced transistor geometry or material as part of 10nm, especially if they hope to transition to EUV at 7nm. It seems unlikely that they would try to do some advanced geometry/material and EUV on the same node. That seems like a recipe for disaster considering the substantial challenges EUV itself entails. 3-D NAND - Finally, Stacy and Brian had a lot to say about Intel's progress in the memory arena. First off, NAND revenue is up 40% compared to last year. Second, Brian said that Intel still expects its 3-D NAND jointly developed with Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) to have a performance and cost advantage over the competition due to the architectural decisions they made (floating gates versus charge traps I presume). Krzanich said Intel expects these 3D NAND products to start ramping in the second half of this year and into next year which is very exciting. I can't wait to see how this plays out. Krzanich said the performance and cost advantages of the Micron/Intel approach should be "quite visible" in the market. In summary, it seems that Intel is executing fairly well on the process technology side of the business considering the ever increasing difficulty of pushing forward with Moore's Law. We can expect exciting new structures and materials (just maybe not at 10nm) and an increasing importance of 3-D structures in both logic and memory fabrication. I continue to be long Intel.
