Microsoft's Historic Turnabout In The Internet Of Things - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft will support an open source infrastructure for the Internet of Things in Windows 10. Apple and Google already have their own offerings in this area. A quarter century ago Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) overcame Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) early lead in PC technology with Windows, which it described as "open" because it was licensed to many OEMs, because Microsoft was very open to developers, and because Microsoft had been allied with IBM (NYSE: IBM ), making MS-DOS the pre-eminent operating system of the 1980s. (Ask your dad.) Microsoft then fought a two-decade long war over control of the desktop, first with free software, then with open source software, led by the Linux operating system. Microsoft lost that war, a fall from grace that eventually led to the removal of the company's founding generation, in the form of former CEO Steve Ballmer, and his replacement last year by Satya Nadella, an Indian immigrant who rose within Microsoft as head of its cloud unit, called Azure. Now Nadella hopes to overcome Apple's current lead in device software (devices are the new desktops) by harking back to that "open" mantra, this time with an overtly open source system called AllJoyn, from an open source group called the AllSeen Alliance. Microsoft has put support for AllJoyn into Windows 10 , its make-or-break operating system update. Microsoft is a "premier member" of the group, and the only operating system vendor in that group. The irony here is that AllSeen is a Linux Collaboration project. At the time of that launch I noted that it was missing some key players, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and General Electric (NYSE: GE ). Neither is yet a member, but there are a dozen premier members along with Microsoft, and about 150 other companies listed as "community members." These include software companies, chip companies and networking companies like CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ). Google and Apple both want to provide support for the IoT, as it is known, within their operating systems. Google has Project Brillo and ties it to Android. Apple has HomeKit . We're talking here about a market that could be worth $1.7 trillion in 2020, according to IDC , with devices, connectivity and services all expected to triple. Just about every major tech company out there, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), has a detailed Internet of Things strategy focused on their strengths. Intel is focused on chips, for instance, and Samsung on devices and appliances. The operating system, however, is the glue that binds all this together. One key to winning that game has to be security, tied identity. The underlying structure must support strong identity, it must be resistant to hacking, and it must have enough marketing oomph behind it to convince skeptical consumers on these values. It is expected that speech will be the interface for the Internet of Things, and Microsoft's Cortana is running a poor third here behind Google Voice and Apple Siri. But this is where the open source movement may be Microsoft's hole card. Because so many people will have a hand in AllSeen at minimal investment, and because no one company controls the underlying code, it is going to be ferociously attractive to companies that don't want to lose control of their future to someone else. This is basically what Microsoft did with Windows, until that proprietary operating system lost out to the more-open Linux, starting in the data center. Now it's taking that lesson on, and using it against its main rivals. This market just got interesting.
