iPad Pro: Another Reason To Sell Apple? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The iPad Pro is now for sale, and investors are wondering if it will be the exit door from collapsing iPhone sales. Analysts see Apple selling between 2M and 2.5M iPad Pros for the quarter, which would be an excellent milestone, given the price and small revenues from the Microsoft's Surface. Regardless of sales, what's important is that the iPad Pro serves as a powerful enabling device that could yield serious applications that were never possible on iPad. This would foster a strong foundation for the future of all iPads, which will allow consumers and enterprises to progressively perceive the iPad as a genuine PC replacement. The highly anticipated iPad Pro has hit Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shelves, and one big question is whether it will be the exit door from collapsing iPad sales. Analysts are expecting that just 2M to 2.5M iPad Pros will sell during the quarter, but Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben calls these estimates " too modest ", adding that the big brother tablet is Apple's most important personal computing device since the Macintosh, which does have some truth to it. Even though iPad sales fell 20% last quarter, Apple's shares still rallied to $123 post-earnings. There's no question that the iPad is losing its importance among investors, but the upside potential just can't be ignored. It's enormous and can be achieved through effective cannibalization of the PC market, and Tim Cook feels confident that iPad Pro can do just that. This makes investing in Apple quite difficult, especially when you consider a cross-section of recent Seeking Alpha analysis. Technology editor Rocco Pendola questioned Tim Cook's music approach , and contributors such as Alex Cho have downgraded their recommendations to "holds", noting of huge iPhone sales decreases to come. Even I've written that the Mac's decade-long growth streak could come to an end by as soon as the next two quarters. It is clear that Apple has become a questionable investment, but hopefully this article helps you come to a better decision with an emphasis on iPad Pro and the future of iPad. To start, I'd like to arm you with some basic facts about iPad sales, specifically when compared to the Mac and iPhone. In Apple's most recent earnings , iPad revenue fell a dramatic 20% YOY in both revenue and unit shipments. This made iPad revenue a mind-boggling 40% lower than the Mac, and 87% lower than the iPhone. For the same period a year ago, iPad was just 20% below the Mac. In the 2013 period, iPad revenue was actually 8% greater than the Mac, and was only 57% lower than the iPhone's revenue. With even this basic information, it is easy to conclude that iPad revenue isn't contracting, it's collapsing; it has hit a wall, not the "speed bump" that Tim Cook has repeatedly referred to. Although Apple's stock has rallied significantly in spite of this, investors still aren't too happy about it as it increases the risk of owning Apple. However, Tim Cook is still adamant that the iPad Pro can replace the notebook for "many, many people" and that users will "conclude that they no longer need anything else, other than their iPhone". Will we find out if Tim Cook was right in January? I've had the chance to spend some time with the iPad Pro and I find it easy to conclude that it's an excellent tablet. It's big without being too heavy. It's incredibly snappy, utilizes an excellent stylus, and features the best sound system I've ever heard in a tablet (or MacBook). The biggest con is the $800 and $950 price tags for the non-upgradable, respective 32GB and 128GB versions. I'm sure Apple is using extremely fast, high-quality storage, but most would think that a "desktop" replacement would come with a little more storage. I find that many customers will question Apple's PC replacements with such configurations. Furthermore, I believe that most individuals just aren't ready to replace their notebooks and desktops with tablet PCs yet. The Surface has been attempting to replace the notebook since 2012, and in spite of Windows 10 having the lion's share of PC users, it still only generated $672M in sales last quarter. That would be about 840,000 $800 iPad Pros, which sort of makes the 2.5M unit target set by analysts an excellent milestone to reach. What's really important about the iPad Pro In Mark Hibben's iPad Pro analysis, he wrote that the greatest factor in improving iPad sales has already arrived - iOS with multi-tasking. Although I agree that this helps, I find that it's not as important as the (most important) A9X processor, the Apple Pencil, and the larger screen of the new iPad Pro. These are three items that will work together as enablers for the future of iPad, which will over time help morph iOS into an operating system that almost anyone can trust to replace their PC. Let's look at some recent iPad Pro benchmarks that have surfaced. As Apple promised, the A9X has proven itself as almost twice as fast as the really quick iPad Air 2, but benchmarks are also adding that it's faster than the $900 Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core m3 chip in the Surface Pro 4. Even the single-core computing, the $800 iPad Pro matches the upgraded Core i5 in the $1000 Surface Pro 4. This is huge, because we're comparing the A9X, a passively-cooled tablet ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) chip to the Core i5, an actively-cooled laptop-grade processor. Because of this, going forward you will find that the Surface Pro 4 will never be able to compete with the iPad in form factor, weight, and battery life unless it can use a more efficient, fanless processor. Now, I wrote earlier that the A9X processor is the most important factor in boosting iPad sales and you may be wondering why. The quick answer is apps. PCs, for example, have generally taken a top-bottom approach when it comes to programs. Sophisticated applications would surface on the desktop, and then notebooks would simply improve until they're capable of running those apps. The iPad, on the other hand, has taken a bottom-up approach because developers have never been able to work with a powerful iPad, or a desktop with virtually no computing limit. Because of this, developers have had to work within the progression of ARM processors, but with the rapid chip improvements that Apple has made with the iPad Pro, we will begin to see a rise of "big-boy apps". This will take time, but as these complex, desirable, and important apps surface, requiring more horsepower, I think we will find that two very desirable things will happen to iPad. First, individuals will begin to genuinely accept the iPad as a true PC replacement. And second, iit will finally turn older iPads, which are still very capable today, into obsolete machines for those who desire more sophisticated uses for their iPad. With collapsing iPad sales, investors have set their eyes on the new iPad Pro. The new tablet will certainly play an important role at Apple, but not through the direct sales boost that many are hoping for. It's unlikely that it'll be a breakout product, and investors should be delighted if iPad Pro achieves analysts' 2-2.5 million unit estimates, because that means the big tablet alone would generate up to three times Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface revenue from last quarter. Regardless, what's really important is that iPad Pro acts as a springboard for the future of all iPads to come. The A9X chip, Pencil (which will come to iPad Air eventually), and bigger screen act as a whole new playground for developers. We will see a whole new selection of apps surface; not just any apps, but powerful and sophisticated programs that would otherwise be impossible for iPad. iOS developers have an excellent reputation for their creativity, and IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), among others, are collaboratively working with Apple to provide the appropriate apps that can morph iPad into the ideal tablet PC that consumers and enterprises need. Does this make Apple a buy today at the very same $112 I recommended avoiding it at several weeks ago? In my opinion, probably not. As mentioned, falling iPad sales have been ignored by investors, and should larger revenue sources such as iPhone and Mac become depressed, shares could come under pressure. I will personally hold off for now, but believe I will become an interested buyer at $105 and under. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
