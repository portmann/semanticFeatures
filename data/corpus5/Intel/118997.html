Intel: A Missed Opportunity - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Management also announced Intel's first 10nm offering won't arrive until late 2017. In this article I will first go into a bit of detail about the positives and negatives of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q2 earnings report, and I will then discuss the opportunity on which Intel missed out by delaying 10nm until late 2017. Leading up to the Q2 earnings report , Intel was receiving a lot of flak and many expected the company to underwhelm expectations. So it was a pleasant surprise for INTC longs when the company posted better-than-expected results across all fronts. Gross margin of 62.5% came in ahead of the 62% previously guided number, EPS beat by $0.05 and came in at $0.55, revenue came in at $13.2 billion beating by $160 million and the slowdowns experienced in the company's various segments were not as bad as anticipated. In addition, management guided above consensus revenue estimates for Q3 and guided a lower drop in full-year 2015 revenue than expected. Out of context that is a good thing, but there is a lot of context that has to be discussed. Before I get into the details I would like to clarify that I thought this was an overall impressive earnings report from the company, especially after how much negativity was surrounding the stock leading up to earnings. But with that said, I still think there are important negative aspects of the report that should be pointed out. Do you notice anything fishy about this table? In Q2 2015 compared to Q2 2014 revenue fell by 4.3%, gross margin fell by two percentage points, R&D and MG&A expenses increased 2%, operating income fell 23.6% and yet EPS for this quarter was exactly the same as it was for Q2 2014. At first glance this makes no sense, but the tax rate tells the story: 9.3% for the quarter. This miniscule tax rate is the result of a "one-time refund claim" and so will not be happening again. In addition to the lower tax rate, EPS numbers also benefited from $697 million spent on share buybacks during the quarter, which reduces the number of shares in the company's float, boosting earnings per share. I don't view Intel management in a negative way for the actions taken to boost EPS, but I think it's important for investors to know how the numbers got to this point. It was not due to organic growth. Another negative development was Intel's decision to cut the 2015 capex budget by another $1 billion, which is most likely what led to the delay of Intel's first 10nm offering. Which brings me to the main focus of this article. Moving on from the earnings report, Intel management's decision to delay 10nm into late 2017, compared to previously expected arrival in late 2016 or early 2017, is a mistake due to the competitive landscape that's taking shape in the 2016 CPU market. Intel has dominated Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) ever since Q1 2006, a time when both companies were neck and neck in market share. The AMD of today is but a shadow of its former self. The company has been slow to adapt to new technology and has placed itself firmly in a ditch against the force of nature that is Intel. AMD is being dominated by Intel in the CPU market, dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) in the GPU market and has recently only been successful in supplying APUs for the new generation of gaming consoles, which supplies by far the lowest margins. But 2016 may be the opportunity for which AMD has been hoping. GlobalFoundries, which fabricates AMD's products, reached an agreement with Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) to license its 14nm technology. This will allow AMD to utilize 14nm for the fabrication of its Zen CPU, which is expected to be one of AMD's first offerings in a while that will be able to compete with what Intel has to offer. Zen will likely be going head-to-head with a third addition to Intel's 14nm CPU offerings, which CEO Brian Krzanich mentioned is code named Kaby Lake. This chip will be built on the same foundations of the Skylake architecture. Then in late 2017, Intel will introduce the 10nm Cannonlake. By that point, Intel will have regained the edge, if it even loses any market share to AMD and Zen. Intel is still the market leader and will almost definitely continue to own that title with ease, but by delaying 10nm to late 2017 Intel is missing out on a great opportunity: to rid themselves of pesky AMD for good. By allowing AMD to release a competitive product in 2016, Intel is toying with fate and who knows what will happen when Zen competes with Skylake and Kaby Lake in the second half of 2016. AMD is a very financially unhealthy company and many commentators and myself agree that if AMD doesn't pull of a miracle in 2016 then the company might be doomed. By delaying 10nm, Intel is throwing AMD a lifeline and giving the company the opportunity to pull off the upset victory over Intel in 2016. It doesn't need to be a full-on coup for AMD to regain some stability and some hope. Intel should crush AMD in 2016 with a 10nm CPU, which would effectively eliminate almost all competition. AMD is not a company that could survive another year of releasing non-competitive products and Intel has missed out on a big opportunity to put its foot on the throat of its rival. It remains to be seen whether Zen will measure up to expectations and it also remains to be seen whether it can compete with Kaby Lake. But if you're Intel, this was the perfect moment to apply pressure on AMD. Why risk not doing so? Intel reported good results but missed out on a big opportunity to apply perhaps fatal pressure to AMD's business. 2016 will now be the first year in a while where AMD has an offering that can compete with Intel's products, which could potentially lead to AMD gaining market share. A 10nm offering from Intel could have wiped out AMD indefinitely, but now we'll have to wait and see how the story plays out.
