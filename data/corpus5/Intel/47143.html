Intel Inside Microsoft Halolens And Windows Phone - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft and Intel are both openly agnostic - having no preference for chip architecture or operating system and able to use all chip architectures and all operating systems. Behind the scenes reveals, through connecting the dots, that Intel and Microsoft are working closely to build on each otherâ€™s technical advances. When this behind the scenes collaboration and the resulting financial benefits become more obvious to stock market analysts, Intel's stock rise will accelerate. The primary financial benefit will come from a higher level of excitement around new technological advances in chips, peripherals, operating systems and apps. Since my focus is on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) this article is entitled "Intel Inside Microsoft." The opposite also is true, that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is inside Intel with many Intel products running on Windows. The big change over the last five years is that both Intel and Microsoft are distancing themselves from the "Wintel" label so they can more effectively market their wares to a wider audience. This agnostic outward image does not stop Intel and Microsoft from working closely together. Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, has said that he meets monthly with the CEO of Microsoft and he quickly adds that he also meets monthly with the CEO of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). In January Microsoft made a big splash with Halolens. Halolens allows for an un-tethered personal computing experience with various "windows" showing up on surfaces around your home or office. Real Sense: Development and demonstration of Real Sense technology has been touted heavily over the last year. Intel has driven the technology smaller and smaller. In early 2014 it was a standalone device. Later in 2014 it was demonstrated in laptop and then tablet forms. Most recently at IDF 15 in Shenzhen Real Sense was shown in a smaller mobile phone form. Real Sense likely has a huge role in Halolens. Compute power: Intel is always driving their computing power higher in smaller form factors. The latest leading edge is 14nm FinFET. Later this year we will likely hear more about 10nm production in 2016. Halolens needs the high performance Intel chips to drive the Halolens computing. Wireless: Intel for the last year has emphasized wireless computing. No wires for charging. No wires for docking. Halolens likely uses Intel's wireless charging and wireless connection to other computing devices. Halolens over time will grow into a huge market as the headset gets reduced down to the size of a pair of sunglasses. Electronic gadgets that start out clunky quickly are shrunk into smaller form factors. This smaller and smaller drive comes from Intel, providing further support that Microsoft Halolens has Intel inside. Intel will likely provide a unified architecture for Microsoft Halolens. The CPU, GPU and HPU are all likely made by Intel. The CPU and GPU are likely Intel designs and the HPU is most likely a collaboration between Microsoft and Intel. These three processors will shrink with Intel's 10nm technology and likely be integrated into an SOC for an even smaller form factor using less battery and producing less head heating from the heavy processing. Maybe Intel's 7nm technology will allow the creation of a "sport" version of the Halolens where the user can move around more quickly and have the processor keep up with the heavy processing needed to recalculate all of the 3D surfaces and vectors. The Windows 10 continuum will allow the Windows Phone to act as a PC with wireless connections to "dumb" laptops as well as large screens/keyboards/mouse/speakers. Again, Intel's ability to drive high performance computing smaller will be critical to the success of this concept. At Microsoft Build a mock-up was shown of this concept and the point was made that the hardware needed to accomplish using a phone as a PC does not exist right now. Intel's new processors will bring this high powered computing to the phone form factor... first with 14nm Skylake SOC processors in 2016 and then with 10nm versions in 2017. Intel's WiDi fits right in with this Windows 10 continuum concept, allowing high-speed wireless connection between the Windows Phone and another screen and peripherals. High quantity sales of Halolens and Windows Phone that can act as a PC are likely one to two years away but with huge upside potential. Microsoft Halolens and Windows Phone with Intel inside are only in the demonstration phase now and likely won't be available in significant quantity until mid to late 2016. However, with more and more announcements regarding Microsoft development of these products and Intel development of the chip technology to make these innovations possible, both Microsoft and Intel will shine as growth prospects increase. This indication of future growth and associated shine is a critical driver to the Price to Earnings ratio (PE). As noted in my previous article titled Intel Train is Leaving the Station , the Intel PE Ratio has varied from a low of 7.2 to a high of 16.8. The low occurred when analysts were focusing on the notion that the PC was dying and analysts had little appreciation for the profits that would soon arrive from the Data Center Group which now makes up 65% of Intel's earnings. The high of 16.8 was reached as sales of PCs in the fourth quarter of 2014 reached their annual peak and as analysts began to understand the magnitude of the Data Center Group growing profits. The PE Ratio has now dropped down to about 14 as the first quarter (historically lowest quarter of the year) PC sales were released. Analysts better understand that the Data Center Group profits will likely continue to increase 30% per year as DCG sales increase 18% per year Analysts better understand that the PC is not dead . . . more personal computing is now moving to new forms as Moore's Law drives processors smaller and smaller... with the next forms including the Windows Phone and Halolens with Intel inside Holding Intel earnings constant and changing the PE Ratio dramatically increases the share price. For example, with earnings per share of $2.30 and the current PE ratio of 14, the share price is $32.20. With a PE Ratio of 16.8 the share price is close to $39. With a PE ratio of 18 the share price becomes $41. If the earnings increase to $2.75 per share with increased PC sales, decreased mobile losses and continuation of Data Center Group profit increases, Intel stock price could reach $50 in 2015 with a PE Ratio of 18. These calculations provide a range that investors can consider as they make decisions regarding the purchase of Intel stock and options.
