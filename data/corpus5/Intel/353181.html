Ongoing Execution Will Be Mellanox's Best Argument Against The Bears - Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) | Seeking Alpha Ongoing beat-and-raise performance hasn't been enough to quite concerns that Intel's Omni-Path will grab significant high-end interconnect share from Mellanox, particularly once it is fully integrated with the processor. Mellanox continues to move forward with faster interconnect speeds, and 100G has climbed to over 10% of sales, while EZChip creates long-run integration/cross-selling opportunities. Mellanox seems fairly valued on the basis of 10% long-term revenue growth and 15% FCF growth, but these shares often give patient investors a second chance at a better valuation. If companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), EMC (NYSE: EMC ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are right about the growth potential in high-performance computing, high-end storage, and data centers over the next three to five years, Mellanox (NASDAQ: MLNX ) should do pretty well for itself selling its high-end Infiniband and Ethernet connectivity switches, boards, and cables. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) remains a looming risk with its integrated Omni-Path offerings, but Intel has had its issues before with overpromising what it could deliver with integration, and Mellanox has a pretty solid hold of the high end of the market. Matters with Mellanox have developed largely in line with my expectations when last I wrote , as 2015 revenue was about 4% higher than I'd modeled, and FCF was about 7% better. I wasn't overly impressed with the valuation then, and the shares did fall about 25% at the worst point, while a strong recent rally has them close to 10% above where they traded back in May. At this point, I'm still pretty ambivalent on the valuation; I can see outperformance with EZChip integration and cross-selling driving better results, as well as increased adoption of 100G Infiniband, but data center spending can be volatile, and Intel still has enough credibility to be viewed as a serious threat to Mellanox. Double-digit revenue and FCF growth assumptions support a mid-$50s fair value in my model, which isn't enough to get me excited about it as a new buy. A lot of ink is spilled on the question of whether Intel will really grab a meaningful share of the market from Mellanox through its new 100G (and beyond) Omni-Path offerings. There's been ample squabbling back and forth, with Intel claiming that it outperforms Mellanox, and Mellanox claiming that Intel has been moving the goalposts, and that its (that is, Mellanox's) offload architecture is a superior approach, given that it uses the NIC instead of the CPU to move data. How much that latter point matters remains to be seen. Mellanox management noted during its last Analyst Day that data centers use over half of their CPU capacity to move data and only 30% for app processing. One of the rebuttals to that is that multi-core processors can get around the need for offloading, but then Intel's past efforts to integrate functions have not always lived up to their promised performance advantages, and that could prove to be true here as well. It's also worth noting that Mellanox has repeatedly noted that it'll be on to 200G by the time Intel is really ready for prime time with 100G. The rebuttal here is that the demand for 200G is unlikely to develop fast enough for that to truly matter - not many customers truly need or can make such full use of 100G that they really need that kick up to 200G. To some extent, this reminds me a little bit of the Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ) versus Intel arguments, and I sometimes wonder if the two sides are really talking past each other - Cavium and Mellanox aren't targeting the mass market "everyman" markets, and Mellanox generates the lion's share of revenue from products with speeds above 40G that are well beyond the needs of most enterprises. Acquisitions are pretty common in this space; Broadcom (BRCM), Intel, and many others have been serial acquirers over the years, and have relied on R&D to supplement (and in some cases, replace) their internal R&D efforts. Mellanox certainly belongs on that list, given its M&A history - Volatire, Kotura, IPtronics, Integrity Project, and Xloon - and the company has used these deals to acquire a variety of capabilities across silicon, boards, cables, and software in both Infiniband and Ethernet. It went back to the well in a big way with the acquisition of EZChip - an $811 million cash deal that cost more than Mellanox's prior deals put together. A fabless chip company, EZChip focuses on high-performance chips for data center, cloud, and carrier network applications sold by OEMs like Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and ZTE. About three-quarters of the business is in network processing units, alternatives to the ASICs and FPGAs sold by Broadcom and Intel that offer good price/programmability trade-offs, and the rest is in multi-core CPUs and network adapters. All told, EZChip should bring valuable capabilities in security, deep packet inspection, and specialized processing (video and storage), as well as a set of addressable market verticals and customers that Mellanox hasn't done much business with in the past. Paying almost five times forward revenue, Mellanox has to make sure this deal goes well. The technology that it is getting certainly explains the company's interest, but paying its way into more head-to-head competition with the likes of Intel, Broadcom, and Cavium is not without some risks. Can Mellanox Leveraging Fast-Growing Markets? Management believes it is serving high-growth markets, and it is hard to argue given the recent run of results (seven straight quarters of double-digit yoy revenue growth, the weakest of which was up 16%). While the projected market growth rates that Mellanox offered at its October Analyst Day only go out to 2019, the prospect of 19-28% growth across switches, adapters, and optical cables is nevertheless attractive. There's a whole ecosystem predicated on strong growth in spending from/on data centers, Web 2.0, and cloud, and Mellanox needs that growth to support the story. While a $5 billion addressable market centered largely around high-performance computing has been more than enough to get the company to this point, it's going to take growth in areas like storage and cloud/Web 2.0 to help take the company further. It's also going to take ongoing high-level execution. Intel may not be the near-term threat to Mellanox that it wants to believe it is, but Intel's resources are too formidable to discount completely, and Mellanox has to stay on its toes. If Intel decides to try to establish Omni-Path by pricing it aggressively, it will only up the pressure on Mellanox to deliver a price/performance equation that makes sense for its targeted customers. That said, high performance demands should work in Mellanox's favor; given the concentration of its market in high-value, high-performance computing and the fact that interconnect is about 20% of the cost of a high-performance installation, customers may not be willing to trade/compromise critical performance for cost savings on one-fifth of the cost base. I'm looking for Mellanox to generate about 10% annualized long-term revenue growth, with near-term (5-year) growth closer to 15%. I'm also looking for it to exceed 20% FCF margins in 2018 and reach the mid-20%s, supporting long-term FCF growth of 15%. Discounted back, that supports a fair value of $56.50 today. As a "stress test", I'd note that the company's trailing revenue and FCF per share growth rates are both around 12% over the past decade. I am also expecting ROICs consistently in the mid-teens over the next few years that comfortably clear my estimated cost of equity. Timing is everything with a stock like Mellanox; back in January or February, this would have probably been a straightforward long idea. Now, it's not so simple. I like Mellanox's business, and I think the threat of Intel is overplayed, but I am not going to pretend that a long-term forecast of 15% annualized FCF growth is easily achieved. The good news is that these shares seem to routinely post 25% pullbacks that give patient investors a chance to reload. At this point, I'm more inclined to wait for one of those freakouts than chase the shares today. Disclosure: I am/we are long BRCM, EMC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
