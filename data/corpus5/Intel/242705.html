Intel Growth Is In The Clouds - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel Investor Day revealed tremendous Intel growth in the cloud (40% in 2015) and network virtualization (50% in 2015). CAGR for cloud and network virtualization expected to be greater than 20% through 2019. Overall Data Center Group CAGR expected to be 15% through 2019 with 12% CAGR for CPU sales and the remaining 3% coming from non-CPU sales. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Investor Day presentations were full of great news including a dividend increase from $0.95 to $1.04, consistently improving 14nm yields, mid single digit growth in 2016, profit improvement of ~$1B in mobile during 2015 with another $800m in 2016, and 2016 gross margin guidance at 62%. This article focuses on the Data Center Group as presented by Diane Bryant, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel's Data Center Group. Intel continues their expectation of a 15% CAGR and now extends this expectation out through 2019. This growth over the next three years includes: >20% CAGR in communications sector (2015 growth over 50%) >20% CAGR in cloud sector (2015 growth over 40%) The 15% CAGR includes 12% CAGR for CPU sales with the other 3% from non-CPU sales. Non-CPU sales growth includes: Silicon Photonics $5b TAM in 2020, only on-die integrated laser, longest reach, highest density, >20% cost advantage, first to 100gigbit. Omni Path $1.6b TAM in 2020, 10% performance advantage, 60% lower power, 20% cost advantage. Financial benefits from cloud growth include: Accelerated tech adoption (cloud providers compete with other cloud providers so each wants the fastest and best tech as soon as possible). TAM expansion (e.g., comms virtual network expansion from 5% to 75% by 2020). ASP Uplift (similar to accelerated tech adoption). In 2015 30% CAGR is from the cloud Super 7 (half of Intel's cloud server revenue) and 40% CAGR for the next 50 cloud service providers. Cloud service providers are diverse and competitive. Growth in cloud is worldwide (from 2015): First use of 14nm Xeon processors (NOW) Half of all business cloud server expansion is for new cloud business that did not exist before cloud computing. For example John Deere selling big data analytics for improving farming, Honeywell for first responder data analytics, BMW for connected cars (airbags deploy and car notifies emergency response and reports on number of passengers, location of vehicle, damage to vehicle, etc.). Most of data sent to cloud is now generated by humans. Over the next few years data from machines and things will dramatically increase the data going to the cloud for storage and analytics. For example video growth and 3D video will dramatically increase cloud computing and storage. Network virtualization for communication companies will be huge. $17 B TAM would almost double Intel DCG sales. Over the last three years communication network virtualization has grown 10 fold. Intel and Altera will grab a high percentage of this growth. Major communications companies have now allowed Intel to say that they will be moving to Intel architecture to virtualize their networks including: Also pushing network virtualization is 5G coming in 2020. Communications companies understand that they will not be able to meet the demand associated with 5G or be able to monetize the increased demand without network virtualization. Data Center Competition: ARM is currently less than half of 1% of cloud servers. ARM says they want to have 20% of the cloud market by 2020 and 45% of the network virtualization market (big communications companies have already committed to using Intel architecture). IBM Power is opening up their product to try to increase sales. Intel sees customers using ARM/Power as a negotiating tool before they buy Intel processors. The value proposition for Intel processors and non CPU products is out of reach to both ARM and IBM. Today was the first time I have seen the economics associated with the various parts of the Data Center business spelled out so clearly. As the market gains an understanding of what was said today, the shine associated with Intel stock will increase significantly. Even if PC sales continue to decline in high single digits, Intel overall will see low single digit growth in 2016. If PC sales become flat YOY Intel growth would be in the high single digits. The DCG has a huge role in this along with IoT, memory and software growth. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
