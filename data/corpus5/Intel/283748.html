Intel pushed further into the consumer/commercial drone market with its purchase of Ascending Technologies, a German drone manufacturer. This follows previous investments and partnerships in consumer drone companies, drone software and drone data analysis. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) beefed up its drone portfolio this week as it announced the acquisition of Ascending Technologies, a German manufacturer of high-end professional drones. This is the latest acquisition in a string of investments as Intel seeks to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing consumer/commercial drone market and establish itself against rivals Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). Ascending technologies is a German manufacturer of drones that Intel previously had a partnership with. As Intel does not like to create end hardware it is likely that Ascending Technologies drones will be discontinued over time and the team at Ascending Technologies brought onboard to Intel. In addition, while German drone manufacturers such as Ascending Technologies once had a great lead in developing advanced drones they have lost their edge recently to Chinese manufacturers who are able to offer drones with similar features for a fraction of the price. The team at Ascending Technologies has expertise in creating software for drones, something that will be very valuable for Intel as it seeks to develop chips for drones along with camera equipment featuring detect and avoid software. Aircraft and drone near misses rose tenfold from 10 in May 2014 to 100 in May 2015 and the trend upwards is only increasing. Very few consumer and commercial drones having detect and avoid systems that could prevent drones flying into aircraft, people, buildings or obstacles. Intel's real sense camera gives drones the ability to detect and avoid obstacles and is something that offers huge potential for Intel if they can ramp it up and gain economies of scale and a lower cost to make it more widespread. Detect and avoid on all drones would take the commercial drone market to the next level, making applications such as drone delivery and flying beyond line of sight much more feasible. In August 2015 Intel invested $60 million into Yuneec, a large maker of consumer and commercial drones along with electric aircraft. The investment gave Intel a stake in a large competitor to market leader DJI and a mass market platform to test its drone technologies on. As detailed in the Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Trends data above, interest in the company has spiked since the Intel investment was announced. At CES this week the company unveiled a consumer/commercial drone utilizing Intel's Real Sense technology, signs the investment is paying off for Intel. At $1,800 Yuneec's new drone will likely be the most affordable drone on the market that offers detect and avoid technology. Earlier, in April 2015 Intel invested an undisclosed amount in Airware, a software provider for drones. Airware combines hardware, software and the cloud to enable enterprises to operate drones at scale. It hopes to become the standard operating system for drones, and allows customers to select their vehicle and the mix and match hardware add ons and software components to create drones for different jobs. By investing in Airware Intel can work with one of the leading companies on drone automation and integrating such automation with its products. In 2014 Intel made a $10 million investment in Precision Hawk, a drone data analysis firm. Precision Hawk analyzes data post collection form drones, and is already providing drone data analysis solutions to enterprise customers in agriculture, energy, forestry, and the government. The consumer and commercial drone market is poised to take off in the coming years big time after being primarily dominated by military applications. Applications from aerial photography to drone deliveries, aerial 3D mapping and modeling, aerial photography, agriculture use, wildlife management and solar panel inspections will become more sophisticated and feasible as drone technology rapidly develops. The potential is staggering and at CES this week, Chinese drone manufacturer Ehang showed off its Ehang 184 , a drone that can comfortably carry a person. U.S FAA data now shows 181,000+ drone users registered in the USA, a big number but still only 0.056% of the population of the USA showing the potential growth for consumer drones still ahead. As drone technology advances and becomes more consumer friendly to the average person who is not familiar with how to fly a drone sales should take off. To avoid missing another revolution as Intel did when it missed the mobile revolution, Intel has been making investments across the board in the drone industry. Intel CEO was recently quoted saying "we've got drones on our roadmap that are going to truly change the world and revolutionize the industry." Source: Congressional Research Service Drone technology is still in its infancy and as a result drones are limited in the applications they can be used in. An uncertain legal framework for their use in many countries has also hindered their growth. The chart above provides an idea of a likely timeframe when we can see commercial drones performing the above tasks. With drones still largely in their infancy Intel is making wise moves for the long term and should reap the rewards as the consumer/commercial drone industry sees significant growth in the coming years. Improving drone technology will lead to safer drones and in turn may lead to more relaxed laws regarding their use. Tractica has forecasted below an increase in commercial drone sales annually from 80,000 in 2015 to over 2.6 million in 2025. With its latest investment, Intel now has a stake in a wide array of drone enterprises, from drone manufacturers to drone software with Airware and drone data analysis with Precision Hawk. Despite this, this is unlikely the end of Intel's drone ambitions and further partnerships and investments are likely in the future. Another thing many people fail to mention is that investing in drone technology will give Intel expertise in GPS, computer vision, and AI, many things that are needed in the autonomous cars. While these investments are giving Intel a solid footing in the drone industry they also position Intel to move into other autonomous vehicle applications in the future such as driverless cars.
