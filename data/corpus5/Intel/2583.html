Did Intel Just Take A Bite Out Of Qualcomm? - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha VentureBeat reports that Intel's LTE chips are rumored to be included in 2016 iPhone units in certain emerging markets. The potential deal could be a coup for Intel and its efforts to gain share in the mobile market. VentureBeat is reporting that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) XMM 7360 4G baseband modem is rumored be included in 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America: The site adds Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) engineers "have been making trips to Munich, Germany, to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone," and that Intel "has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones." Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm. The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation . If the rumors are accurate, Intel's modem chip could be taking a slot long-reserved for Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), a leader in chips for mobile devices. Analysts estimate that Qualcomm controls a 60% share for chipsets in mobile phones. Qualcomm also is known to have several chips inside the iPhone. In addition to a Cat-4 LTE baseband modem, a Qualcomm power management IC, RF transceiver, receive-only chip and an envelope-tracing IC (improves battery life) were found in the iPhone 6 Plus. Apple is loathe to rely on one vendor for any of its components, so the rumors make sense from a strategic standpoint. Still, it would be a coup for Intel which has been trying to build a presence in mobile devices. Intel has dominant market share in processors for personal computers. However, consumers are now using mobile devices to perform certain tasks that they previously used PCs for. In the previous quarter Intel's mobile division incurred a $1.1 billion operating loss as the company sold its chips at a loss in order to build market share. If Intel's XMM 7360 4G baseband modem performs well, it could result in Apple extending the potential relationship to additional products or additional regions of the world. The rumored deal may not have a big impact on Qualcomm financially at first. However, it is symbolic in that [i] as the second largest smartphone vendor, Apple is a key relationship for chip suppliers and [ii] it could be the start of Apple's attempt to wield more power over Qualcomm. Over a month ago Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) dropped Qualcomm as its supplier of snapdragon 810 processors for the Galaxy S5 smartphone, preferring to fulfill its processor needs from its in-house semiconductor unit. Apple Could Continue To Diversity Suppliers In its most recent quarter Qualcomm grew revenue 7% Y/Y to $7.1 billion. QCT ("Qualcomm CDMA Techologies") revenue of $5.2 billion was up 14% Y/Y and QTL ("Qualcomm Technology Licensing") revenue of $1.8 billion was up 4% Y/Y. QCT reflects equipment sales such as LTE chips and modems and snapdragon processors while QTL reflects licensing sales. Qualcomm shipped 270 million chip shipments during the quarter, up 27% Y/Y. However, the loss of Samsung's Galaxy S5 business and the rumored encroachment of Intel on its baseband modem business could have a negative impact on future chipset shipments. Companies from Mediatek (OTCPK: MEDT ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) are trying to increase their presence in the mobile space. There is a risk that they could entice Apple to further diversity their vendor relationships away from Qualcomm. Though chipset shipments were up 27% Y/Y, revenue from the QTC group only increased 14% Y/Y. That implies that Qualcomm's average sales price ("asp") per chipset is in decline. Chipset asp declined 10% Y/Y from $21.67 to $19.41/unit. There was a shift in OEM share from Samsung (a buyer of snapdragon processors) to Apple which buys modems. Thus, the product mix has been skewed toward more modems which have a lower asp. Apple and Samsung represented Qualcomm's two largest customers. With the loss of Samsung's processor business, Qualcomm may be willing to make more concessions in order to appease Apple. In situations where Apple is a vendor's largest customer it has been known to receive an advantaged price for components. For instance, Invensense (NYSE: INVN ) provides accelerometers for the iPhone 6. In wooing Apple away from STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ), Invensense offered Apple an advantageous price. The new business increased Invensense's top line but hurt its asp and gross margins. I would not be surprised if Apple asks for future price concessions from Qualcomm in order to maintain its supplier relationship. The rumored Intel/Apple arrangement could help jump start Intel's mobile ambitions. I have a hold rating on INTC given that the lion's share of its revenue still comes from the PC industry which is experiencing slow growth. Intel recently slashed its Q1 revenue estimate due to weaker demand for personal computers. I have a sell rating on QCOM given the loss of the Samsung business and potential for its chipset asp to decline further.
