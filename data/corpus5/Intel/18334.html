Semiconductor ETFs To Watch Should Intel Buy Altera | Seeking Alpha Mar. 31, 2015  7:39 AM ET  |  Includes: ALTR , INTC , PSI , SMH , SOXX , XSD by: Zacks Funds Wall Street is speculating that the world's largest chipmaker Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC ) is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp. (NASDAQ: ALTR ). According to sources, the deal will likely be valued at over $10 billion. The timing and terms of the deal, which might even fall apart, are not known. Intel is seeking new avenues of growth amid the weaker PC sales market, which forced a billion dollar cut in its first quarter sales outlook earlier this month. The market research firm IDC recently widened its expectation for worldwide PC shipments to decline from 3.3% to 4.9% for this year. Further, the rising demand for low-priced chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry (read: Intel Sales Warning Puts Semiconductor ETFs in Focus ). The acquisition of Altera would open up opportunities for Intel in the programmable computer chip market used in cellular networks, cars, wireless radios and other products. Since about two thirds of Altera's revenues come from the telecom, wireless, and military/aerospace industry, this will help Intel to diversify its revenue stream beyond legacy computer markets. With this, Intel could expand into a number of markets like automotive, industrial and communications while bolstering its presence in data centers as well. The in-focus deal, if announced, would be the largest acquisition in Intel's history and among the biggest in the technology industry in recent years. The latest M&A deals announced in the space are NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ), which agreed to merge with the smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE: FSL ), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), which is set to acquire Wi-Fi gear maker Aruba Networks (NASDAQ: ARUN ). Shares of ALTR soared as much as 30% following the news to a four-year high of $45.00. The stock also crushed its average volume figures, as about 14.2 million shares moved hands compared to just 3.1 million on average. Meanwhile, Intel surged as much as 9.7% on elevated volume of more than two times the daily average volume (see: all the Technology ETFs here ). The M&A deal has put the semiconductor corner of the broad technology ETFs in focus over the coming days. Investors seeking to ride out this surging trend in a diversified way could consider the following ETFs. Any of these funds could make for a compelling choice given their Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or 'Strong Buy' rating, suggesting their continued outperformance.
