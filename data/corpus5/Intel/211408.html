Lenovo Sees Microsoft As A Rival - Lenovo Group Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 21, 2015  1:25 PM ET  |  About: Lenovo Group Ltd. ADR (LNVGY) , Includes: AAPL , HPQ , INTC , MSFT by: Alcaraz Research Lenovo declined Microsoftâ€™s request that it resell the Surface Pro. Microsoftâ€™s move to sell high-end laptops makes it a rival of Lenovo. Lenovo released its flagship Yoga 900 Windows 10 laptop and Yoga 900 Home tabletop/all-in-one desktop computer. Unlike Dell and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ) declned a request last year from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that it resell the popular Surface Pro 3. Gianfranco Lanci, President of Lenovo, told The Register that he rejected Microsoft's offer because his company will never be a reseller of a rival's product. Lenovo, the world's largest PC vendor, apparently now sees Microsoft's ambitious plan to become a high-end PC vendor as something to be wary of. While Lenovo is a major backer of the Windows PC platform, I think Lanci believes the commercial success of the Surface Pro 3 (1.5 million units sold in Q1 2015 according to Canalys) is a threat to its core PC business. According to Gartner, the PC business again declined by 7.7% during the Q3 2015 period. Lenovo obviously doesn't want to help Microsoft to grow and become another rival in the already-shrinking PC market. Except for Dell and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), all other top PC vendors suffered a decline in PC shipments during in Q3 of this year. Lenovo shipped 4% fewer PC products in Q3 2015 compared to what it shipped out in Q3 2014. I opine that Lenovo might be wary that Microsoft's first taste of success with the Surface Pro 3 could eventually lead that software giant to expand its PC portfolio to include desktop computers. Microsoft's first-ever high-end laptop, the Surface Book, already is getting impressive pre-order purchases. Aside from targeting only the high-end sector, Microsoft also released the $499 Surface 3 earlier this year. This sub-$500 price segment is where most Lenovo-made laptops are being sold. Lenovo knows all too well that there's really nothing stopping Microsoft from branching out to sub-$500 desktop computers. Instead of helping an emerging rival like Microsoft market the Surface Pro 3 , Lenovo unveiled yesterday its own flagship Windows 10 laptop, the Yoga 900. The Lenovo Yoga 900 is an alternative to the $1,499 - $2,699 Surface Book. It also features the latest Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) sixth Generation Core Skylake processors. Like the Surface Book, the Yoga 900 is a convertible notebook/tablet computer. It's the much-improved successor, the $949 Yoga Pro 3 . The four form factor (notebook, stand, tent, tablet modes) of the Yoga Pro 3 is retained but Lenovo did away with the Broadwell Core M processor and replaced it with the more powerful sixth Gen Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors. Lenovo also improved the watchband hinge to make the 360-degree functionality of the Yoga 900 provide smoother transition to its different form usage. Lenovo also bumped up the maximum RAM of the Yoga 900 to 16GB, improved the battery life and gave it JBL Speakers and Dolby Audio Premium features. This clearly makes it a real portable workstation for creative professionals involved in video/audio editing. The chart below reveals the Yoga 900 targets both the market segments of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Lenovo wants enterprise users and design professionals to consider the Yoga 900 as an alternative to Microsoft's convertible laptops. The chart above also reveals the new $1,549 Yoga Home 900 . It's Lenovo's latest 27-inch tabletop/all-in-one desktop computer. Microsoft has not yet released its tabletop computer, the PixelSense . The Yoga Home 900 is a touchscreen all-in-one computer that is akin to the iMac that also functions as a tabletop computer for collaborative use when it's laid down on a table. As you can see from the screen below, the Yoga Home 900 is a 16.75-pound portable computer that also can be used outdoors as a giant tablet PC. Lenovo has been a proponent of the tabletop PC for productivity purposes. The older 27-inch Lenovo Horizon AIO computer is popular among DJs and live performance dance music maestros. Microsoft might eventually release its own PixelSense tabletop computer/giant tablet for the enterprise/creative markets. Again, Lenovo will reject any future request to resell this Microsoft tabletop because the Chinese firm already has a competing product. Lenovo did right in rejecting the request of Microsoft. As a leader in PC sales, Lenovo cannot feed the ambitious plan of Microsoft to be more like Apple. On the contrary, Lenovo has greater benefits if it sells cheaper versions of Microsoft's high-end computer products. Not only will Lenovo slow down the growth of Microsoft as a PC vendor, Lenovo might even win the loyalty of some customers who cannot afford the Surface Book. The most expensive version of the Yoga 900 is only $1,499, which already touts the Core i7 Skylake processor, 16GB RAM and 512 GB solid-state drive flash storage. The basic $1,499 Surface Book ( already sold out ) only has Core i5 Skylake, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage. Sad but true, Microsoft doesn't have its own factories to assemble the very in-demand Surface Book. Fortunately, Lenovo has the production capacity to churn out millions of units of the Yoga 900. A customer who becomes aware of the cheaper Yoga 900 will likely buy it instead of the out-of-stock Surface Book. Furthermore, I do not think Lenovo will pre-install any third-party apps on high-end computers like the Yoga 900 and Yoga Home 900. The Superfish scandal was only due to Lenovo's need to improve its margins on cheap computers. Enterprise customers therefore will not be wary of buying these latest high-end computers from Lenovo. LNVGY is worth a buy-in right now. Lenovo is headed in the right direction in focusing more on higher-margin computers. It doesn't really matter if Lenovo loses its top vendor status by selling less cheap computers and more units of mid-range and high-end PCs like the Yoga 900. My point is that any computer vendor is in a losing proposition if it insists on catering mostly to lower-income customers. Lenovo has the technology, resources and engineers to come up with high-quality premium PC products that could win big in the lucrative enterprise and creative industry markets. If a newbie PC vendor like Microsoft is aiming to steal the customers of Macs, a seasoned OEM like Lenovo also should be daring enough to target the highly-profitable niche market for pricey laptops and desktop computers.
