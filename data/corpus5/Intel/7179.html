Intel Inside The World's Possibly Most Powerful Android Phone - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Asus has released its new flagship ZenFone 2 Android phone. It’s cheaper than Xiaomi’s Mi4. In spite of its 4GB of RAM, premium build, and superior camera technology, the ZenFone 2 retails for less than $300. The high AnTuTu benchmark score of the ZenFone 2 confirms Intel's older x86 Atom mobile processors are as good as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 series. This is an update to my previous article discussing the merits of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) winning the right to supply its 64-bit Atom Z3580 inside the ZenFone 2 from ASUSTek ( OTC:ASUUY ). Asus has launched the ZenFone 2 in Taiwan and the most expensive version only retails for NT$8,990 (around $284.96). The cheapest model of the ZenFone 2 (the ZE550CL , which only has 2GB of RAM and 1.6 GHz quad-core Atom CPU) sells for NT$4,990 ($159.17). I reiterate my position that Asus is the most prolific vendor of Intel-powered smartphones. The success of the ZenFone 2 is a barometer of Intel's future sales of smartphone-centric processors. Asus sold more than 8 million Intel-powered smartphones in 2014. The ZenFone 2 could be another tailwind that could help Intel catch up with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). ASUSTek's smartphone sales in Taiwan last year was already outperforming that of HTC ( OTC:HTCXF ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). It will only take a matter of time before Asus-branded Android phones also conquer other parts of Asia. In my country, the Philippines, the Asus ZenFone 5 Lite is very popular due to its low price tag and great performance. I myself own an Asus FonePad 7 phablet (which cost me just $204) that is far better than my Galaxy S3. The lower than Xiaomi flagship phones price tag of the ZenFone 2 will definitely help ASUSTek achieve its 16 million sales target for smartphones this year. Asus, with the help of Intel, might just be the next Xiaomi. Since Samsung does not sell sub-$350 premium Android phones, Xiaomi and Asus will be fighting over this price point. Tech-savvy people will find the $284.96 price tag of the new ZenFone 2 as the better deal than Xiaomi's Mi4, which was launched today in India for 22,150 Rupees ($353.30). Below is the tech specs sheet of the top of the line ZenFone 2 ZE551ML Android 5.0 phone. Compare it to the tech specs sheet of the Xiaomi Mi4. The more expensive Qualcomm-powered Mi4 only has 3GB of RAM, a smaller 5-inch screen, old Adreno 330 GPU, and a 32-bit Snapdragon 801 processor. Asus does not use Xiaomi's hunger-marketing tactic. However, the obvious hardware superiority of the ZenFone 2 compels me to believe that the Asus phone will be tough rival of the Xiaomi Mi4. Another strong selling point of the ZenFone 2 is that it's the first smartphone to wield 4GB of RAM. Not even Samsung's current and upcoming high-end phones comes with 4GB of RAM. Xiaomi's latest Mi Note 4 also remains stuck at 3GB of RAM. As a video and photo editor, I know the importance of having a lot of RAM when editing or multi-tasking. The ZenFone 2 now has the same amount of RAM of my photo-editing Acer laptop. Anybody who has used Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop or Autodesk's (NASDAQ: ADSK ) AutoCAD software can tell you that adding more RAM modules is the only way to work faster. Asus's decision to put in 4GB inside the ZenFone 2 makes it more desirable than a Xiaomi Mi4. Multi-tab web browsing on a mobile phone is faster when there's more RAM. Gaming is better when there is more RAM. The Android OS has so many background processes running which slows down phones. However, using software-based RAM boosters or background task killer apps is allegedly bad for Android phones. Asus therefore made the right decision to just add more RAM. The ZenFone 2 is safe from the danger of task killing apps. Intel's 64-bit quad-core 2.3 GHz Atom 3560 processor also helped the ZenFone 2 post an amazing record-setting AnTuTu benchmark score. Take note that the 50,401 AnTuTu score was achieved by a ZenFone 2 model that only has 2GB of RAM. The Intel-equipped ZenFone 2 managed to outscore all those high-end Qualcomm-powered Android phones from Samsung, Xiaomi, and HTC. I look forward to an even higher score once a 4GB RAM-equipped ZenFone 2 gets tested. The chart above should be prima facie evidence that Intel's 22-nanometer x86 mobile processors are as good as any ARM-based processor from Qualcomm, Samsung, or MediaTek. The new 14-nanometer Atom X5 or X7 processors would likely post the same impressive benchmark scores. Unfortunately, winning the support of more OEMs is not only based on benchmark scores and hardware specs. Intel already has a great ally in ASUSTek. I firmly believe that the ZenFone 2's cheap price tag and industry-leading hardware specs will find widespread acceptance in emerging markets. However, Xiaomi sold 61 million phones last year - none of them used Intel processors. Taiwan-based Asus is only aiming to sell 16 million Intel-powered smartphones in 2015. It would be much better if Intel also wins the backing of Xiaomi - because that Chinese company wants to sell 100 million phones this year. Xiaomi's brand power is definitely stronger than ASUSTek's. Intel's ally, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), has allegedly already managed to recruit Xiaomi to the Windows 10 platform. Intel also needs to persuade Xiaomi to abandon its exclusive dependence on Qualcomm Snapdragons (for its higher-end phones). I know Qualcomm and Microsoft have a strong bond in previous Windows smartphone releases. However, Intel's x86 architecture has proven itself to be the perfect fit for Windows operating systems since the 1990s. If Xiaomi really pushes through with a Windows 10 smartphone and/or tablet, Intel will greatly benefit if it puts an Atom X3 or X5 inside them. Since Samsung is still ignoring Atom smartphone processors, Xiaomi is the best candidate to mass market Intel-powered Android phones. A little contra revenue to encourage Xiaomi to use Intel processors is justified. Xiaomi is a very ambitious company that managed to beat Samsung , Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), and Huawei in China. Xiaomi, now the world's fifth-biggest smartphone vendor, could really accelerate adoption of Intel x86 mobile chips. Intel's mobile processors will get sold more often if they are inside Xiaomi-branded (compared to Asus-branded) phones and tablets. Furthermore, Asus and Xiaomi could also be great clients for Intel LTE modems like the XMM 7360 and RealSense SnapShot cameras. The future is bright for Intel. It is capable of producing low-power mobile processors that also deliver industry-leading performance benchmark scores. One more reason to go long on Intel is that Microsoft already made an official announcement that Windows 10 will be released to 190 countries by summer of 2015. Consequently, the weakened PC market could change for the better in the second half of 2015. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
