Apple : The Road To An ARMv8-A Based Product Stack And Higher Growth - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple‘s custom ARMv8-A cores are incredibly powerful and comparable to Intel’s big cores like Haswell and Skylake. Apple has a world class chip design team through its acquisition of P.A. Semi and Intrinsity. Apple is capable of scaling their custom ARMv8 core design to replace the Intel chips which power their Macs, thus unifying all their products under a single Instruction Set Architecture. Apple could add custom hardware and accelerators to Mac chips and exploit them very well within the operating system and software applications to improve product differentiation and market share. Apple’s profit margins would increase significantly if it were to use its own designed chips rather than Intel designed chips. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has impressed everyone with its efforts in the past few years with the design of high performance CPU micro-architectures. Apple used ARM designed cores until the A5 System-On-Chip (SoC) used in the iPhone 4S and iPad 2. Apple started designing custom CPU cores based on the ARM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with the Swift core in the A6 and A6X SoC which powers the iPhone 5 and iPad 4th generation, respectively. Swift was based on the 32 bit ARMv7-A architecture. The turning point in Apple's CPU design efforts was the Cyclone CPU core based on the 64 bit ARMv8-A architecture. Apple was the first to market with a true 64 bit ARMv8-A core, well before even ARM's own Cortex A57 core launched. Apple's competitors like Samsung and Qualcomm have still not launched SoCs based on 64 bit custom ARMv8-A cores even two years after the A7 SoC launched with the iPhone 5S. Apple's Cyclone and successors are formidable CPU cores and the first mobile CPU cores to be considered desktop class . The term desktop class means the CPU core is capable of high Instructions per Clock ( IPC ) required for running productivity and content creation applications. In particular the term desktop class is a direct comparison with Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) big cores like Haswell and Skylake which are used in a range of products from tablets to notebooks, desktops, workstations and servers. In fact to quote Anand Lal Shimpi of Anandtech - "Cyclone is a bold move by Apple, but not one that is without its challenges. I still find that there are almost no applications on iOS that really take advantage of the CPU power underneath the hood. More than anything Apple needs first-party software that really demonstrates what's possible." The Cyclone core was a very forward-looking design which hinted that Apple wanted their A series SoCs to be used for productivity and content creation rather than just content consumption. We can now see with the launch of the iPad Pro that the reason for designing such high performance CPU cores was to broaden the market for the A series SoCs. The iPad Pro will go after the same market segment as the Core M based tablets and 2-in-1s and this contest should be an interesting one. Apple's partnership with IBM will help in this contest against the Intel-Microsoft duopoly in enterprise moblility devices and applications. Apple was able to achieve their success in custom CPU design by building a world class chip design team through well targeted acquisitions in the field of semiconductor design. Apple acquired P.A. Semi in April 2008. P.A. Semi had world class engineers who had worked on various architectures like DEC Alpha, AMD Opteron, Sun UltraSPARC and Intel Itanium. Apple acquired Intrinsity in April 2010. Apple has embarked on this journey with a long-term strategy of being able to differentiate their products from the competition. Apple's high performance custom CPU cores are a result of that strategy. Apple also acquired a company named PrimeSense in November 2013 which provided products in the area of sensory inputs for consumer and commercial markets. Apple's 3D Touch seems to be a good use of the technology acquired by Apple. We clearly see Apple leveraging its unique advantage as the designer of both the hardware and software of their mobile devices to bring significant product differentiation. Apple is very well capable of improving their custom ARMv8 core to scale to high frequency and address the high performance needs of the Mac lineup. Apple also can uniquely add custom hardware and accelerators to its Mac chips which would give it a competitive advantage and improved product differentiation. The Mac product lineup is growing both in units and revenue y-o-y in a shrinking PC market. This means Apple Macs are gaining share against Windows PCs, even though the current Mac share of the PC market is still very small at 7.8% . There is a huge opportunity to leverage the advantage of being able to provide the hardware and software and improve the product differentiation and market share of the Macs. Apple also can add more CPU cores and provide more performance than would be available to them if they purchased standard Intel Core i5/i7 and Xeon CPUs. Apple could ship the iMacs and MacBook Pros with a 6 core CPU with added support for Simultaneous Multithreading (NASDAQ: SMT ) and provide 6 cores and 12 threads compared to the four cores and eight threads available on Intel Core i7 chips used in the same devices. Similarly the Mac Pro could be designed with 16 cores ands 32 threads instead of the current Xeons chips used which sport eight cores and 16 threads. Intel is more focused on protecting its high gross margins and is unlikely to provide more cores at the same price points. Intel has been conditioned by a complete lack of competition in the high-end PC and server market due to AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) failures and has no interest in providing significantly more cores/performance for the same prices. Apple's manufacturing costs would still be much lower even with larger die sizes as Apple pays much lower prices for processed semiconductor wafers from a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) compared to finished CPUs from Intel. The A8X chip with a die size of 128 sq mm costs USD $22 per chip according to cost estimates from IHS. The A9X die size and cost are not yet known accurately but the A9X is guaranteed to be much cheaper to manufacture than the Skylake Core m7 6Y75 which has a die size of 98 sq mm and a cost of USD $393 per chip. Apple might get lower volume pricing from Intel than publicly published prices but still it's going to be much more than the cost of a chip manufactured at a foundry. We also can extrapolate from the initial Geekbench 3 scores of A9 and Core m7 6Y75 that the A9X chip with three true cores is expected to have similar single core performance and better multi-core performance than the Skylake Core m7 6Y75 (2 cores/4 threads) on the Geekbench 3 test suite. We will see a wider range of CPU performance comparison benchmarks once the iPad Pro is launched and is compared with Core m7 6Y75-based tablets. The ability to design custom silicon is a major advantage that Apple should exploit to further differentiate Macs, broaden their appeal and improve sales. Apple could add accelerators in their chips to further improve performance for certain types of workloads. The flexibility of being able to add custom silicon would directly translate to much better performance in the targeted workloads. This will help in improving the Macs' competitive positioning against Windows-based PCs. Apple could also charge higher selling prices as it leverages the improved product positioning. This would directly translate to better profits, earnings per share and improved share price value. The key enabler of this transition to an ARMv8-A based product stack is the rapid growth of the foundry manufacturers like TSMC and the pace at which they are closing the process node gap with Intel. Apple can use the intense competition among foundries and Intel's foundry aspirations to their benefit. Apple can chose the best process node available from Intel, TSMC and Samsung based on transistor performance, yields, supply volume and pricing. Intel could still benefit if it aggressively pursues Apple as a foundry customer. Apple is the leading consumer of silicon on bleeding edge process nodes and would be a huge win for any foundry or Intel. The last piece of the puzzle is the software ecosystem. Apple can very well handle porting of the Mac operating system and first party applications from x86 to ARMv8-A. The key challenge is the support from third-party developers. We have seen that software ecosystem support for Apple's custom ARMv8-A cores has started improving with Microsoft releasing Office for iPad and Adobe releasing their creative tools for iPad Pro. Apple still has its work cut out and needs to engage with the software ecosystem and get them to port their x86 desktop and workstation applications to ARMv8-A. The task is challenging but Apple can pull it off. Apple has shown they are capable of changing ISA when they moved from IBM PowerPC to Intel x86. In conclusion Apple is well on its way to an ARMv8-A based product stack unifying all its products under a single ISA. Apple has always prided itself on being able to closely integrate well-designed hardware and software where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The move to an ARMv8-A based product stack is a logical extension of that philosophy. Apple's profit margins will increase and there is good potential for higher market share growth for Macs. This also would lead to many more years of sustained growth in revenues and share price growth for the investor. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
