Should I Buy AMD? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Troubled semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) surged 52% on Friday, April 22 to close at $3.99 a share after its big earning surprise on April 21 after the close. I was tempted to buy the shares considering that they were still 57% below their high of $9.21 just five years ago (131% upside) and were far below their 2006 high of $41.80. Plus, AMD is the second-largest maker of personal computer microprocessors after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), which told me the company would likely not die anytime soon. But with a quick look at the data from Finviz, I decided to wait. The average analysts' price target was $2.31, and the technical graph showed resistance about $3.70. Further, the lack of P/E ratios, PEG ratios, and estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth for the next five years raised red flags. The price did fall to an intraday low of $3.33 on Monday and stayed within a range of $3.48 and $3.74 for about 17 days. During that 17-day period, investors seemed to think the stock should not fall below $3.48 but was worth more than $3.74. In stock jargon, this looked like a consolidation phase . "Lengthy periods of consolidation are often known as a base." Finally, on May 16, the stock broke out and surged 22.9% over 10 days. Using the same logic as above, it seems that the stock could fall to about $4.30, the resistance shown in the graph below. The average analysts' price target was raised to $3.41, but this number also indicates the price could fall. Institutional ownership fell from 61.40% to 58.90%, which means that some institutions sold their stakes in the company and probably think the stock will fall. The quarter-over-quarter EPS growth slowed from 72.50% to 40.70%. The graph below also says the stock will fall, but the rounded bottom technical pattern says that the stock will fall to about $4.50 instead of $4.30. The target price is "the distance between the base of the curve and the rim" projected over the top of the rounded bottom (cup). The MFI (Money Flow Index) is 91.10. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is 78.54. The Stochastic %K is 91.70. And the W%R is -2.78. All of these are overbought, which means the stock has a high probability of falling. And the last time the MFI, RSI, Stochastic %K, and W%R were at similar levels, the price fell. On the plus side, the EPS growth estimate for next year was raised from 38.20% to 59.30%. Short float also fell from 13.97% to 11.54%, meaning some short sellers are covering and probably think the shares will rise. While AMD may fall in the short term, is the stock a good long-term investment? As mentioned in the beginning, that high of $9.21 just five years ago looks to be close to the long-term average, as shown in the stock's long-term graph shown below. So we could say the stock may rise back up to its long-term average of $9.21. Based in Sunnyvale, California, the $3.65 billion global semiconductor manufacturer was founded in 1968 and became the only significant rival to Intel in the market for x86-based microprocessors. The x86 line of microprocessors are central processing units (CPUs), such as the Pentium series made by Intel. CPUs are the heart of every computing device, and basically process the instructions of computer programs. The x86 line provided a framework of how processors should carry out those instructions. In 1978, Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor, which became the industry standard . The founders of both AMD and Intel left Fairchild Semiconductor (NASDAQ: FSC ) in the 1960s to form their own semiconductor companies. Intel created the first microprocessor in 1971, beating AMD. "When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode." Due to pressure from IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) PC business, Intel entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement with AMD starting in 1982 where "each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer for semiconductor products developed by the other." Starting in 1991, AMD introduced its own CPU chip and began to compete directly with Intel. After spinning off its flash business to raise cash, AMD acquired ATI Technologies in 2006 for $4.3 billion in cash and 58 million shares of stock, or approximately $5.4 billion. "Since acquiring ATI in 2006, AMD and its competitor Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) have dominated the discrete graphics processor unit (GPU) market." Over the years, AMD had lost market share to competitors Intel and Nvidia in the CPU market and the discrete graphic processing units (GPU) market. As of the second quarter 2015 , Nvidia claimed over 80% of the worldwide GPU market, while AMD's market share fell to 18%. As of the first quarter 2016 , Intel claimed about 80% of the worldwide CPU market, while AMD's market share fell to about 20%. The hope is that as the company launches new products, it can regain lost market share. Further, it plans "to monetize its patent portfolio in return for a royalty fee." On April 21, the company surged after it reported first quarter results that beat on earnings and revenue. For the quarter ending March 31, EPS was -$0.12 on $832.0 million in revenue, compared to EPS of -$0.09 on $1.030 billion in revenue a year ago. Analysts had expected EPS of -$0.13 on $818.2 million in revenue. Thus, despite beating analysts' estimates, EPS loss widened by 33.3% year over year, and revenue fell 19.2% over the same period. Falling revenue and a widening EPS loss does not seem to be good news in my opinion. But the company also mentioned that it signed a $293 million licensing agreement with a Chinese investment group "to develop System-on-Chip (SoCs) tailored to the Chinese server market." The company also said its gross margins rose 2% to 32% from the previous quarter, "due primarily to a richer product mix and the mix of revenue between business segments." Despite a 2% decrease in revenue quarter over quarter and a 14% decrease in revenue year over year, the company's computing and graphics segment's operating loss fell from $99 million in the fourth quarter to $70 million in the first quarter. This was also less than the operating loss of $75 million a year ago, primarily due to lower operating expenses. This tells me that the company is strengthening its product line and decreasing their operating expenses, which could lead to higher revenues and eventually profitability. The company also expects $1.5 billion in future revenue for three new gaming processors "over the next three or four years." But the three SoC drivers of this future revenue are not developed yet. At least one is scheduled to be in production by the second half of this year, with all of those SoCs launching by 2017. One of these SoCs is rumored to be in the new Sony (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation 4. AMD dominates graphics chips for the next-generation gaming consoles , providing chips for Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and Nintendo's Wii U. Over the next few years, virtual reality (VR) is expected to boost demand for graphics chips, which could be a huge catalyst to AMD. The company is positioning itself to take a leadership role. Its VR platform Radeonâ„¢ Pro Duo GPU was selected by 20th Century Fox, New Regency, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, and VR development studio Practical Magic "to bring the upcoming ASSASSIN'S CREED movie VR experience to life." The company's collaboration with the Associated Press to create a VR experience channel for the next-generation of journalism could provide an additional steam of revenue. Computing Solutions: Primarily includes x86 microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and dense servers Graphics and Visual Solutions: Primarily includes graphics processing units (GPUs), semicustom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, and technology for game consoles After July 1, 2014, the company realigned its organizational structure and started reporting under two new segments: Computing and Graphics: Primarily includes desktop and notebook processors, chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics. Five customers accounted for approximately 53% of the net revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment: Primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services, and technology for game consoles. Five customers, including Sony and Microsoft, accounted for approximately 95% of the net revenue. The company gave a semi-rosy forecast. For the second quarter, it forecasts revenue to rise 12%-18% from the first quarter to $931.84-$981.76 million. The company did not give an EPS forecast. Analysts are expecting EPS of -$0.09 on $950.28 million in revenue. The midpoint of the company's revenue forecast is $956.8 million, which is slightly above analysts' revenue estimates. For full year fiscal 2015, the company had EPS of $7.02 on $7.86 billion in revenue, compared to EPS of $5.11 on $5.39 billion in revenue a year ago. For full year fiscal 2016, analysts are expecting EPS of -$0.28 on $4.02 billion in revenue. As can be seen in the revenue and expenses graph above, revenue reached a trough in the first quarter of 2013 (3/13) and the second quarter of 2015 (6/15). Thus, it is probably true that revenue will trough in the first quarter of 2016 (3/16) as analysts estimate. Also notice that the gap between total expenses and revenue is decreasing. Thus, the company could see a profit in the near future. From the year-over-year graph, it can be estimated that the company would either see a continued fall in revenue or a reversal higher. It is also encouraging to see that the computing and graphics segment has finally started to see increasing revenue after being in decline since 2013.
