Why Apple Won't Sell Touchscreen Mac Computers - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple can easily build and sell touchscreen-equipped Mac OS computers. Apple will allegedly put an OLED touch bar on new MacBooks. A touchscreen-equipped, convertible MacBook from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will quickly diminish the popularity of the Surface Pro. However, Tim Cook is smarter than me . Apple doesn't want a touchscreen-equipped Mac because it still likes the money from iPad sales. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the $99 Apple Pencil are very popular companion devices for Mac loyalists. The iPad Pro and its expensive accessories are helping the iPad brand remain a multi-billion business. Selling a $1,500 touch-enabled MacBook will render the iPad Pro redundant. Protecting and developing the iPad Pro business is very important to Apple's future. Analysts like Michael Blair are skeptical that the iPhone 7 can reverse the "slumping" sales of iPhones. My retort is that increased sales of the iPad Pro (and Apple Pencil) could make up for any dips in iPhone sales. Yes, the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro is outselling the iPad Pro in U.K.'s enterprise market, 275k Surface Pro units sold vs. 107k for the iPad Pro. However, the iPad Pro is geared more toward creative industry professionals, rather than to Excel or PowerPoint wizards. Artist or professional designers are likely the reason why the iPad Pro outsold the Surface Pro during the holiday 2015 season. Creative professionals need the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro to speed up their Mac-based workflow. Getting on the good side of the creative industry definitely helps Apple's sell more iPad Pros, while also keeping the Mac business healthy. Protecting The iPad Business Is Worthwhile On a long-term basis, a touchscreen-equipped MacBook will outsell the Surface Pro. However, there is the risk of it also seriously affecting the high-end iPad business of Apple. Compelling Mac users to buy $499 iPad Pros and $99 Apple Pencils is very profitable for Apple. In spite of the declining sales of the iPad, the iOS tablet product line still contributed $4.4 billion during the previous quarter. Apple has recently released the more affordable 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We can expect the high-end iPad business to pick up in sales. The smaller iPad Pro is more convenient when used like a Wacom Cintiq. Wired screen mirroring apps like the $30 Astropad iOS app is inspiring Mac-using artists to buy an iPad. Instead of buying a Cintiq or Surface Pro, the Astropad + iPad combo already makes Mac computers Cintiq-like. I don't use Astropad. I bought Twomon USB because it works with my MacBook, Mac Mini, and Windows computers. Mac users like me are now satisfied with cheap iOS screen mirroring apps. I am no longer in hurry to get my hands on a touchscreen-equipped MacBook. Protecting the high-end iPad/Apple Pencil business is the reason why Apple will allegedly only put an OLED " touch bar " to replace the function keys above the keyboard of new MacBooks. Putting capacitive touchscreen displays on the Mac is simply detrimental to Apple. The logic behind never mixing the iPad and MacBook into a unified product is now clear to me. Apple makes more money by selling Macs and iPads as distinct products. The iPad business segment still contributes more than 9% of Apple's revenue. Keeping it alive by not crossbreeding it with Macs is a clever decision. I might try and go long on AAPL again. I will have to reduce my MSFT exposure to fund this re-entry on Apple.Compared to Microsoft's high P/E ratio, I think the market is undervaluing AAPL. Even though AAPL's price has surged since Berkshire Hathaway divulged a long position on AAPL, I think the stock still deserves a higher P/E than 10.9x . Let us never forget that AAPL has stashed away more than $230 billion in cash. Apple can quickly do major acquisitions to reduce its huge dependence on iPhone sales. Apple is rich enough to buy a controlling stake on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). The bottomline is that Apple can quickly upgrade itself into a formidable cloud computing/software rival of Microsoft, or ad rival of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). I might go long on AAPL again. I will have to reduce my MSFT exposure to fund this re-entry on Apple. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, INTC, GOOG.
