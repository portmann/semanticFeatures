LG Nulcun 2 Confirms Intel's Foundry Superiority - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel and TSMC are testing LG Nuclun 2 architecture with their respective foundries. Intel's product looks to be consistently better. First-generation LG Nuclun was a dead project from the beginning. Nuclun 2 is completely different. Intel has better foundries, and it looks like it's capable of collaborating with customers even at a foundry level. The company has great foundry potential. It must push hard on the next x86 mobile architecture to exploit it at maximum. There is a recent rumor about the LG ( OTC:LGEAF ) Nuclun 2 application processor: it looks like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) are working on it, with their respective node technologies. It's already known that LG wants to adopt an Intel modem XMM 7360 onto the Nuclun 2 and there was also the opinion that Intel is a possible candidate to build the entire SoC. Given the latest rumor, which is likely to be true, Intel will probably win this "match," opening the route as a good foundry partner at least. The first-gen Nuclun was built with ARM ( ARMH ) Cortex A15 cores, which were already two years old at that time, when Cortex A53 and Cortex A57 were already hitting the market. The performance and performance per watt difference was great between those two ARM Cortex generations. Additionally, the Cortex A15 is still ARMv7 architecture, while A53/A57 are powered by the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture, which are faster, more future-proof and enhanced in the encryption field. On top of that, the first-gen Nuclun was built with a 28nm technology node, while Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) were quite ahead: Samsung already had the Exynos 5 built with a 28nm HKMG node, composed of A53 and A57 cores. In addition, it was already going to release the Exynos 7 at 20nm HKMG and 14nm LPE. Qualcomm was releasing the Snapdragon 808 and 810, built with a 20nm HPm and composed of A53 and A57 cores. MediaTek ( OTC:MDTKF ) and Hisilicon were still with a 28nm HPm node, but they were already adopting the A53 cores. Why the second generation is completely different But the second generation is completely different: it will be built using 16nm or 14nm node technology, and it will exploit A53 and A72 cores and an Intel XMM 7360 modem. Just from here, the music sounds quite different - we can say that it will able to face competing solutions without being slower or excessively hotter (therefore, it may be really convenient its production). Moreover, if we take a look at the preview tests, things look bright: the Intel version is able to reach 1980 points in single-core and 6689 points in multi-core (likely Geekbench 3). Such scores would set this SoC only behind the Exynos 8890, providing better results than Snapdragon 820 or Kirin 950, with the latter one sharing a similar architecture. Obviously, it is still not known what TDP has been chosen, but high-end SoCs generally have a TDP around 2.5-3W, and the Nuclun 2 is likely to have a similar TDP. The news states that LG tested two Nuclun 2 samples from Intel and TSMC, verifying consistent differences: the Intel product was able to run its A72 cores at 2.4 GHz against the 2.1 GHz of the TSMC sample, at the same TDP. The result is that the Intel solution performs better by 15% in single-thread (Intel 1980 - TSMC 1721) and by 17% in multi-thread (Intel 6689 - TSMC 5710). The TDP and configuration data have not been disclosed, but from an industrial and convenience point of view, the only choice to make a sensible comparison would be to have the same TDP and core configuration. Otherwise, LG would be quite silly. Such a result shows that Intel, apart from yield considerations, has a better miniaturization technology and is able to provide very good performance per watt. If Intel strikes this deal (and it is likely to do it), it will set another good milestone to really enter the mobile market. Being able to show an Intel 14nm bleeding-edge SoC (even with ARM architecture) in relation to its own modem, this could be a good advertisement for its own foundry business. At the same time, Intel has a good set of solutions for the next year. It will enter another set of low-end 28nm SoFIA solutions in early 2016, and it will successively release the new low-end and mid-end LTE SoFIA solutions at 14nm in mid-2016 while releasing the new Broxton platform with Goldmont core, which will be the real high-end mobile solution. At that point, the 14nm synergies and scalability will likely drive down cost per chip, in conjunction with the Broadwell Xeon and Knights Landing entries. We also must remember that Intel is working on a new modem in order to win the iPhone/iPad 2016 or 2017 supply, and it is working on sampling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) A1x to see if it can win the SoC production for 2016 or more likely 2017. On top of that, the company is releasing its new Knights Landing Xeon Phi solutions. It is going to hit the market with its Xeon/FPGA combo and Intel Optane SSDs (3D XPoint) next year. For the 14nm yields, even if it is not at the same level of Haswell 22nm, the 14nm node is near 22nm values. This year, Intel's profits were slightly reduced due to higher 14nm adoption, but next year, it is expected to grow due to better yields and scaling adoption. Compared to the industry average, it has a lower P/E, P/B and P/S and higher operating margin, net margin, ROA and ROE. The only bad metrics concern the revenue and profit YoY growth which are essentially affected by the PC sales contraction. But from this point of view, things may have to be seen differently, and they are probably going to change. If we look at 3Q IDC data, PC sales were down by more than 10% YoY, but these data do not account in for 2-in-1 tablets that are still PC for the majority of sales. In addition, India's PC market has been recovering from Q2, at least in the business market. Gartner stated that Windows 10 had not any relevant impact on the third quarter, since Windows 10 was keen to upgrade already existing PCs. But Q4 will be positive, and it will show PC sales progressing with 4Q15 holiday sales in relation to the Windows 10 rollout. There's also a survey which demonstrates that 50% of customers are likely to purchase a new PC in the next 12 months, while only 21% of customers are likely to do the same with tablets. A positive recovery trend for US notebooks and premium ultramobile shipments is also ongoing, with a probable general recovery starting from Q4 2015. Even if we take into account a continuous decline in PC sales (though it is unlikely), Intel's growth prospects are still very solid. The company is set to growth steadily in the HPC, Networking, Workstation and storage fields, while it's set to massively grow in the cloud field, which will account for one-third of 2016 data center revenue mix. The CCG is set to partially recover next year, it will exploit better profits from the mobile segment and the entire revenue and profit is set to grow in 2016. If we compare Intel to Qualcomm instead, we see that the metrics are not so different, but the P/S shows something remarkable: Intel has a P/S of 2.7 against its 3.1 industry average, while Qualcomm has a P/S of 3.5 against its 2.1 industry average. Qualcomm has problems concerning lawsuits, competitive pressure in the application processor and modem markets and declining royalty yield, while Intel still pays for its smartphone no-presence and the "ill" PC market. Even if Qualcomm has a better-than-before evaluation, thanks to the latest share price decline, Intel still has a very big portfolio. At actual prices, Intel is still a buy for long-term investments, more so after the dividend raise. But if the target is below one year, it would be better to wait for a retracement of $5-10 before making additional entries. The recent spikes make me think a profit-taking event may be approaching.
