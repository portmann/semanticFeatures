Intel: Yes, It's Still Losing Money On Mobile - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha At Intel's Investor Meeting, Intel management acknowledged its mobile business losses under questioning by analysts. Despite this, an SA contributor has taken issue with my contention that Intel's mobile business continues to lose money. Under questioning by analysts at its recent 2015 Investor Meeting, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) CEO Brian Krzanich frankly acknowledged Intel's mobile business losses, not once, but twice. Despite that, SA contributor Alex Cho appears to deny the losses in a recent article , and asserts that Intel is well-positioned in mobile. Given that the most important mobile device continues to be the smartphone, and given that Intel has negligible presence in smartphones, I would have to disagree. The specific analyst questions about mobile losses occurred during the first Q&A session . The first question was from Mike McConnell of Pacific Crest and occurs at the 3:36 minute mark in the video: Just a quick question on the mobile outlook for next year. You have a full year of SoFIA next year which gives you a lower cost structure, and the contra revenue going away for a full year. . . Why won't the losses go down by even more than the 800 million? There's a couple things. One, there's still a fairly large investment in our modem, and we're trying to get up onto our yearly cadence as we're ramping the volume. . . You're right, we're eliminating the contra, we've got that. We're continuing to improve our product mix, but we're still ramping our volume. . . We're going into phones with our APUs and modems, but at a fairly cautious rate. So it's about volume. It is indeed about volume. The second analyst, who's name I couldn't quite make out, but he was from Barclay's, asks at the 13:04 minute mark: On mobile, with the guidance you're essentially halving the losses that you started off with. The next part probably would require revenue to make that a profitable business. Is that a possible target to actually make that a profitable business? We see many companies pursue modems, and most have bowed out because it's a two prong problem. You need to get carrier approvals, but the small OEMs just don't add up to a lot of revenue. Where are you in terms of carrier approvals and . . . proof of concepts so that you can elephant hunt the big SKUs? And could you actually make this business profitable? Absolutely we can make this business profitable. . . . The 7260 [modem] is currently shipping around the world including the U.S. It's in the Asus Zen Phone, and you can walk into an AT&T store today and buy that. The 7360, which is our next generation cat 6 modem, is shipping to customers and carriers, and validations are on-going today. So people are out testing the 7360 today for shipment in products next year. We've got both Spreadtrum and Rockchip working on products. Spreadtrum is starting to get into the design mode. . . Rockchip building on different levels of iteration of their product. And we showed you with the Internet of Things that all of those things have to be connected. . . I don't know what else is required to realize that Intel is still losing money on their mobile business, other than to listen to what Intel management have to say on the subject. There's hardly a financial analyst interchange of some form, be it quarterly earnings calls or Investor Meeting where the subject doesn't come up. Furthermore, no one can offer enough compelling evidence to support the notion that they're actually losing money on a consolidated operating basis from mobile. But no one has argued that Intel has lost money on a consolidated basis due to its mobile business. All during 2014, when the Mobile and Communications Group (MCG) racked up $4.2 billion in operating losses, Intel still had net income every quarter. No one disputes that. It's been argued, and Cho seems to repeat these arguments, that Intel was merely making investments that it needed to make anyway, and that it was just by some unfortunate quirk of accounting that those losses got booked under the Mobile and Communications Group. This really defies common sense. No one would fault Intel for wanting to make investments in its future. But the losses in MCG were a function of the almost complete absence of revenue for the year. For the entire year of 2014, MCG only had $202 million in revenue, and for Q4 actually managed to achieve negative revenue of $6 million. Intel also bragged that it sold (if it can be called that) 46 million tablet processors. These were Atom class processors that were accounted as part of the sales of MCG, not the PC Client Group. This comes to $4.35 per tablet processor. Even less, if you assume that MCG had some other sales as well. This was contra-revenue in action. The difficulty for analysts has been that since the beginning of 2015, MCG and the PC Client Group have been combined into the Client Computing Group (CCG), which had operating profit large enough to cover the losses of the MCG. Does anyone believe that when Intel slammed the two groups together, the losses just suddenly went away? Regardless of the rationale that Intel management offered for the reorganization, it did serve to obfuscate the mobile losses and make their determination more difficult for outsiders. The $4.2 billion MCG loss for 2014 was a fairly big chunk taken out of Intel's $15.3 billion operating profit for that year , and so could be assumed to be unpopular with investors. Difficult to determine, but not impossible to infer, at least approximately. MCG had been losing about $1 billion per quarter and this was almost all operating cost, since there was virtually no revenue coming in. As soon as the groups were combined, the combined group's operating cost went up by, you guessed it, about $1 billion as the chart below shows. This was despite the fact that revenue for the combined group was lower y/y than for the PC Client group alone, as I show in the chart below. I've focused on the mobile losses, not because of the dollar amounts per se, although they are not insignificant, but because the losses point to the breakage in Intel's mobile device strategy up to now. As I pointed out in Part 1 of my series on the 2015 Intel Investor Meeting , Intel appears to be pivoting away from the strategy. The most tangible signs of the change in strategy are that operating costs are coming down for CCG, Intel management have given assurance that contra revenue really is going away, and the fact that Intel projects sales of only 4 million tablet processors in Q4, a 75% drop y/y. Intel's mobile device strategy was a failure because it was an attempt to impose Intel Architecture processors on the mobile device industry that was (and is) doing quite well without Intel Inside. Now that contra-revenue is going away, the sales of the tablet (Atom series) processors are evaporating. And what of Intel in phones? As much as Intel management were fond of bragging about how many tablet processors have been sold, there's never been any mention of how many phone processors were sold. Because the number is miniscule, and not likely to increase. SoFIA, now dubbed Atom X3 series, was to have been Intel's great hope for its future in smartphones. Next year's X3 will be moved to 14 nm and feature Intel's LTE modem. However, the Airmont cores it will use are already used in the Intel Atom X7. In performance benchmarks, the X7 is already inferior to the best ARM architecture smartphone processors from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). At best, next year's X3 will find a place in 3rd tier smartphones for developing markets, where Intel has been a niche player for some time. The lack of a true mobile device business probably dooms Intel, unless it can somehow find a way to adapt. Intel is on the wrong side of the paradigm shift that has seen Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and now LG embrace the custom system on chip (SOC), rather than buy commodity processors. Commodity processor makers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) are adapting by moving down market, where the profits are more difficult to come by. Intel and Qualcomm appear to be on a collision course to try to invest the low cost end of the mobile device market. But Qualcomm has the benefit of superior ARM architecture processors as well as vastly more experience in communications technology. Frankly, I give the edge to Qualcomm. I consider Intel a sell.
