Is It Time For Intel To Spin Off The Fabs? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Fabrication technology is much less important than it was in the past. Having to keep fabs busy, and to finance the R&D for newer processes, sometimes forces Intel to make aggressive moves that hurt stockholder value. For decades the crown jewels of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) were its fabrication technology plants. Clearly, things have changed, for Intel and the industry as a whole, to the point where Intel should re-examine whether having its own fabs continues to give its shareholders the best return. If we look at the turn of the century, we can see node advances offered advantages considerable greater than today. Going to the around the turn of the century, a new node promised in excess of 50% improvement in clock speed, with transistors costing roughly half as much, while using less power. For example, the Pentium III Katmai (250nm) used 43 watts at 600 MHz, the Coppermine (180nm) version at the same clock speed used 22 watts. Or, it could reach 1 GHz at 38 watts. Its successor, the Tualatin (130nm), officially reached 1.4 GHz while using only 32 watts. It could actually hit 1.6 GHz easily, but Intel did not wish for it to be too attractive compared to the Pentium 4. Nowadays, the cost per wafer is going up nearly 30% according to Intel's Bill Holt in the November investor's meeting, whereas recent, previous node changes were closer to 10%. The move from 32nm to 22nm did not improve top-end performance; the 32nm Sandy Bridge remains the best overclocking processor. The power parameters did improve at lower clock speeds, however. The 14nm node did bring the cost per transistor down significantly, even with the wafer cost going up faster than prior nodes, if you believe Intel. Power use does not seem to be improved significantly, while performance is equal or slightly down. All in all, it's not an enormous step forward despite being significantly delayed. Worse still, Intel announced another delay to the 10nm node, which will leave it two quarters behind both TSMC, and Samsung, if all perform according to their latest statements. With Intel's competitors currently producing FinFets, the advantage Intel had until very recently is essentially gone. It's not clear which process has the performance edge, or better power use parameters, but given the relatively poor characteristics of Intel's 14nm chips in power and performance improvement, and the greatly improved power characteristics of Samsung's new 14nm Exynos processor , the gap has been greatly diminished, if not closed. One of the issues Intel faces is, because of its shrinking size, the ability to compete with companies like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) will likely get more difficult, considering their growth. TSMC will pass Intel is CapEX for 2015, which is a first, and recently showed a huge uptick in July sales , being up 25% year to year, and quarter to quarter. Intel continues to shrink in comparison. Both Samsung and TSMC have announced 10nm parts will be in volume production in Q1 2017, Intel by contrast has delayed its 10nm volume production to Q3 2017. Intel has announced its nodes will now take roughly 30 months, TSMC's 7nm node will be qualifying in Q1 2017, only five quarters behind the 10nm node. Furthermore, Intel generally creates one process per node. TSMC creates several, each having differing characteristics, allowing products in different segments to use the process most appropriate for it. Already, with 16FF+ just ramping, TSMC is working on a 16FFC process, which will be a low cost, low power process well suited for IoT devices. Widely disparate Intel devices, from Xeon servers, to Quark processors, all use the same process, or will, despite having widely varying characteristics. During the times that Intel's processes were far in advance of competitors, this was not nearly as problematic as it is now. And it will only get worse, as TSMC habitually continues to create new processes on the same node; very recently the company released a new 28nm node. While Intel can use better suited processes from competitors, the real issue for Intel is financing the enormous costs of continued research and development, and updating fabrication plants. With these costs escalating, Intel must try to grow revenue, sometimes leading to desperate attempts that compromise the earnings of the company. The most recent related to Intel's pricing of the Atom line of processors. Intel could not lower the price of server processors, as that market is not very price sensitive, or the mainstream line, as that is where Intel has to gain the profits to afford the massive losses of the contra-revenue program. Instead, Intel tried to create demand in the low-end segment. Most people know that Intel's MCG group lost $4.2 billion in 2014, after losing over $3 billion in 2013, with projections of $3.4 billion in 2015. This is mainly related to the tablet market, but we also have to consider that AMD walked away from a lot of business because Intel's pricing was so low in the PC market. Clearly, with the cost of wafers going up, by Intel's account 30%, processor sizes will decrease, as the PC market clearly would not react well to a significant price increase, given how fragile it already is. Also, outside of GPUs, the benefit of increasing size is not in proportion with the costs. As such, with overall smaller processors, and Intel's struggling grow, the difficulty of fully utilizing fabs will become even more difficult. Intel is clearly unable to attract customers for its fabs, and was unable to even with a large process lead. Part of this is distrust of the company, mixed with antipathy. Much of it is also Intel is not well prepared to be a foundry for external customers. As long as these fabs are part of Intel, it become less likely for major customers to consider it as an option, as Intel's behavior when ascendant is well-known, and undesirable; it's clearly better for manufacturers to have competitive pure-play foundries. I think it is much more that companies like Apple would take a much closer look at Intel's fabs, if they weren't Intel's fabs. And, naturally, as a separate entity, culture changes which promoted more efficient research, while at the same time emphasizing greater development tools for potential customers, would further create a more attractive environment. One point many people will be concerned about is Intel no longer having control over the process and development, thus having negative implications on the performance of the product. This is not so, as Intel could pay for custom nodes, or even retain development of processes, but not actually possessing the fabs to build them (which is essentially what IBM (NYSE: IBM ) did). Furthermore, given the volume of Intel's business, fabs would be competing aggressive to win its business, and would be very inclined to work with the company. A decade ago, the thought of Intel, or even AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), selling their fabrication facilities seemed very misguided to me. AMD's founder, Jerry Sanders, would say "Real men have fabs", and for a long time that was true. In the current situation, however, it's clear AMD was better off selling its fabs, while the balance for Intel is shifting more to this as well. This is not a prediction that Intel management will do so in the near future, as this group is reactionary if nothing else. As long as the company is highly profitable, the strong traditional attachment to the fabs will make a split very unlikely. However, if management changes, or if competition from AMD actually exists when Zen is introduced, or both, the company will likely examine this very closely.
