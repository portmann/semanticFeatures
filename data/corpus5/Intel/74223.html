Intel Inside The World's Best Multi-Tasking 8-Inch Tablet - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha ASUSTeK has again opted to use the Intel Atom Z3580 for its latest 8-inch Android tablet. The Asus ZenPad S 8.0 touts 4GB of RAM, 2K IPS display, and USB 3.0 Type-C port. ASUSTeK ( OTC:ASUUY ) unveiled four new Android tablets Monday during the Computex 2015 event. The most impressive of the bunch is the 8-inch Asus ZenPad S 8.0 (Z580CA), which is equipped with a 64-bit 2.33 GHz Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom Z3580 quad-core processor. Asus was the first manufacturer to debut a 4GB RAM-equipped smartphone with the ZenFone 2 and it is again the pioneer in releasing the world's first 8-inch tablet with 4GB of RAM. The huge amount of RAM makes this tablet a multi-tasking powerhouse. While no official price tags were revealed yet, the other high-end hardware specs of the ZenPad S 8.0 hints that is a premium tablet that could compete with the $399++ Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Mini 3 and Dell Venue 8 7000 premium tablets. The image above from Lowyat.net also reveals that the ZenPad S 8.0 has the latest USB 3.0 Type-C port (used in the new MacBook Air 2015), 2K display (2048x1536 resolution), and Z Stylus compatibility. The Z Stylus is similar in purpose to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) tablet stylus for the Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3. The Zenpad S 8.0 is therefore ideal for enterprise users who are accustomed to the pen input style of the Surface 3 tablet and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy Note. If Asus could get carrier support for this product (like what Xiaomi did with the Mi Pad tablet), the ZenPad S 8.0 might get bulk orders from Corporate IT managers looking for a cheaper alternative to the Galaxy Note 3/Surface 3. The Z Stylus also makes the ZenPad S 8 attractive to creative professionals. There is also the obvious potential of this Intel-powered 8-inch tablet to catch the attention of mobile gamers. The huge population of tablet gamers around the world is one reason why it might be good for Asus to market the 4GB RAM-equipped ZenPad S 8.0 as a games-centric tablet. As per Asus' track record of pricing its products, the ZenPad 8.0 will be cheaper than the iPad Mini 3. Asus and Intel have a great track record of creating non-overheating smartphones and tablets that ingeniously combine x86 Atom processors with ARM-based GPUs from Imagination Technology. The ZenPad 8 S has the same PowerVR G6430 GPU used by Apple in the iPhone 5S, iPad Mini 3, and iPad Air. However, I am highly confident that the Asus tablet will prove to be the better gaming tablet. The Asus MemoPad 8 and Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) N1 Android tablets (both have 2GB of RAM) also use the same Atom Z3580 SoC and PowerVR G6430 GPU, and they both outperformed the iPad Mini 3 and iPad Air. The upcoming 4GB RAM-equipped ZenPad S 8.0 is also highly likely to beat the GFXBench test scores of the iPad Mini 3/iPad Air. I think the ZenPad S 8.0 is the updated version of the excellent MemoPad 8 AST21 tablet that was released last year. The ZenPad S 8.0 is a product that might not be as painful as other $100 Atom-powered Android tablets that Intel has been subsidizing. Intel has an urgent need to reduce its contra revenue on mobile devices to prepare itself for the all-cash transaction , $16.7 billion buyout of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) Unlike Microsoft, which generates billions in dollars from licensing its patents to Android device makers, Intel cannot afford a protracted contra revenue approach to mobile. I also doubt that the Altera acquisition will generate enough new revenue to make up for selling Atom processors at below cost to OEMs. Altera's FY 2014 revenue was less than $2 billion. I understand that Intel's generous subsidies is an effective tactic to win and retain the loyalty of hardware manufacturers. However, I am now advocating that Intel focus more on selling profitable x86 mobile processors to OEMs. Microsoft can afford to subsidize tablets/smartphones because it has strong revenue streams from Windows/Office licensing and subscriptions. Microsoft also has a decent advertising business, which is something that Intel also lacks. I was wrong in my previous assumption that Asus will not release a ZenFone with Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 615 processor this year. The ZenFone Selfie Android handset, which was also revealed yesterday at Computex, has the same overheating-prone octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor found inside the HTC ( OTC:HTCXF ) 826, Galaxy Alpha A7, Xiaomi Mi4i, and Yu Yureka Android phones. The Qualcomm-powered ZenFone Selfie is just another clone of the Intel Atom Z3580-equipped ZenFone 2. However, the ZenFone 2, which has been proven to not overheat even under intense 3D gaming sessions, again outperformed those overheating Snapdragon 615-equipped Android phones on GFXBench tests. I see no compelling reason for Asus to use the Snapdragon 615 in the ZenFone Selfie. Asus' experiment with the Snapdragon 615 could even harm the ZenFone brand. In this age of viral online reviews, an overheating ZenFone Selfie YouTube review could also affect the sterling reputation of the Intel-powered ZenFone 2. The overheating issue of Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon processors is probably why even Xiaomi is planning to use MediaTek's new Helio X20 chips for its next flagship Android phones. However, Intel should redouble its effort to win the support of Xiaomi. Xiaomi is more successful than Asus when it comes to smartphones and tablets. The old Bay Trail Atom Z3580 inside the upcoming Asus ZenPad S 8.0 and ZenFone 2 is not as games-perfect as the Tegra K1 SoC used in the Xiaomi Mi Pad. But there were leaks before that Xiaomi's upcoming Mi Pad 2 tablet has an Intel processor. Only x86 processors can dual-boot Windows 10 and Android OS right now. Xiaomi will have to buy processors from Intel if it wants to compete with other Chinese manufacturers who are already shipping out Intel-powered dual-boot phones and tablets.
