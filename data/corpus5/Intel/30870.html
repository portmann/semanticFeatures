Is Intel Stock Worth Considering Right Now? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The fast-growing Data Center and Internet of Things Groups have just compensated the Client Computing Group revenue decrease and have given a small total operating income growth. However, due to much higher growth rate these segments could in the future contribute to healthy growth for the entire company. Intel has compelling valuation metrics; it is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. In my opinion, despite modest growth in the last two years due to declining PC market, INTC's stock is very attractive. The main business of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is microprocessors for personal computers. However, the global PC market is shrinking, and Intel has been late to the fast growing market of tablets and smartphones. In this article, I try to determine if Intel's growing segments - Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group - can compensate for the decline in its PC business and provide a continuous growth to the company. Beginning with the publication of Intel's first quarter earnings report , the company revised the presentation of its operating segments to reflect the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group to create the Client Computing Group. For the following comparison, I have recalculated the previous quarter's results according to the revised presentation. To determine if Intel's growing segments - Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group - can compensate for the decline in its PC business and provide a continuous growth to the company, I compared the results of the latest quarter to the same quarter two years ago. The total increase in revenue of the Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group in these two years was at $1,070 million slightly higher than the Client Computing Group revenue decrease of $1,038 million. However, total increase in operating income of the Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group in these two years was at $577 million, a $202 million higher than the Client Computing Group operating income decrease of $375 million. Hence, in the last two years Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group have just compensated the Client Computing Group revenue decrease and have given a small total operating income growth of 6.7%. Although the two growing segments - Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group - have barely compensated the PC business decline, these segments could in the future contribute to healthy growth for the entire company. The reason for this is very obvious and could be described by one word - Compound. Since the Compound annual growth rate or CAGR of the revenues and operating income of the two growing segments is much higher than the rate of decline of the Client Computing Group, they can in few years compensate for the decline in the PC business. The tables below show the revenue and operating income of the three segments after five years, assuming that the growth rates of the three segments would not change. This indicates a total annual growth of 4% in revenue and a total annual growth of 11.6% in operating income. Of course, this calculation is theoretical, and no one guarantees the same rate of growth for the segments for the next five years. However, the trend is valid, PC sales may recover due to Windows 10 launch in the summer, but there is no doubt that users would use more tablets in the future. In addition, the high demand for data center solutions and the migration to cloud networking is not going to stop. Moreover, according to some companies, the impact of the Internet of Everything will be 5 to 10 times greater than that of the Internet today. Every country, every city, every business, every home, and every car is becoming digital. Since Intel has changed the presentation of its operating segments, we do not have the mobile business exact results for the latest quarter. Mobile and Communications Group have caused the company an enormous loss in the previous quarters. Operating loss of the group in the fourth quarter of 2014 was at $1,110 million and $1,043 million in the third quarter of 2014. Intel has been late to the fast growing market of tablets and smartphones. However, Intel has an ambitious program to gain market share in the strong growing mobile market and for this reason it accepts losses in order to increase market share. Considering Intel's financial and technological extensive resources, I believe that Intel will be able to fulfill its goal in this fast growing market. Intel's valuation metrics are very good, the forward P/E is low at 13.64, and its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.22. In addition, INTC's Margins and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median, and the S&P 500 median as shown in the tables below. Intel has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1993. The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.92% and the payout ratio only 37.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at 4.8%, over the past five years was at 10%, and over the past ten years was very high at 18.9%. In the last quarter, the company generated approximately $4.4 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.1 billion, and used $750 million to repurchase 21 million shares of stock. In the last two years, the fast-growing Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group have just compensated the Client Computing Group revenue decrease and have given a small total operating income growth. However, due to much higher growth rate these segments could in the future contribute to healthy growth for the entire company. I also believe that Intel will gain market share in the tablets and smartphones market. Intel has compelling valuation metrics; its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.75. In addition, the company is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that INTC's stock is a smart long-term investment. Source: Is Intel Stock Worth Considering Right Now? Disclosure: The author is long INTC.
