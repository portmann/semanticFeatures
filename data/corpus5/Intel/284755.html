Intel's Next Multi-Billion Dollar Businesses - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. At CES 2016 Intel's CEO reviewed products that will form the basis for Intel's next multi-billion dollar business units. The basic building blocks: Curie, Real Sense, Skylake, Windows 10, Linex, Xeon Phi. The experiences: sports, health, entertainment, industrial, arts. The Consumer Electronics Show focuses on consumer products with Intel adding its focus on experiences made possible by technology. This article makes an attempt to put numbers and dollars to the experiences described by Brian Krzanich. Please add your own thoughts in comments. Brian Krzanich's keynote address was chalk full of great experiences with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Intel partner products that are either out now or will be out in 2016. The first time I watched the Intel keynote address, my thought wondered to how is Intel going to make money from these experiences? This article focuses on an attempt to put numbers and dollars to the experiences Intel shared. I know a lot of you will attempt to put these experiences into existing business units... and they will likely end up in existing units. But I don't go there for sake of discussion in this article. I believe the switch to experiences has three basic reasons: CES is a consumer-oriented show and consumers love amazing experiences. Intel wants people to think of Intel as a company that makes amazing experiences possible (not just a PC company). Intel wants the next generation of makers to turn to Intel for the tech needed to provide consumers amazing experiences. Many experiences were shared in the Keynote address. This was not an exhaustive review of all the experiences Intel foresees. It's a sample of the experiences that Intel is creating. For example, automotive is a big area that Intel did not mention in the keynote but in an interview at CES Brian talked about Intel projects in the works to meet the needs of the automotive industry based on the same foundation of tech products. Here is just a sampling of what Intel reviewed during the keynote. Understanding these experiences is best done watching the video . Full stadium 3D modeling: Video from 16 cameras placed around a stadium is stitched together to create a full 3D model of the action. Networks can show replays from virtually any position in the stadium. This takes a tremendous amount of computing power provided by Intel. In addition, Skylake processors can have access to this so that an individual can create their own replays at their PC. Eventually as Intel processing ability reaches mobile phones, this type of replay can be done on a mobile phone. Game stats: Curie placed on snowboards, BMX bikes, etc., at XGames to allow networks to show statistics real time of how fast, how high, rotations, G-forces, etc. Curie placed in sports shoes. Curie soon getting power from movement - no battery to recharge. Drones and robots: Drones and robots using Curie, Real Sense and Skylake for autonomous movement and producing tons of data to be analyzed in data centers. Personal Trainer: Curie in sunglasses providing real time statistics about pace, impacts, heart beat, etc., all using voice commands. Then the processor communicates information and suggestions verbally for changes to the workout to achieve appropriate goals. Hard helmets (one of my favorites... I'm a civil engineer): A helmet that not only protects your head but sees in 3D and can provide diagnostic information, heat/vibration levels above normal, repair procedures, operating procedures... all hands free with verbal commands and projection on the protective lens attached to the helmet. Fireworks without fireworks: Hundreds of drones with light emitters forming 3D shapes in the sky... moving in sync with music. Endless possibilities. No smoke or other pollution. Dancers making their own music: Curie attached to hands, feet and fingers. An air guitar that actually produces music. These numbers and dollars are intended to provide a feel for the numbers and dollars and how these experiences can translate to meaningful revenue for Intel. The numbers and dollars are my best guesses. You can insert your own guesses. Curie Chips: Hundreds of millions at $10 each: Billions of dollars Real Sense: Tens of millions at $25 each: Billions of dollars Skylake Processors: Millions at $250 each: Billions of dollars Zeon Phi: Hundreds of thousands at $2,000 each: Billions of dollars These experiences can create billions of dollars in revenue and at Intel's 60% gross margin and tax rates can produce another billion dollars in earnings per year - increasing current earnings by a third. Such an increase in earnings would propel Intel stock to over $60 a share. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
