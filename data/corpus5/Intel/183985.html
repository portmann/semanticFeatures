5 Reasons Why General Electric Has Much Bigger IoT Potential Than Intel Does - General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) | Seeking Alpha GE is a high-tech company disguised as a manufacturer. The company has much more potential for IoT sales because of its diverse experience and customers. Usually, when you think of any comparison between General Electric (NYSE: GE ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), you might think of GE as home to dirty, grubby, low-tech factories while Intel's factories are neat and bright and in fact have "clean rooms". Also, the general impression would be Intel is extremely high tech while GE is more old school, brick, mortar and grease with little technology actually created at GE. Many people remember only that GE had to clean up PCBs from the bottom of the Hudson River . Nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, GE's founding goes back to the original Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. (pick one), Thomas Edison. Edison is generally accepted as the greatest American inventor with over 1,000 patents to his name. The original GE was the Edison General Electric Company founded in 1889. So GE has been a high-tech company for over 125 years. Over that time period, GE has expanded its technological efforts to aircraft engines, industrial pumps, wind turbines, locomotives, industrial software and much, much more. The list is massive, and you can see it here. In fact in the 1950s and '60s, GE manufactured computers and developed its own mainframe operating system called GECOS. It had some strange things though like a 6-bit byte. Intel, on the other hand, has been almost exclusively a computer chip manufacturer founded in 1968 . It has concentrated its efforts on making sure Moore's Law converted into saleable products, and it has done that in a masterly fashion. The company's technological superiority in manufacturing chips is well known. But Intel's focus is very narrow while GE's is massively wide. And that is why GE's IoT sales potential is much greater than Intel's. In this article, I will give some of the reasons why GE will be much more successful in the IoT marketplace than Intel. 1. GE sells end products while Intel sells parts to others who make end products. Most of the things GE sells, and there are literally thousands of things, are products that the company by and large sells directly. In Intel's case, it mostly sells parts that go into end products that other people then sell as complete units. The most obvious are CPUs that it sells in the hundreds of millions to just a few customers. In other words, Intel never sees the ultimate user of its products, so the potential for it to sell IoT to them is limited. GE on the other hand has direct contact and a relationship with entities that will be looking for IoT services. 2. General Electric already has hundreds s of thousands of direct customers, Intel just a few. I am unable to find a number on how many actual customers GE has, but it is certainly in the 100,000s and maybe millions. The number of significant customers for Intel on the other hand is probably in the dozens. As you can see in the following chart, in 2014, INTC sold more than 150 million chips (assuming IDC's 83% market share) to just 5 desktop manufacturers: Add in a few more customers in the "Others" group and maybe you are up to 25. Then, there are 3rd parties and component distributors such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), CDW (NASDAQ: CDW ), Newegg, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) etc. Looking at this technically sophisticated group of customers, I find it difficult to believe any of them would consider Intel as a top-tier IoT provider of software, analytics or services. And, as everyone knows, that is where the profits will be made in IoT, not in the manufacturing of $1 chips. If you look at the GE products page , you will see 25 major groups and over 200 subgroups in sectors as diverse as Healthcare, Aviation, Oil & Gas, Power & Water, Mining, Consumer goods and Software, among others. As GE develops its own IoT framework, it should be able to easily apply the results to other manufacturers in similar businesses who probably are already GE customers. Intel on the other hand is in a very specialized manufacturing niche, basically applicable only to other integrated circuits type companies. As I mentioned above, GE has been in the software business since at least the 1960s when it developed the GECOS operating system. Currently, its software group contains the following: "At the intersection of people, machines, big data, and analytics stands Predix, the cloud-based platform for creating innovative Industrial Internet applications that turn real-time operational data into insight for better and faster decision-making." Intel on the other hand has tried its hand at software with at best limited success. McAfee, a $7.7B acquisition in 2010, has done little to enhance Intel's reputation for software excellence. "Intel is distancing itself from the name of its top security product, McAfee, after years of having its name dragged through the mud thanks to the misadventures of its founder, John McAfee." - Source: money.cnn.com Since the key to success in the IoT marketplace will be software, analytics and service, GE is in an almost unique position to maximize its IoT sales efforts. This is an advantage GE will have over many IoT vendors especially in the industrial sector. Imagine selling a 100HP GE pump by telling your customer it will be connected to your Internet 30 seconds after installation. Obviously, Intel will never have an advantage like this. I have previously written about Intel and IoT here " Intel: Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future " where I basically said Intel's IoT future is limited because the competition has better products. I think this article points out the disadvantages Intel has in the IoT marketplace. Intel will certainly get more server sales due to the massive amount of data that IoT will collect and analyze, but it would get those sales whether or not it had an IoT division. GE on the other hand has a huge potential for IoT sales. In this excellent video from CNBC, the number $500 billion is thrown out as the IoT industrial marketplaces size. I think GE has the potential to get a big chunk of that and would not be surprised if it creates a new IoT group in the next few years. At this point, I do not rate either company as a buy. GE has problems in the Oil & Gas industry as well as other industrial sectors as seen by Caterpillar's (NYSE: CAT ) recent layoffs. I go into more detail why GE is not a buy yet in this article " GE: At 19 Times My 2016 Earnings Estimate It's Time To Sell And Move On ". For Intel, if the next market down-draft gets INTC below $25 and a 4% dividend, I might be interested. Otherwise, I will wait until 3D NAND, 3D XPoint or Skylake generate some significant high-margin sales. Until then, I will do watchful waiting.
