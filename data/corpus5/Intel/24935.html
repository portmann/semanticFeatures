Qualcomm Faces Tough Sledding This Year - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Samsung Galaxy dropped Samsung for both the AP and modem. Intel 64-bit SoCs with integrated modems now in the market. iPhone 7 rumored to be using Intel modem instead of Qualcomm for some models. Competition is starting to hurt Qualcomm and I expect a rash of earnings downgrade to follow as the trend gathers steam. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) can't be all that happy with Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) decision to go in-house for its applications processor and baseband components for the Galaxy S6. While the cost per device is higher for Samsung, the decision may have been driven by wanting to have the best performing applications processor in the industry to rekindle demand for the Galaxy flagship. Forecast sales of the Galaxy S6 run about 55 million units this year. That amounts to a $2.9 billion bite out of Qualcomm sales - more if the demand for the S6 runs ahead of initial forecasts which seems quite likely given the enthusiasm for the product. T-Mobile reports initial orders for the device at twice the rate of last year's Galaxy S5. While I was not surprised Samsung went in-house for the AP the choice of its own baseband chip was a surprise and does not bode well for Qualcomm. Samsung's ability to put out a 14nm AP and its own modem is not the only threat to Qualcomm. Almost concurrently, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced its own 64-bit Atom APs with integrated 3G and 4G modems. The Intel chips will find a market and their sales will chip away at Qualcomm's once almost impregnable grip on baseband technology. SA Author Alcaraz Research sees Intel with a shot at 30 million SoCs in smartphones in 2015, although Ashraf Eassa writing for Motley Fool doubts Intel will ship that many. It is a hard call to make, but in 2014 Intel blew through its own forecast of "Intel Inside" 40 million tablets, ending the year shipping 46 million and displacing Qualcomm as the second largest supplier of tablet SoCs. In addition, Qualcomm may be pushed out of some models of the next iPhone which is expected to have an Intel modem . Qualcomm stock took a beating in the past twelve months, a reflection of the pressure it is feeling from competition. That competition is only going to heat up. Most analysts project Qualcomm earnings per share will actually fall in its fiscal 2015 which ends in September, with the average call at $5.01 per share versus $5.27 in 2014. I expect those projections will continue to fall with a more likely result in the $4.75 range. The analysts' calls don't seem to adequately reflect the combination of the hole created by the demand for the Galaxy S6 and the real prospect of an aggressive push by Intel and its partners Rockchip and Spreadtrum to penetrate growing smartphone demand in emerging markets. The analysts' calls for 2.8% sales growth this year seems unrealistic on a revenue base of $26.5 billion for fiscal 2014 with potential hits from the loss of the Galaxy S6 and inroads by Intel having the potential to crimp sales by as much as $4 billion, offset of course by market growth in the 10% to 12% range. I expect to see Qualcomm revenues for fiscal 2015 fall below $26 billion with a $1 billion sales miss taking a $0.26 per share bite out of profits. It is possible that Qualcomm will win the SoC for the next generation of Samsung Galaxy but I would wait for that possibility to materialize before taking a long position in the stock. In my view, QCOM is probably dead money for the next six to nine months and may emerge as a decent short.
