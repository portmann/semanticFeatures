AMD: Don't Buy The Rally, Don't Believe The Hype - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Data points suggest Q1 PC sales weaker than initially hoped. High inventory levels could ding gross margins. One of the market's recent winners has been Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). At Wednesday's last after-hours price of $2.75, shares were up more than 57% from their January lows. Unfortunately, this rally could prove to be short-lived if data points regarding weak PC sales turn out to be true. Recently, IDC lowered its 2016 PC sales forecast by a couple of percentage points. Windows 10 has not led to the upgrade cycle many were hoping for, as upgrades to older hardware have stretched the life of older PCs. Stabilization will take longer than expected, as seen in the chart below. Citing lackluster PC shipments, we also received this negative note out of BlueFin Research Partners: The analysts think their recent estimate cut for PC shipments, from 67 million to 65 million, may not be low enough: "our latest updates suggest that shipments totals could drop to the 63M range unless the OEMs stuff the channels even more than usual at quarter end." AMD had already guided to a weak Q1 period, with revenues declining 14% sequentially in the lower volume quarter. AMD is in much worse financial shape than a giant like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). While AMD is expecting quarterly gross margins of 32%, Intel is expecting nearly double that. AMD is likely to report an operating loss, while Intel will report a sizable profit. What worries me most is that AMD was in an interesting place with its inventories for the quarter. Despite expecting revenues to decline by 20% over the prior year period (Q1 2015 to Q1 2016), the company ended 2015 with inventories just 1% lower than the prior year period. If PC sales are coming in a bit weak, excess inventory would likely lead to price cuts, squeezing gross margins. For Q1, AMD was also expecting to burn through about $100 million in cash, and that included inventories being "approximately flat." Should those inventories actually increase, cash burn would be higher than expected, also lowering any potential interest on the company's cash balance. Investors will be looking for an update on the Chinese JV as well, given the substantial cash infusion coming from that partnership (expected to close 1st half of this year). Gross margin dollars were already expected to decline sequentially given the much lower revenue figure. AMD shares seem to be a bit extended. Shares closed Wednesday about 47 cents above the key 50-day moving average, and that was before the extra 12 cent jump in the after hours. Over the past year, buying this much above the 50-day has not been a very good strategy. Shares are also well above the mean and median price targets on the street currently. Intel has a dividend and buyback that can help support shares when results are weak, AMD does not. Recently, we've heard a number of negative reports regarding Q1 PC sales. The Windows 10 upgrade cycle has not been as strong as hoped. Low margin AMD could be squeezed further thanks to elevated inventory levels, further increasing operating losses. With shares having rallied well above the 50-day moving average, recent gains could evaporate quickly when the company reports, or even before that if we get a warning like Q2 2015 .
