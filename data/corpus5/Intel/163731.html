Exciting 6th Generation Intel Processors: The Wait Is Over - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is accelerating the replacement of older PCs with its announcements at Europe's biggest tech show: IFA 2015 in Berlin. Half a billion PCs are more than four- to five-years-old. Devices with 6th generation Intel processors compared to old devices: Half as thin, half the weight, 2.5X performance, 3X battery life, 30X graphics speed, near instant on, no passwords. Once in a decade event combining a new generation of Intel processors at the same time as a new Microsoft operating system. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has been developing 6th generation processors (formerly known as Skylake) for more than 4 years... the wait is over. The huge improvement over four- to five-year-old PCs should result in an acceleration of PC replacements. Wednesday Kirk Skaugen, Intel SVP and GM of the Client Computing Group, put on a great presentation at Europe's largest tech show: IFA 2015 in Berlin. A key point he made is that half a billion PCs are now more than four- to five-years-old (one billion that are at least three-years-old). With the current rate of PC sales being about 300,000 per year an acceleration of the replacement of these older PCs would be significant to Intel sales and earnings. Kirk showed real devices by Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba that make use of Intel 6th generation processors. Compared to the half a billion PCs that are four- to five-years-old, the new PCs are half as thin, half the weight, 2.5x the performance, 3X the battery life, 30X the graphics speed, near instant on and need no passwords. A PC that could run three 4K monitors with no delay for refresh. A 2 in 1 device that turns on with Windows 10 ready to go in less than half a second. Real Sense camera that distinguished between near identical twins. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) coming out with a boxing game that takes your Real Sense 3D scan and puts you into the ring. Lego is developing a game where you can do a 3D scan of your favorite items and put them into the game. You really need to watch the IFA presentation by Kirk to get a feel for the magnitude of the announcements. Some useful insights provided regarding where Intel is going with personal computing and IoT: Tablets vs. 2-in-1s: With the high performance, functionality and low cost of 2-in-1s, why buy a tablet when you can buy a 2-in-1? IoT: If it's electrical it will compute and communicate, it's computes/communicates it is best with Intel Inside. Windows 10: Intel and Microsoft designed their products in close cooperation so Windows 10 operates best on Intel 6th generation processors. Intel whose name is based on INTegrated ELectronics is integrating what used to be discrete graphics cards and other features into the 6th generation processors - cutting out sales of discrete graphics cards and accelerating replacement of PCs. PC Gaming sales are huge as PCs take over from game boxes and as PC Gaming becomes an international competitive show (40,000 people attend gaming competitions in huge stadiums ... 11 million gamers replace their PCs every two years... much more frequently than non-gamers.) Also at IFA15 - Acer, ASUS, Lenovo and Toshiba all announced new consumer products using Intel 6th generation processors. I expect that on September 9th Apple will announce a new Mac with a 6th generation Intel processor. If the replacement of one billion PCs happens over the next two years, the PC purchase rate will increase by over 60%. If the half a billion PCs that are over 4 to 5 years old are replaced over the next year, we also would see a 60% plus increase in PC sales. Even half of this increase (30% increase in lower ASP PC sales), a PC sale rate of 400 million per year could add over $5 billion to Intel's annual earnings, pulling the stock price quickly up to $45. A lowering of mobile losses and an increase in DCG earnings would add to this stock price. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
