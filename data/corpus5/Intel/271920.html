Intel Purchase Of Altera Key To Doubling Data Center Group And IoT Group Revenues - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The last hurdle to closing the Altera sale was the China blessing (December 20). Intel now expects to complete the Altera purchase on December 28. Intel's purchase of Altera IP (intellectual property) associated with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) is essential to meeting the needs of the telecom market. Intel will be able to grow from $1.2 b to dominate the $18 billion telecom market using the combination of Intel processors, fabric, memory and Altera FPGAs. Dominating the telecom data center business will allow Intel DCG (Data Center Group) to double its revenues from $15 billion-plus to over $30 billion in less than five years. While the first use of FPGAs integrated into Intel processors will be in the Data Center, these will be followed by uses that increase the IoT addressable market by $11b. On June 1, 2015, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced the planned purchase of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). At the time Intel expected the closing to be in 6-9 months . Now the merger is expected to be completed on December 28 (7 months... good performance). Diane Bryant summarized the benefits to the Data Center Group at the 2015 Global Technology Conference in June: Expands the use of FPGA acceleration Reduces total cost of ownership by using standard server infrastructure Increase flexibility by allowing for rapid implementation of customer IP and algorithms One-third of Cloud Service Providers could use FPGAs by 2020 Cloud Service Providers can accelerate one application such as image identification across many servers. Security appliance vendors can reprogram for customer-specific solutions such as encryption Network functions such as virtual switching can migrate from ASIC function to FPGA with more flexibility The transformation of the telecom business from primarily ASIC and RISC single purpose processors to XEON + FPGA general purpose and more flexible processors is an $18 billion market for Intel to grow into. Currently Intel only addresses $1.2 billion of this $18 billion market providing lots of room to grow using FPGAs. Today Intel and Altera have created discrete products: Intel produces a CPU and Altera produces an FPGA. They are then used together. The next step with the purchase of Altera will be to co-package the CPU with an FPGA increasing the performance. Then Intel will integrate the CPU and FPGA on the same silicon, further increasing performance and decreasing costs and increasing value to customers. Intel also provided examples for use of integrated die and multi-chip packages in IoT. Two major IoT uses for integrated FPGAs/Intel IP include: Industrial automation real time control and enhanced security (replacement of ASSPs). Advance vehicle driver assistance systems including safety, 3D vision, proprietary acceleration (replacement of ASICs). The integration of processor, FPGA, memory controller, security and standard IO will add new functionality, improve performance and lower cost of IoT. Lower cost integrated FPGA units will grow Intel's IoT SAM (serviceable addressable market) by $11 billion by 2020 as they replace ASICs and ASSPs. Currently thr Intel IoT Group has revenues of about $2 billion. Customers will be able to program their own IP into an FPGA without the risks and delays associated with ASICs. Intel can pre-program industry-specific IP to replace ASSPs. Perhaps one of the biggest advantages of integration of FPGAs in the IoT world will be to cut the time to market by at least half. Intel's strong fab abilities will increase the performance and decrease the cost of Altera's existing products. Altera and Intel engineering teams will create an integrated device manufacturer approach enabling faster design optimization and time to market. These benefits will result in higher revenues and higher margins for both Intel and Altera products as costs are lowered, performance increased and increased value is provided to customers. Intel's purchase of Altera will provide new markets for Intel while decreasing costs, increasing performance and meeting more needs of a greater pool of customers. New addressable markets resulting from the purchase of Altera include $17 b in the data center business and $11 b in the IoT business for a total of $28 b. This is huge considering Intel's current total revenues are expected to be around $55b in 2015. The purchase of Altera provides a huge increase in the addressable market for Intel while increasing the value of Intel's processors and other IP through increased integration. Integration is essential to decreasing the size, power use and cost of new technology. Integration of FPGAs into Intel's other IP provides customers increased flexibility, speed to market and improved performance in a smaller and more energy efficient unit. Integration of FPGAs will create new solutions and new profits for Intel in the near term and for many years to come. Integration of FPGAs with other Intel IP is a big step to making Intel a clear winner as a growth stock. Analysts need to recognize the huge value that Altera brings to Intel and adjust their targets to reflect the growth that will result from the integration of FPGAs with other Intel IP. Near term targets above $40 are easily justified based on current earnings and PE ratio of 18 to 20 with the higher PE ratio reflecting the great growth that will result from integrating Altera FPGAs with Intel IP.
