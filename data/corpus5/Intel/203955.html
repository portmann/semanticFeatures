Intel: The Memory Company - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Two new memory technologies will propel Intel to $130 billion in revenue. New memory will allow processors to live up their performance promise. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is a transistor company. Transistors are little switching devices that didn't exist on planet earth 70 years ago. Since then transistors have been aggregated into devices that compute. These computing devices have moved on to control systems like the Internet. The Internet is a system that is capable of storing most of the knowledge humanity has acquired about our world and retrieving pieces of that knowledge in mere seconds for anyone who has one of these computing tools. That first crude transistor begat modern integrated circuits manufactured by Intel and other semiconductor (transistor) companies. Intel is the acknowledged leader of this technology miracle, making integrated circuits containing billions of transistors. Intel has been the keeper of Moore's Law, the driving principle that recognized that the number of circuit elements in an integrated circuit could double every two years. That meant that anything electronic could increase in function and decrease in cost at an astonishing rate. Intel is now a ~$60 billion company, employing over 100,000 people worldwide, 4,000 of whom are PhDs. Intel is as close to a corporate think tank on computing and computing related materials research as exists in the world. I have had the privilege of watching this corporate miracle come into existence and progress to its current leadership position of today. Where does Intel go from here and how do you get rich investing in this amazing company? I've been writing for a couple of years now that the holy grail of computing will see memory and storage integrated with processors to obtain the very highest levels of performance with the lowest possible power consumption. I have to admit that I wasn't exactly sure how this would happen. It seemed that Moore's Law progress might stop a couple of shrink steps short of realizing the ultimate integration goal. You see, the package that houses the microprocessor for PCs and servers has a footprint of only a couple of square inches, smaller than that for smartphone application processors. At the 2014 Intel investor meeting, the company gave a glimpse of their approach to 3D NAND that would allow a sizable SSD (Solid State Drive) to be parked right beside the processor chip in a single package. The only show stopper after this revelation was how to get enough system RAM inside that same package. Enough DRAM for a typical system would require over a square inch of silicon area, far too much to shoehorn into the processor package. On July 28th, Intel and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) showed us how that system memory would shrink enough to get inside the processor package. Instead of DRAM, a new technology was introduced called 3D Cross Point Memory. Diane Bryant, Intel Vice President of the data center business, tells us about 3D XP beginning at minute 45:45 of this video. For now, Intel intends to offer a product line called Optane that will offer 3DXP based DIMM (Dual in Line Memory Module) modules to extend system RAM in servers. Right now, if a massive amount of system memory is required, the only choice is DRAM. DRAM is relatively expensive and volatile. The Optane DIMMs will provide massive amounts of less expensive non-volatile RAM connected to the system memory bus. The Optane line also will offer extreme performance SSDs based on 3DXP memory. These SSDs will find applications where NAND-based SSDs are not fast enough. It turns out that over 50% of all silicon wafers produced are memory wafers . When considering that complex logic chips are over half static RAM, the percentage of wafers that are dedicated memory probably exceeds 70%. Side note: While Intel is the largest semiconductor company by sales, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) exceeds Intel's wafer output by nearly a factor of three. While Samsung's output is mostly memory, Intel cannot fall further behind on total wafer output or they will eventually lose their sales leadership and maybe even their manufacturing technology leadership. So, there is a quiet conflict taking place between these two giants of the semiconductor industry. Samsung cannot engage Intel in the processor segment, but Intel can engage Samsung in the memory segment….and they are doing exactly that. 2D (planar) NAND has run out of gas at about 15nm, making 3D NAND a necessity for continued cost and capacity scaling beyond 128Gb. The first Intel/Micron 3D NAND chip will be 256Gb at MLC or 384Gb at TLC. Samsung, which has been in 3D NAND production for a year, is apparently having enough difficulties that they have been stuck at a 128Gb TLC chip. Storage is one of those places where you make the highest capacity chip you can in order to make SSDs from as few chips as possible. As Intel's Rob Crooke said during the release of this technology, "If you could build a 256Gb chip, you would," implying that Samsung is unable to build a chip of 256Gb capacity with their 3D NAND technology. The Intel 3D NAND scaling roadmap includes vertical layer increases of up to 100% and at least one traditional lithography shrink of 50%. The first chip out will be about 200 sq. mm and 384Gb (48GB). The roadmap as we see today will quadruple the bit capacity of that 200 sq. mm to 1536Gb or 192GB in 2-3 steps over the next two years. That would result in a 192GB SSD on a chip the size of my thumbnail. If you want twice that capacity, stacking NAND chips is easy and has been done for years. A very costly 3D NAND wafer would have a manufacturing cost of not more than $3,000. Each wafer would net about 250 chips, for a cost of $12 per 192GB embedded SSD. We can speculate on sales price, but given the performance, features, and longer battery life, it seems that $100 for the 192GB SSD would not be out of line even for a client PC. There are about 300 million client CPU chips sold per year, if each of those came with a SSD attached it would be $30 billion of new business for Intel. Data center storage systems would be much higher capacity, more complex and much more expensive. I see the data center SSD storage business at about $15 billion. So, 3D NAND should lead to new Intel business of $45 billion to begin with the expensive "low-hanging-fruit" of the data center in 2016 and progressing to the client business by 2018. The bottom line is that an Intel wafer of 3D NAND chips should cost about $3,000 and generate minimum revenue of $25,000 when configured as SSDs. For those out there who think the memory business is always low margin note that this is 92% gross margin. Obviously there are other costs involved, but the NAND margins will, in any case, be above the 65% Intel target. It will take 1.8 million wafers to serve the total market. About 25% of that capacity exists in the 50% interest in the Lehi, UT, fab today, with rumors floating around that Lehi is in the process of being doubled. 3DXP memory is expected to be a low cost-of-manufacturing product, so let's use $2,500 per wafer. This is an absolutely new product, so we can only guess what the volume will be. I'm expecting one of these chips to eventually reside in every client PC and another 300 million will be sold to the data center business. Intel will need to produce 600 million 3DXP chips at full market penetration. By the time full penetration occurs the chip will be half the size it is today. Let's assume 100sq. mm chip size. There will be 550 chips per wafer at that size. A million wafer/year fab will satisfy my WAG market. What should this thing sell for? Let's assume half the price of DRAM or about $3/GB. At 16 GB per chip it should sell for about $48. That price would produce revenue of $26,000 per wafer. At $2,500 cost, gross margin would be 90% and total sales would be nearly $29 billion. I think there's little doubt that Intel is in the memory business and very soon will be even more committed to the memory business. The two new memory technologies could represent $74 billion in growth business for Intel over the next three years. Processor performance has been held back by the "memory wall" for more than a decade. The last step in performance will be to include system memory and some level of storage in the CPU package. That last move eliminates any possibility of competition for system memory and storage, making high memory margin persistent. No other semiconductor company can implement this strategy because , very simply, they don't have ownership of the X86 CPU business. The present value of Intel with a growth rate of 25% for four years and 27% net margin and $1 dividend would be $91. Of course, those numbers are not evident today. I believe the fog will begin to clear by the end on 2015. I think we see $45 in 2016, $65 in 2017 and $85 in 2018. To believers, today's price of $27 is a screaming buy.
