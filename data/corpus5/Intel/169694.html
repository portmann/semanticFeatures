And The Winner Is... Intel! - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 10, 2015 12:38 PM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: AMD , FSC , IBM , MU , QCOM , TXN by: Russ Fischer Most semiconductor companies have underestimated how much it costs to stay viable over the long term. The history of the semiconductor business is littered with the bodies of companies who gave themselves away through low price. A reader recently posted a comment that started me thinking. He suggested that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) might be justified in their high margin pricing. I wrote the following answer to his comment, and then thought to share it with the Seeking Alpha community, as a whole, by posting it as an article. You've hit on a very subtle point. It is very expensive to continually advance the state of the art in semiconductors and is getting even more expensive all the time. Perhaps Intel is the ONLY semiconductor company that understands how much it costs to maintain this leadership over a 40-year timeframe. The give-away-artists are all gone... Fairchild Semiconductor (NASDAQ: FSC )? Fairchild is Where the Intel founders came from. One of the Intel founders, Robert Noyce, invented the Planar Process while at Fairchild. The Planar process is still the foundation for the lithographic magic used to make integrated circuit to this day. Fairchild owned the patent to the planar process and was paid royalties by everyone in the semiconductor business for many years. Fairchild spawned National Semiconductor (National), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and many other players in the business. Fairchild itself fell on bad times and was sold over and over again until finally National wound up buying them. National spun them off as the discrete transistor company they started as. What a humiliation. National Semiconductor itself was finally bought by Texas instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) pretty much for their customer list. National was running 150mm production lines when the big players had been at 300mm for a decade. National and Fairchild were the victims of not (not being able to?) investing in the manufacturing end of the business Motorola Semiconductor? They lost the IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) PC design and were never the Motorola I knew, again. Now they are Freescale (NYSE: FSL )... big deal. Texas Instruments, the co-inventor of the integrated circuit, soldiers on in the analog business, much of which they bought. Even TI could no longer compete in the bleeding edge technology after 65nm. When the inevitable price war comes on analog ICs, TI will be half their present size. All the Japanese semiconductor companies were finally just bundled up as Elpida and sold to Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) for... wait a minute, they were given away....and the first lesson that post Elpida Micron shareholders learned is that it takes a crazy level of spending to keep the technology current and that there is no free lunch as some pundits seem to think. Anyone remember Signetics? AMD ? What a joke! Even the mighty IBM had to bribe Global Foundries to take the obsolete IBM fabs off their hands. Intel is unique in the semiconductor business. They have sustained very high margins in a cutthroat business. They were able to do this by moving the technology along at a breathtaking pace and employing withering tactics to protect their intellectual property. Intel is not always a warm and fuzzy company. They have been brutal as a mother bear in protecting their business from lesser competition, thank you very much Andy Grove. Intel bought into Moore's Law and never let go. For those who think tick-tock-tock is letting go of Moore's Law, think again. Intel is just catching their breath and solving the memory-wall problem and memory cost problem with 3D NAND and 3D XP memory technologies. The 10x increase in bit density represented by 3D XP over DRAM and the density of the Intel/Micron approach to 3D NAND if applied to ALL transistors made - not just Intel's transistors, all transistors - would amount to a total industry node shrink... or more. There, Mr. electronics technology consumer, a free node shrink with the associated cost decreases... how's that for a 2016 gift from Intel? Intel leads through process technology and materials science and lesser competitors follow through reverse engineering and theft of intellectual property. We've come to the point where the ending notes of this tune are Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and Intel. Samsung now has Intel as a competitor in memory in the form of 3D XP non-volatile RAM. Samsung doesn't have a non-volatile RAM. Samsung has DRAM and NAND and even 3D NAND. Unlike Samsung, Intel has a lock on much of the processor business where the memory will be used. Unlike Samsung, Intel is a pure play components supplier - they don't compete with their customers in end markets. Intel will win the battle. TSMC is a fine company founded by Morris Chang as a "time-shared" semiconductor foundry. The company has grown into a huge and innovative business serving fabless semiconductor companies that don't have the scale to build their own fab. TSMC, bless their heart, is slugging it out on bleeding edge semiconductor foundry technology with Samsung at the moment. Both Samsung and TSMC are sharing business at the whims of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The foundry business, of necessity, is much lower margin than the ODM (Intel) business model. There simply isn't enough bleeding edge business at foundry margins to support the cost of the technology arms race for both TSMC and Samsung. One will have to back off. Whoever backs off first will be out of the race forever. I think TSMC will continue leadership in the broad-based foundry business at one node behind Intel and regretting that they ever entered the node arms race with Intel. Intel has just entered the memory on-ramp. Samsung will be very busy protecting their turf for the next several years. Intel needed higher performance memory and Samsung and the others didn't respond, So Intel had to do it themselves. The irony of continued shrink wars between Samsung and Intel is that every shrink brings Intel closer to the point of including both RAM and storage inside the CPU package, to be lost to the outside suppliers forever. That RAM and storage do eventually go in the CPU package is inevitable, and quite near term. Intel has about $50 billion in untouchable recurring annual business in client and server CPU business - add the RAM Business at $10 billion and the storage business at $40 billion and you can see how Intel becomes a $100 billion-plus revenue company in the not too distant future. Intel will supply about 30% of the value of the total semiconductor market. The rest of the simple numbers will be 30% net earnings, 4.8 billion share (shrinking rapidly) for $6.25/share, P/E = 18 for $112 share price (growing due to share reductions). Oh yeah, don't forget that $3 dividend which itself will justify a $100 share price. Buy the stock and turbo charge the gains with some Jan 2017 LEAPS.
