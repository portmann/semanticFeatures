Why 2016 Is Intel's Banner Year (While 2015 Was A Total Fluke) - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha There's no denying Intel's price performance cratered in 2015 as the PC environment wasn't exactly forgiving and reaching DCG growth targets proved to be difficult this year. However, as we turn over the page into next year, new products targeted at enterprise, on-going cloud ramp and organic IaaS growth drives DCG assumptions. Furthermore, the client computing group should experience a recovery due to stabilizing PC shipments, improving pricing mix, gross margin improvements and mobile profitability. Thankfully, there's even more upside to our top line and net income figure due to Altera integration/accretion. The incremental upside is left out of the CFO's and analyst models. I anticipate the share price to react to all of these positive developments. Earnings multiple expansion seems highly likely, hence I have raised my PT and rating on the stock. Things got a little patchy throughout Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) FY 2015 as evidenced by the price volatility. However, it's fair to say that the stock is worth looking into given the various efforts to produce shareholder value through R&D, share buybacks, strategic divestitures and cost efficiency gains. It's hard to understand the various corporate level dynamics, but I plan on dedicating this article to that effort as it's worth exploring the incremental upside as we transition into 2016. Furthermore, I think it's worth mentioning that there will be better performing semiconductor peers when compared to Intel, but by no means will INTC be a Dow laggard next year. Intel will likely outperform when compared to the Dow Component, and while it's hard to anticipate the directional momentum of the broader stock market, my bias is to the upside despite currency/interest rate headwinds. Intel's CFO Stacy Smith went into excruciating detail on the various growth drivers in the annual shareholder/analyst meeting. In an effort to consolidate all of that information, I may leave out some key points from that presentation. Over the course of 2016, the datacenter revenue mix will shift to one-third cloud revenue. The conventional enterprise is buying fewer sever-class CPUs as large-scale IT departments have opted for hybrid-cloud configurations to save on costs. Of course, this plays to Intel's advantage as data needs are expected to explode due to the Internet of Things and rapid deployment of consumer-facing applications. The cloud is extremely flexible for mobile/desktop deployment of apps, and the incremental cost advantage of shifting over to the cloud has been felt by numerous corporate IT clients. The infrastructure component of the cloud is growing rapidly, and while there has been a lot of activity in the software/platform segment of the cloud, Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the vast majority of the incremental silicon opportunities. They have released a variety of products over the years to address various use-cases. The incremental product opportunities are inclusive of Xeon-Phi, FPGAs, Silicon Photonics, TLC NAND and 3D XPoint memory. I see the adoption of these new product categories a key component of realizing the 15% growth assumption for the enterprise segment. Furthermore, while there's a lot of competition within the enterprise space, there's no denying that Intel's custom silicon/storage portfolio offers better TCO (total cost of ownership). The CFO mentions that growth will fluctuate in the data center group. So, forecasting growth at a linear pace might not paint an accurate picture on a year-by-year basis. However, the nature of financial modeling necessitates us (analysts) to create linear extrapolations, as such investors should anticipate the quarterly reports to fluctuate between better than expected or in-line with consensus estimates on an ongoing basis. The DCG composes a high percentage of the profit mix, so the quarterly swing from DCG will be in terms of diluted EPS as opposed to revenue. What really drove optimism at the Intel investor day was the incremental upside potential of the Client Computing Group, formerly known as the PC Client Group. The CCG is inclusive of mobile, and what was surprising was the robustness of the segment despite forecast assumptions indicating modest shipment decline for the full-year. Of course, the PC market could in fact stabilize. When based off of various channel checking sources, the PC market is expected to bottom out in Q1'CY16, so the CCG could perform a lot better than what Intel's own CFO anticipates. Nonetheless, the upside to CCG was driven by growth in mobile revenue and lower mobile-related costs. The R&D for that segment is expected to decline and operational profits seem feasible. While no one is anticipating the company to gain substantial mobile share throughout 2016, the company's mobile line-up is stronger than it was in the past. But, like others have noted, without a cutting edge modem, they're restricted from selling their Atom platform into the high end. At this point, Intel isn't abdicating from mobile, but they are prioritizing investment into other areas of the organization that could use the incremental R&D. They're expecting low double-digit operating profit growth from the CCG and more than $800 million in profitability from mobile specifically. Now I know this contradicts statements made by others on this website, but quite frankly, the internal accounting metrics of a company are far more indicative and reliable than attempts to analyze using external accounting statements. Intel's guidance for CCG is flat to low single digit revenue growth and operating profit growth in the low-teens. The growth in operating profit is driven by falling costs for 14nm wafers as they anticipate better yields from their fab. Furthermore, product segmentation will drive ASPs over the course of FY 2016, driving top line assumptions. The incremental cost reduction to mobile and growth in low-end mobile sockets adds some upside from prior-year comps. Of course, the growth in that segment could surprise. Since sales primarily come from that segment, the revenue miss/beats in upcoming quarters could deviate from consensus expectations more significantly. Based on management's outlook and integration of Altera I anticipate revenue to grow by 10.12% in FY 2016. Of course, my estimate differs from Street consensus and management's outlook, as I calculate the impact from Altera separately. I don't believe management/analyst estimates are inclusive of Altera as the DCG was projected to grow at 15% per annum without Altera included. Furthermore, it also helps that CCG is expected to grow by low single digits due to pricing improvements and mobile. The core growth rate of IoT, software and other is approximately 8%, however this growth rate may differ materially due to divestitures in the software segment. Nonetheless growth in storage and IoT has been fairly consistent, and given the launch of new storage/memory products I anticipate high single digit growth in the segment not inclusive of Altera. I anticipate net income growth of 20.14% in FY 2016. This is mostly driven by revenue and a modest reduction in operating expenses. The gross margin should remain stable between FY 2015 and FY 2016, however there could be upside to gross margins assuming higher volumes at better yields. Of course, volumes will be driven by CPU demand. To stay conservative, I anticipate the growth rate to be roughly equivalent to Intel's guidance, hence a 62% gross margin rate. I anticipate share buybacks to slow in FY 2016. The 4 billion in incremental buybacks won't offset the dilution impact from convertible debt and share bonuses. The stock price will likely increase which will trigger employee options and debt to equity conversions. Furthermore, the annual run rate of dilution exceeds the impact from share repurchases, and the authorization won't be increased unless FCF improves materially. Since we're in an investment year where capex will ramp in response to the 10nm transition, I can't see a window of opportunity for higher share repurchases. Furthermore, the net income growth also is inclusive of incremental expenses pertaining specifically to Altera. I anticipate the tax rate to increase by a couple points when compared to 2015. While I'm well aware Intel reports a lower tax rate when compared to the U.S. average, the incremental impact from higher earnings won't be completely offset by tax credits and offshore tax shelters. The diluted EPS growth rate is in mid-teens as a result of the dilution impact. I anticipate some earnings multiple expansion throughout FY 2016. The stock has exhibited multiple expansion over the trailing 12-month period, so investor sentiment will likely improve, which translates to a higher forward P/E. While valuation trends are hard to accurately articulate, I believe the stock will trade at 16.7 times earnings over the next 12 months. The valuation is definitely within a feasible range as it's driven by strengthening fundamentals and a relatively strong equity environment. Due to these various factors, I'm raising my recommendation from buy to high conviction buy. I raise my 12-month price target to $42.87 from $35.48. I anticipate 23.18% upside from the prior overnight close. Of course, there could be additional upside, but I tend to avoid pushing the cart ahead of the horse.
