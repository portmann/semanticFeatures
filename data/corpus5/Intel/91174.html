Intel Becomes An ARM Mobile Device Maker - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has announced the acquisition of Recon Instruments, a maker of smart glasses based on ARM processor technology. Along with Altera's ARM based SOCs, Recon gives Intel even more presence in the ARM device market. With the purchase of Recon Instruments, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) now becomes an ARM mobile device manufacturer. Recon Instruments makes smart glasses/goggles for sports and skiing, using ARM Holdings-based (NASDAQ: ARMH ) processors. Intel is being drawn, however unwillingly, into the ARM sphere of influence. Intel's announcement of the purchase makes clear that it will attempt to steer recon in the direction of using Intel Architecture devices developed specifically for the wearable market. Intel also offered the assurance that Recon would "continue selling, enhancing and marketing their products under the Recon brand without disruption." As with the Altera acquisition I recently profiled , Intel seems to want to walk a fine line. On the one hand, Intel professes that the newly acquired company will have independence in choice of processor technology, while on the other it assumes that Intel's processors will be chosen on their own merits. Left unaddressed is what might happen if Altera or Recon decide to continue with the ARM architecture. It would be easy to assume that Intel would simply mandate the use of Intel processors, and that's probably true. What I'm not convinced of is that those processors will be based on the current Intel Architecture. By way of explaining this opinion, let me back up a moment and clarify my stance on Intel. Following the Altera article, I saw a lot of comments that misrepresented (to put it politely) my views on Intel. The most common misrepresentation was a simple-minded assertion: "Mark thinks everything ARM is great, and everything Intel is "s#^t." The ridiculousness of the assertion is apparent to me as I sit here writing this on my Windows 7 Intel PC, one of the many I've put together over the years. My negativity about Intel is confined to Intel's current management, which I think has misread the opportunity in mobile devices. Intel's public position is that mobile devices, including wearables, represent an opportunity to extend the Intel Architecture into very low power mobile applications. Intel has proclaimed that "everything is best with Intel inside." I doubt that this is true. This opinion is based on a set of observations over the past couple of years that Intel has been trying to break into the mobile device market. These observations constitute admittedly circumstantial evidence, but I consider them persuasive in their totality. The first observation has to do with price competitiveness. Over the course of 2014, Intel's mobile device division lost $4.2 billion dollars, apparently due to contra-revenue subsidies. Intel shipped 46 million tablet processors in 2014, exceeding its goal of 40 million for the year. But even then, it hardly achieved dominance of the tablet market, in which 229 million units were shipped in 2014, according to IDC . Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alone, despite a sales decline, sold 63 million tablets in 2014, all of which used Apple's custom designed ARM processors. Intel's experience in 2014 suggested to me that Intel Architecture was profoundly cost disadvantaged relative to ARM. Moreover, process node leadership, which arguably Intel still maintains, was not sufficient to overcome the cost disadvantage. Architecture Differences Driving Cost Competitiveness The second observation has to do with the most likely explanation for the cost disadvantage. There's a fundamental difference between ARM architecture and Intel Architecture (x86/x64) having to do with how the processors handle the numeric codes (instructions) that tell the processor what to do. In order to maintain compatibility with the x86 instruction set, which goes back to the 1970's, Intel Architecture employs a second layer of instructions called microcode, which is what the modern Intel chip really understands. There's a layer of processing in the Intel chip that translates the x86 instructions into microcode. The added processing for translation into microcode takes up additional real estate on the chip itself. Additional chip area equals additional cost. ARM architecture doesn't use microcode, and therefore doesn't need the extra area for instruction decoding. Instructions are directly implemented in the design of the processor. This also gives ARM architecture a power efficiency advantage as well. Intel has successfully mitigated the power efficiency advantage of ARM through various on-chip power saving techniques, just as it has the performance impact of microcode translation. But these have come at the cost of greater complexity and have effectively increased the area and cost impact of microcode translation beyond the needs of translation itself. The bottom line of this set of observations is that in order to achieve the power efficiency of ARM, Intel had to add further complexity and cost to the Intel Architecture. By 2013, Intel had achieved power performance parity with ARM, but it was now priced out of the mobile device market. Intel's solution was to try to force its way in with the contra-revenue give away. Intel's Mobile and Communications Group received an average of $4.39 in revenue for each of the 46 million processors it sold in 2014. This is well below the price of a typical ARM based tablet processor from the likes of Samsung. The fact that Intel was forced to undercut ARM so severely says much about how the mobile device industry responded to contra-revenue. I think the industry understood full well what Intel was trying to do and why, and for the most part wasn't having any of it. Recon had been an Intel Capital portfolio company prior to the acquisition, so Intel made the decision to invest in an ARM mobile device maker a couple of years ago. Intel might have tried to steer Recon into using Intel processors, but wisely chose not to. And may still. I believe that the Altera and Recon purchases signal a shift in Intel strategy. The presumption that everything is best with Intel inside has probably been severely shaken, if not abandoned. Intel is hedging its bet on Intel Architecture, at least when it comes to mobile devices. My complaint about Intel is that Intel in 2015 has only gotten to the point it should have been in about 2010, in terms of receptiveness to building ARM processors. Intel could design ARM processors that would be superior to any competition, and it would have little trouble gaining acceptance for them among mobile device makers. The Altera and Recon acquisitions suggest that it may still do so. Source: Intel Becomes An ARM Mobile Device Maker Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
