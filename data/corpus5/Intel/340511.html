Intel To Reap Profits From 3D freeD - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel RealSense image processing, combined with Intel freeD video modeling will create a new $10 billion business for the company by 2020 in the autonomous IoT arena. RealSense image processing models movement in 3D. freeD combines multiple (numerous) video feeds into one video model. Combined, these two technologies will disrupt technology associated with autonomous device movement by predicting object movement outside the view of any one object. Gartner estimates that by 2020, there will be some 30 billion connected devices. IDC is even more bullish, and expects there to be about 200 billion connected devices by 2021. Many of these devices will have just a few sensors and little need to compute. There is still profit to be made in the small IoT devices with little need to compute. However, profits will be much greater associated with the IoT devices that move autonomously. My previous article focused on the part of the IoT market that will require the greatest amount of compute power and collect the most data (the next big things ). Autonomous devices require many sensors and the ability to see and compute. They also will collect the most data from video streams as the autonomous devices move around on their own. Therefore, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is most likely to earn the most profit from the Autonomous IoT platform, both in the field end and in the data center end. The company is building an autonomous device platform from end to end. As part of this platform, it is providing the RealSense silicon and algorithms needed to see, interpret, collect, and make decisions based on 3D image processing what is around the autonomous device. At the other end, Intel is providing the compute power in the data center to analyze the huge amount of data that will be collected by 3D image processing devices moving around autonomously. An example of this is its basketball court data processing . Intel takes video from 16 or more cameras around the basketball court and weaves all of these images together to create a real-life 3D video model of the action on the court. From this model, the company can create new dynamic video views of the imagery using Intel freeD . Think of it as taking the complete volume of any arena and breaking it down in to a collection of small cubes. Once you have that complete set of voxels, you can use a large computer to put yourself anywhere on the court or the field and view 360 degrees around you. Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender's perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback's perspective. Amazing, right? Well that's what we'll see this weekend at the All-Star slam dunk contest and during the NBA All-Star Game. We'll see the slam dunks, blocks and steals from every angle, every position. This 3D video modeling is done with normal video cameras. It is also done as a replay. Now take this concept several steps further and use 3D image processing data from 3D cameras like Intel RealSense in real time. Now imagine a bunch of autonomous devices, including cars, augmented reality (NYSE: AR )-empowered smartglasses, and drones, all contributing 3D image processing data to an overall truly 3D freeD model from various perspectives. We then could have a real-time 3D model of the movements of everything in an area and even things that are approaching the area. This model would have the ability to predict movements of things within this 3D video model. Having this 3D modeling available in real-time woven together from multiple perspectives would truly be disruptive and be a huge leap forward in collision avoidance autonomous movement. Who else besides Intel is in position to deliver such a 3D freeD system in real time? The company is is in position to deliver this system from end to end - from the RealSense image processors moving around on devices, to the hubs that collect and process this data, to the data centers that analyze the yottabytes of Big Data collected by 3D-imaging RealSense devices. Yes, the Star Wars character, Yoda, is a homophone for yotta, and is a cousin of Google (also a number). Yotta is the largest decimal unit prefix in the metric system. One yottabyte is one trillion terabytes and 1,000 times a zettabyte. Further, connections at the hub level will allow autonomous devices to share data associated with reactive movements in order to avoid collisions. For example, if two smart autonomous objects are about to collide, the sharing of information can make sure that both objects do not try to avoid collision by moving to the same spot (colliding in an effort to avoid collision). The 5G work that Intel is doing with many other companies, as well as the drone work that Intel is doing with AT&T will help build the IP and communication system needed for 3D freeD autonomous collision avoidance. This Intel IoT shared IP pyramid helps to explain the high profit potential for Intel's RealSense-empowered freeD modeling in real time in the real world. IoT devices that are not autonomous will be more likely at the bottom of this pyramid, in the $1-5 range. Autonomous devices will more likely be in the $50-100 range. These higher-end devices will be less of a commodity than the bottom end of IoT devices. These autonomous devices, while lower in number, will have contribute much greater profit levels due to the limited competition for these extremely complex devices that require super high-speed connections from the field device to the hub to the data center and back again. Lets say that half of the vehicles, AR smart glasses, robots and drones have this advanced imagery processing ability. That is, half of 300 million per year - or 150 million devices a year. At $75 each for Intel, that is a new $10 billion a year business by 2020. Don't hold your breath for this one or run out and buy INTC stock based on this huge opportunity. In the short term, Intel will continue to struggle as it invests in the company's future and diversifies outside of PCs. This future will likely include an end-to-end platform for 3D freeD image processing from multiple moving and autonomous devices for collision avoidance. I am watching for investment opportunities in Intel. The stock is likely to drop back to $25 a share this year, before rising on the back of new tech advancements. In the near term, I will be looking for signs that the company is being successful in turning around the PC market, rapidly growing data center sales, expanding IoT, and growing its new memory business. Maybe these signs will start to show up in 2016. More likely, we will need to wait until the second half of 2017 for these signs to be more obvious and secure. Intel is in the middle of a long-term effort to make itself more relevant in new tech innovation and application. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
