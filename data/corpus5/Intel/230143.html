Apple Unleashes iPad Pro, Will It Reverse The iPad Sales Decline? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's iPad Pro goes on sale this week. iPad Pro supply will probably be constrained this quarter, making it difficult to gauge sales success. I expect iPad Pro to unlock pent up demand for a larger screen iPad similar to the effect of iPhone 6. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will begin accepting orders for the iPad Pro on Wednesday . The iPad Pro could prove to be Apple's most important personal computing product since the first Mac. Investors and the tech industry will be watching closely to see how it's received in the marketplace. Since its debut at Apple's September event, sales expectations for the iPad Pro have been rather modest, too modest in my view. The Digitimes report from late October pegged orders to suppliers at 2.5 million units by the end of calendar 2015. Prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has estimated Pro sales at about 2 million units for the December quarter. Apple's own revenue guidance range for the quarter of $75.5-77.5 billion (1-4% y/y growth) didn't convey high expectations for iPad Pro either. Rumors have it that the Pro will be supply constrained at about the two million unit level, but it's unclear whether this is the result of production issues (Kuo's view) or the result of a self-imposed conservatism (Digitimes). Overall, it looks like sales of iPad could come in flat to slightly lower than fiscal Q1 2015 (December 2014) sales of 21.4 million iPads. iPad unit shipments have been dropping y/y at about 20%, which puts iPad sales at about 17 million for this quarter plus iPad Pro sales of about 2 million. One of the continuing factors in the sales decline of iPad has been Intel's contra revenue subsidy of its tablet processors. This has resulted in low cost Windows and Android tablets coming to market at the low end of the iPad price range (sub-$500). I believe this has drained off a large number of first-time buyers who might have opted for iPad were it not for the "just as good and much cheaper" options of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )-based tablets. Based on Intel's Q3 earnings report , there are indications that contra revenue is starting to be withdrawn, as I discussed in my recent article on Intel's earnings release. Intel's tablet processor shipments for calendar Q3 fell 39% y/y to 8 million units. There was an indication based on my analysis of Intel's financials that this was due to a reduction in contra revenue subsidy. How much the reduction in Intel tablet processor sales will benefit Apple is difficult to gauge, but the effect will probably show up this quarter. There's about a one quarter delay between Intel's sale of a tablet processor and that processor getting into products at the retail level. There will also be more competition from ARM-based tablets. Mediatek has released a new ARM Cortex-A72 based processor which has seen its first application in the new Amazon Fire TV set top box. The Cortex-A72 is ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARMH ) most advanced 64 bit CPU design, which is only just now finding its way into production processors. MediaTek actually considers this a tablet processor, so we'll probably see more products using it this quarter. A number of processors are expected to feature the A72 design, and one of the big questions I have had is how well it stacks up against the A9 (iPhone 6s) and A9X (iPad Pro). As I pointed out in The Huawei Challenge , Huawei's next flagship phones are expected to feature the A72. All told, even with the competition from ARM processors (which always exists), I expect the reduction in Intel tablet processor shipments to boost iPad sales by about 1 million units, to about 20 million for the quarter. Perhaps the greatest factors in boosting sales for iPad this year have come from Apple itself. iOS 9 contains significant enhancements for iOS productivity in the form of split screen multitasking and the touchpad mode of the on screen keyboard that allows manipulating an on screen text cursor. Despite Apple's protestations against convergence, these features clearly represent movement in the direction of affording greater personal computing power within iOS. Apple clearly wants to use these enhancements to boost the appeal of iPad. As I've said in the past, the A8 processor in the iPhone 6 Plus is capable of running the full multitasking options of iOS 9. This is proven by the fact that the iPad Mini 4 runs the multitasking functions and has an A8 processor. But iPhone 6 and 6s will not get the multitasking features. Despite the fact that iOS and Mac OS are drawing ever closer together, Daniel Eran Dilger had to reiterate the obvious recently, that Apple isn't going to merge iOS and Mac OS X. Yeah. We know. Keeping them separate is a good strategy, but that doesn't mean convergence isn't happening. It is, and will continue. iOS is Apple's most important personal computing platform. It has been for a long time. The significance of iPad Pro is that for the first time, Apple is positioning the iPad to really challenge the Windows PC, specifically the Windows PC notebook. Is iPad Pro all the way there in terms of replacing a laptop? Certainly not from the standpoint of software suites such as Adobe Creative Cloud. In choosing iOS as its fundamental platform for personal computing, Apple has had to forgo some near term software compatibility. The advantage of iOS is that it is completely modern and doesn't have to drag along any legacy compatibility baggage, which is the double-edged sword of operating systems such as Windows 10 and Mac OS X. And unlike Windows 10, which still seems like a pastiche of desktop and tablet user interfaces, iOS is seamless and self consistent. So I believe Apple's strategy for iOS is to keep enhancing its capabilities until it becomes the converged, do everything personal computing platform. But Apple is creating this platform gradually so that it maintains its beautifully integrated character. iPad Pro is yet another Apple take on "the computer for the rest of us". As such, its impact and potential for success are being vastly underestimated in my view, perhaps even by Apple itself. Does iPad Pro move the needle for Apple in the December quarter? Probably not, based on the rumored availability. However, I expect iPad Pro to unlock considerable pent up demand for a larger screen iPad in much the same way that iPhone 6 did for a larger screen iPhone. If I'm correct, the indication of that will be that iPad Pro sells out very quickly, and continues to be on several weeks back order through the December quarter. Obviously, this is something I'll be watching very closely. I recently rated Apple a Hold on the basis of Apple's September quarter earnings and guidance for the December quarter. This may have been excessive caution on my part, but now that I have a fairly substantial following and audience, I feel obligated to be cautious. This may displease the fan base, but I've always written for fellow Apple investors, rather than pandering to the fans. Part of that investor orientation is to demonstrate a certain equanimity often lacking in fan writers such as Dilger. I acknowledge, for instance, that not all creativity and innovation flows out of Cupertino. I acknowledge that choice of personal computing device is fundamentally a matter of personal preference. Computing devices are just tools in the end, not religious icons. My current Hold rating on Apple is based on my reading of the competitive environment and Apple's near-term prospects. iPad Pro has the potential to change those dynamics, but this remains to be seen.
