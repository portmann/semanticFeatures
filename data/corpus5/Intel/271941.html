Apple: Management Decisions Key To Overcoming Q2 Panic - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analysts are quickly reducing fiscal Q2 estimates. Buyback power indicates analysts looking for decline in net income. Last week, I discussed how we were seeing a number of negative analyst reports regarding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Wall Street has been worried about the iPhone, as supply chain checks seem to indicate demand for the company's newest phones is not doing as well as hoped. As a result, we've seen some pretty dramatic estimate reductions lately for the March-ending fiscal Q2. This puts Apple management in the spotlight, because the company can overcome this panic if it decides to release some new products and services earlier than some may have expected. Frankly, I'm surprised at how quickly Wall Street has turned against Apple. It wouldn't be surprising to see a number of estimate reductions shortly after an earnings report, but to see this happen during a quarter, a month before earnings, seems unprecedented. In the chart below, you can see how the fiscal Q2 revenue average has dropped in just over a week's time. Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates The average revenue estimate is down by $1.09 billion, and it takes a lot for that to happen with 36 estimates on the name currently. If we take a look at last year's Q2 financials and the iPhone's average selling price, analysts are basically reducing their unit sales estimate by about 1.6 million or so units. Since the iPhone is a high margin product, this has also resulted in an average EPS estimate drop of 6 cents over the above charted time period. Now a billion plus dollars of revenues may not seem that important for Apple, since analysts are still looking for more than $59.3 billion in fiscal Q2. However, analysts have cut their year over year percentage growth estimate from 4.1% to 2.2% in just over a week, and that's almost half of the company's projected growth. Remember, Apple in this year's Q2 has the benefit of Apple Watch and Apple Music that weren't in last year's period, so it seems likely that analysts will now be looking for the company to report a year over year decline in iPhone sales. It's also interesting to note that analysts are looking for just a 7 cent gain in EPS to $2.40 a share in Q2. Based on Apple's strong share repurchase plan, I am currently projecting at least a 9 cent year over year EPS increase thanks to the buyback. That number could be even more if the lower share price results in management stepping in with additional accelerated share repurchases. This basically tells me analysts are looking for Apple to report a decline in Q2 net income, something we haven't seen from Apple in a couple of years. So how can Apple overcome this sudden panic, which has sent shares back down towards $105? Well, this is where management needs to step in. If designs are ready and decent production can be found, the company should move up some product/service launches that the street is looking for. The most recent rumors have an Apple event in March that could see the launch of the Apple Watch 2 and the smaller iPhone 6c that I've discussed at length . We are also waiting for the company to launch a refreshed iPad Air, as well as a streaming TV service that has recently been put on the back burner. If you remember the launch of the iPhone 6s, Apple only launched the smartphone with a couple of days left in the quarter. If the company hopes to overcome this recent analyst panic, it cannot do the same with the upcoming launches. To generate meaningful revenues, since the company usually is supply constrained at launch with most items, Apple probably needs to have these products available for 2 weeks during fiscal Q2. I'm not suggesting Apple move up these launches to January, but every extra sales day works out to a few hundred million in revenues. That could easily be the difference between making and missing quarterly estimates. Why is this Q2 panic such a big deal for investors in the long-term? Well, it all has to do with perception. When the street fears that Apple's largest product isn't growing, and company revenues are plateauing, the stock is sold off and investors flee to names that are perceived to have more growth. Just take a look at the following 6-month chart showing Apple against Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Apple has lost more than 16% over this time because investors and analysts are worried about the company's near term future. To show you how bad sentiment is, Microsoft shares are up 19% in this period and yet analysts are looking for revenues at that company to decline in this fiscal year! However, Microsoft has a growing cloud business and is expected to do better in the future, so investors are jumping on that train. Alphabet (Google) and Amazon are showing plenty of growth, so investors are sending those names to all-time highs. Even a name like Intel, which has struggled to grow revenues in recent years thanks to a declining PC industry, is being favored because revenue growth is likely in 2016 thanks to the Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) acquisition, an extra week in its fiscal year, and some other items. In early Tuesday morning trading, Apple shares are fetching less than 11 times expected fiscal 2016 EPS, and that includes the company's massive cash pile. We've continued to see negative analyst notes in recent days, sending fiscal Q2 (and even the current Q1) estimates down quite significantly. Apple management needs to earn its pay now, and the best way to do that is to move up potential product/service launches. Investors are selling the stock because growth doesn't seem to be there, and management can help overcome that panic by refreshing products that consumers are waiting for, while launching other new ones. This is critical for the stock's long-term success, because if Apple doesn't prove it can grow going forward, more investors are going to bail, moving to names that currently have growth potential.
