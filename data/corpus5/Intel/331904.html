Intel Xeon D-1587 Shows Astonishing Performance Per Watt - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha ARM is believed to provide competitive or better performance-per-watt ratios compared to Intel's solutions. AMD Opteron A1100 series is "old" and disappointing while other ARM competitors are still struggling. The latest Intel Xeon D update has shown a fantastic performance per watt compared to the Intel Haswell generation. Public expectations for ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) server solutions are quite high. This is partially caused by the recent agreements between Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and the Chinese regional government, and other minor Chinese agreements, not to mention the quite good performance in the mobile sector. However, the recent AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) Opteron A1100 series showed bad performance, and the other ARM competitors are still relatively behind in development. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) instead has decided to heavily accelerate and release its Xeon D series which provides an astonishing performance per watt. The performance-per-watt improvement is so outstanding that it practically closes a lot of enterprise markets in the short and mid term, solidifying one of INTC's historically core business. ARM will have serious problems in attacking INTC, and it may manage to enter only those niche markets where Intel Atom 2000 series is still the most competitive solution (till Denverton's arrival). And if Intel is able to maintain a solid performance in its core business, it will be able to accelerate in all other segments (virtualization, SSD, HPC, interconnections), generating more profits in the following years. The latest Xeon D provides 16 cores with 32-logic threads, a Broadwell-based architecture, 24MB of cache, a 65W TDP and a 1.7 GHz base clock. It supports the VT-x/VT-d virtualization technology, RAS and full TXT, AVX2, TSX instructions. It has a dual memory channel with a maximum of 128GB of DDR4 (2,133 MHz) or DDR3L (1,600MHz), ECC or non-ECC. The SOC is equipped with 24 PCI-E 3.0 lines and eight PCI-E 2.0 lines, integrated I/O with dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet Intel ports, four USB 3.0 ports, four USB 2.0 ports, and six SATA 3.0 ports. It is fundamentally a Broadwell chip with a full instruction support, but its relatively low clock speed in conjunction with the high core count and the 14nm adoption makes it extremely interesting. Low frequency and high core count will obviously exploit the highly multi-threaded programs and situations, but it is also a setting that consistently improves power consumption and efficiency. This is caused by the fact that power consumption increases with frequency with a potential law, which means that the performance increase is generally a lot lower than the power consumption increase. In such a situation where each core exploits the low frequency, the local power consumption and heat generation per each core remains very low, implying that each core stays very efficient. If we have a CPU with eight cores, high frequency and 65W TDP and the same CPU architecture with 16 cores, low frequency and the same 65W TDP, you will see that the 16-core CPU will provide a lot better power efficiency in highly multi-threaded applications. In this scenario, the use of the 14nm process nodes and the Broadwell architecture, which has been designed to improve efficiency in the low-power segment, plays a fundamental and remarkable role. STH has showed a first preview about the Intel Xeon D-1587, using a bunch of benchmark suites, and it has provided a picture that looks extremely good, beyond any expectations. You can see the benchmarks in the previous link, but I wanted to recap the results in the following table, taking a look at the score difference and the much more important performance-per-watt ratio. In the table, I compared the Xeon D-1587 to the other two configurations, a system with a single E5-1660 v3 (140W) and a dual E5-2620 v3 (2 x 88W). These systems provide comparable or lower absolute performance with prices slightly lower than $1,000 while the dual configuration is quite popular. D-1587 will surely have more hefty prices, but its performances are quite astonishing. It shows +28% of multi-thread performance against the Dual E5-2620 v3 while it performs +53% better than the E5-1660 v3. Just this performance improvement is very good and consistent, but the real deal comes when we take into account the power consumption. The performance-per-watt ratio increases around +200-250% against the Haswell generation, providing an enormous performance-per-watt jump. Intel has managed to reach better performance with 1/2 to 1/3 of power consumption, enabling these systems to meet an overall 120W power consumption with 16/32 implemented cores and a relatively low budget with 10 GBit integrated MAC. The situation looks even more positive than described by AnandTech during last summer; it reviewed the Xeon D-1541 SoC, which used an eight-core (16 logic cores) CPU at 45W TDP that is obviously less efficient than the 65W 16-core Xeon D-1587. AnandTech wrote: "The Xeon D effectively puts a big almost unbreakable lock on some parts of the server market in the short and mid term (as Intel will undoubtedly further improve the Xeon D line)". Given that the new 16-core SOCs look more efficient than forecasted, the judgment is obviously rosier, and if we also take into account that the D-1587 is the top 16-core Xeon-D version, the D-1577 and D-1571 with 45W TDP will probably provide even higher power efficiency. It is clear that INTC is pushing hard with its actual Broadwell Xeon series since it is providing a performance/watt boost not seen since the introduction of Xeon 5500. Intel is practically closing a big slice of the market at least in the short-to-medium term, given that it continues to widen the Xeon-D offer. Xeon D is a design win essentially for the network and storage device sector while it is also essential to the micro-server, data center/network edge and IoT. In reality, given the peculiar product that Intel has managed to create, Xeon D is able to heavily attack the other segments. It is highly suitable as a mid-range Java server, a text-search engine, a high-end development machine, or a node into a web server cluster. It meets many workloads in the enterprise, hyper-scale, and HPC data centers that are popular, and with the lower-end solutions, is able to provide a lot of specific features that were not present in the "old" Atom enterprise solutions. We must also remember that the 14nm offer is going to grow even in the E3, E5 and Atom series, providing a general and massive performance/watt boost throughout the entire gamma of products. For what concerns the next product generations, Intel is likely to introduce the Skylake architecture at 14nm, which brings good power efficiency improvement over the Broadwell architecture, mostly with low power consumption per each core and high core count. After Skylake, it will be Kaby Lake 14nm (2H 2016 consumer/2H 2017 enterprise) and Cannonlake at 10nm (2H 2017 consumer/2H 2018 enterprise). The delay for the 10nm is obviously related to the production and technical issues, but it may also be related to the will of anticipating the enterprise solutions and accelerating the production scalability. It is known that the 10nm Xeon Phi will hit the market between 2017 and 2018, therefore, it is not impossible for Intel to take such a route and anticipate enterprise Cannonlake by 6-12 months. This would imply that Kaby Lake will be only a consumer solution while INTC will not have any real delay on the enterprise market (for what concerns the 10nm). This scenario makes me think that the enterprise segment looks very solid for Intel, which it is also able to exploit: The 3D XPoint memory (by the adoption of new SSD, on-SOC memory, fast-memory) - Intel has already shown tremendous performances with SSD and DIMM samples, and it is expected to hit the market between 2017 and 2018. Its better miniaturization process - remember that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )/TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) 10-7nm is roughly equivalent to Intel 14nm while Intel 10nm is a lot denser. The omni-path connections and future photonics - photonics is a revolutionary technology while the omni-path interconnections are the result of more than 10 year of research with OEMs. Morganfield/Goldmont will be the first mobile architecture that will not be the result of an old tweaked architecture, therefore the expectations are quite high. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is working hard on the Surface Phone, which would be the perfect trump card to heavily enter the smartphone market from the high-end segment. Even the consumer segment looks rosier since the PC sales, including the 2-in-1, are set to recover starting from 2H 2016. Even if 2016 is set to be one of the most volatile years ever, Intel deserves a buy for a long-term position; its enterprise business is solid, consumer business is reaching stability but possibly a slow recovery, virtualization is growing fast. INTC is well set to earn good market share from the IoT market. Obviously, it is possible to meet the highs and lows through the year. Therefore, if you worry about this roller coaster, avoid any investment during this period. But, if your target is 2017 and after, Intel is a good long choice.
