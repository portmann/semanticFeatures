ETF Hub Aug 12 2015, 12:39 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "We now believe that Intel ( INTC +0.9%) will capture roughly 50% of Apple’s modem business in the upcoming iPhones due to launch September 9th," writes Northland Securities' Gus Richard. "[W]e estimate that this win could represent $750M to $1.25B in revenue for Intel in [2016]. This is a marque win for Intel and would go a long way to reducing the mobile business losses." At the same time, Richard is concerned Alibaba plans to deploy ARM-based ( ARMH -3.3%) server CPUs developed by Cavium ( CAVM -1.7%), and reports hearing Amazon , Facebook, and Google are working on their own ARM server CPU designs. Major Web/cloud service providers currently rely overwhelmingly on Intel server CPUs (primarily Xeon). Qualcomm ( QCOM -0.9%) has been the iPhone's exclusive baseband modem supplier for some time, and also sells complementary RF transceiver, power management, receive-only, and envelope-tracking ICs to Apple. VentureBeat reported in March Apple plans to use Intel modems in 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Qualcomm suggested last month Apple's high-end smartphone share gains were partly responsible for its soft FQ4 (calendar Q3) guidance. However, this was generally seen as a reference to the fact Apple uses home-grown app processors (the A-series) within the iPhone rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon line. The company has dominated the 4G modem market to date, and is generally seen as having a high-end performance/power consumption edge. Separately, Qualcomm has unveiled its next-gen GPU core architecture, the Adreno 5xx. Qualcomm promises up to 40% improvements in performance and power draw relative to the prior-gen Adreno 430. The first GPUs based on the architecture will go into the company's upcoming Snapdragon 820 (next-gen flagship) and 620/618 (mid-range) processors. The iPhone using Intel's discrete modem is huge!  AAPL is one of few still using discrete modems in smart phones, next Intel's Atom x3 LTE Inside iPhone 7? ARM server's are going to have an uphill battle against Intel's servers and it will get really ugly for everyone.  Here comes Intel's 14nm + FPGA server products in notebooks and servers.
