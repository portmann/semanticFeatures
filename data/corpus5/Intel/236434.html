Qualcomm Poorly Positioned To Compete With Apple And Samsung - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 is much better than its predecessor, but the likelihood of winning Samsung's business has been reduced to nil. This is driven by recently leaked performance benchmarks, which point to the Exynos 8890 as a better single-threaded and multi-threaded app processor. Qualcomm needs to develop unique technologies to assist OEMs in differentiating handsets to Apple. Instead, Qualcomm has lost footing in the high-end and has emphasized commodity parts for commodity handsets. While Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has yet to recover from the disaster that was the Snapdragon 810, the upcoming Snapdragon 820 seems to do a better job addressing performance issues. While Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is working toward building competitive SoCs, I'm somewhat dubious of the company's ability to sell mobile parts to other OEMs. So, Samsung isn't a direct competitor to Qualcomm, but Qualcomm's handset OEMs will likely lose share to Samsung's device lineup as time wears on. The vast majority of mobile apps are single-threaded, and performance enhancement primarily comes from improvements at one or two cores. In the rare instance you have multi-threaded applications, the Samsung would have an edge over its rivals. However, power consumption becomes an issue in this form factor. Ideally you'd utilize the additional cores through multi-tasking. However, smartphones aren't really designed for multi-tasking due to limitations to screen size and lack of functional productivity apps to leverage the compute resources. In other words, smartphones are still content consumption devices, and rarely will you ever multi-task or use demanding multi-threaded applications. So, Samsung's design philosophy falls short of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) A9 (Twister) cores in terms of real world performance. In fact, I anticipate Apple's iPhone 6s to have both a power and performance advantage when compared to Samsung's Mongoose. Sure, the tech space is known for both competition and partnership among bitter tech rivals. But, after having invested such significant resources in prior and current-generation SoCs, I'd be doubtful of Samsung's willingness to share its competitive edge even if it means missing out on direct OEM sales. Apple doesn't even share its OS much less its hardware. Qualcomm designed its own in-house thumbprint sensor in response to Apple's thumbprint sensor and it's years late. Apple designed a dual-core CPU for its current tablet and smartphone lineup. Qualcomm opted for a quad-core configuration for the Snapdragon 820. The Snapdragon 820 will have two higher-clocked cores, and two lower-clocked cores. The lower-clocked cores are utilized whenever there are serious CPU demands put in place, but generally speaking, Qualcomm has the best of both worlds when it comes to multi-threaded and single-threaded applications as the two high-powered cores running at 2.2 Ghz will have better power savings features as opposed to an eight-core CPU. Samsung's strategy sort of reminds me of AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ). More cores must equal more power, and if AMD can't design more efficient cores or better CPU architecture AMD cranks up the voltage and adds more cores to keep pace with competitor's benchmarks. In the high-end, AMD's CPUs draw as much power as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Xeon E5 & E7 series. Likewise, Samsung's Exynos 8890 will consume more power, but in terms of single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks the results are pretty astonishing nonetheless. The Snapdragon 820's (red bar) performance lags behind the Exynos 8890 (green bar), and Apple A9 (purple bar). Of course, these benchmarks are run on reference handsets, so these rankings may change once we see real world performance benchmarks. However, there's no denying that Qualcomm's performance will likely lag the Exynos on both the single-threaded and multi-threaded performance benchmarks when based on preliminary leaks. Samsung's performance advantage is very modest on the single-threaded comparison. But, for the sake of marketing, Samsung finally has a performance advantage when compared to other Android handsets. At this point, there's zero possibility Qualcomm wins Samsung's business as its app processor and modem are roughly comparable in terms of performance. On the other hand, the remaining chip providers have inferior CPUs (with the obvious exception of Apple and Qualcomm). So, Qualcomm could take back share from MediaTek as QCOM can move its mid-tier to low-tier chips to lower pricing levels. However, the high volume low margin business isn't where the excitement is at. Qualcomm needed to build a better chip to win Samsung's business. Instead, Samsung is well-equipped to design chips in-house and even has a fab advantage when compared to Apple and Qualcomm. So, perhaps Samsung's chips will get even better on the single-threaded performance comparisons in the next generation. Perhaps, Samsung will eclipse the performance of Apple's upcoming A10. Qualcomm's stock returns have lagged against its mobile competitors. Yes, I refer to Samsung and Apple as competitors because every bit of market share they gain is a loss to the ecosystem that Qualcomm supports. It's basically Qualcomm's responsibility to come up with new hardware to market to mobile OEMs. They haven't done that very successfully and you'll often see Qualcomm reacting to every handset Apple releases. In a year, I can see Qualcomm releasing something equivalent to the haptic feedback engine. That's a long time to go without functionality improvements to the Android UI. Hence, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has opted to design some of its own components in-house. While, I'm dubious of Google attempting to build an app processor or modem, history has proven that if you commit enough resources it's possible to build a better CPU/GPU than Qualcomm. Hence, Qualcomm's value-add comes into question within the mobile ecosystem. If anything, Qualcomm has to be more integrated into the future design of handsets. Maybe they come up with new hardware to keep the Android ecosystem relevant. But, honestly I'm not really banking on that. They're too focused on building the core components of smartphones and they're not doing a good job at that either. Hence, Qualcomm has hung its OEMs as mobile OEMs will likely struggle against Samsung and Apple in this current handset cycle. I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation on Qualcomm.
