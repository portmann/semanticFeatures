Apple: What's A Proper Buyback? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Investors expect company to raise buyback for third straight year. Size of raise most likely depends on time frame for execution. Domestic cash buffer around $20 billion is key for debt raises. In January, technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported a tremendous blowout quarter , leading many investors to expect a large buyback raise. Management has stated it will provide an update on its plans at the April earnings report. The buyback program has been the more influential part of Apple's capital return plan in recent years with more than twice as much cash used for the buyback than the dividend. Today, I'll discuss why I think the best idea for Apple is a smaller, more flexible buyback, which may disappoint investors looking for a huge headline increase to the program. Apple initially announced a $10 billion buyback in 2012, raised it to $60 billion in 2013, and further increased the plan to $90 billion last year. According to the latest 10-Q filing , Apple had utilized $72.9 billion of that amount as of December 27th, 2014. In the chart below, you can see how the buyback has impacted Apple's split-adjusted number of shares outstanding. These are end of fiscal quarter values, so the Q1 2015 point below refers to the December 2014 ending period. From the peak during fiscal 2013, Apple has reduced its outstanding share count by about three quarters of a billion shares, which is nearly 11.5%. In addition to helping the stock, the buyback has significantly improved Apple's EPS figures. In the company's fiscal 2014 period , Apple reported earnings per share of $6.45, and that figure was boosted by nearly 40 cents thanks to the buyback. In the most recent quarter, where Apple had over $18 billion in net income, the buyback improved EPS by 20 cents over the prior year period. The latest turning point in shares was when Apple stepped in and bought $14 billion in shares after the January 2014 earnings report. Apple shares were in the low to mid $70s at that point (split-adjusted), and have rallied continuously since. Management believed in the company's near-term future, and put a lot money behind that faith. Apple generates tens of billions in free cash flow per year, although a lot of that is outside the US. The company also has added a lot of debt to facilitate its repurchase program. In the table below, you can see some key balance sheet metrics at the end of fiscal Q1, basically the calendar year, in recent years. Dollar values are in millions. In early February the company added another $6.5 billion in debt. Since a majority of its cash is located outside the US, Apple is taking on debt rather than repatriate funds and having a huge tax bill. With interest rates this low, that makes sense. At some point however the company may be forced to repatriate funds, and investors are hoping that Congress can come up with a deal to lower the tax. Like most tech companies, Apple doesn't plan to repatriate at the moment, especially not with tax rates this high. I'm very curious to see what Apple does over the next couple of years as some of its short-term debt comes due, especially if interest rates finally do rise. The first parts of Apple's debt start coming due in 2016, with further issues due three years after. Apple's total debt amount has surpassed its US cash (domestic) balance, as seen in the chart below. With Apple taking out that $6.5 billion earlier this year, probably to be used mostly for the buyback, we will likely see total debt rise above $40 billion at the end of fiscal Q1. For those looking for a tremendous buyback raise, this would mostly require additional debt. If Apple doesn't plan on repatriation anytime soon, I don't think the company wants to get its debt/domestic balance ratio up too high. There are some differing opinions on what Apple will do with its buyback at the April earnings report. Back in January, a Credit Suisse analyst called for a $200 billion capital return plan by the end of 2017, of which $165 billion would be through buybacks. On the other hand, a UBS analyst discussed the issue of repatration . Apple may wait for more clarity on the tax issue resulting in a smaller buyback over a shorter time period. If the company believes a tax holiday is coming, it may be more generous with its share repurchase plans. There's one other item to keep in mind, and that's stock price. The following table is from Apple's 10-Q showing open market purchases over the past five quarters. Apple spent $5 billion in fiscal Q1, both 2014 and 2015. However, in this year's period, the stock price was much higher so Apple did not get as much bang for its buck. That situation has stretched even further in fiscal Q2 because Apple's daily closing price in this quarter has been about $120. The company's buyback in the past looks good based on where shares are currently, but that makes it harder to get the share count down going forward. With the stock currently trading at $125, it is nice to see the purchases above are at significantly lower share prices. Apple's two completed accelerated repurchase programs bought back $12 billion worth of stock at about $70 and $90, respectively. The buyback has been extremely successful since the share price is much higher. Last week, I discussed how chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) decided to rush in and buy a tremendous amount of its stock in 2014. Intel shares have fallen since thanks to a weak PC market. Intel's buyback looks foolish when a large chunk of shares were bought at prices 10% higher than current levels. Apple's management has done the exact opposite, buying when shares were well below current prices. Apple had about $17 billion left on the $90 billion plan at the end of December. At the current $5 billion per quarter rate, the company would finish that plan during calendar 2015. Combined with the past announcements each April and talk from management, we are expecting an update next month. That leaves Apple with three possibilities for the April announcement in my opinion: The first option is along the lines of the UBS analyst, and something I've been favoring in recent months. In this situation, Apple basically goes year-to-year with the buyback like it has done in the past couple of years. If Apple does this, I would expect the company to maybe raise the buyback to say $100 billion, telling investors it will revisit the situation a year from now (April 2016). This would leave Apple about $27 billion for share repurchases over a five quarter period, which puts the name around a $5 billion per quarter run rate. The second option is along the lines of the Credit Suisse analyst. Here, Apple would announce a significant increase to its buyback and detail a timeframe for it, say 3 to 5 years. The amount of the buyback would depend on how willing Apple is to take on debt, and perhaps if the company believes it will start repatriating funds. In this situation, Apple could raise the buyback to $125 billion or maybe even $200 billion, depending on the timeframe. The third option is comparable to what some other technology giants have done, and a common practice among stock buybacks. Apple could simply raise the buyback to a given amount, but not give a timeframe, simply repurchasing shares over time as it sees fit. In this scenario, the buyback is a little more flexible. If Apple decides to go with this route, then the total value could be almost anything. While I don't hold Apple shares currently, my personal preference as someone who follows the name extensively would be options one or three. I believe that flexibility is the best plan here, and those two options give the company the most wiggle room. A lot can change in the technology space and the market in a year. Also, I know that most of the headlines that will come out will cite the buyback total, but remember that timing is key. A $40 billion plan over two years is more important in the short-term than a $60 billion plan over five years. On Monday, I read another article on this site predicting that Apple would increase its buyback by $35 billion to $45 billion at the earnings report next month. The contributor did lay out some of the key points that I've referenced, especially regarding timing, but I think the article needs a little further analysis. First, the article discusses the possibility of $75 billion in cash available for the capital return program. As part of this, Apple's calendar 2015 starting cash balance of roughly $20 billion in the US is given, a figure I discussed above. However, I believe this cash should be excluded because I believe the company wants to hold a "buffer" of cash, a margin of safety. If we go back to last April, Apple had a little over $18 billion in US cash at the end of fiscal Q2 . Shortly thereafter, Apple took out another $12 billion in debt. Thus, I believe the $20 billion should be discounted because when the US cash balance gets down around that number, more debt is added. That happened earlier this year as well. Additionally, let me point out that the contributor's $35 billion to $45 billion increase would be an acceleration of what Apple did last year, an increase of $30 billion. Since that time, the stock has risen substantially and the company has taken out almost $30 billion in additional debt. Overall, I think that the author's buyback amount increase could be accurate, but given my thoughts and the above items, I think the timing may be a little off. This goes back to the flexibility discussion I presented above. If Apple raises its buyback by $45 billion, I think that's a two-year plan. Apple is expected to update its capital return plan next month and most investors are looking for a buyback raise. Apple's share repurchase plan has been quite successful in supporting shares and improving EPS in recent years. While most of the company's cash is located outside the US, interest rates are low so Apple has been quite comfortable taking on debt. In my opinion, the company should try to be as flexible with its buyback program as possible. That might disappoint some investors if the announced headline number isn't tremendous. However, I think it sets things up better for the long run. In the end, Apple will most likely continue its buyback program at a brisk pace, and that's a good reason to remain long the stock.
