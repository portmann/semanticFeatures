Intel Becomes An ARM Chip Maker - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has announced the purchase of Altera for $16.7 billion. Altera's product portfolio includes ARM chips fabricated on Intel's most advanced process. Intel has indicated that it will allow fabrication of Altera's ARM chips to continue, even into the next more advanced fabrication process. With the purchase of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) officially joins the ranks of ARM chip makers. Intel had already become an ARM foundry by virtue of its foundry arrangement with Altera. Intel is currently supplying the only ARM system on chip (SOC) built on Intel's most advanced manufacturing process, the Altera Stratix 10 series of SOCs. Purchasing Altera could be a defensive move intended to head off the threat posed by Stratix 10, or it could be a belated entry into the ARM ecosystem. The question of Intel's intentions toward Altera's ARM products was clearly uppermost in the minds of analysts at the conference call Intel held to discuss the Altera acquisition. Intel's slides made no mention of Altera's ARM products, and laid out a road map in which Intel architecture products would be merged with Altera FPGAs in single chip solutions for data center and IoT markets. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) represent an intermediate performance point between the conventional microprocessor and the custom designed ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). FPGAs provide more real-time performance than microprocessors, but aren't as easy to program. On the other hand, they can be repurposed, unlike the ASIC. Device manufacturers often turn to FPGAs when they need performance approaching an ASIC but don't have the market volume to justify investing in an ASIC design. Analysts danced around the question of the future of Altera's ARM SOCs a little bit during Q&A until finally one just asked a direct question, which I'm paraphrasing: Would Altera's SOC be migrated to all Intel Architecture by the 10 nm node? The answer was surprising. According to CEO Brian Krzanich, Altera would make their own decision about which architecture to use. But CFO Stacy Smith chimed in, "we like our chances." That the matter was even decisionable came as a shock. I had assumed that this was a defensive move intended to curtail production of the Stratix 10 SOCs, which feature a quad-core 64 bit ARM processor (Cortex A53) and which are to be built per the foundry agreement on Intel's 14 nm FinFET process. It's not clear that Intel understood that it would be building ARM SOCs when the foundry agreement with Altera was announced back in February 25, 2013. Especially not very high capability SOCs that might pose a threat to Intel's data center business. The announcement by Altera of the use of the ARM CPU block in a variant of the Stratix 10 didn't come until the following October. If there was any chagrin within Intel management at the Altera maneuver, they were over it by the time of the acquisition announcement. Krzanich professed admiration for Altera's strong product portfolio, saying that they were "products our customers want." When asked if the acquisition was defensive, he replied that it was not defensive but "expansive." Analysts also seemed concerned at the high cost of Altera, about $16.7 billion by Intel's estimate. One pointed out that Altera has had a negative CAGR for the past several years. The high price tag certainly suggests defensive aspects to the acquisition. Intel predicted that the market for combined CPU/FPGA SOCs of the Stratix 10 type will grow at a 7% CAGR going forward. Intel cited as the reason for this the 2x performance increase that the combined CPU/FPGA Stratix 10 could provide for certain tasks such as facial recognition. Intel must have been impressed by the Stratix 10 and realized that an ARM processor core combined with an FPGA could be a viable competitor in markets such as data centers and IoT. Clearly, Intel would rather see Altera FPGAs combined with Intel architecture cores, but seem content to allow the horse race between Intel and ARM to proceed within the ranks of the company. Now that Intel owns both horses, the decision must come a little easier. Intel expressed confidence that Intel Architecture combined with Altera FPGA would be the lowest cost solution. Given the recent history of Intel's moves into mobile and its contra-revenue subsidies of its tablet sales, this is by no means self evident. If Intel allows Altera to develop a next generation ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) Cortex A72 SOC, I doubt that Intel Architecture will be cost competitive at the A72 performance point. This still leaves Intel's plan to combine a Xeon core with the Altera FPGA as a viable product however, and I expect it to gain traction at the high end of the server market. For the Internet of Things, I'm extremely skeptical of the cost competitiveness of an Atom/FPGA solution compared to ARM. In this arena, the Altera purchase looks very much like an intelligent bet cover by Intel. The wave of consolidations sweeping the semiconductor industry is indicative of the stress the entire industry is under due to the success of the custom SOC paradigm pioneered by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and now adopted by Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). The market for commodity semiconductors has become a game of musical chairs in which seats at the table are being continuously removed. In this context, Intel's acquisition of Altera appears considerably more adaptive and intelligent than its misguided contra-revenue strategy of last year. With Altera, Intel gains expertise in ARM processor design, which it sorely needs to remain relevant. In addition, Intel gains a customizable product technology that can appeal to a broad spectrum of customers including hyperscale data centers, and mobile and IoT device makers. From Altera's standpoint, the acquisition is a win because it gains better access to the data center market than it might otherwise have had. ARM penetration of the data center was always going to be an uphill battle. With margins for its datacenter products running fairly high, Intel could have starved out its ARM competition without resorting to contra revenue. Intel now has an opportunity to foster the growth of its ARM-based product line. Investors should monitor carefully how Intel handles this opportunity. Intel could squander it by "fixing" the horse race. If it does this, only Intel will be the loser. Source: Intel Becomes An ARM Chip Maker Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
