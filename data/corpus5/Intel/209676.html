AMD's Classic Death Spiral - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 20, 2015 10:55 AM ET  |  About: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) , Includes: AAPL , INTC , NVDA , TSM by: Mark Hibben AMD's 2015 Q3 earnings report pointed to ongoing cash flow and profitability shortfalls. The company's plans for new products such as the Zen CPU appear to be too little, too late. AMD is in the grips of a classic death spiral, in which near-term measures only put more downward pressure on the company in the long term. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) is exhibiting all symptoms of the classic tech company death spiral. Important executives fleeing the company. Products so late to market that they're irrelevant at launch. Crucial technology development getting delayed. Endless restructuring as management flails away, desperate to make some kind of difference. Shrinking revenue and mounting losses. Every quarterly report feels like a stay of execution. I once had high hopes of a turnaround at AMD. This was back in 2013 when the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles featuring AMD semi-custom systems on chip (SOCs) were announced. It seemed good timing on AMD's part. I was making observations that the commodity semiconductor industry was being supplanted by the custom SOCs of companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Being a custom SOC house for hire seemed like a good coping strategy for AMD. But the company's semi-custom business just hasn't been able to take up the slack in its mainstream x86 CPU and graphics chip businesses. All the focus on specifics of AMD's financials and products misses this crucial point: The commodity semiconductor business has become a lousy business to be in. The paradigm shift that Apple pioneered continues to fuel innovation in mobile devices, and these devices continue to take consumer attention and money away from the classic personal computer. The semiconductor business as a whole has been awash with downsizing and consolidation for some time. Even the top dogs in their respective markets, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) haven't been immune. The PC market keeps shrinking, and the top dogs are competing ferociously for market share to compensate. They've largely been successful at AMD's expense. It's in this context that AMD's 2015 Q3 earnings results should be viewed. There is nothing in the report that can be rationally embraced as good, or even encouraging news. Revenue is down y/y by 26% to $1.06 billion. Whereas the year-ago quarter posted a slight profit of $17 million, this quarter posted a net loss of $197 million. The emphasis in the earnings presentation on the slight sequential improvements in revenue amount to managerial legerdemain. Q3 was bound to be higher in revenue on the strength of chip orders by the console makers. This is a purely seasonal effect. While Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Group (EESG) (where the console business resides) only suffered a slight 2% y/y revenue decline for the quarter, Computing and Graphics Group (CCG) is an absolute shambles. With a 46% y/y revenue decline to $424 million, the CCG operating loss ballooned to $182 million from the year-ago loss of $17 million. AMD is hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate. This quarter, the cash outflow was $74 million. At this rate, the company has about 10 quarters to burn through its existing $755 million. Ten quarters of cash may seem like a long time, but it's really not. AMD is now exhibiting one of the death spiral attributes that have become all too familiar from companies such as BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) and Nokia (NYSE: NOK ). As a result of Draconian downsizing, tech companies reach a point where there's no more fat to cut. Muscle, tendon and bone are sliced away in the name of cost cutting, but it does serious injury to the operational capability of the company. Investors can see evidence of that excessive cost cutting in the delay of the once-promising Zen processor family. As of the Financial Analyst Day presentations , investors were led to believe that Zen would arrive in 2016. This seemed perfectly reasonable since one of the cornerstones of Zen was expected to be its use of a 14-16 nm FinFET processing node provided by either Global Foundries or TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). As of the Q3 earnings call, Zen will merely be "available" in 2016, with volume production in 2017. This is an unqualified disaster, but it's typical of what happens when you're understaffed. AMD clearly made updating its GPUs for FinFET a priority in 2016. This was a rational decision under the circumstances. Nvidia will be moving to 16 nm FinFET at TSMC. The GPU area is where AMD is most competitive, and it simply couldn't afford to lose more ground to Nvidia. Zen is likely to suffer the fate of Carrizo. The Carrizo line of SOCs was targeted at low-power applications such as notebooks, but is fabricated on TSMC's 28 nm node. That means it's two full process generations behind Intel's latest Skylake processor family. I can only find a single review of a Carrizo laptop. The review was before Intel Skylake processors had arrived, but based on the results and Intel's claims for Skylake CPU and GPU performance improvements over Broadwell, I would say that Carrizo is likely to fall well short of Skylake in both CPU and GPU performance. This means that Carrizo is basically DOA. AMD spoke of a few design wins for Carrizo, but that doesn't necessarily translate into significant sales. Zen will be more competitive with Skylake, and based on AMD's claimed performance gains, might even be comparable in performance. This is unlikely to be enough. Intel can simply undercut AMD in clearance pricing Skylake. Intel only needs to buy enough time for its 10 nm process to begin volume production in late 2017. Other initiatives that AMD announced at the earnings call are also symptomatic of the death spiral. Invariably, companies in the grips of the death spiral try selling off pieces of themselves to raise much needed cash. AMD has been doing this for years, and the joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics is just the latest example. Another example is the willingness to license or sell AMD intellectual property in the form of its patents. The problem with patent licensing is the problem with most of these kinds of cash raising activities. They simply reduce or eliminate the positive discriminators for the company's technology and therefore increase the longer-term downward momentum of the company. When I take in the big picture, the changes sweeping the semiconductor industry, the incredibly tough competition from Intel and Nvidia, and AMD's diminishing ability to execute, all I see is downside risk. Granted, AMD isn't dead yet, nor is death imminent. I can't rule out a turnaround, but I don't see how the company wrenches free of the death spiral. At one time I thought that Apple could be an " Angel Customer " for AMD by commissioning a custom SOC for the MacBook. This theme has even been taken up by another SA contributor, Sean Chandler. It can't be ruled out, and a custom Zen SOC with very enhanced graphics capability might offer an advantage over Skylake. The only way I see this working is if AMD gives Apple dibs on a custom Zen SOC ahead of its general release in 2017. This depends on AMD executing smartly on the custom chip to Apple's demanding specification and schedule requirements. Apple would need a Zen-based SOC in 2016 for it to be useful. It could still happen, but based on what we're seeing from AMD, I don't think that's in the cards. If there is such an effort underway at AMD, it has the potential to become a minor fiasco reminiscent of GT Advanced Technologies. At this point, investing in AMD in hopes of a turnaround and rich reward may not be absolutely crazy, but it skirts perilously close. I consider AMD a lost cause and a sell.
