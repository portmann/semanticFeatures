Apple: Moving On After The Taiwan Earthquake - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The Taiwan earthquake affected TSMC production, in particular the FAB14 that produces the Apple A10. Samsung has lost the A10 partial commission due to weak results compared to the TSMC product. The Taiwanese issue may push Apple to get back on track to differentiate the application processor production in order to avoid possible future delays. Apple may seriously consider to entrust the production to Samsung and Intel. The latter one has probably won a partial modem production for iPhone 7. Samsung and Intel may gain from this "apparently" small issue while Apple may build up its hardware ecosystem and drive down hardware costs. For TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) foundries, things initially did not look bad at all since the company stated that 95% of the business would have been back to normal within 2-3 days. However, things are different from the first reports and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be forced to change its supply strategy, favoring companies like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Some hours after the earthquake, TSMC declared the event did not affect its production in any major way and that AP production would have been back on track within 2-3 days. Obviously, given such a situation, there was no major concern about AP production and Apple supply for the iPhone 7. Further reportss in the mid of February sounded quite different, almost like an alarm bell: TSMC said it expects to meet its previous shipments and revenue target, but it has also said that next quarter shipments will be affected - more than 1% of production - and that the damage affecting FAB 14 is worse than expected. FAB 14 is the fab producing the Apple SoCs, and that is the main alarm bell. But I will get there later. TSMC also is ready to roughly double its 16nm production, increasing the wafer production capacity from 40k units in February to 80k units in March. This projection is consistent with previous roadmaps that state TSMC would have increased 16nm share from 40% to 70% of its production. The 16nm production would comprise the 16 FF (FinFET), the 16 FF+ (FinFET Plus) and the 16 FFC (FinFET Compact) process node. These technologies will be used for various customers such as Apple, Xilinx, Mediatek, HiSilicon, Spreadstrum and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). For Apple, TSMC is very likely the sole AP supplier for the next upcoming iPhone 7, powered by the future Apple A10 SoC. That is where the recent earthquake could bring different paths. Apple generally prefers to have different suppliers in order to avoid possible supply issues and to avoid annoying delays in device distribution. But this approach could bring up different issues: it is possible that the same AP design produced by different companies may lead to slightly different performances and possible complaints from consumers. That's what has happened with the Apple A9 produced by TSMC and Samsung. After last year's complaints, Apple decided to entrust the entire A10 production to TSMC, but we have seen that having a sole supplier may be a great risk and it has its limits against nature or worldwide dynamics. Apple has a lot of feasible paths to take after the earthquake: The Cupertino company may decide to get back to last year and to entrust part of the A11 production to Samsung, which looks to have FABs in safer positions and it has managed to win the Snapdragon 820 production against TSMC. It also may decide to entrust the entire production to Samsung, but this business move is unlikely to happen because it would mean having a sole supplier. It may decide to entrust part of the production to Samsung and to Intel since the latter one looks to have won 30-40% of the modem production for iPhone 7 (and probably iPhone 5SE). This could be problematic because TSMC-Samsung 10nm and Intel 10nm process nodes are quite different with the latter one being consistently denser: this would likely imply more problematic complaints than last year, It also may decide to entrust the entire production to Intel. While it would be a single producer, Apple would be able to exploit a denser and advanced process node. In any case, the chance that Apple will change its strategy is not foreign at all and the fact that Intel has probably won part of the modem production for iPhone 7, it may be a consistent hint. Apple also may exploit such an event to drive down the price per unit. It has already been reported that Intel was working hard on building a modem for future iPhones and I have already discussed such matter . Since people working on it have been stated to be around 1,000, the chance that Intel is trying to also win the Apple SoC design is more sensible and feasible now. Such a move would provide more supply stability and the chance to drive down the price per unit once Intel becomes a feasible contractor. At the same time, Samsung and Intel would meet a revenue and profit increase. On the contrary, TSMC and Qualcomm are the players with potential losses: Qualcomm would meet a consistent revenue decrease from the modem market, while TSMC would be hit twice by losing a big customer as Apple and by the production reduction for Qualcomm, since Intel is likely beginning to substitute Qualcomm's modems inside Apple devices. From this scenario, Apple may reach multiple targets: it will certainly reach a cost reduction for the AP units since Intel's presence will add additional pressure on TSMC and Samsung. The same target may be reached for the modems since Intel would add pressure on Qualcomm and Murata. If Apple will entrust the AP production to Intel, it will probably have a better performing SoC with the same base design (the LG Nuclun 2 preview showed that Intel design at 14nm was consistently faster than TSMC product with the same TDP - and Intel 10nm is likely to maintain the lead). Finally, since Intel is using 1,000 people to design the modem requested by Apple, it is very likely to be a custom modem, modeled to be effective with Apple APs and its platform. The latter one would be a typical approach for Apple. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in INTC over the next 72 hours.
