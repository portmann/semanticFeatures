Was The Recent Executive Shuffle Good For Intel Shareholders? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel's top ranks went through some reorganization with the departure of Renee James. Generally speaking, investors react negatively when top executives leave unless if there's some sort of succession plan or if this was broadly anticipated for quite some time. It's likely that this will further consolidate and simplify the decision making process for Intel's current CEO, Brian Krzanich. Investors have interpreted this as positive news. However, it puts further pressure on Brian to deliver a blowout on second half earnings. Otherwise, he'll be quickly out the door too. In recent months, boardrooms have become antsy with their CEOs and it's no wonder - people need something to believe in, especially when they're chasing after stocks on the back half of a multi-year market rally. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) recently had an executive shuffle, and it's not clear whether this will positively impact the company over a longer timeframe. Quoted from The wall Street Journal: Intel Corp. said President Renée James is stepping down to seek a chief executive job elsewhere, one of several management changes announced Thursday as CEO Brian Krzanich pushes the chip maker to move more quickly. Ms. James, 51-years-old, is one of the most prominent female executives in Silicon Valley and the highest-ranking woman ever at Intel. She agreed to stay until the end of the year to help with transition planning, Mr. Krzanich said in a letter to employees. In another high-profile change, longtime Intel Capital chief Arvind Sodhani, 61, would retire in January, the company said. The recent executive shuffle is a little hard to evaluate, so I decided to put on my reading glasses and go through some industry journals to get a better sense of how executive departures impact the price of a stock. For the most part, the reaction to the recent departure was positive as evidenced by the stock price, but generally speaking it's not always the case that this occurs. I think what differentiates this departure is that initially both Renee James and Brian Krzanich were tasked with running the company as Co-CEOs. However, according to the WSJ, Brian Krzanich was able to take over many of Renee's responsibilities. So, James' departure can be interpreted positively as she's become more redundant and less important in the day-to-day operations of the business. Furthermore it may give Brian added flexibility when making strategic decisions or larger acquisitions. In addition, when asked to name the key factors affecting an organization's reputation in the investment community, CEO reputation was among the top six factors cited. That was nearly on par with the company's historical reputation itself and more important than the brand equity of a company's products and services. When CEOs change, investors are more than twice as likely to sell shares in a company as they are to buy them. All things being equal, nearly 40% of investors said they would sell a stock solely on the basis of the new CEO, the FTI Consulting survey found, while only 15% said they would buy the stock on the same basis. Generally speaking executive transitions can be a little a tricky for shareholders. In this case, the positive response and the undulating confidence in Brian Krzanich shouldn't come to anyone's surprise as he's a pretty astute manager and has been able to pivot the company in the right direction. Mobile and enterprise are the two growth pillars for Intel at the present moment, and while the company has scaled back R&D, there's no denying that Intel had made inroads on both fronts in the past year. For the most part, I think shareholders can anticipate the stock to recover going into the end of the year. PC demand should stabilize following the launch of Windows 10. Also continuing share gains in mobile and ongoing growth in enterprise will lift the share price higher. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation and $36.22 price target.
