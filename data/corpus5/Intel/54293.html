AMD's Second Half Guidance Seems Unrealistic: Zen Will Not Topple Skylake - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD's financial guidance for the second half of 2015 could be too aggressive. The guidance contradicts what Intel's management team anticipates from PC Client in the second half of the current fiscal year. The update to roadmap for both Zen and Zen+ was intriguing. However, the performance gains will not keep pace with Skylake in 2015. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) offered really ambitious financial targets for the second half of 2015. It's not exactly clear whether AMD will meet its own financial projections, or whether the sell-side will buy into the optimistic forecasts from Wednesday's analyst day presentation. Despite the glittery graphics, and the convincing tone in which management presents its bold vision, I'm bearish. AMD has always over promised on its ability to improve its designs and processes. What usually ends up happening is a series of bottlenecks that prevents AMD from releasing a key product on time. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) pulls ahead and gains all the higher-end designs from OEMs. This has been the case for the past 10 years. I haven't seen anything that could convince me that this trend will somehow change. The company anticipates sales growth of 15% year-over-year in the back half of the year. I'm not completely sold. Intel wasn't nearly as optimistic with its own full-year guidance. And, quite frankly, there are only two CPU providers in the marketplace anyway. So we have to weigh the opinions of Intel's management team with more than just a bit of salt. For the most part, I felt that Intel was far more realistic on its revenue guidance despite having limited visibility into holiday season sales. Here's what Stacy Smith (CFO of Intel) mentioned earlier in the year: Turning to the full year 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat to 2014, down from the prior guidance mid-single-digit percentage growth. We're now projecting a mid-single-digit decline in the overall PC market. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group and NAND businesses, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. Intel anticipates that its growth will be flat year-over-year and will offset the negative growth from client computing group with NAND, data center, and Internet of things. Clearly, AMD has limited exposure to mobile, IoT, NAND and data centers, so I find AMD's reasoning of back half growth pretty erroneous. In fact, AMD is almost non-existent in servers, and its semi-custom business is on the front-end of a downward cycle due to falling ASPs for its APUs in console gaming devices. I anticipate console gaming devices to slow in growth as competing consumer electronics will tighten the available discretionary spending for premium gaming devices. Also, portable gaming devices are a rapidly shrinking market due to the rapid emergence and adoption of smartphone devices. AMD won't find niche opportunities worth expanding into with its current portfolio of semi-custom designs. I can't imagine a scenario where AMD will generate enough volume from smaller markets to offset the decline in pricing and volume it has experienced in consumer CPUs and GPUs. Also, the company forecasts an increase in gross margins - it plans to accomplish this with a mix-shift to premium products in servers and workstation graphics. However, it has been shown that both Intel and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) have developed superior enterprise grade hardware solutions. Intel plans to launch another generation of Xeon series chips pretty soon. And, needless to say, Nvidia has plans of improving its architecture to better utilize Direct X12, which is projected to improve frame rates per second by a considerable amount going into calendar year 2016. AMD plans to improve its platform efficiency, which is likely to be driven by improvements in the instruction per cycle and improvement in manufacturing process. It certainly helps that GlobalFoundries and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) are working in conjunction to deliver 14nm technologies. The combined scale of a joint fab gives AMD a reasonable shot at reasonable yields (assuming Global Foundries can meet the requirements of AMD's wafer supply agreement). The improvement in performance from Zen to Zen+ might not be as significant as the performance gain from Excavator to Zen. Much of the performance gains from improving CPU architecture already occurred between Zen and Excavator due to simultaneous multithreading, which is similar to Intel's hyper threading. So, it's more likely that Zen+ (based on the naming cadence) is just a die shrink of the pre-existing architecture. Intel wasn't able to accomplish significant IPC gains from Haswell to Broadwell with a simple die shrink, but was able to squeeze in some power efficiency gains due to duty cycling control. Skylake will directly confront Zen on a more advanced node with superior architecture (when working under the assumption of a second half 2015 launch). Early reports on Intel's upcoming line-up of CPUs are extremely promising. AMD may hold onto some of the PC market with Zen and Zen+. AMD certainly is not dead, and its update on the roadmap is pretty helpful for investors and speculators. However, I don't think the back half financial figures are going to be remotely accurate as we're still months way from supply chain confirmation. Overall, I'm still bearish on AMD. The transition to Zen will not close the performance gap to Skylake. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
