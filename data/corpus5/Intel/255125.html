Intel And Solid State Drives: A Winning Strategy - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is expanding its NAND production capacity by 50%, signaling its intention to take more market share. Several months ago I wrote an article outlining the tremendous opportunity Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) faces in the non-volatile memory market (NAND storage) and more specifically in solid state drives (SSD). It's no secret that Intel has faced several headwinds during the past few years. PC sales are stagnating, and with them chip sales to PC OEMs. Intel's efforts to win substantial share in the mobile processor market also hit a brick wall. First Intel missed the mobile train. Then it paid heavy subsidies to win market share in the tablet market, a strategy that backfired when tablet sales suddenly began to decline roughly 18 months ago. Thus, despite putting enormous resources into penetrating the tablet market, Intel enjoyed only a short-term increase in mobile sales. Without growth, its mobile business is having a hard time turning a profit. Intel needs to grow profitably. In order to secure its long-term future, it has to build on its expertise in manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs). In the previous article, I identified the SSD market as one that Intel has a high probability of winning. Intel has 8.9% of the market today. By investing substantial resources today, it can become a member of the oligopoly that will own the SSD market in the future. It's important to note that Western Digital rose to the No. 2 position by acquiring SanDisk, which controls 11.1% of the market. Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba rule the HDD market. I believe the triumvirate of the SSD market will be Intel, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ). (Western Digital is thus a very interesting play, but this is a topic for another article.) Let's put a figure on this opportunity. The SSD market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 40% for several years, from $15B in 2015 to about $230B in 2022, according to this research . If Intel wins 40% market share, just a few years from now its SSD business alone could have revenues of $100B. This would roughly triple the company's total revenues. Intel's Strategy: Expand and Acquire Intel's competitive edge is its expertise in technology design and manufacturing. By controlling both manufacturing and design, Intel can be one of several companies that control the entire value chain of SSDs. A few weeks ago, Intel made the jaw-dropping announcement that it will invest up to $5.5B to transition its fab in Dalian, China, to non-volatile memory. TrendForce indicates the fab will have a capacity of roughly 420,000 wafer starts per month. According to Nomura Research, 70% of global NAND output goes to SSDs. In 2015, Samsung will produce roughly 340,000 wafers per month, or roughly 28% of global capacity. Source: Nomura Global Memory Research This means that at its initial output rate, the Dalian fab can supply 4-5% of the SSD market. It will increase Intel's SSD output by ~50% and grow the company's market share to ~14%, depending on when the fab starts producing. Thus the expansion strategy is visible. The acquisition strategy is less clear. As Western Digital demonstrated, acquisition is paramount for players aiming to dominate either the HDD market or the SSD market. Now that SanDisk has been acquired, I believe Intel can go in several directions. It can continue building its own production facilities and acquire smaller vendors and their books of business. Those vendors are usually fabless and assemble SSDs from NAND they acquire from other producers. Intel could acquire Micron's NAND business. This is unlikely given the structure of Micron's production facility and its product mix. I believe Intel decided to invest in its own production facility because it fears Micron may be acquired by an Asian player, putting at risk Intel's access to Micron's NAND. Intel's $5.5B investment in Fab 68 shows its commitment to SSD. I believe its strategy is to grow its market share toward 20% in the first stage and to 40% over the long haul. SSD will be a core Intel business and a large profit center that will supply the company with capital to grow sales and revolutionize technology in its other businesses. Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) will likely suffer greatly. The announcement about the Dalian fab probably caused considerable turmoil in the boardroom. I truly believe Micron is getting cornered. Its options will gradually fade away. If Micron doesn't sell its entire business, it will eventually move away from manufacturing NAND. Continuously reading the business map is crucial for long-term investing. I believe Intel faces an enormous opportunity in the SSD market. It's proving by its actions that it intends to make the most of it. The SSD market will yield profits that the company can use to maintain leadership in the processor market and achieve success in mobile.
