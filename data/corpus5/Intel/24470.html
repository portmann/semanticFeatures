When Will AMD's Technology Process Catch Up To Intel's? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha From the eyes of anyone interested in the semiconductor industry, AMD appears to be so far behind Intel that it will never catch up. AMD still uses an aging 28nm process while Intel produces its own chips with 14nm FinFET technology. The question everyone is asking AMD: â€œWhen will you adopt FinFET and transition to a lower node?". This question isn't going to go away anytime soon, but here I address why the transition is taking so long and give my guess as to when AMD finally transitions. In 2009, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) spun off its fabs to alleviate itself from the financial burdens of maintaining such facilities, but this forced AMD to rely on the progress of outside manufacturers like TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and GlobalFoundries, companies that have far trailed behind Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) until recently. Although Intel recently moved to 14nm last October, TSMC and GlobalFoundries have been ramping up their efforts. Global Foundries and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) have begun ramping their own 14nm FinFET process for customers as of earlier this month, and TSMC debuted its 20nm planar process back in September with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6. The fabs may have closed the gap against Intel, but AMD doesn't seem to be taking advantage of this, as its upcoming APUs, Carrizo and Carrizo-L will be using the same old 28nm transistor size that it's been using for the last three years. This only drags out AMD's biggest wonder as of lately: When will it adopt FinFET and transition to a smaller node? A special thanks to fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Technology Investing for helping me grasp the topic much better. AMD receives its wafers from both Global Foundries and TSMC, but almost entirely from the former due to a take-or-pay wafer supply agreement. These companies have been unsuccessful in keeping up with Intel's rapid node shrinks over the years, at least until recently. TSMC was stuck on 28nm for two years after Intel debuted 22nm in 2012, and only this month has GlobalFoundries replaced its own 28nm process with a 14nm FinFET wafer, licensed from Samsung. When it comes to FinFET, TSMC isn't even there yet, and Global Foundries' latest 14LPE is basically still a beta for early adopters that can't wait for the more mature, faster, a better yielding (cheaper) 14LPP replacement arriving later this year. These delays may have hurt companies like AMD one or two years ago, but why now? If Apple can receive 20nm wafers from TSMC from as early as last September, why can't AMD receive and utilize this technology for Carrizo and Carrizo-L? To start, Carrizo is out of the question because it is based on AMD's high-performance Bulldozer architecture, which isn't suitable for the low-power 20nm process. However, Carrizo-L, which is based on the low-power Puma architecture, could utilize this process, but AMD may not have been able to afford the transition. AMD generally has a take-or-pay wafer supply agreement with Global Foundries in order to receive a nice fixed price, and offloading some supply to TSMC's 20nm process may affect AMD's ability to produce Carrizo-L at the lowest possible cost, which is a vital element since these are low-end, low-margins parts. Global Foundries just started shipping 14LPE, which I suspect is more than suitable for Carrizo, however it is probably just as uneconomical. As mentioned before, 14LPE is far from perfect and the costs are currently high. Furthermore, AMD is using its Bulldozer architecture to target mid-range laptops, which are also low-margin chips that make it difficult for AMD to achieve value through the new technology. If these were high-performance, high-margin parts used to replace AMD's old FX chips this could be possible, but the latest Bulldozer design is emphasized for laptops. Above 25 watts as seen in the image below, the part starts to consume more energy than its predecessor, Kaveri, making it unviable for desktops. There's just no way that AMD can compete with Intel on the high-end without a whole new architecture. AMD has repeatedly stated that there's much room to grow on the 28nm process, and this has been true with what we've seen so far. Both AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) have been stuck with 28nm, except that Nvidia is known to be moving to TSMC's 16FF+ technology next year. While on 28nm, we have seen examples of performance and power consumption improvements made on a design level, rather than through a traditional node shrink. With Nvidia's latest Maxwell architecture, we saw an enormous, unpredictable leap forward in power efficiency while using the same 28nm process. Many are suspecting that AMD will replicate this achievement with its upcoming 300 series GPUs. Even with AMD's upcoming Carrizo and Carrizo-L technologies, AMD explained that its new High-Density Library design with Excavator (the latest Bulldozer version) is 23% smaller and uses less power while on the same node. AMD is able to fill this space with more GPU horsepower and also noted that Carrizo is a very big leap forward in terms of power consumption. AMD is in a very tight spot with very, very little wiggle room. To manage its cost and stay afloat, the company has lowered R&D and dramatically cut the line of products it is working on. In the PC space, it's gone from covering everything from encompassing high-end desktops to tablets, to covering merely low-to-mid range laptops. AMD's Bulldozer failure is largely to blame for this, and AMD doesn't have a replacement for this architecture until 2016. Until then, AMD has been resorting to tactics that will allow it to stay afloat and generate some cash. This is the big risk regarding AMD's future, but many including myself are highly optimistic about the upcoming architectures, Zen and K12. We can't tell for sure, but should AMD succeed, it will dramatically improve its flexibility, which will allow it to finally adopt better transistor technologies. This will likely be the case, and if so I suspect that AMD will debut its Zen and K12 processors with GlobalFoundries 14LPP process that will launch later this year.
