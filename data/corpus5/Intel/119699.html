AMD Is In Serious Trouble, But There's Still Hope - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD reported Q2 earnings after the close on Thursday. The company underperformed even its own lackluster revised guidance. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) reported earnings after the close on Thursday, and the results were unsurprisingly dreary. Even after issuing a warning just ten days ago and guiding lower revenue and gross margin than originally expected, the company managed to underwhelm expectations. As guided, revenue declined 8% sequentially from last quarter, marking both the fifth straight quarter of declining revenue and the first quarter in years since AMD has reported quarterly revenue below $1 billion. The revenue decline was attributed to the decline of the PC market, which impacted APU sales to OEMs. I guess you can consider the 8% Q/Q "expected", because management warned about it on July 6th, but it is still very disappointing to see. Speaking of disappointing, in its warning to investors, AMD lowered its expected gross margin from 32% down to 28%, yet the 25% gross margin for the quarter was even lower than the revised estimate. Net loss for the quarter was $181 million, or a $0.23 loss per share. The warning all but guaranteed a net loss for AMD this quarter, and even before the warning, it was unlikely, at best, that the company would come close to breaking even. One of the few bright spots for AMD was its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom results. Revenue increased 13% sequentially due to higher sales of semi-custom SoCs, and fell 8% year-over-year mainly due to decreased server sales. For Q3, management guided for a sequential revenue increase of 6% (+/- 3%), or approximately $998 million, below a consensus estimate of $1.05 billion. This mirrors Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) guidance for higher Q3 revenues over Q2, and might be signaling a gradual bottoming of the decline of the PC market. 2015 is pretty much out of sight and out of mind for AMD (and should be for AMD investors as well), and 2016 will most likely be the company's best shot at recovering some market share from Intel. As I mentioned in my previous article on AMD, 2016 will be a decisive year for the company's future and its very survival. With massive debt looming, revenue and gross margin declining and no earnings to speak of, AMD is rapidly approaching a crossroads. If the company can't pull something out of the hat next year, terminal decline is almost guaranteed (barring a buyout before it goes bankrupt). Luckily for AMD investors, the company has a legitimate shot at being competitive in 2016, especially with its newest x86 processor code-named "Zen". Intel just announced on Wednesday that it would be pushing its first 10nm offering (code-named "Cannonlake") out until late 2017, as opposed to its earlier expected arrival date of late 2016 or early 2017. As I wrote in an article on Thursday, by cutting capex by $1 billion, and therefore delaying 10nm into late 2017, Intel has passed up a great opportunity to deal the final blow to AMD. By pushing Cannonlake off into late 2017, Intel is giving AMD a chance for Zen to gain market share and reintroduce AMD into relevancy. It's a long shot, to be sure, as Intel has already had Broadwell and Skylake to perfect its 14nm architecture, and will have a third generation of 14nm chips (code-named "Kaby Lake") come to market in late 2016. Considering that AMD is just now developing Zen, its first 14nm chip, the experience advantage is on Intel's side. However, being stuck on 20nm and 28nm for a long time, AMD engineers have had more copious experience in optimizing existing architecture, so it will be interesting to see who comes out on top in 2016. According to AMD's updated roadmap , 2016 will see Zen and 7th-generation desktop and mobile APUs and GPUs on a FinFET process, and 2016-2017 will see Zen+, if you will, ARM CPU K12 and a "high-performance server APU". With these offerings and the company's new capability to produce with FinFET technology, a comeback by AMD for 2016-2017 is not at all out of the question. It will be a hard road back from the brink, but it is by no means impossible. If AMD takes a dive after earnings, I am thinking about buying shares. At that point, the risk/reward trade-off will be favorable enough for me to take a gamble. If anything, I don't think that the US government will allow AMD to implode completely, because that would leave Intel as the sole x86 processor producer in the market. That is a bad situation for consumers and for OEMs. With only one supplier, OEM margins will fall, and the costs of this will be partially passed on further to the consumer. For this reason, it is likely that OEMs will be more inclined to award AMD design wins. If the technology is somewhat similar in capability, OEMs will have a greater incentive to give revenue towards AMD to ensure that there remain two suppliers in the market. A vital 2016-2017 is coming for AMD, and how it executes could very well make or break the company. There are still many risks involved, but if the company can perform well in the coming year, there is substantial upside. AMD reported disappointing earnings, as expected. Investors should look towards 2016, which could be an inflection point for the company and the stock. It will not be an easy battle, nor one for the faint of heart, but investors that don't fear risk should consider AMD as a possible turnaround.
