Intel's Skylake Processors Arrived, But With Some Questions - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel launched its 6th generation Skylake processor a month ago, and major OEMs will launch a host of laptops powered by the processor this month. The obvious question now is where does Skylake fit into the Haswell-Broadwell equation? Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) launched its Core i7-6700k Skylake processor a month ago. In August the chipmaker revealed at the gaming tradeshow Gamescon in Germany that the sixth generation Skylake processors in the form of Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K are coming. The wait is over. Major OEMs such as HP (NYSE: HPQ ) and Dell will launch a host of laptops powered by the 6th generation Skylake processors this month. Selling Skylake could be a challenge for Intel given it has also launched lots of CPUs based on Broadwell earlier this year. Since Skylake represents a giant leap with microarchitecture redesign, industry observers will closely watch whether the successor to the Broadwell microarchitecture, a "tock" in the Intel's "tick-tock" cadence, succeeds in attracting customers amid an unfavorable economic climate, particularly outside the U.S. Where does Skylake fit into the Haswell-Broadwell equation? Broadwell, the codename of Intel's 5th generation microarchitecture, is actually the 14 nanometer die shrink successor of the company's 4th generation Haswell microarchitecture. Skylake is Intel's 6th generation microarchitecture which also uses the 14 nanometer manufacturing process, like Broadwell. Earlier this year in January, Intel launched 14 new dual-core mobile processors ranging from Celeron/Pentium to Core i3, i5 and i7 based on Broadwell microarchitecture. In June, the company launched 10 new quad-core desktop and mobile processors based on the same microarchitecture. This in essence means that Intel has rolled out almost the full family of Broadwell processors in phases throughout the year, only the highest end version of Broadwell will be coming in the first quarter of 2016 or slightly later. Intel didn't launch any low-end desktop processors based on Broadwell, the previous generation Haswell will continue to fill that space. With Broadwell involving a die shrink over 22 nanometer Haswell, a "tick" in the Intel's "tick-tock" sequence, the 5th generation processors launched throughout the year are smaller with improved battery life. As far as performance is concerned, Haswell-based tablets, laptops and desktops are fast enough for everyday computing including media performance. However, Broadwell is certainly capable of delivering improved graphics performance, particularly for high-end gaming. The moot question, however, is where does Skylake fit into the Haswell-Broadwell equation? Many industry watchers believe the process shrink to 14 nanometer didn't translate into improvement in longevity with Broadwell. I am almost sure the same old question will be asked again for Skylake, will it lead to improved longevity? I believe it will. Why? Because Intel promised Skylake will deliver 20% performance improvement and 30% battery life improvement over Broadwell. With such improvement in performance, I am sure Intel has also dealt with the longevity issue with microarchitecture redesign. Sadly, this won't solve the actual question, where does Skylake fit into the equation? To be more specific, with the Haswell-Broadwell duo delivering great performance in every facet of computing from improved battery life to improved media and graphics performance, why would people opt for Skylake? Those who have already been shifted to Broadwell, what would drive them to discard it and upgrade to Skylake when it's been only a few months they have been shifted to Broadwell? On top of that, upgrading will be costly, since Skylake requires new motherboard with microarchitecture redesign. Further, since Intel won't launch the highest end version of Broadwell before the first quarter of 2016, Haswell will continue to be sold. With Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) offering free upgrade to Windows 10 which the company claims doesn't require processor upgrade, there is a possibility that existing Haswell-Broadwell users won't get enough incentive to upgrade to Skylake. However, Skylake offers a few features that are absent in the earlier generations, such as Thunderbolt 3 data transfer, DDR4 memory support, wireless charging and enhanced security using biometric authentication. Kirk Skaugen, the general manager of Intel's Client Computing Group, said that Windows 10 and Skylake processors were designed together. He said in an interview , "This is something that only happens once every decade or so." Skaugen believes Skylake along with Windows 10 will drive positive sales for both Intel and Microsoft. Some industry insiders I know believe that Skylake will eventually have a negative impact on Broadwell sales since Skylake offers advanced features, as just mentioned. However, I don't think it would be as simple as that. An article in VR World opined that Intel might have done with the "tick-tock" strategy, at least for the time being. An excerpt from the article: The slowdown or a dissolve of Tick-Tock cadence is set to continue in 2016 and 2017, as recently, Benchlife.info leaked that Intel plans to introduce Kaby Lake, yet another 14nm processor. This would mean Intel cadence finally slowed from Tick-Tock to Tock (Sandy Bridge, 32nm) - Tick (Ivy Bridge, 22nm) - Tock (Haswell, 22nm) - Tick (Broadwell, 14nm) - Tock or Tick? (Skylake, 14nm) - Tick (Kaby Lake, 14nm) - Tick (Ice Lake, 10nm) - Tick (Cannonlake, 10nm). That's a whole lot of ticks. Yes, lots of "ticks" are in the offing. The fact is that going forward Intel will continue to sell older version processors even when it will launch newer versions. This is a marketing strategy known as product differentiation. With its competitors offering similar processors, product differentiation will help Intel retain market share. Launch of Skylake will mark a new era for Intel's microprocessor marketing strategy wherein Haswell-Broadwell-Skylake will coexist together, and this is just the beginning. I strongly believe Intel will continue to lead the microprocessor market in the foreseeable future. Its shares are trading at one-year forward price to earnings multiple of 13.8x, and at one-year forward price to sales multiple of 2.7x, which imply they are reasonably valued. Intel's strong product pipeline including Kaby Lake, Ice Lake and Cannonlake makes it a "screaming buy." We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
