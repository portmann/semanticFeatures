Qualcomm: Buy Rating With A $100 Target - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha The main question for Qualcomm's stock performance, we believe, is when will revenue growth begin to go positive again. We think that underlying business could actually see an inflection in end demand growth numbers in Q4 which will drive Qualcomm's results. Before that, though, Qualcomm revenues have the chance to surprise as they re-sign customers that stopped paying after the Chinese government accused them of anti-trust. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has gone through a period of multiple issues which has dragged results and the stock price. We think, over the next year, those issues can turn into drivers. As those drivers take hold in combination with lapping weak results, Qualcomm could begin to show an inflection point in revenue growth. We believe that is the key driver to cause investors to need to own Qualcomm, a market leader, again. We will review each step of why the stock has become out of favor and the drivers that, we believe, will sway back fundamentals and investors. 1) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Revenues Slowing We know that Apple revenues have been slowing. Apple made up 45% of Qualcomm revenues in 2015 ( 10K ). As Apple's revenues have slowed, Qualcomm has had a slowing impact on their sell-in to Apple. Below is the quarterly trend of Apple revenues. IDC has said that Q1'16 global smartphone growth slowed to .2% which was down from 10.4% growth in 2015 down from 28.4% in 2014 . Of which, Qualcomm has, by far, the largest market share of 3G and 4G chip technology. As goes the market so goes Qualcomm. Qualcomm, with the market, has also seen its revenues slow and go negative. China began investigating anti-competitive claims at the turn of 2014 . Those claims materially slowed business for Qualcomm. Even though Qualcomm continued to sell in to clients they had difficulty collecting or knowing if they were going to collect. The stock price peaked soon after as the case weighed on investor sentiment and business trends. The case was resolved in February 2015 but Qualcomm continued to have difficulty collecting from customers in China. In many cases, when they collected on a sale they did not book them to revenues because they did not know what the outcome of the enforcement would be. As for revenues, revenues started to go negative year-over-year in the June quarter of 2015. You can see in the chart above that is when the stock started to accelerate on the downside. This is also why we believe that positive revenue growth will help repair the stock price. 1) There may be a new driver to market share in Asia taking share from Apple. Apple owns the premium segment but the fastest growth in Asia is coming from lower priced smartphone devices. While the overall market has been slowing, low-end device makers have been growing. According to Qualcomm, they actually have less content per unit when selling in to Apple than they do in other vendors. Because of that Qualcomm can begin to grow again. As low-end vendors take share, the mix of customers that have a higher content per phone of Qualcomm chips increases. Samsung , Huawei and OPPO all have phones that sell in Asia for about half the price of Apple . While the overall market is seeing growth slow (.2% in the right column), the lower end players are taking share (Look at their year over year change versus the market). Even Samsung with -.6% growth is taking share from Apple -16.3%. That means Qualcomm's content is gaining share because they generally will have more content per unit of players outside of Apple. The chart above also shows lower end players gaining share. As has been reported , (see Mark Hibben's Report after the Mobile World Congress In Barcelona) Qualcomm has been a big winner at multiple vendors, outside of Apple. Qualcomm has wins from many of the vendors listed above. We think they will continuously win especially after a strong showing earlier this year at Mobile World Congress. We think the huge demand for performance driven by huge data demand growth , will force vendors to have to go with best-in-class chip performance. Step 1's conclusion, Apple's pain is Qualcomm's gain, in a way. Apple slowing still hurts but when growth rates at the low end overtake premium declines, the overall market will grow and content per device can increase for Qualcomm. 2) The overall market could pick up as well. We will hit an inflection point when premium phones that are slowing will be overtaken by low end growth as they take over market share numbers. We think we need to lap this year's strong Apple comparisons before that happens. When we finally lap Apple's huge numbers in Asia from last year, the slowdown of the premium market will ease its influence on the overall market slowdown. That will happen after the September quarter or 4 months away (you see in the chart above that the last difficult comparisons are in September). The excercise to see revenues grow is part qualitative (low end picking up share) and part numeric (that premium declines will stop being a drag on overall share soon). Stock prices discount in advance but we already have visibility that the share shifts from premium to low end are in effect, which has slowed the overall market. That overall market slowdown will end, we believe, after these comparisons are lapped. That will give an upward bias to overall growth led by the low-end growth numbers. We also think that Q1'16 numbers may have been held back by the economic and stock market downside in Asia in Q1. Now that markets have stopped going down, consumer confidence may have normalized somewhat. Qualcomm said that they only collected from 56% of their customers in China in 2015. They said they expected to have that number reach 75% this year. That said, they did not include that in their forecasts. China made up 53% of their overall revenues ( 10K ). The company guided to 5.2B - 6B of revenues for next quarter. The street is at 5.57B . That said the company expects that 20% of that 53% will come on to revenues just by collecting from customers already purchasing their chips. That is 10% additional revenue growth this year to the overall revenue base. Add to that, as they bring these customers back as paying customers, they will account for past revenues that they either received and did not book (because of the lack of clarity if they would be allowed to keep those revenues) or revenues that they did not collect at all as customers used the excuse of government action not to pay. Customers either owe them money or Qualcomm did not book cash as revenues, holding back results. As these customers sign back on there will be current revenues received and catch-up revenues booked that will drive earnings. You can start to see the path to growing revenues again. Keep in mind, the high end of Qualcomm's revenue range actually already calls for revenue growth, which may be upside to our thesis. We begin to lap last year's slower numbers just as we are going to start to collect from customers that are already purchasing chips. As we get deeper into the easier comparisons, in combination with increased collections, revenues have the ability, based on that alone to start to go positive in Q4. Add to that what we said about share-shifts to the low end helping end market demand in Q4 which they will book in Q1 (there is a lag in some of their recognition). We have three meaningful drivers to revenues coming in about two quarters (comparisons, collections, share shifts). Short interest is not high but it has jumped of late ( up 21% ). The stock has traded off after earnings in each quarter over the last two years. Add to that it is $20 off of its 2014 high. It is fair to say sentiment likely has room for upside. Qualcomm's PE of late was 17.5x. Before 2012 it averaged 20x or more. The street is expecting $4.64 for Fiscal September 2017. We ran some numbers and it is not hard to get above that if some of the items we mentioned above go well. That means that 20x 4.80-5.00 can get you up to $100 or 80% upside. That said, 90% of SA readers are looking ahead ( If you vote you can see the overall sentiment of SA readers). The company has missed, guided down, and disappointed many times over the last two years. You need to be ready for that. You need to be prepared for the stock disapointing on earnings and looking passed that to a future pick up. Analysts on last earnings call were annoyed with management that they were not flowing through to guidance the extra collection revenues in China. Analysts thought it was conservative. The company claims that it is reasonable given the difficulty they have had to date of collections and they don't want to expect too much. If collections continue to be a problem revenues may be stuck in the mud. The overall market can continue its descent to lower, negative numbers. We showed the immense slowdown in overall growth. Even if the low end wins share, if the market descends to negative numbers, the low end growth will not help Qualcomm get back to growth. There is huge competition for chipset makers to win devices. Qualcomm has been up against their own customers as well as Intel and other huge names to hold and gain share. This can change at any moment. That said, we think that Qualcomm seems to be showing important design win momentum and we think that will be a shield near-term. Review of the stair steps to revenue growth, the key ingredient for stock performance 1. Low end taking share where Qualcomm has more content per device 2. Low end revenue growth overtaking premium revenue declines 3. Larger content per device of the market share winners, less content per device of market share losers 4. Make up revenues and booking older revenues from large customers that are already buying after settling anti-trust issues 5. Q2 economic bounce back in Asia and the world 6. Holiday period re-emergence of overall growth led by low end and easier comparisons 7. Overall 3g and 4g growth from legacy 2g in emerging markets 8. India and rest of Asia driving growth next year There are plenty of drivers that are stacking up including easy comparisons, share shifts, and China payment collections that can help Qualcomm's revenues go positive again. There are plenty of risks and Qualcomm has disappointed Wall Street for two years straight so this is not an easy journey. That said, given likely bearish sentiment, if this market leader can get back on track, we think, everybody will need to own Qualcomm again.
