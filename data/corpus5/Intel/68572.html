Intel Adds Momentum To Servers: The Growth Story Is Not Over - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The upcoming launch of Purely will sustain Intel's advantage in servers. The upcoming Skylake based Xeon chips will further Intel's competitive advantage. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) remains one of my better investment ideas in 2015. While volatility will roll through the markets during the summer months, for those who have the patience and tolerance to buy and hold outperformance following a period of negative returns seems highly likely. Intel is in the early innings of growth in the smartphone and storage space, and will likely return to a low yet respectable growth rate in the PC client group. Furthermore, server-chips have the potential to grow at a brisker pace assuming hyper scale IaaS providers are able to scale the unique cost to performance advantage of Intel's upcoming Skylake architecture. This all translates into high single-digit revenue growth rates, and double digit EPS growth, as the mix-shift to server CPUs will add significant cost leverage, therefore, increasing margins. I anticipate that this pattern will play out over the next five years, despite some moderate cyclicality in PC demand. The stock trades at 14 times trailing earnings, with reasonable prospects of bottom line expansion due to some modest acceleration in the share buyback program. The broader PC market needs to show modest signs of recovery, for earnings to expand. Various macro factors like lower energy prices, higher levels of consumer confidence, refresh in product features could add momentum to demand in the back half of the year. Admittedly Brian Krzanich told various members of the media that he doesn't anticipate Windows 10 to drive much growth in shipment volume. However, it's not exactly clear who's going to be right or wrong on this topic, as upstream OEMs like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) and Microsoft (NYSE: MFT ) are much more confident in the potential impact on volume than Intel. However, to give Brian some credit, I think that if PCCG were to report flat year-over-year comps, the other business categories will pick up enough volume or narrow losses enough to drive bottom line expansion, which is why I disagree with the thought process of sell-side analysts when it comes to FY 2015 earnings. The upcoming Purley platform will be the biggest advance since Nehalem architecture. The increased memory bandwidth, CPU sockets, and integration of FPGAs into its design will give unprecedented performance scaling. It will be the biggest platform shift witnessed to date, and with a 2017 launch - the ongoing lead in technology will continue. The upcoming Xeon E-5 and E-7 V5 series will have a significant architectural and node advantage from prior generation Xeons. However, the first set of Skylake server-class chips will be the single-socketed variation, and will be launched in the October to November timeframe. Intel will be integrating FPGAs into its motherboards, which will give Intel the ability to scale performance even when compared to RISC-based systems, which have edged out Intel in performance by operating on a different software layer when pertaining to the server OS (middleware is a huge factor here). In a recent presentation by Intel, the company announced that they had a significant edge in comparison to RISC architecture, which may woo some CTOs to white box vendors selling Intel and Windows Server based systems. IBM and Oracle won't be able to hide behind RISC based architecture for much longer. Field programmable arrays (FPGAs), when altered using HDL (hardware design language), can improve performance in specific use cases. FPGAs are similar to application specific integrated circuits, but unlike ASICs, the FPGAs are re-programmable to varying uses, whereas ASICs are stuck with the same hardware design. With a combination of FPGAs, add-in-boards, and multi-socket CPUS, Intel will build an advantage in HPC (high performance computing). I anticipate that Xeon series CPUs will continue to edge out AMD Opterons in read intensive situations where data retrieval is more important. So, in general Intel's solutions will continue to appeal in every varying circumstance that could potentially materialize for white box venders of servers, or hyper scale providers like Amazon and Microsoft. The performance-oriented crowd, i.e. Universities, and R&D labs will get a combination of Altera branded FPGAs and Intel Xeon series CPUs in their super computers following the integration of both components on the Purley platform. It also doesn't hurt that Intel will be integrating add-in-board for graphics, creating a truly comprehensive platform for any large-scale super or mainframe computer. The added momentum in the server CPU line-up gives me great conviction in Intel's long-term growth trajectory. Admittedly, PCCG will either be flat to negative depending on the impact of a Windows 10 launch. The consolidated bottom line should grow, as server revenue is more heavily weighted on gross margin impact. I plan to release additional details on what I think revenue and earnings will look like, over the summer. I'm still bullish on Intel, and I think that investors will be pleasantly surprised over a multi-year holding period.
