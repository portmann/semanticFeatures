Intel Inside Xiaomi's Upcoming MacBook-Like Linux Laptop - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Chinaâ€™s top vendor of smartphones, Xiaomi, is reportedly working on releasing its own laptop product. Xiaomi will allegedly use a custom version of the Linux OS for its first 15-inch notebook. The world's fourth largest smartphone vendor (no.1 in China), Xiaomi, is again rumored to be coming up with a notebook PC. The supply-chain sources of Digitimes reported yesterday that Xiaomi will launch a laptop in China next year. Inventec and Foxconn are helping Xiaomi develop a 15-inch laptop that uses a customized Linux OS. It will offer high-performance but will sell for less than $500 in China. The decision to use an open source OS is likely because Xiaomi will not never get approval from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to modify the Windows 10 operating system. Xiaomi was only able to develop its custom Android MIUI ROM because of the Android Open Source Program (AOSP) project. I now speculate that Xiaomi's laptop will use an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 processor, not an ARM-based one. The $471 price point claimed for the Xiaomi notebook insinuates it will have (at least) the same CPU/GPU build of the consumer-centric Microsoft Surface 3. The $499 tablet/notebook hybrid Surface 3 uses Intel's latest 14nm Atom X7-Z8700 ($35/tray) processor. My theory that Xiaomi will likely use an x86 processor is also because Intel has emerged as the top contributor to the development of the standard Linux OS kernel. As we can see from the chart below, Intel's open-source engineers/coders contributed 10,108 codes to the Linux 3.15 kernel, more than 10x the contribution of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ). Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), which supplies ARM-based processors to Xiaomi phones, is not even among the top 20 contributors to Linux kernel development. Intel is obliged to make sure its x86/x64 processors deliver the best compatibility /performance on Linux computers. Intel makes billions out of supplying processors to server farms. Linux's share of the lucrative enterprise server market was already 28.5% since early 2014. On the consumer level, Intel has been diligent in issuing updated software drivers. All the top laptops reviewed by experts with the best compatibility /performance with Linux OS are using Intel processors. Xiaomi, if it wants to makes its laptop competitive against established brands like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), will also need Intel processors to ensure enhanced Linux compatibility. To avoid future customer complaints, a Xiaomi Linux laptop needs to be compatible with the most amount of third-party hardware (printers, scanners, USB peripherals, etc...) and software. Another motivation for Xiaomi to use x86 processor on its Linux computer is its compatibility with Wine . Wine is a Windows application compatibility layer software that lets people run Windows-only software and games on Linux computers. Xiaomi, even if its uses its own custom Linux operating system, will still find it prudent to make its laptop compatible with Wine. Aside from gaming purposes, many Linux computer owners use industry-standard Windows-only software from Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) and Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ). The screenshot below reveals that many creative professionals like using Windows-only graphic software on Linux laptops/desktops using Wine. The economic benefit to Intel from Xiaomi expanding its empire to notebook PCs is very obvious. Xiaomi is now a globally-renowned brand that rivals the iconic charm of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Xiaomi's initial success came from selling sub-$400 high-end Android phones that look like iPhones. The rumor before was that Xiaomi was developing a copycat version of Apple's high-end MacBook Ai, which touts Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM. However, a dual approach of selling both entry level and high-end Linux Xiaomi notebooks is something I would expect from Xiaomi. This company had tremendous success selling $80 Android phones in China. The same non-discriminatory approach could also be applied by Xiaomi to its future PC products. Unlike Apple who only focuses on affluent buyers, Xiaomi is brave enough to cater to all sorts of customers. Selling a $399 Linux-powered clone of the $1,299 MacBook 2015 laptop is possible with the $35/tray Intel Atom X7-Z8700 processor. The MacBook 2015 uses the more expensive $281/tray 1.2 GHz Intel Core-M processor. Xiaomi needs Intel to make it big on notebooks. The winning advantage of Intel's x86 processor architecture is its universal native hardware compatibility with Linux, Windows, Chrome OS, Android, and Mac OS. This is something that RISC ARM-based chip producers has yet to match. Event the smartest geniuses at Microsoft had to create a special Windows 10 Mobile OS version because most Windows phone today are stuck with Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM-based processors. INTC is a Buy. Winning Xiaomi as a long-term processor client would certainly boost Intel's PC chip sales. There are millions of low/middle-income Chinese buyers that will snap up a sub-$500 MacBook clone from Xiaomi.Global expansion of this product is also a possibility. Apple can continue to sell its $1,200++ laptops to affluent customers and Xiaomi will target buyers who can only afford $500 price tags. Apple has persistently tolerated Xiaomi's habit of copycatting its phones and tablets . I therefore expect Xiaomi to get away again with a Linux-powered replica of the MacBook next year. As per the report of Digitimes, Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) will be the one who could suffer from Xiaomi's entry into notebook computers. Lenovo currently has 20-25% share in Chinese laptop sales. Xiaomi's expert use of the hunger marketing strategy for its phones has helped it trounce Apple, Lenovo, Samsung, and Huawei in China. Xiaomi's global smartphone shipments for Q2 2015 is also greater than that of Lenovo's. Xiaomi's brand power is now strong enough to expand smartphones. Intel also still benefits in the end even if these two Chinese OEMs also starts slugging it out in the notebook PC category. Lenovo, the world's largest PC vendor, is also a loyal client of Intel processors. In fact, Lenovo was one of the first OEMs to integrate Intel's RealSense 3D camera to its consumer Z51 and Z41 laptops last May. Lenovo again used Intel processors and RealSense 3D cameras inside its new ThinkPad E series of business laptops. Xiaomi's alleged $471 Linux laptop could imitate the design/aesthetics of the MacBook but Xiaomi might also imitate Lenovo's decision to use RealSense Camera on the Z1. Geeks already proved that RealSense technology works on Linux computers. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
