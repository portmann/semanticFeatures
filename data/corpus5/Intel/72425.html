ETF Hub May 31 2015, 16:02 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Following more than two months of drama, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is set to announce tomorrow it's buying FPGA vendor Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) for the same $54/share price Bloomberg reported hearing in early April, per the WSJ . The reported price translates to a $16.2B valuation, or $13.2B after factoring net cash/investments. It represents an 11% premium to Altera's Friday close, and a 56% premium to where it traded before the WSJ first reported of deal talks on March 27. Since the first reports, Altera has posted disappointing Q1 results/Q2 guidance, and Intel has announced a server CPU partnership with programmable ASIC maker eASIC (Pending: EASI ) that has been seen as a hedge against Altera. But that alliance could prove complementary, as FPGAs remain the gold standard for rapid programmability and low design costs, while ASICs maintain a size, performance, and power edge. Will Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) get acquired next? Reuters reported earlier this month Avago has shown interest in the Altera archrival. But that was before Avago struck a $37B deal to merge with Broadcom. Interesting.  So to me that means Intel made the correct decision not to go higher than $54 back before earnings when Altera was trying to squeeze them for more. They did.  INTC had a confidentiality agreement and a standstill agreement (which expires at midnight).  Conference call in the AM with details, but ALTR holders are on board with the deal.  More on the combination: http://seekingalpha.co... Likely that the sticking point of the deal was who gets bounced and who gets to keep their job after the merger. I sure hope Intel's knows more about Altera then the public does including me!  I do not see the $16 billion in intrinsic value which is $3.38 PS for every one of Intel's outstanding 4.74 billion shares.  Oh well, I hope it's not another McAfee. They could pull a VRX and hike FPGA costs by 500% immediately after. But somehow I doubt they'd win any market share by doing that. That only works if you have a monopoly. ALTR appears to be worth about $42-44, the way that I do my numbers... looks like INTC overpaid, though not as much as McAfee. These guys do have some pretty good earnings power, and there will be synergies. It's a strategic acquisition that strengthens their hold on the server market. As one of the most hated (quality ambiguous) antivirus products next to Norton, the McAfee acquisition looked like a bungle going in. This doesn't. I await Intel's *detailed* announcement on what those FPGAs will do for them, and I strongly suspect that the PR for this announcement will be 90% of it, actual benefits to performance and sales will be minor.  But I could be wrong.  Since I'm long Intel I hope I'm wrong. The bean counters are going to have a fit. Those that see the long-term strategy that's been developed over many years will see the value.
