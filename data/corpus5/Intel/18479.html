Facebook: The Poster Child Of 'Jobless' Companies - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook has extraordinarily few employees relative to its large market capitalization. Market cap per employee could be a useful metric in security analysis. Software is a key battlefield of business competition. Rewind back to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) April 2012 $1Bn acquisition of Instagram. It seemed to many at the time an astronomical price to pay for an 18-month old startup with just 13 employees. After all, that billion dollar dream team could fit inside an elevator. Citigroup now values Instagram at $35Bn. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unequivocally proved the doubters wrong with what is now widely considered to have been a brilliant acquisition. After being turned down by Snapchat, Mr. Zuckerberg went on to acquire 55-employee WhatsApp for $19Bn in February, 2014. While the wisdom of that acquisition has yet to be decided, it proves the almost limitless price a company will pay for brand equity and an automated business model. It's a paradox that some of the most successful companies in terms of shareholder value are the smallest in terms of employment. Towering offices, overflowing with employees were forever the hallmark of corporate success. These days, in an era of super lean post-recession enterprises and inside the world of management consulting it's often seen as a failure - a failure to automate and outsource to cut salary expense. One notable exception with regards to the general unwillingness of companies to hire is technology companies, which are in need of high-skill workers. Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) say they cannot get enough "top engineers," to meet their needs. Mr. Zuckerberg has said Facebook hires as many qualified engineers as it can find. His policy appears in part aimed at keeping talent away from the competition and preparing for future needs. Facebook and Google, relative to their market capitalization, still employ very few workers. They are among the ranks of what we term, "jobless" companies, which is the focus of this article. The internet and software are by and large behind the increasing automation of companies. The internet is fueling the outsourcing of tasks on a global basis and software development is automating all nature of logical tasks. Software has undeniably become a major battlefield of business competition. The right software can assist nearly any business to do what they do even better. Often, this software is internet-linked, such as with web apps and mobile apps. For this reason, many businesses in disparate industries have evolved into part software businesses. The generally conservative BLS predicts a 22% growth in the employment of software developers from 2012 - 2022. That's a lot of work getting automated by software: Accounting, analytics, market research, marketing and financial, to name a few. As a developer myself, I know that harnessing software can have powerful results but still has a lot of execution risk. Creating useful software is far easier said than done. It takes a whole lot of mentally challenging high-skill labor to automate business tasks. This labor is also very expensive for corporations; with the median salary for US-based software developers at over $90,000. Nonetheless, a good software developer can produce enormous value for a corporation; literally hundreds of thousands to millions in yearly value. Software also never wears out, can work 24/7/365 and never asks for a raise. That's why developers are in such demand. WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ: WETF ) is the maker of popular exchange traded funds, and Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ: GT ) makes tires and fixes cars through a network of high-quality service stations. Goodyear creates value primarily through manufacturing, manual labor, transporting goods and the location advantages of its network of service stations. It actually makes something - tires, and its service technicians can repair your car quickly. It employs a small army of 67,000 laborers. It's a company your grandfather would understand: A S&P 500 index member with a 7.09 Bn market cap and not a jobless company. WisdomTree creates value by "making" and maintaining ETFs. Just two of its ETFs, the (NYSEARCA: HEDJ ) and the (NYSEARCA: DXJ ) account for $32.7 Bn of its recently surpassed $50Bn in AUM. WidsomTree doesn't create anything in the physical sense. It's an idea company. It's just one good idea away from its next blockbuster ETF. Despite its not insignificant market cap of 2.85 Bn, it employs just 124 people. It's a jobless company. So despite having just 124 employees, WisdomTree has roughly half the market capitalization of Goodyear Tire, a company with 67,000 employees! Jobless companies have small, well-compensated and highly-skilled workforces. They leverage technology heavily in their businesses. Their business models are uniquely vulnerable to technological change, but they also derive much of their profits from the harnessing of technology. The future of their business rests upon the generation of ideas and technological breakthroughs. Their growth is less constrained by the laws of physics and more constrained by their ability to recruit talent and convert good ideas into popular new products and services. Jobless companies tend to have very high brand equity. Sound familiar? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook and Google are all in the ranks of "jobless" companies. If we take a company's market cap, and divide it by the number of employees we get the market cap per employee. The higher this number, the more "jobless" the company is … We begin with Goodyear. It's certainly not a jobless company, with a 105K Market Cap Per Employee ratio. A personnel intensive business, due to the nature of manufacturing and exporting tires globally. Facebook is the poster child of low employment tech companies, with a staggering 25,346K Market Cap Per Employee. Facebook employs 9,199. Google is a heavily automated low employment to shareholder value company. GOOGL shares have a 7,079K Market Cap Per Employee ratio. Google employs 53,600. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is a heavily technological company, as indicated by a Market Cap Per Employee of 11,461K. It employs 2,189. Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) is a computer conglomerate with a globally based workforce of 302,000. It has a Market Cap Per Employee of 189K, which is very low for a technology company. It is under the skillful leadership of ex-Ebay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) CEO Meg Whitman. HP has been hurt by the decline in the PC market and shift to cloud-based enterprise IT applications. HP is planning a split into two public entities: Hewlett-PackardEnterprise and HP Inc. These two entities would have a narrower business focus. Darden (NYSE: DRI ) employs 150,000, with a Market Cap Per Employee of 57K. This ratio puts it at the bottom of the S&P 500. A labor intensive business. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) employs 379,592, and has a Market Cap Per Employee of 379K, which is similar to Starbucks. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) has a 7.79% or $12,346,279,447 stake in IBM. According to research by McKinsey and Company , IBM's profits are driven more by the size of it's workforce and less by the productivity of it's workforce. IBM has significantly underperformed over the last few years. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) employs 106,700 and has a Market Cap Per Employee of 1,420K. As a hardware company, it is a more research and capital intensive business than software focused companies such as Yahoo and Microsoft. I created a sample jobless portfolio with 10 of the S&P's stocks with the highest jobless ratios, excluding REITs. I excluded REITs because they have low numbers of employees due to being holding companies, not technology companies. These stocks are: This jobless portfolio outperformed the S&P by an extremely wide margin over the last year. Further analysis is warranted on whether this outperformance is due to the jobless companies picked already having high valuations by definition, due the concentrated portfolio of just 10 stocks, or whether jobless companies are being inefficiently priced by the market at large. For curiosity's sake, I took some of the lowest market cap per employee companies of the S&P and created a portfolio of these heavily labor intensive companies. These companies are: As seen with Instagram, jobless companies have large and rapid appreciation potential. On the negative, jobless companies may not have the "staying" power and durability of business models that blue chips do. Knowingly or not, I believe many investors will experience some of their largest portfolio gains from the purchase of shares in reasonably valued "jobless" companies. I believe active equity investors should formulate a sensible long-term strategy with regards to jobless companies. Holdings of certain jobless companies may be appropriate for some aggressive growth investors. Shares of jobless companies may be avoided by some retirees investing for income due to their general lack of dividends and volatility. Salary expense as percent of revenue varies widely by industry yet often is a major corporate expense. Jobless companies are far less encumbered by salary expense and have powerful business models. Jobless companies have successfully harnessed technology and by and large have superior growth prospects. They can afford to pay for and hoard top talent. They do more, with less workforce and more capital. Jobless companies are the top shareholder value creators of the future.
