Intel Short Interest Hits Multi-Year Low - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha 20 million shares short were covered in April. Short interest at lowest point since May 2012. Early in 2015, the PC market has hit a bit of a rough patch. That was extremely evident when we got a major Q1 revenue warning from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). As a result, shares of the company are down a bit this year. Interestingly enough, despite the bad news from the company and weak PC space, negative sentiment regarding Intel has subsided quite a bit recently. In this article, I look at how short interest has hit a nearly three-year low, and examine the current situation regarding Intel. We recently received the end of April update on short interest. During the month, just over 20 million shares short of the stock were covered. As a result, total short interest is now under 109 million shares, the lowest value we've seen since May 2012. The chart below shows a three-year history of Intel's short interest. This most recent short interest number was the 5th lowest data point of the 74 that I have tracked. Since the October 2013 peak, we have seen 57.5% of shares short covered. This is a major shift in sentiment regarding the name, as a 35-month low in short interest is nothing to ignore. Since the company reported Q1 results, we have seen analyst revenue estimates trickle down a little. Right now, forecasts are calling for a 0.7% decline in revenues this year for Intel, while EPS are expected to drop by 14 cents to $2.17. You can view all estimates here . Intel's latest guidance called for revenues to be approximately flat, so if the company hits the flat line, it would be a beat of current expectations. In my opinion, the decline in short interest is likely due to a couple of factors. First, Intel finally raised its dividend this year, and with the pullback in shares, the annual yield is back around 3.00%. Additionally, the company became a bit more aggressive with its buyback last year. A strong capital return plan combined with a reduction in expectations can easily scare away some of the shorts. With shares down more than $5 from their 52-week high, there just doesn't seem to be as much of a risk/reward basis on the short side. In the end, short interest in Intel has hit a nearly three-year low, meaning one indicator of bearish sentiment in this name is evaporating. While the PC market is weak, Intel took down its yearly revenue forecast at its Q1 report, and it seems like the stock is more in line with expectations currently. With a decent capital return plan in place, it seems investors have decided there are better stocks to short at this point than the chip giant.
