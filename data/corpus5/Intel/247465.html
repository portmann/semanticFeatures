Intel's Mobile Business Is Doing Real Good, In Fact They're Better Positioned Than Apple - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha There has been a lot of misinformation spread about Intel's presence in mobile recently. I'm dedicating this article to clear up these misconceptions because in reality, Intel has done a lot of corporate and product maneuvering to get in the right product segments. Furthermore, I can't comprehend how Intel is actually losing money. Cost segmentation of fab-related costs are being distributed into a low-revenue segment, but those costs would have existed even without mobile. Furthermore, the ASPs from the high-end of the tablet market are extremely compelling, and with the recent form factor changes to 12-inch and up, it positions INTC where it's strongest. There's also enough evidence to indicate that mobile/tablets are starting to become accretive to consolidated margins and revenue. Surface volumes are ramping, whereas Apple is struggling, so who's losing? For the most part, I believe the argument over Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) near-term mobile profitability to be misconstrued by other members of this website. It's more the gimmicky nature of accounting as opposed to money loss from the segment that seems to be tripping everyone over the current fiscal year as opposed to next fiscal year. Furthermore, no one can offer enough compelling evidence to support the notion that they're actually losing money on a consolidated operating basis from mobile. Sure, we could argue that Intel's net income hasn't grown over the past couple years, but that has more to do with desktop and laptop weakness. This issue though becomes addressed as a result of their efforts in mobile and tablets next year, as opposed to issues with their mobile P&L. When you work downwards into the consolidated impact, the mobile group seems to be a contributor this year, despite the carry over of ongoing R&D pertaining to next-generation process nodes. These costs pertaining to fab-specific operating costs would have existed whether they had actually participated in mobile or not. However, when you do the segment-by-segment reporting they have to distribute these ancillary costs into a segment that doesn't generate server or desktop/laptop-like revenues. Also, the incremental cost of developing mobile-specific designs is dropping, and while those costs are a small component of the company's operating cost structure, the incremental impact from reducing those costs generates meaningful operating profit improvements for the upcoming fiscal year. The topic of MCG profitability was a bigger theme in last year's investor conference because the company was losing money just by spreading the cost of foundational (foundry) investments on a segment-by-segment basis, but in terms of actual economic profit, or in terms of accounting consolidated profit, the MCG is starting to pull more of its own weight. This is partially because of R&D reductions in the low-power envelopes, but more specifically improvements to the gross margin per wafer on the mobile-specific SKUs. Furthermore, while Intel won't generate a substantial improvement to their market share, growth seems feasible based on their ability to release new mobile parts on an annual cadence and the off-setting of direct R&D by moving over SoC design at the low-end to third-parties like Rockchip and Spreadtrum. Of course, this doesn't completely mitigate direct R&D expenditure into the lower power envelopes because Intel continues to invest into the development of mobile modems and Atom-class CPUs. So, they've kept the good stuff and still participate in the not so good stuff. Intel has done some pretty good corporate level maneuvering to avoid the low-margin categories of the mobile segment by simply moving the costs of developing these chips over to Chinese semiconductor houses. They then go on to provide the foundational architecture so companies can develop some compelling designs using Intel-based architecture. Over the past couple years, we've seen a consistent trend in Intel gaining market share. And while the tablet segment has been an area of concern. I think investors forget they actually have a meaningful presence in the tablet market via the Surface Pro line-up, which is generally recognized in-terms of U-series sales, which doesn't fall under MCG, but rather the broader revenue pool of CCG. After consolidating MCG and PCCG, it's all synonymous anyway. In other words, it's not that Intel hasn't generated progress in tablets, it's just that in the low-end they're not doing so hot due to tablet-market decline even as they're generating meaningful momentum in high-end tablet sockets. In a sense, that's where they exhibit the most strength, and it's where OEMs feel comfortable in terms of tablet differentiation away from ARM-cores. After all, Intel's process and design advantage is best exemplified once we move into the 15W+ TDP variants of its processor family, and as such, these tablets are worth taking a closer look into because the Core i5 and i7 line-up for Surface Pro and Surface book typically carry ASPs in excess of $250 at the entry level. As such, Intel can technically occupy a meaningful fragment of the ultra high-end of the tablet market and come much further ahead than attempting to compete with Qualcomm in mainstream tablets where app processors are sold for less than $20 per unit. Furthermore, Intel's "tablet strategy" seems to be working where it matters most, in the high-end, as evidenced by Microsoft's sales growth in the segment between FY 2014 and FY 2015. Microsoft grew the Surface segment by 107% in FY 2015, and reviews for the Surface Pro 4 were all around solid (despite the difficulty of repairing the product). Intel has a much bigger advantage in terms of performance and power consumption at 15W TDPs. This runs contrary to logic, but because tablets have followed a similar trend to smartphones, we're seeing a blurring of the lines between tablets and laptops. In a sense, a tablet replacement of laptops creates cannibalization, and it's this strategic shift that has been creating some friction in Intel's Skylake-H line-up, which has TDPs in excess of 25W, but is targeted at performance-oriented notebooks like the MacBook Pro 15-inch or the XPS line-up from Dell. This market is sort of in transition, but it seems overall accretive to Intel, because they can still participate in tablets without completely alienating its core laptop business. They're just moving up the power stack where they and the OEMs feel most comfortable. In other words, the bigger tablet variants play straight into Intel's hands, because that's where Intel knows it can compete with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) custom designs, and still come ahead with very healthy margins. Big tablets have a form factor similar to laptops, so battery life becomes less of an issue, because you can simply package a larger battery to overcome the power/performance dynamics. Hence, this is an area where not even Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) or Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) can realistically compete, as such it would be a stretch to label Intel a "mobile disaster." There's still power behind the Wintel ecosystem and while things have been shaken up in the past, it's common knowledge that Intel and Microsoft are well capitalized and know how to adapt to a heightened competitive environment. Don't forget that it was Wintel the alliance that subjugated the PC market away from IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Apple in the 1990s. While Apple does have a functional tablet at the high-end, so does Microsoft and Intel. It also comes with better performance parameters. Apple is trying to maintain sales growth off a high revenue base, whereas Microsoft and Intel are creating marginal revenue from thin air. The organic growth argument seems far more compelling in the case of Intel and Microsoft than in the case of Apple. As such, I don't view Intel's mobile business the way others have painted it. They're not actually losing money from mobile, and they're making headway into the highest margin segment. Explain to me, how do you lose money from a segment that's generating higher operational profits in an environment where they anticipate a mid-single digit PC shipment decline? It's all because of their high-end tablet strategy, cost-synergies through partnerships in low-end mobile, and incremental loss aversion from mainstream tablets/smartphones. Quite frankly, the strategy is so good it's going to generate sales growth in a year where conventional laptop/tower shipments may either decline or remain flat. I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation and $42.87 price target. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
