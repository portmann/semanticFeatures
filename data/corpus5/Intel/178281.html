Microsoft: Another Sizable Dividend Raise - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Last week, technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) announced its 2015 dividend increase . The new quarterly payout, payable in December for those in the stock by mid-November, will be $0.36 a share. This is a 5 cent per quarter increase over last year, or 16.13% in percentage terms. This year's raise was very strong, continuing a history of tremendous dividend growth for Microsoft. This year's raise was a bit more than last year's 10.71% raise and was only the second time the company raised the dividend by a nickel. This was the sixth straight double-digit percentage raise, and the dividend has more than doubled with the last five raises. As you can see in the chart below, Microsoft's dividend has risen substantially in the last decade. *According to Microsoft's dividend history, the first payment in fiscal 2006 was $0.08 before rising to $0.09 for the final three payments. The chart above uses the $0.09 figure for fiscal 2006. Year above represents the year in which a majority of payments will be. In my dividend raise preview article , I was looking for a 2 to 3 cent quarterly raise. Given a slightly weaker balance sheet than a year ago and results being pressured by a stronger dollar, I thought the company would be a little conservative. That was not the case here, which I believe means the company will reduce its buyback pace a little over the next year. For those who also worried about a weak PC industry around the Windows 10 launch, I think this large dividend raise might reduce those fears. Since my preview article, Microsoft shares have lost about $3 with this recent market volatility. Combined with the larger than expected raise, the annual yield as of Friday's close was up to 3.31%. Since we did not get a rate increase from the Federal Reserve last week, Microsoft now yields almost 40 basis points more than the 30-Year US Treasury bond. In the chart below, you can see how Microsoft's dividend stands up against large tech peers: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ). Of the six names, Microsoft stands just ahead of Intel for third place. In a research note following the dividend increase, a Piper Jaffray analyst noted that Microsoft now yields about 50% more than the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ). The analyst noted that this large raise continues a movement to increased shareholder value and the firm maintained its $53 price target and Outperform rating on Microsoft shares. Microsoft continued its series of strong dividend raises last week, boosting its quarterly payout to $0.36 a share. The stock's annual yield is now well over 3.00%, well above the S&P 500 and US Treasuries. The Windows cash cow has fueled strong capital returns in the past, and that trend seems likely to continue going forward thanks to this latest piece of news.
