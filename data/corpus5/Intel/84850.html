Qualcomm Faces Wall Of Doubts - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm's first quarter has generated doubts about the company. It faces challenges in acquisitions, in China, in its dealings with Apple and Intel. Most of the folks writing here at Seeking Alpha about Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) remain bullish on the stock, but the wall of doubt surrounding the company is a real one. Over the last year the shares are down 16% and the most recent quarterly report was filled with red flags. Net income fell by nearly half from the same period a year ago, to $1 billion, 63 cents per share, against almost $2 billion, $1.14 per share, in 2014. Profit margins were down, operating margins were down, and so was operating cash flow. Revenue, fortunately, was up at $6.9 billion, against nearly $6.4 billion in the year-ago period, and the bulls attributed it to writing down old assets and a one-time gain the previous year from the sale of its Omnitracs unit. Still, the storm clouds gathered. Qualcomm is a "fab-less" company, with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) actually making its chips, and some analysts warned this necessary agreement may constrain Qualcomm's ability to acquire other companies. Its main customer, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), is getting more aggressive in cutting off royalty payments for old technology and analysts worry about that. Its policy of share buybacks is under criticism and its decision to sell some spectrum assets in the United Kingdom is also seen as bearish. Then there's China. Qualcomm is highly dependent on China. China represents about half its revenue. The company's respected head of China operations, Wang Xiang, just got hired away by phone maker Xiaiomi forcing the company to bring back Frank Meng . China recently had to pay a fine of $975 million over anti-competitive practices there, and to lower its royalty rate going forward. Qualcomm was one of the few tech companies to take Taiwan's CompuTex show seriously this year, announcing plans to make WiFi faster , advance the Internet of Things (its display featured watches as well as tablets), and to make the PC obsolete. But all this was not enough for some, who insist they're dumping Qualcomm in favor of Intel . That's a little like closing the barn door after the horse is out, since Intel is up over the last year while Qualcomm stock has struggled. The solution, acquisitions, could be an expensive one. Buy Skyworks? Separate chips from licensing, as activist investor Jana Partners wants? Or why not make a run at MediaTek, the Taiwanese company that has been taking share from it? Such a move would also give Qualcomm an alternate foundry partner in Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ). The point is it's a complicated chess board, perhaps the most fraught since Steven Mollonkopf stepped into the CEO chair in March, 2014. It's not an easy call, but Mollonkopf's compensation is nearly all in stock so he is bound to make a play. Source: Qualcomm Faces Wall Of Doubts Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
