Where Does Qualcomm Fit Into Intel's Server Strategy? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm plans to enter the server market and recently it tested its SDP (server development platform). With Intel having a clearly defined strategy in the space, Qualcommâ€™s potential here might be limited. Even if Qualcomm emerges as a successful player in the space, Intel shareholders have nothing to worry as Qualcomm will take at least a decade to build the entire ecosystem. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is planning to take a slice of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 server chip business via its SDP (server development platform). SDP, which the company has been developing since the past two years, was tested in tier-one data centers, according to the company. Industry watchers believe that after the test the company will use customer feedback for product design. Qualcomm said : The SDP was tested today running the entire software stack: Linux kernel version 4.2 along with KVM virtualization, OpenStack DevStack for OpenStack cloud orchestration, guest virtual machines running a standard Linux distribution along with Apache web server and WordPress. SDP used a pre-production version of 24-core SoC based on ARM's (NASDAQ: ARMH ) ARMv8-A architecture. Qualcomm said it will collaborate with Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) and Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ: MLNX ) for its server chip business. In this article I will attempt to gauge Qualcomm's potential in the server market, which is currently dominated by Intel. Let's first delve deeper into Qualcomm's opportunities in the growing server market. Qualcomm's CEO Steve Mollenkopf first mentioned almost a year ago that data center is a more than $15 billion projected market in 2020, and the company is finally entering the server market. Since the server market advances slowly and deliberately compared to the desktop market, Qualcomm will get enough time to prepare itself before ramping up production. Few years ago Calxeda ventured into developing low-power ARM-based dense servers with its existing 32-bit SoCs coupled with fabric technology, which would challenge Intel's dominance and monopoly in the x86-based server market. Sadly, the company faced financial problems and the company officials had to shut it down in December 2013. Although the low performance of ARM CPUs per core compared to Intel's Xeon doesn't make it a great fit for the server market yet, Calxeda showed that ARM-based servers might have good future potential in this market. Intel's Xeon continues to dominate the server market with a decent core count coupled with huge performance per core at moderate power levels. ARM-based servers can certainly challenge Xeon with exceptionally low power and decent performance per watt ratios. This makes Qualcomm's decision to enter the server market commercially viable. However, there are a number of hurdles that Qualcomm needs to overcome before challenging Intel. Intel's strategy provides itself the competitive edge Intel has a clearly defined strategy for the server market. It knows that big data combined with HPC (high performance computing) in the cloud is emerging as the new data center trend. This trend requires efficient server processors that support massive storage capacity coupled with a lot of computing horsepower. Intel's strategy is making server chips keeping these issues in mind. With its Haswell-based Xeon chips released last year, Intel addressed these issues partially. It increased core counts to 18 cores, added advanced turbo mechanisms and cache monitoring. It also upgraded the entire platform to DDR4. Intel's upcoming Broadwell-based Xeon chips, which are expected to be released in the first quarter of 2016, will have a number of enhancements for addressing the needs of tomorrow's virtualized data center that will thrive on big data combined with HPC in the cloud. The enhancements will include page modification logging and posted interrupts for advanced virtualization. Further, Intel has an established software ecosystem for the data center. If Qualcomm can't build a sustainable software ecosystem, which needs heavy investments and almost a decade's time, how could it grab even a fraction of Intel's market share? Calxeda handed over the baton for ARM-based sever chips to AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), Applied Micro Circuits (NASDAQ: AMCC ) and Cavium Networks (NASDAQ: CAVM ). It's noteworthy here that AMD, the pioneer of the x86-64 architecture, is returning to the x86-based server chip market with its new architecture called Zen. However, none of these companies have been able to pose a serious long-term threat to Intel's server chip business. ARM-based chips don't yet have the number of DIMM slots that Xeon's memory controller can support. If Qualcomm can't make chips with massive amount of DIMM slots, competing with Intel won't be an easy task. Add to that the enhanced features Intel offers / will be offering with its Xeon family, as stated above. I believe Qualcomm and other existing players in the field will face tremendous challenge from Intel in the coming years. Earlier this year Intel launched Broadwell-based Xeon SoCs, which the company markets under the Xeon D brand name. It's the first SoC design based on Xeon that came up with excellent performance per watt ratios for addressing the needs of the low end server market. Intel had two Atom-based server SoCs for primarily competing with ARM-based low power SoCs, which weren't enough for the low end server market. The new Xeon D family coupled with the existing Atom C2000 family will make life difficult for the companies that make ARM-based server chips. Can Qualcomm win at least a decent percentage of Intel's server market share, say 20%? Of course, but it will take at least a decade, which is irrelevant from Intel shareholders' point of view. Imagine where Intel could reach with its Xeon and Atom platforms in the next 10 years. Intel is making its workload-optimized processors and developing its customized chip business at lightning speed. I believe Qualcomm needs to acquire either Cavium or Applied Micro immediately (which isn't impossible with its huge cash reserve) for their fabric and networking assets. Otherwise the company's big plan for the server market may be too late. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
