AMD: Cash Infusion Means It Is Time To Buy This Beleaguered Laggard - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD makes Joint Venture deal for test and assembly business with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. AMD will collect $320M and maintains a 15% portion of the JV. On October 15, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics (NFME) to form a Joint Venture (JV) to provide enhanced SATS (Semi-conductor Assembly and Test Services) utilizing AMD's current ATMP (Assembly, Test, Mark and Pack) facilities in Malaysia and China. After selling their fabs to Global Foundries AMD had maintained their ATMP facilities. With this transaction they are also out of the ATMP side of the semiconductor business and that should minimize CAPEX going forward. The value of the transaction is $371M with net to AMD after expenses at about $320M. Closing is expected in the first half of 2016. Cash balance and cash flow should both improve in 2016. The $320M in cash should put AMD's cash balance at about $1B from the current $745M, about the same as the year ending balance for the last 3 years - $1b, $1.1B and $1.04B for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. This should provide them with more than enough time to bring Zen to market in late 2016. Commercial volumes should then ramp up in 2017 providing a significant boost to sales and profits. Even if the quarterly negative Cash Flow of $74M continues each quarter for the next year the cash balance as of Q3 2016 would be higher than it is right now. The ATMP facilities are capital intensive so CAPEX relative to the ATMP facilities should be decreased. According to CFO Kumar, CAPEX should be down a total $40M in 2016 (per transcript). Also the transferring of 1,700 employees (about 18% of AMD employees) to NFME will decrease operating costs significantly. CFO Kumar mentions $58M in 2016 OPEX savings not including JV savings which are yet to be determined. So total savings on CAPEX and OPEX including the new JV will certainly be well over $100M in 2016. The agreement also calls for no overall cost increase for AMD's use of the JV's ATMP services. Also the $65M inventory write-down should provide some cash in the next quarter (or two) as the lower cost inventory is sold off. We don't know what the original value of the inventory written down was but if the original cost was written down 40% the sale of all reduced inventory at cost would be about $100M. That would of course not be profit but it would more than offset the current quarters $74M negative cash flow. So we have $98M in CAPEX and OPEX savings in 2016 plus additional OPEX savings once the JV is finalized plus positive cash generation from selling the written down inventory. So cash, cash and more cash for 2016. This bodes well for AMD going forward. New product introductions should help sales. New graphics products including the Radeon R9 Nano and the Embedded R-Series SOC seem to have stemmed the tide of market share losses to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), but the PC and tablets graphics market as a whole is down in 2015 meaning graphic chip sales are down too. But according to Gartner PC and tablet sales should increase modestly in 2016 and 2017. The newest Carrizo chip is going after the largest segment of the laptop market the $400 to $700 price range. While this could help sales marginally I don't think it will be a blockbuster product. However even a modest improvement would help until Zen comes along. In some ways sales this quarter were better than they looked. If you compare Q3 2015 vs. Q2 2015 sales are up 13% ($942M vs. $1.06B). If you go back to 2014 Q3 vs. Q2 the sales actually went down a small amount ($1.44B vs. $1.43B). Of course YoY comparisons were down by 26% but that was less than last quarter's YoY down 34%. But the question to ask is: was Q2 the low point for sales? Time will tell. Next year's sales comparisons will be much easier and may bring some surprises. In addition to the new GPU's and APU's game consoles sales should continue to increase and the previously announced semi-custom SOC contracts should provide some increase in sales. Is a buyout possible? Rumors continue to fly that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) may be interested in AMD. As a member of the x86 duopoly it only makes sense that weak AMD is on the buyout radar. And the termination of the cross licensing deal with Intel is actually an advantage to AMD because if an agreement is not reached with the new acquirer license fees will have to be paid back and forth with both parties. And since Intel has 10 times the sales of AMD their license fee income would be multiples of Intel's. So a new license deal will be reached in case of AMD's acquisition because Intel cannot function without AMD's IP for example AMD's 64 bit extension. The cross licensing deal is explained here . I would think any acquirer would do so within the next 6 months before Zen production starts. After that the price would certainly go up significantly. What could possibly go wrong? Well lots of things of course. The first and most important is the closing of the new JV deal which will provide all the cash needed to see Zen come to fruition. If something happens to terminate or delay the closing cash may be a problem in 2016. And cash is all important to AMD as I discussed in AMD: 4 Reasons Why Cash Is Much More Important Than Jim Keller's Departure . Secondly any delay of Zen production would also have a big negative effect on the stock although with the extra cash from the JV a delay would not be terminal but would be a significant setback. Thirdly if sales do not increase in 2016 then cash flow may be a problem since further cuts in CAPEX and OPEX will be difficult to come by. And fourthly, any lack of focus on getting saleable products out the door will be hugely problematic. But so far at least, I am impressed with CEO Lisa Su's management of this especially important aspect of AMD's business prospects. I have been intrigued by AMD for a long time. One of my first articles on SA was about AMD's prospects over the next few years - 10 Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 By 2017 - where I outlined my arguments for a big increase in price by 2017. Do I think they can still be at $10 by 2017? Yes I do although admittedly I would say by the end of 2017 not the beginning. One could easily argue that AMD has been the worst managed semiconductor company over the last 10 years or so. But those are exactly the kind of companies that can provide significant capital gains over the medium term. If Zen is on time and Lisa Su can keep the company focused and disciplined for the next two years the price of the stock will go up significantly. If not then I think they will be sold piecemeal (Graphics, X86, IP) with little left for shareholders after the debt is paid. So looking at it as a binary outcome is probably best. One way to play this with some risk capital is to buy 2018 LEAPS at $3 or above. That may generate massive profits and if not then the loss will not be much greater than holding the stock itself.
