Intel: A Dinosaur Headed For Extinction - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Shifts in how we interface with technology are making PCs obsolete. Monopoly power has been broken by the rise of RISC architecture. When I read the Strategic Roadmap published by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) CEO Bryan Kzanich, I finally threw in the towel on Intel after staying invested for the last 10 years. How does a company that spends $20B annually in capex and R&D combined face such a daunting future? With that much investment, is it possible for them to fail? The answer is yes. Many companies struggling with technological shifts have pointed toward the Internet of Things to save them. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and a host of other S&P 500 companies are touting IoT as the next big thing, and it will likely be so, but how often do old established companies successfully shift to an entirely new market? Think Kodak (NYSE: KODK ). It's much more likely that new entrants, unencumbered by the past, will dominate the IoT market, not Intel. Qualcomm may have a better chance, but the competition and pricing will be fierce, and the commodity products, being the architecture and chips, are not where the value will be derived. Creating the IoT is one thing, extracting value from the network and data is entirely another, and this is not Intel's domain. Not many people remember that Intel had a shot at becoming a player in mobile architecture. In 2006, Intel sold its RISC-based architecture division ( XScale Technology ) to Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL ) for $600 million, right before the launch of the smartphone revolution. Intel chips were already powering some BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) phones. At the time, Intel stated it was divesting of non-core assets to focus on its x86 architecture. Oops. Intel did not think to hedge its x86 bet with a smaller division focused on RISC architecture. That has proven to be a very costly mistake. Now, the new President of the IoT group, Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala , has pushed Intel to capitulate on the x86 architecture for mobile, essentially declaring defeat to RISC architecture, after spending more than $10 billion trying to catch up in the mobile market. Prior to the mobile revolution, everybody that wanted to connect to the internet had to have a PC, and the vast majority of PCs were powered by Intel as an effective monopoly. Intel extracted monopoly pricing for a single product, the CPU, that was excessively powerful and overpriced for the majority of tasks it was performing for the majority of consumers. The full power of an Intel CPU is way more than most people need for daily tasks and connectivity, yet they had no choice but to pay the monopoly price. Intel did some market segmentation with Celeron and other lower end processors, but it was all based on the x86 architecture, which consumes a lot of power and produces a lot of heat. By virtue of its monopoly power, Intel could set the profit maximizing price for each market segment, and the cash flow was practically certain. The PC is now a dying industry, as tablets, smartphones and RISC based laptops and devices cannibalize the market that Intel dominated for more than two decades. The PC itself will eventually die off as a form factor, but it may take a long time of slow decline as the ecosystem of apps and connected form factors continues to develop for both general (i.e., smartphone) and specific (i.e., enterprise) purposes. Intel bulls will point to the growth in data center demand and its ability to offset declining PC revenues. However, virtualization and cloud efficiencies lowers the demand for processing power for the same tasks that a PC would normally do. In addition, the overall demand for data centers pales in comparison to the personal computing market. Intel is used to selling oversized, overpriced CPUs for every PC; this type of monopoly power cannot be maintained in the Datacenter business. Competition in the data center market is set to be fierce, as ARM based processors continue pushing into the lucrative space. Intel cannot defend against this attack on its cash cow by continuing to push Moore's law. It is no longer a relevant force, we don't need more raw processing power, we need smarter and more efficient processing. Moore's law is not the cure for Intel's sickness, and investing CapEx purely in the pursuit of achieving Moore's law is a gross mis-allocation of capital. Mr. Market is unsure how to price INTC. With the dividend and cash flow relatively safe in the near term, the stock price has a floor under it, but an erosion of their core market and pricing power will hurt stockholders down the road. Intel is wedded to the x86 architecture, and it is still their cash cow. Without the ability to cannibalize their own product, they will have to acquire the technology to compete in mobile and IoT, and they will have to pay a large premium to do so. Given that they blew through $10 billion to fail at mobile, I would not rule a large acquisition. However, it will likely be value destroying for shareholders as there is no guarantee that Intel can move fast enough into new markets to offset the decline of PCs. At this point, I would say Intel is a dinosaur headed to extinction. Just like the dinosaurs, extinction won't be immediate, but it could be fast. The asteroid has already struck, and the long dark winter is setting in for the PC era. Intel will go down with it.
