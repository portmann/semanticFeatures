Why Intel Needs Xiaomi - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The 14-nanometer Cherry Trail Atom X5 is important toward improving Intel's mobile chip sales. Intel needs more OEMs to use the Atom X5 mobile processors. Xiaomi is now exclusively using the Intel Atom X5 for the Android and Windows 10 models of the Mi Pad 2. We now know why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) issued a cheaper $199 Tegra K1-powered Android tablet. Xiaomi, one the world's top vendors of smartphones, has decided to exclusively use an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom Cherry Trail processor for its iPad Mini-looking Mi Pad 2 . Aside from the Nexus 9, Nvidia's only major design win for its Tegra K1 SoC last year was Xiaomi's original Mi Pad. Xiaomi's decision to use the $25 Atom x5-Z8500 for both the Android and Windows 10 versions of the Mi Pad 2 is detrimental to Nvidia. On the other hand, Xiaomi could help Intel recover from its year-over-year 39% drop in Q3 tablet processor sales. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 design win's relevance will be more apparent after Q1 2016. I see this product as a reference design for more Cherry Trail-powered tablets next year. The Intel-powered Mi Pad 2 was already rumored last December . Xiaomi's defection to the latest x86 tablet SoC of Intel meant it underwent a long testing process. Intel's 14-nm quad-core x5-Z8500 apparently has satisfied all the performance/energy efficiency requirements of Xiaomi. Global OEMs like Xiaomi can help Intel improve sales for its Cherry Trail mobile processors. Ashraf Eassa already speculated earlier this year that Intel might face difficulty ramping up support for Cherry Trail processors. This pessimism was understandable because Intel is now allegedly only willing to offer $2-$3 subsidies for its Cherry Trail Atom SoCs. Wider industry support for the $20 and $25 Cherry Trail mobile processors, the Z8500 and Z8300, would likely contribute lower operating losses for Intel in 2016. Intel previously offered $8 discounts on its older 2014-era $15 Bay Trail processors to tablet vendors. Yes, the tablet industry is posting declining sales. This is due to the proliferation of phablets and 2-in-1 hybrid notebook/tablet products. However, I believe that any product category that helps Intel make inroads in the mobile sector is important. Intel's original hype for its 14-nm Cherry Trail SoCs is to provide more energy efficient but more powerful processors for tablets. Xiaomi's selection of the x5-Z8500 help validates this Intel claim. Intel investors should never lose hope when it comes to the commercial relevance of x86 mobile chips against ARM-based processors. I believe Cherry Trail Atom processors are now competitive with MediaTek ARM SoCs. Cherry Trail processors have a total addressable market greater than just a $499 Surface 3 and/or a dirt-cheap $99 Teclast Windows 10 tablet. The possibility that tablet vendors will now abandon less-subsidized Cherry Trail Atom chips in favor of ARM-based processors is no longer worrisome. I expect other Android/Windows tablet vendors to emulate the example set by Xiaomi in going all-Intel for its latest tablet product. White-box Chinese tablet manufacturers that survive on low-margin products will remain clients of Intel. The fact that a recent 14-nanometer x86 SoC could be used inside a $155 Android Mi Pad 2 (and a $200 Windows 10) all-metal tablet, says it is still a cost-effective component for premium-level mid-range priced tablets. It was actually cheaper for Xiaomi to use Intel's tablet chip. The Tegra K1-equipped plastic-made Mi Pad 1 retailed for $249 in China last year. Intel will continue to do brisk business with Chinese white-box manufacturers. The versatility of one x86 SoC (that could be used for Android and Windows tablets) allows margins-pressured Chinese white-box manufactures to differentiate their products against other ARM-based tablets. Unlike an ARM-based Tegra K1 or Snapdragon processor, the Cherry Trail Atom SoC could be used in dual-OS Windows 10/Android tablets like the $247 Teclast X98 . Having a dual-OS tablet is a differentiating factor that Chinese manufacturers could use as an excuse to sell their products at a higher margin. I also expect Teclast and other white-box tablet vendors to lower the prices of their current higher-end Cherry Trail-powered products so they remain competitive with the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2. The cheaper Cherry Trail-powered tablets become, the more people will be able to afford them. Why Xiaomi's Support Is Most Welcome Xiaomi's reputation for high quality products and its ability to sell copycat versions of Apple products could mean the Mi Pad 2 will become a big hit in China. Other price-sensitive markets like the Philippines, India, and Latin America will also appreciate a $200 iPad Mini-looking Windows 10 8-inch tablet. As of now, Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) is the only major global tablet vendor that uses Intel x86 Atom SoCs for its tablet products. I expect Xiaomi's more powerful brand power to eventually eclipse the commercial appeal of Intel-powered Asus ZenPad Android tablets next year. Asustek also no longer sells Windows-based stand-alone tablets. It only sells Windows 8.1/Windows 10 2-in-1 tablet/notebook devices. Xiaomi's 8-inch $155 Android or $200 Windows 10 tablet could therefore cater to customers who only want cheaper alternatives to the $399 iPad Mini 4. The marketing power of Xiaomi is also no longer handicapped by limited-time-only online sales. Xiaomi already opened its first physical retail store in Beijing last September . Intel has future rewards if Xiaomi also aggressively copies the successful retail chain of Apple Stores around the world. I opine that if Intel cannot get its mobile processors inside Apple iPads, the next best thing is for Intel to get them inside lower-priced clones of the iPad. I expect this first-ever collaboration between Intel and Xiaomi to expand beyond tablets. Long-term investors should not discount the possibility that Xiaomi could someday use an Intel-made smartphone processor. Going forward, Intel could reap greater benefits if Xiaomi imitates Asustek's act of using Intel Atom processors in Android phones. Once Intel delivers 4G-integrated SoFIA x3 Atom chips next year , I assume Xiaomi will evaluate them for possible use in its lower-end Android phones. Xiaomi could also create full Windows 10 versions of its high-end Android phones/phablets using an x5-z8500. Like other mobile gadget vendors, Xiaomi could sell far more units of smartphones than tablets. Intel's future relevance in the mobile chips industry will only gain the respect of investors if more top phone vendors use its x86 smartphone processors. Compared to Xiaomi, Asustek is really only a minor player in the smartphone industry. There is almost zero chance that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) will use Intel-made smartphone processors. Microsoft is also likely still bound to an exclusivity deal for years with Qualcomm. Aside from Asustek, I therefore see Xiaomi as the next viable client for smartphone processors from Intel. Xiaomi is also expanding toward Internet of Things products. Xiaomi now only has a smart fitness health wristband in the $32 Mi Band 1S . I anticipate Xiaomi to eventually come up with a real smartwatch product to compete with the Apple Watch and the Intel-powered $1,500 Tag Heuer Connected. I also look forward to Intel also supplying the even higher-margin processors for Xiaomi's first ever laptop product. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
