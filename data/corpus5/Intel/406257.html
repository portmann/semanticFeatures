Intel: 5G End-To-End Worldwide, Seamlessly - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha 5G is much more than a mobile phone technology. 5G is a new connectivity technology with all devices connecting to all devices seamlessly... mobile and stationary devices. Intel's end-to-end approach will win. By 2020, over 20 billion devices will be connected to the Internet. The speed, low latency and pervasiveness of 5G will be essential to effectively connect these 20 billion active devices. I don't think we will need to wait until 2020 for 5G technology. Out on a limb: Moore's Law will be applied to communications and bring 5G in 2018. This article goes out on a limb. Actually one leg is on one limb, another leg on another limb and each arm is hanging on to separate limbs. My hope is that if I keep my weight evenly distributed across all four limbs, they will be strong enough to support my weight. Before I lose you completely, I'll jump out of the tree and into the weeds. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) CEO recently made 5G a huge part of the company's forward looking strategy. This is a huge challenge for a company that lost money on 4G. However, 5G is much different from 4G. 4G was mostly a way for a single mobile phone to communicate to a base station. 5G involves all devices communicating with all devices around it including stationary and mobile devices. 5G is a communication network tying all devices together seamlessly. An example may help. Currently my mobile phone connects to the Internet either through 4G or through WiFi. With a 5G system my mobile phone could connect through a phone base station, a home gateway device, another mobile phone, an IoT device, a car gateway... all seamlessly without me being aware that I'm moving from one to the other. My 5G system will be virtualized across multiple hardware devices. Data will come and go across multiple types of connections simultaneously. The 5G system will find the path of least resistance and send packets of data along various paths, to later be reconnected and delivered. This is similar to the current Internet. There's no isolated path that all of your data takes to get from you to its destination. Data finds its way through various compute devices across the system and is reunited as it is delivered. This concept brings new meaning to the Internet of Things. The Things (intelligent devices) are actually the Internet (connectivity). The Things are the connection to other Things. 4G, 3G and 2G were wireless innovations focused largely on improving the speed and efficiency of a connection between point A (a cellular network antenna) and point B (your cellphone or other device). 5G also is about faster and more efficient wireless connectivity, but this time, it is also about computing capability. The industry is looking to 5G to provide the higher data rates (1-20 Gbps), lower latency and capacity needed to enable the Internet of Things (IoT), new service models and immersive user experiences. This will require immense processing and communications power provided by sophisticated silicon solutions. Working in partnership with leading operators, we developed the Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform to offer the mobile industry a flexible and high-performance development platform that allows for faster integration and testing of 5G networks and devices. Intel is taking a leading role in development of 5G so that its solutions can effectively become the standard for the industry as 5G is rolled out. The European Union is hot on taking the lead in 5G. The EU has funded huge efforts to implement a 5G system throughout the EU. Here's a graphic that describes the EU vision for 5G. Intel is working hand in hand with the EU. My thought is that Intel is staying very general on 5G (glossy videos and broad motherhood statements) and has a backroom secret project that will take the world by storm. It's either that or it's all fluff and no substance. Place your bets. A 5G Network is Possible Now on Intel Architecture. With everything from the silicon to acceleration technologies built into and/or around Intel Architecture processors, Intel offers the building blocks needed for network transformation and has emerged with a leading role in the future 5G network. This link has an article (5G: A Network Transformation Imperative) describing how Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Architecture will be essential to make 5G work. Note that last year Intel said by 2020, there would be some 50 billion things connected to the Internet. Now Intel is saying over 20 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020. This reduction indicates that Intel is taking a more realistic view of the future with regard to connected devices. I think they are looking to see fewer and more capable things. The reader is reminded that Intel provides numerous devices that could all contribute to the effectiveness of 5G. These devices are from end-to-end and include pretty much all hardware in data centers, pretty much all desktop PCs, a large percentage of gateways (broadband and cable), almost all laptops/2-in-1s and some mobile devices. Experience working with all of these devices from end-to-end is essential to providing an overall 5G solution. Security is critical to a successful 5G network. Intel offers physical channel authentication and virtualized authentication through its hardware and software end-to-end solutions. Unfortunately 5G is yet another program by Intel that will require a substantial investment over years, before it delivers a meaningful return in the form of earnings. If Intel is extremely successful in 5G and delivers a secret system that will form a backbone for 5G, then Intel could start seeing substantial earnings from 5G in the 2018 time period. A more likely scenario is that significant earnings from 5G do not appear until 2019 or 2020. Earlier earnings for Intel will likely come as service providers prepare their data center systems to compete as 5G service providers. I continue to see Intel stock price declining during 2016 down to $28 or $25 with a possible upturn in the second half back up to $30 or $32.
