Microsoft Is Undervalued Ahead Of Dividend Raise - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is about to raise the dividend again. Growing dividend and sluggish share price made Microsoft's dividend yield grow to a compelling level. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has seen its share price decline over the last year: Microsoft paid a quarterly dividend of $0.31 for the last four quarters. This gives Microsoft a trailing dividend yield of 2.9 percent at the current share price. Microsoft's dividend has been raised regularly over the last 10 years with four quarters at the same payout before the dividend was raised again. Over the last five years the growth rates were the following: The annual growth rate over the last five years was nineteen percent, which is a great result for a company of Microsoft's size. In combination with Microsoft's dividend yield of (almost) three percent this gives the company a Chowder number of 22, which makes Microsoft a compelling pick for dividend growth investors. Over the last few years the dividend policy has been to make the annual dividend hike with the dividend which is announced in September (see Microsoft's dividend history here ), it thus makes sense that Microsoft will increase its dividend again with the next dividend announcement in a couple of days. Since Microsoft paid out $0.31 four times, the company will increase the payout again with its next dividend announcement (the last increases were announced between September 16 and September 20 of the last four years). We can thus assume that Microsoft's next dividend payment will not be $0.31, but more than that. If Microsoft were to grow its dividend by 19 percent (the average over the last five years), Microsoft's next dividend payment would be $0.37 (rounded). This would give the company a dividend yield of 3.4 percent, which would be great, but I believe this is too optimistic. As Microsoft's last dividend increase was smaller than the previous ones, I believe it's appropriate to be conservative and to say that Microsoft will likely raise its dividend by $0.03 again - to $0.34 per share per quarter, for a dividend yield of 3.1 percent at today's price. Microsoft never pays fractions of one cent, so the increase will be by a multiple of $0.01. If Microsoft increased its dividend by $0.01 or $0.02, the dividend increase would be very low (relatively speaking) in comparison to Microsoft's past dividend growth rate - three percent / six percent versus Microsoft's last dividend hike of eleven percent. A $0.03 increase would equal a 10 percent increase, which is very close to Microsoft's last dividend increase of eleven percent. A $0.04 increase would equal a growth rate of 13 percent, which is possible as well but less likely than a $0.03 increase (to $0.34), as this would mean that Microsoft would increase its dividend growth rate again - usually companies tend to lower their dividend growth rates over the years (as the company matures), so a 10 percent increase vs. 11 percent in the previous year seems most likely. A dividend yield of more than three percent still is very compelling as the broad market's yield is just 2.0 percent and US bonds yield just 2.2 percent. Since Microsoft has a AAA rating, buying the company's shares and holding them with a long-term horizon is a very low risk investment, making the above market dividend yield even more compelling. Microsoft's cloud business has reached an annual run rate of $8 billion and grew 27 percent in the last quarter - Microsoft is poised to become the number two cloud company (after Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )) in IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and will become the clear PaaS leader (Platform as a Service). Gross margins for Microsoft's cloud business are about 70 percent (thus higher than the company wide average of 65 percent) and will likely continue to grow. Success in the cloud does not only means revenue growth for Microsoft, but very profitable revenues: Growing cloud revenues should provide a boost to Microsoft's margins, making the company more profitable over time. Microsoft's Bing keeps capturing market share and is about to become profitable for the first time: Nadella said Bing will generate positive net income in fiscal 2016, which is very good news for investors. Over the years Microsoft has spent a lot of cash and work on its search engine business while generating loss after loss with it. As Bing will be profitable very soon, Microsoft is not longer spending money on the segment, but rather generating money from it, which should be another positive for Microsoft's bottom line. Microsoft also has taken other steps to become more profitable. Among the cost reduction initiatives are job cuts, especially in the business acquired from Nokia, which will lower Microsoft's operating costs and thus raise margins and earnings. Microsoft's traditional PC business is in a good position as well. PC sales, which have been trending down for years, are finally stabilizing: Microsoft's Windows 10 and Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) new Skylake processors are factors which motivate users to upgrade their PCs. Intel has said "PC demand appears to have bottomed" and PC sales are growing at very healthy rates in some countries (e.g. Taiwan notebook sales were up 15 percent in August on a month on month basis). With global PC sales not shrinking but growing from now on, this should be another boost to Microsoft's top as well as bottom line. It thus is not surprising that analysts see Microsoft earnings $3.07 in the next fiscal year, which is more than Microsoft has ever earned in the past. Higher revenues, higher margins (through high margin growth in the cloud and cost cutting) and the impact of a lower share count due to Microsoft's stock buybacks will allow for substantial earnings per share growth in the next years. With an expected dividend of $0.34 quarterly Microsoft's dividend payout ratio (using $1.36 for the annual dividend and $3.07 for EPS) would be slightly less than 45 percent, which is still very conservative - a lot of blue chip stock's have higher dividend payout ratios. As Microsoft's business is not very cyclical and the company has a very clean balance sheet, Microsoft could probably afford to pay out a higher portion of its earnings. I used the interactive finbox valuation model to determine a fair value for Microsoft's shares: Even with conservative assumptions (an exit EBITDA multiple which is below the peer group average and below Microsoft's current EBITDA multiple; revenue growth leveling of to just three percent in a short time) Microsoft looks undervalued right now, according to my calculations Microsoft's fair value is about $48, which implies low doubledigit upside for the company. We also can use another way to determine whether Microsoft is undervalued right now, the Gordon growth model: Using Microsoft's current dividend rate of $1.24, a discount rate of nine percent and by putting in the current share price of $43.50 as the fair value, we can solve for g, the required dividend growth rate we need to justify buying at today's price. By solving $43.50 = $1.24 / (0.09 - g) for g we get to a required dividend growth rate of 6.1 percent. This means: When Microsoft raises its dividend by six percent annually in the future, the company's shares trade at fair value right now. If Microsoft raises its dividend faster, its shares are undervalued right now if Microsoft raises its dividend by a lower pace, its shares would be overvalued right now (at least from an income investor's point of view). As Microsoft's dividend growth rate has been a lot high in the past, and since the analyst consensus sees Microsoft grow its earnings by 7.2 percent annually over the next five years ( source ), a dividend growth rate of more than six percent seems very likely - Microsoft is undervalued right now. When we use Microsoft's expected new dividend of $0.34 per quarter (or $1.36 annually), the required dividend growth rate drops down to 5.9 percent, which will be even easier to achieve. Microsoft is about to raise its dividend, and although we will probably not see a 15 to 20 percent hike, a low double-digit growth rate is likely. As Microsoft's shares are down over the last year the company's dividend yield became very attractive, especially in an environment where low risk investments come with very low returns. According to my calculations Microsoft is trading below fair value right now. The company's shares thus look attractive for income investors ahead of another dividend increase.
