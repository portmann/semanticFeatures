Silicom: Poised For The Next Wave Of Growth - Silicom Ltd (NASDAQ:SILC) | Seeking Alpha Silicom previously was a high growth company but has stumbled in 2014 and 2015. The security sector is a growing market for the company and will cause revenue acceleration. Silicom Ltd (NASDAQ: SILC ) is an off-the-beaten-track Israeli company that benefits from the same growth drivers as security vendors such as Check Point Software (NASDAQ: CHKP ), Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ), and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ). The company supplies network interface cards (NICs) that go into bare slots in its customers' network appliances, and provide various types of functionalities to the appliances, such as bypass and CPU offload. Silicom has a history of terrific revenue growth, with a 30% CAGR from 2010 to 2013. The last two years have been tougher with a 3% growth rate each year. So, what caused the slowdown in growth and what can reignite sales growth for the company? Silicom's main end markets until recently were WAN Optimization and application delivery controllers (ADCs). These markets were both growing at a 15-20% clip during Silicom's growth years and the company added incremental growth by growing its customer base and introducing new products. More recently these markets have slowed down considerably as they have matured and their penetration rates have increased. In addition, Silicom's more recent products have been more sophisticated technologically and had more features, leading to longer design cycles with its customers. Last year Silicom missed a design win on a continuing product causing it to miss Q3. This year, it missed Q2 because a large customer was bought by a private equity firm and it drew down existing inventories before buying new parts from Silicom. So exiting this SILC history lesson, where does this lead us going forward? Silicom rebounded from its Q2 miss this year with a 22% revenue growth quarter in Q3. Granted the comparison was easy with last year but the quarter got the company back of the growth trajectory it had in Q1. Management guided to $20-$21m in revenue for Q4, a 6% sequential increase from Q3. Given the 40% historical Q4 sequential revenue increases in 2013 and 2014, I think this year's guidance is extremely conservative. Silicom launched a time-stamp product for the network management and financial markets two years ago. At the time, it predicted that the products could add $10m to its run rate in a year's time. These products have been at customer labs in the interim and were even designed into a product that has yet to launch. Time-stamp has disappointed investors (and management), but I view it currently as a free option since there is no revenue from it built into my model and each win could be sized at $3m and above. Security is a 30% end market for Silicom now and is growing quickly. Customers (my guess, not verified by management) such as Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), SourceFire (acquired by Cisco), McAfee, Juniper, HP Tippingpoint, etc. have designed in Silicom cards to their appliances. As this market becomes a larger piece of Silicom's revenue stream, overall revenue should accelerate. Security is a crucial priority for CIOs now and they will continue to spend, regardless of the overall tepid world economic growth. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a hot topic in the tech world today. What this means is the ability to separate the software that creates the desired function from the underlying hardware. Basically it will allow customers to use commodity hardware in conjunction with security or ADC software instead of using hardware appliances supplied by the security or ADC vendor. Silicom's NICs are still relevant in this environment because the commodity servers need to have the input / output functionality that they provide. One target customer base that SILC has not yet penetrated is the Web 2.0 market. Potential customers like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) are putting together their own hardware and represent a huge opportunity for Silicom if the company can get its foot in the door. It is working on this angle but have reminded me that it could be a long process to a design win. This again seems like another free option as no one is expecting the company to acquire these customers at all. So if I am right and Silicom's revenue growth gets back to a healthy level (15-20%?), the stock will be meaningfully higher than here given its current 10x P/E ratio ex-its net cash. While not likely, I think there is a scenario where Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) purchases Silicom at some point down the road. The company's products are mostly based on Intel chipsets and while Intel has some competing NICs, Silicom's product line could greatly enhance Intel's product breadth. Obviously given Intel's balance sheet (even pro forma for the Altera acquisition), it could pay a nice premium for the company.
