Micron And Intel: Non-Volatile Memory Is Exploding - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Micron continues to be mystifyingly closed mouth about some of the developments they have done in their IMFT joint venture with Intel. Intel is extremely bullish on what the new 3DXpoint technology is going to mean. Micron is bullish but hasn't given much background as to how they will market the technology. Intel and Micron appear to be free to sell 3DXpoint as they choose with no marketing restrictions on each other in their joint venture. My previous article Intel/Micron: 3D NAND And SSDs About To Explode was a week prior to the release of 3DXpoint. Let me augment that title by now saying Non Volatile Memory is Exploding, again in the very best sense of the word "explode". Notice the broadening to "NVM" and the change to the present tense. Much of the change is due to what we've learned at the 3D Xpoint hasty unveiling , and what I've learned attending the Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) Analyst Day and the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Developers Forum (slides for the 201 presentations available at this link). Tongue tied Micron. For reasons nobody has been able to explain, Micron and Intel gave only 24 hours notice for their poorly executed unveiling of the biggest thing to hit computer memories in 25 years. There were no potential customers of 3DXpoint on stage to validate the new memory concept, no whitepapers and few specs. Micron CEO, Mark Durcan, looked particularly uneasy next to his Intel counterpart, Rob Crooke. I attended the August 14 Micron analyst day and assumed, incorrectly, that shareholders would be given a lot more detail on 3DXpoint which had been developed over 10 years and which will be built in the Intel/Micron joint venture IMFT, which owns a fab in Lehi, Utah. A happy and very effusive Intel. The contrast with Micron's analyst day and the Intel Developer's Forum which began today, August 18, couldn't be more striking when it comes to transparency on this amazing new product. Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, closed his keynote address with a side by side comparison of a state of the art Intel NAND based Solid State Drive against a 3DXPoint SSD. The latter delivered 5 - 7.5x the performance of the former; we learned later in the day from Intel's Rob Crooke, Senior VP of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, that this performance increment would have been even larger but for the memory buss the 3DXpoint was using. Two IDF sessions later on Tuesday, August 18, made my whole trip better. They can be found at the link for IDF presentations by searching for these titles: "SSD's are here- The Next Wave in Non- Volatile Memory Driven Storage Modernizations" and "Technology Insight: Intel Non-Volatile Memory Inside. The Speed of Possibility Outside". So What did the two partners tell us? Micron put up the following graph on one of its slides, showing the growth of NAND demand: That four year slice of time works out to about a 36% compound annual growth rate. By contrast, in the first Intel SSD presentation cited above, Greg Matson, the Director of Strategic Planning for the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, put up a more bullish slide: And that five year time slice works out to a 40% CAGR. So what's 4% between friends? An enormous amount since by the terminal year we are dealing with billions of dollars of product (even though the pricing of 3DXpoint hasn't yet been released). Intel's Matson said he believes 3DXpoint can scale to 100TB in a 2.5" drive enclosure. For comparison Samsung has just announced a NAND based SSD which will "only" scale to 16TB . In the words of Intel presenter Matson, "2016 is the year of crossover [from HDD to SSD]. The hard disc guys will never catch up." Intel's Matson shared the stage with Ruiping Sun, Principal Architect of Yahoo!, who gave a real world example of where 3DXpoint would fit in his company's deployment and stratification of "hot" and "cold" storage. Matson then displayed a nice series of slides on performance advantages which I hadn't seen elsewhere. First he had this interesting comparison between hard discs and SSDs: What the chart is showing is that HDDs degrade in performance as they get loaded down. And then there was this slide which clearly shows where the 3DXpont-- released under the Optane system branding name-- fits: Obviously Matson was quite pleased with the volume of the graph enabled by his light blue baby. For the first time we have been given the "why?" for the adoption by some customer segments. Please download the entire slide decks from both presentations cited above. They are good reading. What about the different markets for the two partners in IMFT? Unfortunately, at both meetings the audience wasted a lot of time on hyper technical and competitive questions which were not going to get answered: What is your error correction? What are the materials? How many metal layers are there? I was able to ask a question of Rob Crooke after his Intel presentation, "Are there any limitations on either partner in IMFT on how they can sell or who they can sell to?" He responded that 3DXpoint would primarily leave Intel bundled into systems, just as NAND does now. "You don't see us selling a lot or raw NAND chips and I don't think you will with 3DXpoint either." He said we'd have to ask Micron about their go to market strategy. I took his answer to mean either company is unrestricted on sales. Conclusions. This new product is obviously going to be huge. Micron's Mark Durcan was uncharacteristically fairly specific and very bullish as to the size of the market: In the 2018 timeframe [3DXpoint] could easily be of the same order of magnitude as our DRAM businesses in that timeframe. So maybe not the same size maybe half the size in 2018 but it will be a significant additive revenue stream to Micron at the time. And clearly both companies are lavishing capital on Lehi, Utah which has already seen a lot of construction. Intel's Crooke indicated that a wafer of 3DXpoint contains about 5 TeraBytes or about 312 individual 128Gb (16GB) die. At a price per 16GB chip, which we only know lies between DRAM and NAND but which has been guessed to be between $40 and $60, Lehi, Utah may soon be generating a total of almost $18 billion in revenue for its two partners. Micron is secretive, tight lipped, and not as bullish as Intel. Intel is quickly reeling out more data and has made this a show piece of their IDF 2015. It looks very big for both companies.
