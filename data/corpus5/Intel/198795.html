Does Apple Have A Surface Book Problem? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha For the September quarter, Mac sales growth is expected to be flat. Microsoft has announced the Surface Book, which is superior to the 13" MacBook Pro in many ways. Given the robust growth of the iOS ecosystem, does Apple really care about a potential Surface Book impact on the Mac? Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) introduced the Surface Book on October 6 and took direct aim at the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBook Pro. Microsoft claims Surface Book is "the ultimate laptop" with features that current MacBook Pros cannot match. Whether Surface Book constitutes a threat to Apple depends on Apple's product plans for MacBook, as well as its long-term strategy for Mac OS X. The introduction of the Surface Book inflamed a long-standing concern I've had about Apple's strategy and direction for Mac OS X devices, which I wrote about in What Is The Future Of The Mac? It's not just that the Surface Book is a finely crafted machine that claims to be twice as fast as the MacBook Pro. The speed claim should be greeted with some skepticism, since it wasn't disclosed what specific benchmark was used or what the configurations of the respective machines were. The 13.5-inch Surface Book features the latest Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Skylake processors and in some configurations, a discreet Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPU. The current 13-inch MacBook Pros are a generation behind in CPU, and can't be configured with a discreet GPU at all. These kinds of advantages tend to be transitory, since they depend on early adoption of commodity processors, which anyone else can also use. Although SA contributor Alcaraz Research has speculated that the unidentified "secret" Nvidia GPU Microsoft is using in the Surface Book is somehow "special", it's unlikely to be significantly customized. The volume for the Surface Book just wouldn't justify the engineering cost, which Microsoft would be required to bear. So the Nvidia GPU is probably just an early release of something that will soon be available to all OEMs, just as the Intel CPU is now. And this is the fundamental problem that all manufacturers of personal computers have whether Microsoft or Apple or any Windows OEM. It's very difficult to get a meaningful, lasting competitive advantage for a machine based on commodity processors. Apple has tended to rely on the perceived advantage of Mac OS X. I would certainly agree that this advantage is highly debatable. Mac OS X is the more refined and better-integrated OS. Apple has done an excellent job of aligning the user interfaces of iOS and OS X. I was personally a little disappointed that the final-release version of Windows 10 didn't resolve the "split personality" of Windows 8 with its clashing tablet and desktop user interfaces. The problem with Win 8 was not that it tried to converge desktop and tablet, but that the convergence was incomplete. And it still is in Win 10. Alcaraz makes an astute observation about the Surface Book that bears on this issue of convergence. Alcaraz points out that the ability to use Surface Book as a tablet as well as being able to use desktop class applications such as Adobe Creative Cloud make it a much more desirable platform for creative professionals than a MacBook Pro or iPad Pro can be, either separately or together. I've been urging that Apple enable OS X for touchscreens for some time, in the face of considerable resistance from numerous Apple fans who echo the sentiments of Apple's management regarding "convergence". If there's a threat in Surface Book, it's due to Apple reluctance to embrace this converged future. The iPad Pro may be an indicator that Apple is finally losing the "not invented here" attitude. At the October 6 event, Microsoft asserted with some justification that Apple is "chasing" the Surface Pro. Yes, and no. The fact that Apple chose not to endow the iPad Pro with an Intel processor probably says much about Apple's long-term personal computer strategy. Apple hailed the iPad Pro at its unveiling as the future of personal computing. Let's think about what that means. This future has two key ingredients: iOS and Apple custom systems on chip (SOCs). I've speculated that Apple could build Mac OS X laptops with its ARM based SOCs, such as the new A9X in the iPad Pro. Based on the performance of the A9 in the latest iPhone 6s/6s Plus, the A9X probably has more processing power that the current Intel Core M in the Retina MacBook (not that that's saying much). Many have pointed out that this would mean limited or no backward compatibility with legacy OS X apps. This is somewhat moderated by the fact that developers with apps on the Mac App store would easily be able to port the apps to Apple's SOCs That would still leave a lot of legacy code off limits for any new OS X devices that used Apple's SOCs. Based on the iPad Pro, I believe that Apple is going to keep OS X on Intel for the foreseeable future. Instead, I believe that Apple is going to put its effort into continuing to grow the iOS ecosystem, adding ever more capability to it. iOS 9 and iPad Pro are indicators of this direction. For Apple, it makes sense. Apple is investing in its true money maker, rather than in a marginal (for Apple) product. In this scenario, rather than making Mac OS X the converged platform, and having to drag along a lot of baggage, iOS becomes the converged platform, able ultimately to handle so called "desktop" tasks as well as lighter weight tablet tasks. Clearly, iOS isn't there yet. But we're seeing the evolutionary trend in the operating system, apps, and hardware capability. iOS 9 received two important changes this year: the ability to multitask and a new virtual trackpad mode. Multitasking is essential for any OS that aspires to be a general purpose computing option. In iOS 9, it's limited to running just two apps simultaneously in side by side panes, but it's a step towards a desktop class OS. The virtual trackpad mode allows the keyboard region on the screen to become a trackpad for purposes of manipulating a text cursor. It's a small but significant step in the direction of mouse and trackpad support, which a converged OS would need to have. In apps, we're seeing more and more desktop apps being ported to iOS, such as Microsoft Office, and in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) apps that have much of the functionality of desktop apps such as Photoshop. Finally, in hardware, the increasing power and performance of Apple's processors for iPhone and iPad have made them suitable substitutes for low-end Intel Core processors. If these trends continue (and it may take years), iOS simply subsumes Mac OS X, becoming Apple's converged platform, until finally, OS X withers away. Investors may have legitimate concerns about Apple's near-term product plans for OS X devices. Macs are still an important product line, representing about 12% of total revenue as of the June quarter. The PC market is still huge, at 66.1 million units in the June quarter, according to IDC , and therefore represents a growth opportunity that is largely unexploited. At the very least, Apple should move more quickly in upgrading the processors in the MacBook Pro line to the latest available from Intel. Providing a touchscreen option would be another enhancement that would be relatively painless, as long as Macs stay on the Intel platform. Apple should do both. But even if it doesn't, the impact of Surface Book may be blunted by the overall decline of PC sales, as well as the free Win 10 upgrade, which I expect to further dampen new PC sales. Apple investors will want to watch results closely in the September and December quarters for signs of weakness in Mac sales, which may already exist. Apple's Mac unit sales growth for the September quarter has been predicted to be flat by IDC and Gartner . Even if Mac sales suffer declines in the coming quarters, I would still be a buyer of Apple. In the long run, Mac sales may simply not matter. Apple is in the enviable position, unlike so many PC manufacturers, of not being dependent on its Mac sales for growth.
