Can Microsoft Compete With Apple In Devices? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft devices such as Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 are increasingly competitive with Apple. However, September quarter results contained substantial y/y declines in Surface and Windows licensing revenue. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) continues to field very credible Windows 10 devices, including the new Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. However, Microsoft continues to see declining revenue and market share in what has become the most important personal computing device, the smartphone. Competing with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has proved challenging, and Microsoft's September quarter results demonstrate this. I can't remember the last time I agreed with anything that ex-CEO Steve Ballmer had to say. Somewhat to my surprise, I found myself in agreement with a statement he made in a Bloomberg interview : Of course, that's not a statement that Microsoft will be competitive, let alone win in any sense of the word. But Microsoft has an operating system that it's been able to adapt to a variety of platforms and that is competitive with Apple's Mac OS X and iOS. Microsoft has demonstrated increasing hardware prowess, in conventional Windows devices as well as its very innovative HoloLens system. Being competitive doesn't just mean fielding devices. Lots of companies put out new smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. Microsoft's real challenge in competing with Apple is to achieve comparable profitability. Here, there is still much work to do, as Microsoft's September quarter results illustrate. On the conference call , analysts were generally complementary, but the results were mixed. GAAP revenue was down 12% y/y, to $20.4 billion, and GAAP operating income was down 1% y/y to $5.8 billion. This was perhaps to be expected as a consequence of the free Windows 10 upgrade, but even after putting the Windows 10 deferred revenue of $1.3 billion back in to the non-GAAP results, they weren't great. Revenue was still down by 7% y/y, and operating income grew by only 1% y/y. For the new fiscal year, Microsoft has reorganized into Productivity and Business Processes where Office products went, Intelligent Cloud where the enterprise server and cloud (Azure) products went, and then More Personal Computing where all the Windows licensing and devices went. Microsoft has always done well in the enterprise, and this continues to be the case. Microsoft has put all its problem children in one playpen, and the result was a 17% y/y decline in revenue for the More Personal Computing (MPC) group. As I've been saying for some time, Windows 10 is not stimulating growth in Window OEM devices, and OEM licensing revenue was down 7% y/y for pro licensing and down 4% y/y for consumer. One analyst pointed to this as a better than expected result, but it really isn't. OEM's generally buy a lot of licenses when a new version of Windows comes out in preparation for new hardware releases. It doesn't say anything about sales, except that they don't expect them to be any better than last year, when Windows 8 had already been out for a year. Surface revenue was also down 26% y/y, but it was phone hardware that suffered the worst decline of 54% y/y. Search was the the sole bright spot in the new group, posting a 29% y/y revenue gain on the strength of enhanced search demand through new Windows 10 users. CEO Nadella has made some good decisions in trying to meet the challenges faced by Microsoft in devices. Making the Windows 10 upgrade free to consumers was a good decision. Microsoft's latest Surface devices are very competitive, and can be expected to do well. Probably the best decision made at Microsoft is the one most at odds with Apple's approach, which was to focus on a single converged OS with variants for the different device types. I'm sure this is the right approach, despite being an Apple investor and developer. As Microsoft and its OEMs have fielded a variety of Windows-based, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )-powered touch screen laptops and tablets, this has probably hurt iPad sales more than anything else. But it's been a validation of Microsoft's approach, and continues to be an advantage for Microsoft. Microsoft's big problem is in smartphones. I doubt the new Windows 10 phones can turn this around. The hardware is commodity grade, with undistinguished Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) processors. I'm not convinced that the Continuum feature that allows the phone to be used in desktop mode is a really compelling usage scenario for most consumers, especially traditional Windows users who probably already have a Windows PC. None of the usual Windows PC software will run on these phones. If smartphones represent a gap in Microsoft's device strategy, there is another deeper gap. This is Microsoft's dependence on commodity processors from Intel and Qualcomm. Focusing on Intel for laptops and tablets is a good strategy for Microsoft in the near term. Microsoft's priority needed to be preserving its existing 1.5 billion user base and converting them to more mobile devices, as I discussed in Microsoft 'Mobilizes' the PC . Providing backward compatibility to legacy Windows software was key to this. The lack of ability to develop custom SOCs for its phones more or less dooms them to second tier status. This lack of a custom SOC also doomed Microsoft's early ARM-based Surface tablets. Relying on commodity ARM processors has never worked well for Microsoft. Given Apple's five-year head start in custom SOCs, this is a lead that Microsoft cannot reasonably expect to overcome without help. Probably, Microsoft's best choice is to rely on Intel for smartphone processors, once processors of sufficient performance become available. So, the all Intel future still looks like the best path forward in the near term. Continuum, running on an Intel-based phone probably opens up a wider range of software options for the user. Whether this is enough to kick start Windows 10 phone sales remains to be seen. It can't hurt. Lately, I've begun to wonder if the all Intel approach is really the best for Microsoft in the very long term. I've been saying for some time that the only advantage that ARM processors have over the Intel architecture is cost. While this cost advantage has proved decisive for smartphones, and most lower cost tablets, the extra cost of Wintel devices is acceptable for the sake of software compatibility. In the longer term, I wonder if there won't be a gradual erosion of the Windows user base as users are lured away by lower cost ARM-based platforms. As I, and many others are observing, ARM processors are getting much more capable every year. At the rate of current progress, ARM processors from leading developers such as Apple and Samsung will probably be equivalent to all but the most powerful processors from Intel in a year or two. The popularity of Windows is probably to some degree generational, and younger users starting out on one of the mobile device platforms will not be motivated by considerations of compatibility with Windows software. Windows may eventually lose more users due to old age than for any other reason. But this is a few years off. For the present, Microsoft investors can look forward to the increasing competitiveness of its devices, and improving revenue as new devices hit the market.
