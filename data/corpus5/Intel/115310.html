Apple: Mac Sales Growth Driven By China In The June Quarter - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IDC has forecast that Apple sold over 5 million Macs in the June quarter, a y/y gain of 16%. Apple's Mac growth, as in iPhone, has been fueled by China. Although Mac sales have been outgrowing the PC market, Apple's global market share of 13.5% indicates that there is more opportunity for growth. Gartner and IDC recently released PC sales estimates for the June quarter with widely varying Mac sales estimates. Gartner estimated a sales decline for Mac in the U.S., while IDC estimates sales gains both in the U.S. and globally. The difference may be partly explainable by the impact of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) booming China business. Apple's strong iPhone sales in China had a halo effect on Mac sales in the March quarter. Apple can expect more of the same for June. It's hard to tell from the results of Gartner and IDC whether the divergence between their results is systematic or merely random noise. Gartner concluded that Apple's Mac sales had declined by 2.5% y/y to 1.922 million units in the U.S. for calendar Q2. Meanwhile, Gartner doesn't even show Apple making the top five globally. IDC shows a gain of 12% to 2.205 million units in the U.S. while placing Apple fourth globally with 5.136 million units. To add to the confusion, while Gartner's estimates are "sell in" (wholesale to distribution channels), IDC states that its estimates can be either sell in or "sell through" (retail to end users). Apple's quarterly sales data are in fact a combination of both, since Apple sells both to distributors and directly through its retail stores and online. This alone could account for the difference between Gartner and IDC with respect to Apple. Gartner and IDC at least more or less agree on the state of Windows PC sales, as both show significant y/y PC sales declines: 9.5% according to Gartner, 11.8% according to IDC. And both arrive at the same explanation for the decline: presumed inventory reductions ahead of the launch of Windows 10. Despite the free upgrade to Win10, this probably is a compelling motive for Windows PC makers and says much about the stigma of Windows 8. None of the manufacturers want to have their machines on display with Win8 once Win10 is released. Given that IDC includes retail and wholesale sales in their calculations, I consider it very likely that IDC's number will be much closer to what Apple will report for the June quarter. Mac sales of 5.136 million for the quarter represent 16.1% y/y unit shipment growth according to IDC. I estimate Mac sales revenue to be about $6.1 billion for the quarter for 11% y/y growth. As I recently discussed in Apple Clobbers Samsung In China , the key to understanding how Apple is bucking the overall PC market trend is Apple's performance in China. During Apple's March quarter earnings call , CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Mac unit sales were up 32% in China. Clearly, strong iPhone sales are having a halo effect. Combined with Apple's ever increasing retail presence and the effort to make OS X and iOS easier for Chinese language users, I expect Mac unit sales to be strong once again in the quarter. Mac has become the aspirational personal computer brand in China just as iPhone has become the aspirational smart phone brand. Apple's leadership has been very proud of the way Mac sales have grown even as the overall PC market has declined. Despite this, we may look back at what has happened over the past couple of years as a missed opportunity for Apple. This is driven by two fundamental observations. The first is that much of the slow down of Windows PC sales may be attributed to the impact of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 8. During the last two years that Windows PC sales have been hobbled by the impact of Win8, Apple had a golden opportunity to greatly expand its market share. With the advent of Win10, the opportunity that Win8 represented for Apple probably comes to an end. Windows 10 will probably satisfy most Windows users that Microsoft is back on track, and Microsoft will achieve its goal of having 1 billion Windows 10 users within two years, as I discussed in Microsoft 'Mobilizes' The PC . The second observation is that Apple's U.S. market share hasn't really changed all that much since the advent of Win8. At the time that Win8 was released in Q4 2012, Apple had an 11.4% share of the U.S. personal computer market, according to IDC. As of IDC's latest report, Apple now has a 13.5% share of the US market, a gain of 2.1 percentage points. Not much to show for what Apple claims to be the "world's most advanced operating system". Not long after investors started to realize that Apple has benefited mightily from expansion in China, concerns emerged about Apple's exposure to economic issues in China, such as the recent stock market declines. Fellow SA contributor Stone Fox Capital has a good discussion of this. Obviously, Apple can't control macro-economic factors and a recession in China would undoubtedly not be good for sales. However, it's not clear that what's going on in the China markets is necessarily a harbinger of recession. Also, as an aspirational brand that is still out of reach for the majority of Chinese consumers, Apple may be protected to some degree from an economic downturn in China. The wealthy tend to stay wealthy despite macro-economic circumstances. Just as the recession in the U.S. represented an opportunity to buy Apple shares on the cheap, I concur with Stone Fox that a downturn in China might also present buying opportunities for Apple. Despite not having fully capitalized on the Win8 debacle, I continue to view personal computers as a large untapped area for growth for Apple, as I discussed in What Is The Future Of The Mac? With a global market share of only 7.8% (according to IDC), there is arguably more potential for growth in Mac (at least in market share) than there is in iPhone. The key of course is greater price competitiveness, something that Apple has been slowly creeping up on. But there's only so much Apple can do with pricing as long as Macs depend on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processors. Intel's pricing of their Core series processors reflects their near-monopoly on high performance x64 processors for desktop and laptop applications. In the "Future of the Mac" and other articles, I've focused on reducing processor cost as a way to achieve greater price competitiveness of the Mac without sacrificing build quality (the aluminum unibody is a must) or gross margin. I've suggested that a Mac based on Apple's ARM architecture SOC's could achieve the necessary cost savings. There are, of course, consequences to switching to ARM for the Mac. So here's another thought: AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ). Apple already uses AMD's graphics chips. AMD's Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) are essentially low end desktop/laptop class systems on chip (SOCs) that contain highly capable AMD graphics built in. Although AMD's APUs served as the basis for the semi-custom chips AMD supplies for XBox One and Playstation 4, they haven't done particularly well in the general PC market. This is due in large part to being fabricated on a 28 nm node (Kaveri and the new Carrizo series), which is hardly competitive with Intel's latest 14 nm node. The second factor hurting APU sales is that AMD's designs have lagged Intel in terms of performance, even after taking process into account. AMD has some interesting products in the pipeline for 2016, as described by Mark Papermaster, AMD SVP and Chief Technology Officer, in his Financial Analyst Day presentation . Mark Papermaster, the reader may recall, served briefly at Apple as head of Hardware Engineering. Papermaster describes two key technology thrusts for AMD in 2016. The first is a move to an all new CPU architecture dubbed Zen, which promises design improvements, as well as fabrication on (probably) Global Foundries forthcoming 14 nm FinFET process node. The second major thrust is moving AMD's graphics chips to FinFET as well. So AMD's key product lines in CPUs and GPUs will both benefit from 14 nm FinFET. It's not clear that Zen will achieve performance parity with Intel, but it may represent a better price/performance value. AMD is very hungry and has been willing to live with much lower margins than Intel. AMD may hand Apple a golden opportunity to win even more PC market share.
