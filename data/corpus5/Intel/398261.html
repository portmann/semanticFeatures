Is Intel Losing Its Head? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha In 2013, Intel cancelled OnCue, its TV project. Now, it is throwing in the towel on mobile. Additionally, the company is going to execute a layoff in the coming months. Both measures are counterproductive for a company that needs its best employees to turn the ship around. Re/code reports that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has invested $10 billion in its mobile unit over the last 3 years. Now, the company is throwing in the towel on this endeavor. After last week's announced layoff, this is another set of negative signs coming from the giant chipmaker. Brian Krzanich argued the company needs flexibility to invest in hot segments like Cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT). Intel's management seems to be suggesting that layoffs and R&D crash programs are the way to achieve flexibility. I couldn't disagree more. Three years ago, Intel launched an offensive to get a nice piece of the mobile chip market. The company showed willingness to put huge financial resources and technical staff behind this ambitious project. However, fast forwarding 3 years to the present, Intel just killed several mobile-related programs. Additionally, one of the first measures taken by the current management team was to cancel the TV project . Clearly, there's a pattern here. Philip Fisher, the growth investing legend, once said that research projects cancellation was a waste of money, but more than this, a waste of brain power. Brilliant scientists are put on five-year projects, just to see them cancelled after just three years. All the work goes down the drain, and the scientists are relocated to some other tasks, starting from scratch. Thus preventing the staff from gaining the technical reputation that, so many times, drives the ambition of great minds. This doesn't seem to be a good allocation of the company's resources, nor the way to motivate the bright minds that can come up with the innovations Intel needs to improve. On another note, Intel announced that it intends to part ways with 12,000 of its employees. The company also stated that it will pursue voluntary and involuntary agreements to achieve that figure. My view on layoffs is always pretty negative, and I have voiced against investing in companies undertaking this tactic. Usually, layoffs are the management's confession of poor business decisions, and, in my experience, it doesn't really help managements devising better business strategies. Actually, it works inversely . When a company announces a layoff, employees cannot avoid reading such initiative as a war declaration. Basically, the company is saying that when problems arise, it won't care about employees, it'll just care about short-term results and Wall Street. The theoretical negative impact on productivity and employee morale is well known, but since these are difficult to measure, many managers and investors tend to overlook them. However, the problem is well beyond productivity and morale. Voluntary severance packages are an open door for the best brains to leave. Only the employees who feel confident enough about their own skills will pursue opportunities outside the company. Layoffs are the best way to leave a company struggling with mediocrity or, metaphorically speaking, leaving a body with no head. There are some positives that may (or may not) offset the gloomy picture presented in the previous paragraphs. Going through Glassdoor (I like to check this website to get the employees' feel on the company), reviews on Intel already incorporate a negative sentiment towards layoffs. However, even considering the layoffs, they still see the company as a great place to work (3.8 in 5), full of competent people and compelling projects. Additionally, focusing on growth segments where margins are above the company's average is a sound strategy. If the present layoffs and project cancellations end up being a one-off, then the current re-focusing strategy might work in the long run. Intel's problem seems to be the lack of consistency coming from the management team. Three years ago, they were fully committed to mobile, but now that mobile is no longer the hot trend, Intel is giving up. Who knows what will happen to the current bet on Cloud 3 years from now? Management behavior seems erratic and suggests that the present efforts to re-focus might be scrapped if new problems arise during the process. We will need to wait and see, but overall, I'm not positive on this one. Most likely, the current layoff program and the lack of persistence on R&D projects will have a negative impact on sales and margins. During the next 3 years, profit margins and return on equity will be good indicators of a successful turnaround. The company claims to be refocusing on areas where it has better margins; therefore, if the turnaround is successful, we should see some improvements on margins and ROE. If the indicators don't improve enough, that might be happening because the company is no longer capable of keeping its brightest minds paving the way for the future. In order words, Intel might have lost its head. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
