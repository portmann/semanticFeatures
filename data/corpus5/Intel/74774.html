Intel-Altera: My Thoughts On The Proposed Deal - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Deal focuses on the data center group. On Monday, we received an official announcement from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) that it would be purchasing Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). The deal will combine Intel's manufacturing power with a strong product portfolio from Altera in an effort to meet the needs of data center and Internet of Things customers. Now that a proposed deal is in place, I'd like to detail my thoughts on the combination. The presentation slides state that the deal is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow in the first year after closing. Intel has stuck to GAAP results, unlike a number of technology companies that like to exclude certain costs like share-based compensation. Intel has reported restructuring costs in its GAAP results in recent years, but I'm guessing that it will break out Altera deal specific costs in the short term. Since Intel didn't state the deal will be accretive to GAAP EPS initially, we can most likely figure that the EPS figure will be hurt by the deal in the short term. Intel's main focus on the deal is data center and IoT, two segments that Intel is targeting for future growth. When the company reported Q1 results , the Data Center Group ("DCG") reported more than 19% revenue growth over the prior year period. That growth followed the more than 18% top line increase for the segment in 2014. The IoT segment also showed a small double digit revenue increase in Q1. Focusing on these growth segments helps reduce the company's reliance on the PC space, which got Intel in trouble during early 2015. When you look at Intel's new reporting segments, the DCG was the most profitable one in Q1. Intel will take on a bit of debt to complete this deal (if approved). It will be interesting to see how much money is borrowed, and at what rates. US Treasury rates have jumped in recent weeks, which increases Intel's borrowing costs. If Intel were to borrow $10 billion at an average cost of 4.00%, you'd be talking about $400 million in annual pre-tax interest costs, or about $0.08 per share. An alternative use of that money would have been to buy back shares. However, Intel uses the buyback as its last use of cash, CFO Stacy Smith reiterated on the most recent conference call : And just coming on the last part of your question, John, we - as Brian said, our priority is to invest in the business first, dividend second, and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances. Intel increased its buyback last year and accelerated some repurchases in the second half of 2014. You can expect that buybacks will slow down going forward if the company takes out as much debt as expected. The buyback would have helped with the EPS, while the Altera deal will help with the revenues first, and hopefully with the EPS over time. I can't say at this time how much of an impact on the dividend there will be until we see if the deal goes through, how much debt is taken on, and how results are impacted. At the moment, I have to say Intel is doing what it needs to, and that is focusing on data center and IoT. Time will tell if the price was too high, as detailed by an analyst at Citigroup. At the purchase price, Altera's Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio (for the trailing twelve months) is about 24, compared to Intel at around 6.6. Those that believe in capital returns would argue that Intel could have used these funds for the buyback, but that doesn't help the business in the long run. Intel needed to reduce its reliance on the PC space, and hopefully the Altera purchase will do just that.
