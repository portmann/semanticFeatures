Nvidia: Still Struggling To Find Growth Beyond PCs, Buy Qualcomm Or Intel - Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha It doesn't make sense to place a bet on Nvidia at this level, not when its second quarter might be under pressure. Given that more than 70% NVDA revenue comes from PC-dependent segment makes NVDA too risky. Qualcomm and Intel trade at P/Es of 16 and 13, respectively. On top of that, they both pay annual dividends that yield a full point higher than Nvidia. It's a new era in the chip sector. Like the drop in oil prices that caused the panic among energy companies, the huge decline in the personal computer market has taken a drastic toll on chip companies whose business relies on high PC sales. And that makes chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) a tough trade, given that more than 70% its revenue comes from its Graphics Processing Unit -- a PC-dependent segment. To its credit, Nvidia understands what it is up against. The Santa Clara, CA.-based company has begun to expand its products into non-traditional industries like automobiles, targeting corporate enterprises for its virtualization GRID -- a technology that provides interactive graphics. But this is not yet a huge segment for the company. Nvidia is several more quarters away before making a lucrative enterprise. And following the company's mixed first-quarter earnings and downbeat outlook Thursday, it doesn't appear Nvidia stock -- despite its relatively cheap price -- has much upside. For now, investors would be better served moving on to stocks with better near-term prospect. For the quarter that ended April , Nvidia posted net income of $134 million, or 24 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when excluding one-time gains and costs, earnings came to 33 cents per share, topping analyst estimates of 26 cents. The company benefited from solid gross margins, topping its midpoint range of 56.2%, 56.9% of revenue, advancing some 70 basis points year over year. But that was the extent of the good news. Sure, revenue climbed 4.4% year over year, reaching $1.15 billion. But it also missed Wall Street estimates by about $10 million. And even if we grant that the strong U.S. dollar impacted revenue, this still doesn't address the struggles Nvidia has had to overcome in the past twelve months. What's more important to focus on is the extent to which Nvidia can lessen its dependency on personal computer sales, which declined 6.7% globally in the first quarter to 68.5 million units. And things aren't going to improve anytime soon, according to research firm IDC, which predicts another 5% decline for all of 2015. In that vein, Nvidia is not taking any chances, lowering its business outlook for the second quarter , ending in June. Why? When PC sales on the decline, it means weak demand for its graphic processors. Unlike rivals Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Nvidia doesn't haven a strong offsetting segment like smartphones, which Qualcomm is the leader of or the Internet-of-Things -- an area Intel is looking to dominate. To that end, it doesn't make sense to place a bet on Nvidia at this level, not when its second quarter might be under pressure. Again, these share look cheap at just 20 times earnings. But they're cheap for a reason. Not to mention, investors can own both Qualcomm and Intel -- two market leaders at a cheaper multiple than Nvidia. Qualcomm and Intel trade at P/Es of 16 and 13, respectively. On top of that, they both pay annual dividends that yield a full point higher than Nvidia.
