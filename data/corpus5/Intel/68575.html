Intel-Powered Dual-OS Windows/Android Smartphones Are Coming - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Like Microsoft, Samsung is now open to the idea of dual-OS mobile devices. Samsung is working on a dual-OS smartphone/laptop product. Samsung will need an x86 processor for its upcoming dual-OS smartphones/tablets. Aside from testing an Android 5.1 tablet with an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom x5 Cherry Trail processor, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is also apparently working on a dual-OS smartphone design. Patently Mobile said Samsung recently filed a patent application for a dual-operating system smartphone. Samsung's dual-OS smartphone will dock and become the computer processing unit (CPU) of a laptop. The image below illustrates the unique approach of Samsung when it comes to making smartphones function as mini computers . Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Continuum for Windows 10 Phones concept requires a cable connection to HDMI monitors. Samsung's idea is to dock a smartphone in to a slot on top of the QWERTY keyboard of a laptop. Microsoft's Continuum for Windows 10 Phones concept requires a cable connection to HDMI monitors. Once docked, the Samsung smartphone can switch from Android OS to Windows operating system. A dual-OS smartphone that can run x86 architecture-exclusive Windows software like Photoshop and AutoCAD is a brilliant idea which could help Samsung attract more corporate clients. Unlike last year, Microsoft is now supporting the dual-OS Windows/Android concept. Digitimes' supply chain sources said Microsoft is subsidizing Chinese white-box manufacturers including those who create dual-OS tablets ( $3-$4 per device ). The dual-OS tablet/2-in-1 notebook concept is also backed by Intel, which first broached the idea during the CES January 2014 event. Chinese firms Teclast and Cube are among the new 20 OEM partners of Microsoft that will pre-install Office 365 and Skype on Android devices. Teclast and Cube already sells excellent Intel-powered dual-OS tablets .. Chuwi is another major Chinese vendor that sells a dual-OS Windows/Android tablet hybrid tablet/notebook. However, Samsung's unique dual-OS smartphone-docked-to-a-laptop design could be better than the current detachable-tablet form factor used by dual-OS device manufacturers. Instead of attaching a detachable 9-inch or 10-inch tablet to a keyboard/touchpad dock, Samsung wants the smaller-size smartphone to get attached to a brainless laptop with a bigger display. Enterprise users may find editing Excel spreadsheets a little uncomfortable on the 10.6-inch display of the Chuwi Vi10. Samsung will need to use x86 processors to implement its dual-OS smartphone concept. All existing dual-OS tablets/notebooks available right now use Intel processors. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) have yet to release an ARM-based processor that could run the full Windows 8.1 OS. Even Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) used an Intel Core i5 and an Intel Atom SoC for its $1,200 dual-OS Transformer Book Trio TX201 notebook. The cheap dual-OS phablets from Chuwi and Teclast use the $20/tray Intel Atom Z3736F SoC. The Cube i6 Air 3G uses the Atom Z3735F . The subsidies from Intel and Microsoft for dual-OS tablets may extend to smartphones in the future. The new Atom x3 is Windows 10 ready. I expect majority of Chinese white-box OEMs to also create dual-OS phones in the near future. Elephone's upcoming dual-OS phone is a flagship product that has 4GB of RAM and a quad-core Intel processor. It should meet the hardware requirements of Continuum for Windows 10 phones. Samsung's backing of the dual-OS concept is another reason to stay (or go) long on INTC . Samsung's patented dual-OS smartphone/laptop design will not compete directly with existing $200 dual-OS products from Chinese OEMs. Samsung will likely release a premium, enterprise-centric dual-OS smartphone with a price tag above $500. Intel stands to gain a lot if Samsung makes bulk purchases of the higher-margin Atom X5 or X7 processors. Samsung needs powerful x86 processors to create enterprise-worthy smartphones/mini-computers. The mighty purchasing power of Chinese OEMs is another tailwind for Intel. White-box manufacturers are also buyers of higher-margin x86 processors. Aside from Apple and Microsoft, Cube is also one of the first firms to use the Core M processors. The $670 Cube i7 Windows 8.1 tablet and the $500 Onda V11w 2-in-1 notebooks are equipped with the $281/tray Intel Core M-5Y10C SoC. The copycat nature among hardware vendors is beneficial to Intel. With the help of Microsoft and Intel, Chinese companies were able to create cheaper clones of the Asus Transformer Book Trio. I expect Chinese OEMs to create clones of Samsung's new dual-OS smartphone/laptop concept product. Elephone's dual-OS Windows 10/Android 5.0 smartphone will inspire dozens of copycat products too. The more factories that create dual-OS mobile devices, the better it is for Intel. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
