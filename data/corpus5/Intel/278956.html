AMD: Evaluating The Problems And Risks - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Despite increasing over 70%, nothing has materially changed in AMD's business. 2016 promises many obstacles, including an aggressive Intel. Over the last few months, I've written many articles on AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), and why it was a good investment. It has risen over 70% since that time, despite no concrete news that would seem consistent with such an increase. Although I still think AMD has the potential to do well, I write this article with an eye on some of the challenges and risks the company faces. I do this because most of the pro-AMD articles do not address these issues, and the anti-AMD articles generally do not address the real issues well. An issue AMD has, that is visible to all, and is not showing signs of going away, is the cash burn. It's difficult to see this changing any time soon, and it may even get worse. If we look at AMD's product mix for most of 2016, it will be largely the same as it is now, particularly with CPUs. We will also see the cost per APU sold for the game machine go down, as is this is part of the contract. Although AMD has made several cuts, it is still not able to break even, or even approach it. Considering that third quarter is seasonally the strongest for semi-custom, and Q1 is seasonally weak in almost all segments, it would be unsurprising if AMD continued to accept massive losses in early 2016, lessening towards the back half of the year. Moderating this is that console sales should be up slightly from 2015, going by AMD's predictions and past console behavior. AMD also gained market share in the GPU market last quarter, and should continue to make small strides there with the new Fury line, and as DX12 (which favors AMD's GPU architecture more than DX11) gains more traction. This is not certain though, based on recent pricing activity . AMD has also made small strides in gaining market share in the commercial CPU market, and continues to lead the thin client market. There should also be some revenue from the new semi-custom win in 2016. So, although these could mitigate losses, it is improbable they will be enough to address to prevent a heavy cash burn in 2016. In the CPU market, it is unlikely Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will relax its aggressive low-end pricing, since the company is continuing moving to 14nm, and have a lot of fabs to keep busy. The rapid decline of tablet market has only made it more likely Intel will continue to try to push its low-end architecture aggressively in the PC market. Couple this with AMD's canceling plans to move the Jaguar/Puma architecture to a more refined lithography, and it becomes clear the low-end market is no longer nearly as attractive for AMD. Another challenge will come from the move to FinFETs, both from AMD, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ). It's difficult to know which will have a better product right now, but one issue all technology companies face is competing with older products as well. While everyone is excited by the move to FinFETs, there are a few things that need to be considered. The most important is, that previously lithography improvements brought with it a very significant reduction in cost per transistor. This is very important for GPUs, because throwing more transistors at them does improve performance considerably. Although the "shrink" will improve power use, the cost per transistor will not be significantly less any time soon, if ever. So, it will give both companies the ability to pack a more powerful GPU into the same power envelope, but it will also have to sell for a significant price premium. This could have a significant impact on sales of the newer products. Naturally, this is based on current estimates of cost. In the past, similar predictions have been made about what was possible and what was not, and I believe there will be a cost reduction at some point. But, it will be significantly less than previous generations, even if this is so. In 2016, it could easily be much higher, when factoring in yields and such. AMD will also be releasing Zen, as many know, and there is a lot of hope and expectation regarding this processor. But, if one looks at the history of the company, the higher-end processors have been highly unsuccessful for the past decade, particularly the first release. While AMD does like to say the IPC per core is improved by 40% over Excavator, it's not clear what this means. For example, a core in Excavator shares parts with another, to make a module, and in any case only runs one thread per core. Zen will be similar to Intel's and IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) current processors, where a single core can run more than one thread to better feed it's many pipelines. If Zen is 40% faster while running two threads, it's very different from comparing it to both processors running one thread. There's also every indication 2016 will not be a significant year for Zen in terms of revenue, which means AMD will have to rely on the Bulldozer line for most of the CPU revenue during the year. Even so, there's no doubt Zen will be superior to Excavator; even if all the company did was to move the design to 14nm, it would have far superior power characteristics. It's also clear AMD has done a good job in managing power in Excavator, and have managed to make a very power hungry initial design work acceptably well in low power scenarios. A good part of this technology will be carried over, and likely improved, with Zen. It's also clear Zen will be wider, and even worse case should have significantly better single-threaded performance. So, Zen will be a significantly improved product, but whether it approaches Intel's Core line is far from certain. If it closes the gap significantly, which is a reasonable expectation, it can have success in the consumer and commercial PC market, as both are at least somewhat price sensitive. The server market generally is much less so, and if Zen can not show superiority in a significant amount of workloads, it will not materially improve AMD's server market share, regardless of price. The other issue is, assuming Zen is moderately competitive, how much market share will Intel be willing to give away to maintain margins? With expensive fabs to feed, Intel will be loathe to give up market share too easily, and might release Pentium branded processors that perform nearly as well as the low-end Core line, but at a price most people will pay with little hesitation. This article is not to say AMD is doomed, or you should sell. The stock was a steal a $1.77 when I first recommended it be bought, as the reward justified the risk. It probably still is, but it's also important to understand that there are significant issues the company is facing, and none have been materially resolved during this run-up. You can read my previous articles to see why I considered it a strong buy, but that was at a much lower prices. Is it still worth buying? I think so, but not nearly as enthusiastically as I did when it was much cheaper. It going up 70% without really significant news can do that. In any case, it is always worthwhile to consider both sides when making a decision, and hopefully this helps. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
