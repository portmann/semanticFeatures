Carrier Support Surfaces For Intel Windows HDMI PC Sticks - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has other alternative markets to help sell its mobile application processors. The Windows PC Stick chip business is still the sole domain of Intel. Tier-1 telecom operators like PLDT could purchase bulk orders of PC Stick computers and help Intel sell more of its Atom chips. Investors should not worry about the big -39% drop in tablet application processor sales from Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q3 report. There are other mobile products aside from tablets and mobile phones where Intel can try and sell its Bay Trail, Cherry Trail or the sixth generation Skylake mobile processors. The Windows PC Stick is an ultra-small computer that is just slightly larger than a USB thumb drive. It can be attached via the HDMI port of a TV or a monitor. As of October, PLDT (NYSE: PHI ), the Philippines' biggest telecom operator, started bundling a free Intel-powered Windows 10 TVOlution PC Stick to attract new customers for its postpaid DSL internet plans. Even existing long-term DSL subscribers like me can get a free TVolution Stick if I sign up for another three-year lock-in period. Intel previously had an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Starhub for its Compute Stick product in Singapore. The cancellation of the generous subsidy on x86 Atom Bay Trail tablet processors means Intel will find it even more difficult to compete with entry-level ARM-based tablet chips from MediaTek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The -39% drop in tablet processor sales last quarter is a strong hint that Intel could still have some unsold inventory of Atom Bay Trail processors. Aside from Asustek and Microsoft, Intel is not really getting any design wins from other major tablet/phone manufacturers. I therefore opine that a carrier-backed PC stick product could become an alternative, volume-based sales avenue for low-power Atom processors. Carrier backing is always great for any new PC product that is just beginning to be introduced in the market. The PC Stick concept first unveiled by Intel last year now enjoys the support of Acer, Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). It's a mobile product that could help Intel get rid of unsold mobile Atom processors that are no longer being bought by subsidy-loving Chinese white-box tablet manufacturers. It was indeed a great victory for Intel to get the backing of major OEMs like Lenovo and Asus for the PC Stick. However, I still feel that the all-out support of a telco/carrier is the more important win. A tier-1 telco like PLDT could purchase bulk orders of Bay Trail-powered HDMI PC Stick computers for immediate distribution to its current customers. Free bundling of a new product with DSL subscription is a great way to instantly win a customer. The $100-plus retail price tag of the PC Stick like the TVolution (which uses an older-generation Bay Trail Atom 3735F) tells me that Intel did not have to subsidize it like it did last year for sub-$100 Shenzhen-made white-box tablets. Investors also should appreciate that, unlike Android TV HDMI dongles, a Windows PC Stick like the Lenovo 300 Stick transforms ordinary HDMI-equipped television sets into full-pledged Windows computers. The total addressable market therefore for Intel's trendsetting Compute Stick PC product is not just limited to home users or DSL subscribers. The PC Stick could be used as a cheap, portable, energy-efficient replacement for outdated Windows 7 or Windows XP computers still being used by corporations, governments and schools. To illustrate, a smart IT manager could sign up for a top-end 1 Gbps business DSL plan from PLDT and get a bunch of free Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Office-capable TVolution PC Stick computers. Intel already announced that it will release a more powerful, Core M-powered version of its Compute Stick. A more powerful sixth generation Skylake processor could transform a HDMI PC Stick into an enterprise-centric computer, which could run more CPU-demanding workplace-standard software like Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop. There is already a Cherry Trail-equipped business version of the Compute Stick called the MagicStick , which touts 8GB of RAM and games-friendly Gen 8 Intel GPU technology. The MagicStick is an example of how the tiny PC Stick is turning out to be a real desktop PC-level productivity tool. Intel was able to sell 40 million subsidized tablet processors last year. I guesstimate that Intel also has the potential to sell 5-10 million/year of PC Stick application processors. The future of Intel's mobile chip business is a little brighter when it creates mobile computer designs that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is unlikely to get involved with. Intel's superior miniaturization and low-power chip design expertise has helped it create a brand new computer product category in the Compute Stick. Intel remains the sole chip supplier of Windows PC Stick products so it has the monopoly advantage. The PLDT TVolution deal is a smart template that Intel could again use in other countries with telecom operators who like giving freebies. Dumping free PC Sticks on postpaid customers of telecom operators is a painless method of disseminating these Intel-designed portable computers. Intel or its OEM partners like Lenovo won't have to shoulder the marketing/advertising budget toward popularizing the PC Stick. Carriers desperate to retain or gain new customers will shoulder the advertising/shipping costs of free bundled PC Stick computers. To conclude, I again reiterate my call that Intel is better off focusing on products that do not require excessive contra revenue.
