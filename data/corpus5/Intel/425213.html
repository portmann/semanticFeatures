AMD Finds Its Zen - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha After sticking to its narrative for a second half release, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is not disappointing its fans. At Computex on June 1st, the company revealed the Summit Ridge CPU. This chip is based on the Zen architecture and promises to advance the struggling company's technology. Confidence is high that AMD will finally have a CPU solution that competes with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) but at a lower price. For years, Intel led in CPU performance, low heat output, and low energy consumption. AMD believes Zen is a real alternative to Intel's offering. On its Twitter page , AMD said "With 8 cores & 16 threads, Zen "chips will go toe to toe" with the competition." Scheduled for market availability by the end of this year, the chip has no pins on the bottom. This implies AMD will introduce a new socket as it retires the AM3+ platform. AMD fans may groan over the change because the upgrade will need replacing the motherboard. Fortunately, AMD is already shipping the AM4 socket to OEMs. This socket is available in time for the 7th generation APU release. Budget enthusiasts will find the upgrade worthwhile. AMD says Summit Ridge has a 40 percent instructions per clock ("IPC") performance enhancement over the current offering. The new CPU will also have 8 cores and 16 threads. Buying Intel 's Haswell-E 8-core desktop chip will cost consumers over $1,000. Intel will stay ahead of AMD by offering a $1,723 10-core desktop CPU for hardcore users. The desktop PC market is shrinking , down 11.5 percent in the first quarter. It still makes sense that investors grow bullish on AMD, if AMD really did achieve a similar performance to Intel's current generation chip with Zen. Competition will only get worse in this market, but AMD must continue operating here. It may ride the virtual reality gaming and benefit from the seasonal back-to-school demand. In the graphics chip space, AMD's Radeon card refresh based on Polaris should help the company gain market share. Its RX 480 will debut at $199. Shares sold off after investors concluded AMD will suffer from a profit margin decline from this release. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GTX 970 retails for $369.99. Already, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) offers a $50 discount and $20 rebate, which cuts the card's price to $299.49. AMD's product refresh in the CPU and GPU markets should improve EBITDA and cash flow by the end of this year. Monetizing its patent portfolio last quarter will also help: AMD's Zen release in the CPU market will reinvigorate the company's competitiveness. Together with the GPU refresh, the stock is becoming less risky.
