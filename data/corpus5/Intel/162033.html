Why Intel's Server Segment Will Accelerate In 2016 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The server segment is well positioned, but various growth catalyst will drive earnings and revenue growth in FY 2016. Some of this growth comes from unanticipated product categories paired with the opportunity to scale server-CPUs into applications that run better on standardized CPUs. I anticipate that net income from the segment will nearly double by 2018 as the growth projection seems well supported. I anticipate that the addition of new products, continued ASP improvements and on-going unit growth for Xeon-branded CPUs will sustain the 15% revenue CAGR with some bias to the upside. While, I acknowledge all of these growth catalysts, I don't anticipate the stock to move considerably higher until FY 2016. Therefore I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Data Center Group is the lone bright spot of the organization as the company is heavily dependent on both the profitability and growth potential of the segment. For the most part, Intel continued to emphasize the long-term growth rate of 15% for the data center group throughout last week's Data Center Day, but also mentioned that there could be upside to those estimates assuming cell network transformation is inclusive of more adoption of server-class CPUs and the attach rate for 3D XPoint drives/memory is better than expected. Of course, 3D XPoint adoption will come from HPC (high performance compute) clusters first, as advanced scientific institutions are starting to reach the glass ceiling of performance for more advanced computer models. There was a lot of information presented at Intel's Data Center Day Conference at its Santa Clara headquarters. It was the first time Intel ever hosted an Data Center Day and was primarily attended by industry- and sell-side analysts. It's not clear if Intel will host this event annually, but given the rapid developments in the server space, it wouldn't be surprising to see another one next year. The company mentioned that the memory and storage business is going to be priced for profitability, and while the company did acknowledge competitive threats to the higher-value memory product that they had recently developed, the priority will be to recoup investment rather than broadening adoption through aggressive pricing. In other words, Intel will go back to its advanced calculus models to determine the best way to optimize profitability and volumes. The company also has a lot of spare capacity in its fabs to handle unanticipated demand, so investors won't have to encounter supply-related difficulties when factoring in revenue ramp from storage and assuming Intel does have the best-performing storage solution in the 2016 timeframe, revenue from this segment will grow at a relatively explosive rate when compared to Intel CPUs and FPGAs. Demand is starting to shift to high-end Intel Xeon E5 SKUs. There isn't a lot of demand for the Intel Xeon E7 SKU, but there is some upside to ASPs. Cloud providers have consistently transitioned their data centers to higher-tier SKUs over the past five years. Needless to say, the performance per watt improves further up the product stack, but the adoption rate has been slow due to the broadness of price tiers. Intel mentioned that various large-scale cloud service providers have been slowly moving up the SKUs, which add some additional upside to long-term growth models. Growth in new product categories like Xeon branded co-processor units (graphic accelerators), storage (3D NAND and 3D XPoint), FPGAs and network connectivity solutions (Silicon Photonics, Ethernet and Infiniband Switch) also supports long-term growth assumptions. Furthermore, ARM-based CPUs were mentioned at Data Center Day, but for the most part, large-scale deployment of ARM-based components seem highly unlikely based on the comments that were mentioned. Furthermore, Intel mentioned that it had higher performing SKUs at the mobile component level, so even if ARM-based vendors compete in Data Centers, it's likely that Intel will generate the vast majority of the volume. Today, Atom CPU-units represent a small rounding error when it pertains to server revenues. So, competing platforms using mobile components or different instruction sets don't seem very competitive. With Intel at 90%-plus market share, growth assumptions are primarily tied to the growth of the entire market and new product offerings. The growth mix is less than 10% from IT, cloud is greater than 20%, comms service providers greater than 20%, and HPC greater than 20%. These growth rates are annualized and are expected to sustain over the foreseeable five years. Assuming Intel is able to sustain a 15% CAGR in DCG revenue, I anticipate that the DCG will generate $24.66 billion in revenue in FY 2018, which will contribute $9 billion in net income to Intel's bottom line assuming a 27% tax rate and 50% operating margins. In 2014, Intel's data center group generated $5.11 billion in profits, so the incremental net income from the segment will almost double. To compare those figures to FY 2015, I project the DCG group to generate $16.2 billion in revenue on similar profit rate assumptions. The profit from the segment will grow to $5.91 billion assuming stabilization in enterprise demand in Q3 and Q4. Of course, there are some factors that can negatively impact the long-term growth assumption of DCG, such as foreign exchange and anemic demand from enterprise IT providers. The growth from traditional IT is projected to be much less than that of other categories and is 40% of the current revenue mix for DCG. But barring those uncertainties the upside to DCG will be pretty substantial. When looking historically, Intel's revenue hasn't grown by much between 2011 and 2014. Much of this was driven by stagnating demand for Intel CPUs in client-side computing and the rapid adoption of mobile devices, which Intel didn't really participate in. The product mix was heavily concentrated in CPUs, which was a cyclical business. Going forward, I anticipate that with the exception of 2015, which will be a flat year for consolidated revenue, revenue will begin to accelerate on the back of PC refresh and rapid cloud deployment. When looking at Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) conference calls there's a lot of optimism about the cloud. Furthermore, capex spend is expected to tick higher. Of course, investors are a little antsy about the scale of investment from various cloud providers. The demand consistently outstrips projections, which forces cloud providers to invest even more aggressively into their data center build-out to accommodate for future demand. The compression on FCF shouldn't be too surprising. The market has reasonable expectations for the variability of spending, so as long as growth from these investments can be sustained. In other words, Intel is well positioned in the data center space. And while I'm continuing to reiterate my $31 price target and hold recommendation. I do anticipate that the stock will begin to recover and momentum will be particularly strong in 2016, so as long as broader market sentiment continues to improve.
