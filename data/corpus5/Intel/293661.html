Intel And The Pain Ahead - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Intel reported an FQ4 revenue beat last week, yet the stock sold off 9%. Intel was punished by slowing growth in its Data Center Group. Week guidance of mid-to-high single digit revenue growth did not help matters. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported FQ4 earnings on Thursday. The company delivered revenue of $14.9 billion and eps of $0.74. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and 1% Y/Y. The company delivered a revenue beat and met expectations on earnings, yet the stock plummeted over 9%. Here's why: Intel's exposure to the declining PC segment has been well documented. The company garnered 60% of its revenue from its PC Client Group in the quarter ended December 27, 2014. That exposure was 59% this quarter. Longs have been energized about the double-digit growth in revenue from the Data Center Group ("DCG") and IoT Group. They expected its emergence to lower the company's reliance on PCs. The expectations may have been too frothy as evidenced by a commenter from my previous article : Shock I agree that Intel profits per unit sold are less for mobile PCs compared to desk top PCs (even with the same margin). That is where my agreement with the article ends ... DCG in Q1 had revenues up 18% YOY with profits up 31% YOY. DCG profits now make up 65% of Intel profits. YOY revenues are expected to increase at least 15% for the next three plus years. Profit increases for DCG will be even higher YOY. Revenue from DCG was only up 4% sequentially and 5% Y/Y, and INTC was punished for it. Macroeconomic weakness hurt enterprise demand and caused DCG revenue to come in less than what management had expected. FQ4 2014 was one of the company's strongest quarters as DCG grew revenue 20%, making Y/Y comparison tough. The flip side is that maybe FQ4 2014 growth was a high water mark for DCG, and double-digit growth could be a thing of the past. The company believes DCG will continue its double-digit clip in 2016 on the strength of the cloud and by taking more share in the telco and networking space. Investors appear to be taking a wait and see attitude, as they should. In my opinion, with the slowdown in China and emerging markets, macro weakness could continue to be a headwind for DCG. Management guided that revenue growth would be in the mid-to-high single digits. This follows a 1% fall off in FY15 and a 6% increase in FY14. The growth estimate also includes the acquisition of Altera. Altera's Field Programmable Gate Array Technology ("FPGA") allows functions to be updated after being installed inside devices. Strategically, their programmable logic semiconductors are expected to help Intel expand its DCG and IoT segments. By my estimation, Altera will add about 3% to Intel's revenue immediately. If the company expects mid-to-high single digit revenue growth with Altera, that implies flat organic growth from the other business segments. Secondly, I believe there is a risk that double-digit growth in DCG may not materialize. I expect macro headwinds to persist, which could cause giants in cloud services - Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or IBM (NYSE: IBM ) - to squeeze suppliers in order to maintain their bottom line. While Intel has attacked Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) share of chips for mobile devices, it would be silly to think Qualcomm will not hit back. A natural response would be to expand its presence in data centers, which could take share or cause a hit to Intel's profit margins in the space. Lastly, there is the issue of Intel's sliding margins. Margins were 64% during the quarter, but management expects them to fall to 63% for FY16. Given the company's mobile losses, decline pricing power in the PC sector and the potential squeeze from cloud providers, declining gross margins could be the next shoe to drop. With top line growth from DCG slowing and overall margins declining, I see pain ahead for Intel. When Qualcomm hits back in the data center space it could get worse. Sell INTC.
