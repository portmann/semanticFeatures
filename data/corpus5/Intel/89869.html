Micron's 'Qualcomm Problem' - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm is caught between Apple, Samsung and a hard place. Apple's dominance is causing its ASP to decline, while Samsung's mobile phone growth hurts Qualcomm's chipset shipments. The more mobile phone share Apple and Samsung control, the less DRAM demand there is for Micron. DRAM contract prices - down 14% in Q4 - are expected to decline further. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has a problem with its top-line growth. For fiscal Q2 revenue from its licensing division (QTL) was up 32% sequentially. Its chipset division (QCT), which generates the lion's share of sales, experienced a revenue decline of 16%. QCT's problems are two-fold: average sales price ("ASP") and unit sales are declining. ASP fell to $18.90 while chipset shipments fell about 14% to 233 million in FQ2 vis-a-vis FQ1. During its Q2 earnings call management crystallized the problem: While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, we are guiding the second half lower due to a number of factors in QCT. First, the extent of the impact of OEM concentration at the premium tier and the impact of share loss in the Galaxy S6 and Note. Second, the altered launch plans of the OEMs in the premium tier with some OEMs delaying launches and then OEM rationalizing their portfolio by deemphasizing designs using our legacy parts. By "premium tier," management was referring to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) - the two leading mobile phone manufacturers. Prior to replacing Qualcomm's snapdragon 810 processor for its in-house Exynos processor, Samsung represented over 10% of Qualcomm's revenue. Apple is now Qualcomm's largest customer. However, Apple only buys modems and does not utilize the company's higher margin snapdragon processors. Qualcomm is in effect caught between Apple, Samsung and a hard place. The more Samsung increases its smartphone market share, the more Qualcomm's unit sales decline. As Apple's smartphone share increases, it hurts Qualcomm's ASP. DRAM represents about 65% of Micron's (NASDAQ: MU ) $4.2 billion in quarterly revenue. In an attempt to expand its semiconductor operations, Samsung has expanded its share in DRAM from 36% in Q1 2014 to 41% in Q4 2014. Micron's share declined from 28% to 24% over that period. And it could get worse, particularly in mobile DRAM. Samsung is rumored to supply the lion's share of DRAM for Apple's iPhone 6S due out Q3 2015. According to Trendforce , Apple and Samsung controlled about 48% of all smartphone shipments in Q1 2015. By rekindling its relationship with Apple, Samsung has practically ring fenced manufacturers representing nearly half the mobile phone market. Micron's "Qualcomm problem" is that the more market share Apple and Samsung take from competitors, the less DRAM demand there is for Micron. And investors have punished the stock. Over the past 12 months MU is down nearly 25% versus an 9% gain for the S&P 500 (SPX). Yet all is not lost. Micron bulls like Seeking Alpha's William Tidwell point to the vaunted second half rebound : So here's my bull case for a $40 stock in 2016 ... Micron will report ok numbers in Q3, decently good numbers in Q4, and blow the roof off in Q1 of 2016 as the PC market recovers after the W10 release. However, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) recently threw the kibosh on the Windows 10 pent up demand thesis. And with a reported 20 million pre-orders for Samsung's blockbuster Galaxy S6, there could be less mobile DRAM to sell to manufacturers not named "Apple" or "Samsung." In addition to an expected decline in Micron DRAM demand in the second half of 2015, prices are declining. According to Kevin Rottinghaus of Cleveland Research, DRAM contract prices declined by as much as 13% to around $27 in Q4. Competitor SK Hynix (OTC: HXSCF ) experienced a 4% sequential decline in its DRAM ASP in Q1. Meanwhile, Drexel Hamilton expects DRAM price cuts to deepen due to Samsung's willingness to accept lower margins while it hikes output. Qualcomm is caught between Apple, Samsung and a hard place . Whether Micron's management admits to a similar dilemma remains to be seen. I continue to rate MU a hold.
