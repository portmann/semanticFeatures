3.3% To 5% Yields For Top 10 Dow Dividend Dogs As Of August 5 | Seeking Alpha Aug.  9, 2015  6:08 AM ET  |  Includes: CAT , CVX , DD , GE , IBM , INTC , MCD , PFE , PG , VZ , XOM by: Fredrik Arnold Ten top Dow dividend dogs disclosed yields averaging 3.88% per IndexArb.com or 3.79% per Yahoo as of market close August 6. The IndexArb projection showed dividend rose as price also rose to send a mixed up signal for top ten Dow July/August selections by yield. Yahoo Finance saw dividend rise as price plummeted to send a retreating bear signal for their top ten Dow August selections by yield. IndexArb selected CVX, VZ, CAT, XOM, GE, MCD, INTC, IBM, PFE, and KO by yield. Yahoo saw CVX, VZ, CAT, XOM, GE, PG, MCD, IBM, and INTC as top dogs. Yield (dividend/price) results from IndexArb.com for 30 Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices August 6 led to four actionable conclusions summarized above and detailed below. Investors have utilized Michael B. O'Higgins ' dividend dog ranking system to select portfolios of five or ten stocks in the Dow Index to trade as of the last day in December since 1991, when he wrote the book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins). Thereafter, dog investors awaited annual results from their investments in the lowest priced, highest yielding stocks and trusted that the price of every stock they now owned would climb higher (having locked in a high yield percentage at purchase). Now named Dogs of the Dow , O'Higgins' system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks. Utilizing analyst price upside estimates has expanded the stock universe to include popular growth equities, if desired. McGraw Hill Financial, publisher of this index, states: "The Dow, is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies. The Dow covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities, which are covered by the Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average. While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added to The Dow only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process." Top ten Dow dogs by yield from IndexArb.com after July included seven of nine business sectors: basic materials; technology; conglomerates; industrial goods; services; healthcare; and consumer goods. (Financials were excluded and Dow rated Utilities in a separate index.) The IndexArb chart included Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) in the top ten. Top ten Dow dogs by yield from Yahoo Finance after July included six of nine business sectors by dropping the healthcare firm, Pfizer, from the top ten in favor of a basic materials firm, Du Pont (E.I.) (NYSE: DD ). According to both IndexArb and Yahoo, one of two or three dogs in basic materials led their dog sled: Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX ) [1]. Technology firm Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) [2] showed the second best dividend yield as of market close August 6. A single conglomerate placed third, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ) [3], per both ranking systems. Slots four to six showed different firms in each ranking system. Another basic materials outfit was fourth per both IndexArb and Yahoo, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ) [4]. The lone industrial goods firm took fifth per IndexArb and sixth per Yahoo, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) [5][6]. Fifth place for Yahoo was occupied by a third basic materials concern, Du Pont (E.I.) [5] which did not make the top ten per IndexArb. Sixth place for IndexArb went to the consumer goods sector representative, which placed seventh in the Yahoo scheme, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) [6] [7]. The lone service dog placed seventh per IndexArb, while Yahoo had it eighth: McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ) [7][8]. A second technology firm placed eighth per IndexArb and tenth per Yahoo, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC ) [8][10]. Slot nine spelled relief from the chaos in the form of International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM )[9] being there on both IndexArb and Yahoo. A single healthcare firm ranked tenth per IndexArb but was not listed in the top ten per Yahoo. Pfizer [10] then completed the dual, July/August IndexArb/Yahoo, top ten Dow dividend dog lists. Relative strength by yield for the top ten Dow Industrial index stocks was graphed below. Eleven periods of historic projected annual dividend history from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and the total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points for each period shown in blue for dividend and green for price. Actionable Conclusions: (1) Dow Top Dogs Mixed Up into August per IndexArb But (2) Retreated Bearishly per Yahoo Finance Reports Dow dogs dithered up showing 6% more annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k in each of the top ten, while the aggregate single share price of the ten increased 8% between June 11 and August 6 by way of IndexArb's including Pfizer in slot ten. Yahoo, however, projected a retreating scenario for the Dow dogs, showing 2.4% higher annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k in each of the top ten, while the aggregate single share price for the ten tumbled 2.5% between June 11 and August 6 with DD in slot 5. The difference between the IndexArb mixed up Dow and the Yahoo retreating Dow was caused by the share price and annual dividends for Du Pont (E.I.) at $54.47/$1.96 in slot 5, leaving IndexArb with Pfizer Inc. at $35.17 /$1.18 in slot 10 pushing price and dividend higher on Yahoo. Thus, IndexArb results were driven into retreat by Pfizer's lower price and dividend. Actionable Conclusion (3): Dow Dogs Are Overbought The Dow dogs' overbought condition (in which aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $1k invested in each of the ten) advanced on the IndexArb chart but retreated on the Yahoo Finance graph from a record gap set in June. The June gap was $367% or 79% on IndexArb but $415 or 118% per Yahoo. July/August put the gap at $318 or 81.5% on IndexArb, and $347 or 91% per Yahoo. This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested shows an overbought condition. Meaning, no matter which chart you read, these are low risk and low opportunity Dow dogs.
