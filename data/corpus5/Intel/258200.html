Intel: Guidance Revision Prior To Dec. 12 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Earlier this year Intel was forced to revise guidance downward due to slower than anticipated desktop sales. If Intel guidance requires revision, it must be done by December 12 which is the beginning of their quiet period. With Windows 10 and Skylake in the market Intel could be seeing higher than anticipated revenues and be compelled to announce revisions upward to its Q4 and 2015 guidance. Expected Data Center Group performance would likely propel revised guidance upward for a significant breakout of the stock above $35 possibly above $40. 2015 has been a slow year for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock. In the first week of January 2015 Intel stock was hovering around $35, right where it's hovering this week. The major dips in January, March and June were due to negative announcements related to desktop sales. These negative announcements from Intel were all colored with the idea that Windows 10 and Skylake in the fall would increase PC sales. Maybe PC sales are rebounding and maybe Intel revenues are rising. The evidence is starting to lean this direction and it's likely that the first substantial news of such a rebound will send Intel stock much higher given the much anticipated growth in DCG sales . We will not know if recent sales increases are enough to drive guidance higher until December 12, the beginning of Intel's quiet period. If prior to December 12 Intel has information indicating that revenues or earnings will be substantially different than they guided in October, then Intel will be compelled to announce such a revision publicly as they did in June 2014 (upward) and March 2015 (downward). These two examples show the impact such an announcement can have on stock price. Following the March 2014 revised guidance (positive) Intel stock rose ~20% (from below $30 to above $36). Following the negative guidance revision in March 2015 the stock plummeted ~14% ($33.50 to $29) after already dropping from $36 due to indications of PC sales declines. Note that at the investor meeting in November, Intel was careful to point out that the guidance provided was based on the October guidance... the November restatement of guidance was NOT an update based on sales in October and November. Anecdotal information is all we have to go on. Here are some sound bites. Please add more in comments. Skylake is pushing gamer PCs sales due to higher performance Skylake was later to market than anticipated reducing PC sales growth potential Microsoft stores are selling Surface devices which are available with Intel Skylake processors and sales appear strong Nvidia sales of advanced graphics cards indicates very strong gaming PC sales with Intel processors Inventories are drained and empty, ready for new inventory builds Intel's early ramp of the second Skylake fab in Ireland shows strong demand for Skylake PCs in the home are still needed for productive work even though smartphones and phablets have replaced PCs that were used just for Internet access The rise in Intel stock price from $25 in August 2015 to the current $35 has been largely due to anticipation of increased PC sales and strong long-term growth in the DCG as well as non-volatile memory. Continued good news about Data Center Group growth in cloud computing, network virtualization and most recently HPC (high performance computing) has stock buyers primed for higher Intel stock prices. Lack of clear PC sales news is likely the only thing holding Intel stock price at $35. The following chart from Finviz indicates the rising support for Intel stock (PC sales increases and DCG growth) as well as the clear resistance of buyers to pay much over $35 until clear news about PC sales growth is heard. The quickly rising support line indicates that buyers' expectations are rising quickly in anticipation of DCG growth and PC sales increases. If these expectations are confirmed, the stock is likely to rise quickly above $35, possibly reaching over $40 with a price to earnings ratio still less than Intel's historic PE ratio of 20. If the expectations are not confirmed, the stock is likely to drop significantly. In addition to news from Intel or generally about PC sales, we also will hear this week (Dec. 10th) from Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) regarding their earnings. Strong Adobe earnings related to the cloud could help drive Intel higher. By the end of this week Intel stock will likely either see a steep rise in stock as investors anticipate growth in PC and DCG sales are confirmed - or a steep decline if there is no confirmation of growing PC sales.
