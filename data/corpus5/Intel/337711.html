Intel reportedly wins portion of iPhone 7 modem orders, lands Baird upgrade - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Mar  3 2016, 12:15 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor CLSA's Sriji Pajjuri reports supply chain checks indicate Intel ( INTC +0.6%) has landed a portion of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 7 baseband modem orders. He estimates the company could supply 30%-40% of the modems going into the device. Pajjuri thinks such a win would boost Intel's revenue and earnings by 1.5%-2%, and respectively hurt current iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm's ( QCOM -1.2%) revenue and earnings by 4% and 2%. VentureBeat reported back in March 2015 Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem (450Mbps peak download speeds) would go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. The site followed up in October by stating Intel "now has a thousand people or more" working to get the XMM 7360 designed into an iPhone, and that Apple is interested in eventually developing an SoC pairing a 4G modem with an A-series app processor, with Intel manufacturing the SoC and providing modem IP. Qualcomm is still viewed as having a modem performance lead on the high-end. The company recently unveiled a modem (the Snapdragon X16) supporting 1Gbps peak download speeds, while adding the chip is expected to go into commercial products in 2H16. Separately, Baird's Tristan Gerra has upgraded Intel to Outperform, and hiked his target by $5 to $38. He cites healthy DCG (server CPU division) growth and (without naming Apple) the potential for a major "tier-1 smartphone ramp" in 2H16. Gerra: "After being on the sidelines for a few years on Intel, we think data center has reached sufficient critical mass within Intel's mix to drive a resumption in EPS growth starting in 2017 ... Assuming a low single-digit decline in annual PC revenue and a high single-digit growth rate in data center (below Intel's 15% growth target), DCG mix becomes large enough to drive EPS growth starting in 2017 and in years forward ... We believe Intel's LTE technology has matured, improving Intel's positioning for a potential tier-one smartphone ramp this second half." old news and note the "aimed at emerging markets" disclaimer... Look out Lower Slabovia! INTC needs a new trick cuz this one is old. IMO Intel is paying Apple to use their modem ! contra-revenue, heard about that ?? Apple will use it in the lower cost models and keep high margins ! 22nm has matured enough, so INTC is salvaging whatever they can from it. The modem is definitely competitive to QCom offerings, but definitely not free. 1.5-2%  = ~$1B. INTC is trying to get out of the contra-revenue business if they haven't exited already.    Getting back into this business, especially with AAPL will be a losing sum game.   There are certain business dynamics that you don't want to re-create or get back into.  If they haven't learned this by now, all of management should be replaced. Intel fabbing SoC with their modem would be fantastic news. For both companies' stocks, and battery performance and battery life with iPhones. Cellular communications is the biggest battery drain of all on a smartphone. one more over exaggerated rumor! for this to happen the modem would likely have to only go to Europe, that too features a lot of variants of CDMA. At the most if this is true then the might be using it for upcoming low cost iPhone. but given the dismal specs of XMM 7480, this would be one time win if at all Apple does stick to it in face of competition from low end Android which also migrate to CAT 10 modems during the end of this year. Would be funny for iPhone which is already loosing share to offer specs same as low end Android phones when it comes to Modem!
