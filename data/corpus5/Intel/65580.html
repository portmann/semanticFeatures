Intel: Wintel Alliance Might Help The Atom X3 Gain More Industry Support - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is helping Intel sell more x86 mobile processors to device manufacturers. Intel and Rockchip are aggressively wooing Chinese OEMs to use the new quad-core Atom X3 3G-R (C3230RK) processor for Android tablets. Intelâ€™s tablet strategy is not limited to dirt-cheap tablets. Fujitsu is coming up with a $1,288 Intel Core-M powered Windows 8.1 tablet. Digitimes' supply chain sources are reporting that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Rockchip are trying to win the support of more Chinese white-box tablet manufacturers for the new quad-core Atom X3 CR3230RK processors. Intel is reportedly offering a subsidy of around $3 per device as incentive for Chinese firms to use the Rockchip-made Atom X3 product. Intel recruited Rockchip last year to help penetrate the Chinese smartphone application processor market, which is still currently dominated by ARM-based processors. Rockchip is one of the top ARM-based mobile application vendors in China/Asia and has a network of long-term clients . Intel's shrewd partnership with Rockchip is one more reason why I believe the Atom X3 SoC could threaten Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek's low-priced smartphone/tablet processors. White-box tablet manufacturers in Shenzhen also are likely responsible for the production of generic Android phones that get sold on a wholesale basis out of China. Generic tablets and smartphones from white-box producers in China are then rebranded and sold by vendors like Oppo, Ainol or Onda. Even India's biggest local smartphone vendor, Micromax, also has rebranded generic Android phones since 2011 . Intel's friendliness toward local Chinese companies has long-term benefits. Top-tier companies like Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) are still ignoring the new Atom X3 products. Chinese firms can help make up for this lack of interest from tier-1 companies. According to Gartner , Chinese white-box manufacturers will continue to ship out huge numbers of phones and tablets this year, 450 smartphones and 74 million tablets. Samsung, the world's top seller of Android tablets, might regret ignoring the Cherry Trail Atom X3 products once $70 Intel-powered phablets like the Teclast X70 start getting distributed outside of China. The Teclast X70 has the cheapest dual-core Atom X3-C3130 SoC but Rockchip and Intel are now promoting the quad-core 3G Atom X3-C3230RK version. The higher CPU frequency and better GPU of the X3-C3230RK should appeal to more white-box manufacturers accustomed to quad-core ARM processors from MediaTek or Allwinner. Digitimes also reported that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is now subsidizing dual-OS Windows 8.1/Android devices from white-box manufacturers. Microsoft is reportedly offering a $3-$4 subsidy in addition to Intel's own $3-$4 contra revenue for each tablet/2-in-1 notebook that use the older Atom Bay-Trail chips. However, I believe the Rockchip-made Cherry Trail Atom X3 processor also is ready to help Intel beat its 46 million tablet processor sales last year. Teclast has a dual-boot Windows 8.1/Android 4.4 tablet. Onda has one too. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is selling the dual-boot Chuwi tablet in the U.S., which is more proof that Microsoft now approves of these dual-OS devices. Contra revenue from Microsoft goes a lot in helping Intel gain wider support for its new Cherry Trail Atom X3 processor. The SoFiA/X3 was first revealed as Intel's first smartphone chip with an integrated modem last year. The emerging tactic now is that Krzanich is pushing it first to white-box tablet manufacturers hoping that it might lead those companies to also try the Atom X3 for their generic smartphones. The Atom X3's total addressable market is much bigger in smartphones than in tablets. Furthermore, investors also should appreciate that Intel's tablet strategy is not limited to selling dirt-cheap processors. Fujitsu will soon launch a $1,288 Windows 8.1 tablet with an Intel Core-M processor. The Fujitsu ARROWS Tab Q665/L will go on sale next month. The $699 Dell Venue Pro 11 7000 Series is another high-priced tablet with an Intel Core-M processor. Since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also used an Intel Core M for its new fanless Macbook 2015 laptop, there's a probability that the upcoming 12-inch iPad Pro might also use one. Apple needs an x86 processor for the iPad Pro if it intends to sell them to Photoshop-using creative professionals. The $499 Surface 3 has an Intel Atom X7 processor and it can run Photoshop, Pro Tools and AutoCAD. This is the unique advantage of Intel's x86 mobile application processors they can run any industry-standard programs and operating systems. INTC is a buy. Investors should not focus too much on cheap white-box tablets from China. The more important thing is that Microsoft and Intel are back to their old Wintel tag-teaming ways.
