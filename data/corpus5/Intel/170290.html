ETF Hub Sep 11 2015, 19:09 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "Taiwan notebook ODM shipments increased 16% MoM in August, above our Citi Asia Hardware Analyst William Yang’s estimate of up 10% MoM and above the three year average of up 6% MoM," writes Citi's Chris Danely, arguing PC demand is improving after a very rough Q1 and Q2. Danely adds Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has "indicated PC demand appears to have bottomed, and PC OEMs have started to replenish inventory driven by the Skylake processor ramp," and that Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) has "stated DRAM spot prices have started to stabilize, which the company believes is a sign of a bottom in the PC market." IT distributor Ingram Micro (NYSE: IM ) is also said to be seeing stabilizing demand. Wells Fargo's David Wong sings a similar tune. "There have been signs of a seasonal pickup in PC builds. Month of August sales data reported by Taiwanese notebook and motherboard/computer makers shows a clear month-over-month lift in PC builds in August, and solid growth in the first two months of the September quarter compared to the first two months of the June quarter." Likely helping: Windows 10 (free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) launched in late July to decent reviews , and Intel has since gradually rolled out its 14nm Skylake CPU line. After starting off by launching the gamer/enthusiast-focused Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K desktop CPUs, Intel has rolled out the Skylake Y-series (meant for tablets and compute sticks), U-series (ultrabooks/convertibles), H-series (notebooks), and S-series (desktops). Sizable power/efficiency and GPU performance gains are generally promised relative to comparable 14nm Broadwell CPUs.
