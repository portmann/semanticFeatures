Microsoft Is Infecting Android Phones With Windows 10 OS - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Xiaomi is enabling its customers to try installing a custom Windows 10 upgrade on their Mi 4 Android phones. Letting people install Windows 10 on their Android smartphones can increase the total addressable market of Microsoftâ€™s monetization of Skype, Bing, and Office 365. WMPower User reported two days ago that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) will release the custom Windows 10 ROM for all Xiaomi Mi 4 Android phone users today, June 1. This is almost two months before the official release of the desktop version of Windows 10 on July 29. Microsoft is massively crowd-sourcing its effort of infecting existing Android phones with its Windows 10 software. Microsoft first announced the Windows 10-on-Xiaomi Android experimental project last March . Only a select few of testers were able to experiment with the custom Windows 10 Xiaomi back then. Today anybody with a Xiaomi Mi 4 phone will be able to download the said Windows 10 ROM. Chinese owners of the Mi 4 will only need to sign up on this link to download the Windows 10 ROM. This is a very important development because it will determine if ARM-based Android phones could really jibe with the universal apps concept of Windows 10 for Phones. Like most Android phones today, the Xiaomi Mi 4 uses an ARM-based processor. A YouTube video of a Chinese-speaking guy demonstrates that Windows 10 runs decently on his Mi 4 handset. Xiaomi, one of the world's top smartphone vendors, sold 61 million smartphones last year. If we guesstimate that 10% of that figure are Mi 4 handsets, the potential number of Android-to-Windows 10 defectors among Xiaomi phone users could hit 6 million. Android is disproportionately dominant in smartphones so Xiaomi's helping hand is a welcome boost for Microsoft. Even after buying Nokia's (NYSE: NOK ) smartphone hardware business last year, Microsoft is still struggling to increase the 2.7% global share of Windows phones. The successful implementation of a Windows 10 software-based conversion method of Xiaomi's flagship Android phone could lead to more OEMs requesting Microsoft to also provide them with custom ROMs. Providing custom Windows 10 ROMs to existing flagship or mid-range Android phones from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), LG Electronics ( OTC:LGEAF ), Huawei, and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) is a shortcut toward persuading more than one billion people to try Windows 10 for Phones. Providing a software solution to make existing Android phones in to Windows 10 handsets is also a cheaper alternative to subsidizing Lumia Windows phones. Xiaomi is not one of the Android device manufacturers that signed up to pre-install Microsoft's mobile apps on Android phones/tablets. However, Xiaomi's tacit approval for its customers to try the custom Windows 10 ROM is an even better proposition. The monetization of Bing, Skype, and Office 365 is likely stronger when the host mobile device runs in Windows 10, not in Android OS. Tracking (through system background processes) the location and mobile activities of users are necessary toward delivering hyper-targeted, hyperlocal mobile ads . Microsoft still has a long way to catch up before it can match Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) pervasive presence in global mobile advertising. However, Nadella's turn as CEO has transformed Microsoft in to a freemium company that is akin to what Google is right now. The free mobile apps/operating system from Google is just a mouse trap to capture billions of eyeballs for mobile ads. The collaboration of Microsoft and Xiaomi might also be due to both of them having a close relationship with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). Qualcomm is an early investor in Xiaomi . Microsoft picked Qualcomm's ARM-based processors in 2011 for its first Windows Phone 7 handsets. All existing Windows Phone 7/8.1 smartphones available today use a Snapdragon SoC. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Microsoft are allegedly plotting to bring their successful Wintel PC alliance to the mobile sector. The cheap Cherry Trail Intel Atom X3 family of processors is Windows 10-ready. However, it doesn't really matter much for MSFT investors as to which processor Xiaomi will use on its future smartphones. The important thing is that Xiaomi is helping distribute Windows 10 to more people. Xiaomi's brand popularity might even be stronger than Microsoft's Lumia. Xiaomi was able to sell 2.11 million phones through its online store within 24 hours - a Guinness record that Microsoft is unlikely to beat.
