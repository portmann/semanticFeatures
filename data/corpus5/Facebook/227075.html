Facebook Has More Momentum By Year End - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Market risk remains an important theme for investors in high-flying tech names, however, FB's strong fundamentals outweigh these concerns. Seeking Alpha readers were optimistic on Thursday, which is indicative of 3-month price action. Analysts raised price targets and non-GAAP EPS estimates almost across the board. Facebook is planning to launch a new app (Notify), but it seems like a non-event as it's not competitive when compared to Twitter. Many in the retail community are skeptical of FB's valuation, however, this isn't well substantiated when based on comparative growth metrics and historical valuations. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) remains one of my favorite investments . While the stock wasn't able to sustain the momentum from Wednesday's after-hours trading on Thursday, I feel confident in anticipating further upside in 2015. While the broader macro can create some uncertainty and broader pricing dynamics pertaining to equities could be derailed by interest rate hikes, there's no denying that core fundamentals drive the individual performance of securities whenever market risk takes the back seat. Many readers on Seeking Alpha more or less shared the same views in my prior Facebook article , so sentiment from the buy side seems pretty strong. While, it's not an accurate poll, there are many instances where the comment stream does indicate price action for securities over the immediate 3-month timeframe. FB continues to outperform when compared to the S&P 500. And while this pattern is typically considered abnormal, I don't anticipate this to be purely a beta-driven play where the stock is priced based on expected return, but rather intrinsic and comparative value measures will remain far more indicative. While investors should feel rightfully skeptical of a stock moving considerably higher when compared to the broader market, I don't think the valuation is stretched given the numerous growth catalysts, and growth rate comparisons. Large Cap growth has remained a bright spot in 2015 just as it was in 2014. Typically, size is a constraint to earnings growth, but miraculously Facebook has maintained healthy growth rates off a sizable revenue base. The company maintained similar growth rates from last year when pertaining to both average user monetization and user engagement, which defies conventional logic. However, FB is still in the early innings of saturating the advertising space, as the company is uniquely positioned to compete for ad dollars in 2015 due to the global reach of the platform, and targeting advantages when pertaining specifically to mobile. These factors in conjunction with growth in adjacent mobile apps has created a dynamic in which Facebook can sustain revenue and earnings growth rates above the tech industry median/mean. Analysts were optimistic Thursday morning, and many raised their price targets due to changes in Q4'15 earnings assumptions. The consensus estimate for FY'15 non-GAAP diluted EPS will increase and while this data won't be available immediately, the data will be reflected by the major data providers over the next 3 to 7 days. Brief rundown of price target changes on Thursday: Credit Suisse raises PT from $115 to $135 Oppenheimer Co raises PT from $110 to $130 RBC Capital Market raises PT from $105 to $130 Deutsche Bank raises PT from $115 to $125 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey maintains PT at $125 Mizuho Securities raises PT from $107 to $125 Pacific Crest maintains (bull case) PT at $125 Raymond James raises PT from $115 to $120 Morgan Stanley raises PT from $110 to $120 The mean price target of analysts surveyed was $123.33. This compares very closely to my own price target of $125.92. Maybe, I wasn't that optimistic when compared to the consensus view. Not so surprisingly, everyone reacted to the company's outlook the next morning by raising PTs and non-GAAP EPS estimates. Additionally, Facebook is planning to launch a new standalone app called Notify. It's going to be a notification-driven app that allows users to quickly access top trending news headlines from FB's media partners. While, I'm not exactly certain of the upside from this app, FB is at least attempting to compete more directly with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) by becoming a more reliable source of current events. However, I still have to give the edge to Twitter due to their recent launch of Moments as Twitter has put a lot of effort into both curating and analyzing billions of Tweets. TWTR is a combination of network effect, algorithm, and curation versus FB's me-too app that's partnering with a small sample of news publishers. There's really no comparison here, but over time it may generate momentum depending on the number of news publishers it signs on and gradual feature improvements. I anticipate very little impact on core engagement metrics going forward. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
