Facebook: Total Platform Evolution Will Continue To Drive Shares Higher - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook has decided to take the path of least resistance to growth and thatâ€™s a good thing for shareholders. It looks like Facebook is keen on the idea of taking the best ideas from the current best platforms and deploying them on its own. Facebook is out with news that, in a follow-on News Feed algorithm update to its recently announced algorithm updates, it will begin tracking a huge spectrum of video data points. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has decided to take the path of least resistance to growth and that's a good thing for shareholders. I recently detailed how Facebook added Snapchat-esque photo overlays to its photo uploader for its Facebook platform (so far no indication these overlays are coming to Instagram) and how it appears that Facebook is past the point of being too proud to simply mimic its competition into the grave. Facebook outright stealing ideas isn't Snapchat's only problem (good look monetizing that demographic with the current platform capacity - zero text ability and limited content visibility?) but the creation of a Snapchat-like service (do we see this coming to Moments soon?) should at the very least be concerning. Snapchat, good luck with that. It looks like Facebook is keen on the idea of taking the best ideas from the current best platforms and deploying them on its own. Facebook is out with news that, in a follow-on News Feed algorithm update to its recently announced algorithm updates (updates in which Facebook announced it will track data like time spent viewing posts and who users elect to prioritize seeing content from), it will begin tracking a huge spectrum of video data points. First, are we seeing a pattern yet? Facebook has drastically stepped up its incremental News Feed algorithm testing efforts as of late. This also happens to coincide with the company's massive push to international markets and its ancillary testing of apps like Moments, Instant Articles, and a non-social testing of Messenger . Does anybody reading this think that none of this is connected? We're seeing testing efforts on the largest scale since Facebook came public and from my knowledge of history at the company, maybe ever - or at least since the early days of the company when the platform itself was evolving to current state. I think a couple things are happening on a much wider scale. The first thing that's happening is Facebook is continuing to optimize its platform for Content and Inbound Marketing . That much is clear and I don't think is arguable. All of the testing efforts can be backed out to the general idea that Facebook is trying to optimize the News Feed to optimize engagement to optimize effective advertising. That's a pretty obvious concept. Facebook now tracking video data points like full screen expansion, time viewed in full screen, mute/unmute, time viewed in mute/unmute, HD viewing, time spent HD viewing, as well as traditional metrics of shares, likes, comments, etc., will only further that dialing-in of its most monetizable asset - the News Feed. This again will be good for investors as the data will likely increase the attractiveness of the data, a very productive cycle. For those skeptical of the long-term viability of Facebook like it or not if the company can show increased levels of engagement, even if in non-monetizable ways (users viewing cat videos, users never clicking ads but showing increased key metrics, etc.) the value of the platform and the network will still continue to increase. But what Facebook placing a premium on these types of metrics also does is skew the ratings and the News Feed visibility to high quality content - especially the HD viewing and full screen metrics. I know plenty of folks with smart phones and/or GoPro's that can shoot some pretty high quality video but doesn't it stand to reason that big money marketing and advertising firms will be able to create this type of video, this type of "stay watching me in HD full screen with the volume turned on" content in volume? Especially when they get adept on how to Inbound market, as they are growing adept with Instant Articles? I really think it does. So now Facebook is going to get to have its cake and eat it too. Well, eventually it will. Facebook will be able to continue to optimize its content visibility efforts, it will be able to further drive engagement, it will be able to get users (I think so at least) to prioritize high quality content - I speculate even some created by marketers and advertisers, and it will be able to track it all for repackaging and selling. And therein lies the shareholder value creation of it all. Facebook isn't just doing this to do this - maybe it already has been doing this, driving the video metrics and broader platform engagement with this type of content but we would have never known. Facebook has admitted that its tracking has been buggy and even inaccurate (to the downside of metrics attractiveness - never embellishing) at times. That's been a big friction creator for video ad and marketing adopters. Facebook's data tracking and reporting capacity was atrocious as well - something it very importantly fixed with the rollout of new data, tracking, and reporting dashboards for Page admins. Facebook has fixed what ailed it when it comes to video at exactly the moment of inflection. With the most recent data out of Facebook showing that the platform is on track in 2015 to deliver two-thirds as many video views at Google's YouTube, but growing at an exponentially faster view rate, this is a shot in the arm for the company on the verge of what I believe is finalizing the next evolution of total platform advertising (Content, Intent, and Inbound Marketing from transactional/traditional). If Facebook is first the well when it comes to the "new normal" I think it will be nearly impossible to unseat. It isn't in the high traction periods of evolutionary cycles that disruption happens but during the transitions - just ask Myspace, newspapers, etc., about that. But maybe equally as important and equal in total addressable market is the now very overt Big Data positioning of Facebook. Yes, Facebook has always been in Big Data but it's largely been in this business for itself. With the somewhat recently expressed willingness to share this data with marketers and advertisers and its now focused efforts on making the data easy to collect, view, and analyze (via the above mentioned dashboard additions) I believe Facebook is parallel refining its non-consumer endeavors as well. Facebook's video Big Data rollout and Page updates to dashboards in conjunction with what I believe is non-consumer testing of Messenger and Moments sounds very "BI" to me. I've already speculated multiple times in previous Facebook writings how I believe a collaboration/workflow solution is in the works at Facebook that will eventually launch in an effort to build out its customer service platform (Messenger for Business, Businesses on Facebook). Dashboards for viewing data, the ability to silo, sort, and refine data for analysis, and the ability to have deep, real-time data is an expectation in the BI space and has become an expectation for in-app analysis for even non-BI solutions. Facebook is clearly addressing these requirements in sample size with video data and Page updates. I guess the broader point of this article and the big takeaway for readers is that Facebook is moving forward across multiple fronts all at once. I believe Facebook could be announcing a total tear-down makeover of platform and platform capacity within the next twelve months. I also believe readers should be long the common stock at the very least and readers with experience using leveraged vehicles should add long-dated leverage. The "long-dated" should be added in case I'm wrong or wrong on timing. The Facebook Jan 20, 2017 $87.50 CALL's (which I purchased at $9.60 21 days ago - see below) have exploded 97% higher - I'm now up just under $10,000 on the position, as 1) I think the market realizes what I'm seeing is actually happening and 2) as Facebook shares managed to jump a major technical hurdle to all-time highs. I still like today's spot for adds if you're considering. I continue to recommend a long position in Facebook.
