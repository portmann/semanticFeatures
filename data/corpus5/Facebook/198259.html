Netflix Price Increase: A Repeat Of 2014, Not 2011 - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX has learned to communicate effectively after the 2011 disastrous price increase. Raising the price $1 will allow it to accomplish what it states to its customers - more content. With earnings around the corner, I am still a buyer and will add to my position on any dip post-earnings. Most remember the debacle of Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock price in 2011 - it soared to over $330 (prior to the 7:1 split) and sunk into the $60s after announcing changes to its baseline pricing structure. Netflix's July 2011 announcement of the price increase on its blog was so poorly communicated that most consumers digested it only through the media's interpretation. Thus many were angry. The NFLX Facebook page ran rampant with negative comments, and subscribers ran away over the price increase that was less than the cost of a beer and burger. Making a mistake is only truly a mistake if you learn from it. As I was in a Big 10 University Graduate Communications program at the time and studying media effects/marketing, my classmates and I noted the issues with this message . The bottom line lacks clarity - it cannot be digested in a single reading and provides a more exhaustive explanation than needed. It had an "arrogant air" to its theme - almost like that of, say, a cable company , which is the absolute antithesis to NFLX's basis. The attitude could be summed up as, "the price is going up, and you will like it … and if you don't, then cancel … we dare you." And if you wanted to take NFLX's dare to cancel, the message gave the customer an easy way out - a couple clicks, and you were done. Most importantly though, was the lesson of customer loyalty. They gave no incentive to current customers, no grandfathering of those already members for a year or two, and thus further infuriated long-term subscribers. However, fast forward over four years and we come to NFLX having regained its stock price and then some. This increase in the company's stock price has come about even with another price increase for its service in May of 2014 . But why did that increase not have a media headline of, "NFLX raises prices 12.5%?" Well, the answer is in the email below, which shows that NFLX learned from its 2011 mistake. The messaging is direct and uncomplicated. Consumers can understand the reason for the price increase and they have seen the results of increased content over the past several years, especially the addition of original content that NFLX continues to expand. And NFLX grandfathered in current subscribers at their old price for two years. Average subscribers likely read the email, shrugged with an, "ok, I get it," and went on with their lives … and the stock price reflected this lack of enraged defections. So what were the lessons learned by NFLX, outside the realization that $1 is better than $2 per month and the need to clearly spell out the increase while citing valid reason that consumers can easily digest? Two additional and essential lessons pop out: The need to incentivize current customers to stay through a price increase by keeping their current plan price for 1-2 years. Loyalty works both ways and is give and take. There is no mention of canceling your membership in either of the newest announcements. By not mentioning the option, consumers are more likely to react in a "ho-hum" manner than consider ending their subscription. With these lessons learned, NFLX again announced it will increase the price of its most popular subscription fee by $1/month to $9.99 last week. There is no reason to fear a 2011 drop, or even a major dip, as this newest increase nearly mirrors the 2014 success. NFLX also prepped this increase in July with a statement from Reed Hastings that subscribers should brace for higher-priced plans in the future. The simple statement below gave the candid reason for the price bump: To continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles, we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. As a thank you to existing Netflix members -- who aren't already benefiting from a previous price guarantee -- we will maintain their current price for a year. Overall, NFLX has now created its round wheel for price increases that unlock value for its investors by maintaining customer loyalty and increasing its content library. And as my military comrades like to tell me, "You don't need to reinvent the wheel - if it works, it works!" NFLX has fortified this base messaging skill and now only needs to improve the rubber on the wheel for max performance and longevity. Thus, this newest price raise is nothing to worry about - in fact, it should be welcomed as Seeking Alpha contributor Michael Battat mentions in his article. Defections in mass are highly unlikely and the extra revenue should help ensure original content and the addition of new shows, possibly from the selection of cancelled TV shows I mentioned in my previous NFLX article . I am continuing to buy on a weekly basis and will fortify my position further if investors react negatively to the next earnings report.
