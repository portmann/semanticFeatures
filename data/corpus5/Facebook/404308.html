Facebook: What Worries Me Most - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha While results strong, new share class proposal is troubling. Effective split forces investors to make tough decision(s). In late April, we got another strong quarterly report from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). The continued growth in both the user base and financial results have sent the stock to all-time highs, with a market cap approaching $350 billion. While the company continues to fire on all cylinders, there is one item regarding the stock that worries me the most, detailed in the above press release: We also announced today that our board of directors has approved a proposal to amend and restate our existing certificate of incorporation to create a new class of non-voting capital stock, known as the Class C capital stock. If the proposal is approved, we intend to issue two shares of Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend in respect of each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock. This proposal is designed to create a capital structure that will, among other things, allow us to remain focused on Mr. Zuckerberg's long-term vision for our company and encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to remain in an active leadership role at Facebook. The adoption of the proposal is subject to the approval of our stockholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June 20, 2016, and the record date for the payment of the Class C stock dividend would be set by the board of directors at a later date. If this sounds familiar to you, it probably is. When Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) tried to do this, the company faced lawsuits and eventually had to make a one-time payment because its Class C shares were trading at a discount. In fact, the gap between Google's two share classes grew so large that the company had to step in and start repurchasing shares to decrease the gap. Buying a few billion in shares has helped the situation, but currently, Alphabet's Class A shares still trade at about a $17 premium. Last month, I warned investors that we would see a similar scenario when it came to Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) (NYSE: UA.C ). Sure enough, a wide gap has opened between the two trading classes, more than $2.50 as of Tuesday morning, which is quite significant on a stock that trades for less than $40. Today, Under Armour's Class A shares are also trading nearly 10 times the amount of shares as Class C, so there is virtually little interest in the non-voting shares. So if Facebook does go through with this "stock dividend", perhaps after a legal battle that could take months or even years, investors will again be put in a precarious scenario. Do you hold both classes of shares, and likely see the non-voting shares trade at a discount that grows over time? Or, do you perhaps sell the non-voting shares once they start trading, or perhaps just sell Facebook before the "dividend" and then re-buy the voting class shares afterwards? In that case, you are likely to face a tax bill, perhaps a large one, given how well Facebook shares have done in recent years. Some investors may not have the necessary cash to do that, and those who have held for a shorter time may not be eligible for the lower long-term capital gains tax rate. Here we go again. While Facebook's Q1 results were spectacular, the company announced a new proposed trading share class that will not contain voting rights. Following in the footsteps of Alphabet/Google and Under Armour, this is designed to protect the company's founders and early holders, but it creates a messy situation for the everyday shareholder. As we've seen so far, these non-voting shares end up trading at a discount, and those stuck holding end up with significant underperformance.
