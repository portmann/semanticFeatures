Can Facebook Win At Politics? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is facing political pressure in the developing world over net neutrality. Facebook is also trying to avoid the problems Google had in offering publishing content. Facebook is now a dominant player in social, but will have to reach a mature valuation to be worth buying. Given that technology is now our dominant industry, it is inevitable that any fast-growing tech company will, at some point, have to master politics, and on a global scale. This is now the challenge at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Facebook has managed, in its short life, to gain a huge footprint in many international markets, like India. Thus it now faces the issue of net neutrality. It was the U.S. FCC decision upholding net neutrality, the idea that Internet access should not favor one company's content over others, which began the controversy. That is because Facebook's Internet.Org initiative, which is aimed at opening up access to the very poor around the world, does not offer open, neutral access to the resource. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to defend that proposition and to personally back down from Indian protests, saying that he is turning Internet.org into a platform rather than a "walled garden" featuring Facebook and other services, like the BBC, it chooses to support. By letting other Internet Service Providers, rather than just Facebook, choose what content to support, Facebook hopes to deflect criticism away from its choices. This is being sold as pushing the service out to "developers" . Facebook is also facing increased pressure from publishers, who are demanding a bigger cut of ad revenues on articles people reach using the service. The Facebook response is an "Instant Articles" feature, where publishers posting stories directly to the service will get 70% of the ad revenue from them, or all the revenue if the publishers sell ads themselves. Whether either of these initiatives work in stifling political criticism isn't nearly as important as the fact that politics will continue to hamper growth going forward. Facebook has seen how companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can get into costly political trouble offering something free that people no longer had, like search, and it is determined to navigate those political channels more successfully. This is happening against the backdrop of a market where all social stocks, including Facebook, are in trouble due to the financial stumbles of companies like Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), leading to a general disenchantment with the "social networking" space, in which people rather than data points are the focus. Facebook itself has not yet stumbled. Its March quarter revenue of $3.5 billion was up 40% from last year's quarterly revenue of $2.5 billion, and while net income fell year-over-year, to $512 million from $642 million, its heavy investment in cloud infrastructure is making it independent of companies like Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), thus more self-sustaining than other social platforms. Still, relative margins are declining, growth rates are declining as numbers naturally get bigger, and the stock is under pressure, down from a recent high of $85/share to the current level of $78.50. This is nothing compared to the disasters at LinkedIn and Yelp, both of which lost 20% of their value after earnings and have yet to get a bounce back. Facebook is now considered the established leader in social, just as Google is the leader in search, giving it a premium valuation. Should it manage to just maintain its present revenue pace, however, delivering $14 billion in sales for all of 2015, it would have a price-to-sales ratio of 15. The expectation built into the stock, then, is that it continues to grow rapidly, bringing the forward price-to-sales ratio below 10, and any failure to hit that mark will be punished severely. My prediction is that politics will play a role in slowing Facebook's growth going forward, and you will be able to catch it at lower levels later this year. Source: Can Facebook Win At Politics?
