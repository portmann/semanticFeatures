Snapchat: This Ghost Cannot, And Will Not, Be Ignored - Snapchat (Pending:CHAT) | Seeking Alpha A recent report states that Snapchat has reached six billion daily video views. This closely rivals Facebook's eight billion daily video views. I touch on some of CHAT's newest features and explain why the app is so attractive and sticky. Halloween may be over, but the Snapchat (Pending: CHAT ) ghost certainly is not. Recently, news reveals just how much of a disruptor CHAT truly is. Earlier this week, FT reported that Snapchat tripled its daily video view count to six billion, which closely rivals Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) whopping eight billion daily video views. The latter's daily video view count has doubled since April. It is worth noting that to tally a view on FB, it must be watched for at least three seconds. Comparatively, on Snapchat, it is reported that only a few milliseconds count as a view. While this may seem like a ludicrous amount of time, especially when compared to Facebook's perhaps more legitimate length of time, Snapchat is founded on the concept of short bursts of content. When sending videos to friends or posting to a story, the maximum amount of time allotted is 10 seconds. This is why, in my opinion, tallying a view at nearly one-third of the total video length available seems a little unreasonable, and it is needless to say that the average video length on Snapchat is less than 10 seconds, which makes this proportion even higher. On FB, the average video length is 44 seconds (as of August 2014). So, when measuring what counts as a view, I think both view times reflect the nature of each social media site, and serve as reasonable means by which to track engagement Before I get into why Snapchat's rapid increase in video views even matters, I'll quickly discuss why the social media platform is so popular. Snapchat is an app that adds new features at a rapid cadence. Within the last few months, CHAT has added a facial recognition capability. The new feature allows the user to press and hold on his or her face, and select - from seven different choices - the distortion that they would like. While this is a silly addition to the app, it makes Snapchat incredibly sticky. Each day a new distortion is added, making a compelling case for the user to return each day. The newest features that have been added are slow motion and sped up video capabilities. These features have been heavily requested by many users, and they present even more reason to use and keep using the app. Lastly, the Live Stories and Discover sections provide an endless stream of visual content, and make this app a severe threat to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). With media from National Geographic, Daily Mail, and CNN, a user is able to access a large portion of the world's news. While it certainly is not the primary outlet for this, it is just another feature that gives reason for a user to stay. But back to video. Why exactly is it that Snapchat's strength in video poses a threat to Facebook? First, realize that Snapchat only operates in portrait mode (the way you would hold your phone to field a phone call). Many have griped over the fact that there is no landscape mode capability, but I believe that this is one feature on which Snapchat will not bend. The portrait-only platform is too vital to its advertiser appeal. Snapchat's portrait-only platform ensures that ads are always vertical and full screen. By offering full-screen ads, CHAT gives advertisers a way to better engage with consumers. Facebook and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube do not offer full-screen videos in portrait, which means vertical ads can only be displayed on a small portion of the screen. I know that while ads are playing on YouTube, I often find myself scrolling through the comments rather than watching. The drawback to Snapchat's platform is that, unlike YouTube, users can skip ads the moment they show up. The trade-off is the amazing capability for the ad to instantly fire on all cylinders. This plays into the short length of time that counts as a video view. It may be short, especially when compared to Facebook, but to an advertiser, those milliseconds may be worth far more than seconds on Facebook. I see this as a preferred feature for advertisers. So does all this mean death to Facebook? No, not at all. Facebook knows advertising better than almost anyone else, and it has the ability to tailor ads based on interests. One thing Snapchat advertising lacks is the ability to target ads to certain users based on their interests, because there is no feature that gives a clear sense of a user's interests. I think that the only way for CHAT to really rival Facebook's momentum in the advertising world is to add a feature that gathers information about its users. An idea I have is for Snapchat to enable polls. Given how well-received Twitter polls were (measured by engagement as a percentage of impressions), I think Snapchat would have no problem cleverly adding polls to its app. With more information on users, they present a stronger case to advertisers and will be able to take even more market share. If you're currently long Facebook, I wouldn't touch your position. It will take a great deal of time before Snapchat is able to learn as much about its users as Facebook. While CHAT has the portrait-only advertisements going for it, I do not see the company being a major threat to Facebook until it can successfully integrate a feature such as polls and learn about its users. With the portrait-only advertisements and an equal amount of knowledge about its users, Snapchat poses a much bigger threat. So, in a sentence: I do not recommend selling or shorting FB based solely on competition from CHAT. Moreover, Snapchat has not filed for an IPO, but many think that the company will one day hit the trading floor. Simply due to its popularity and brand, I believe investors will be quick to pounce on Snapchat in its first moments as a public company. Am I one of those investors? Not right off the bat. Previous IPOs that were incredibly hyped include Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Facebook. While it is not necessarily fair to predict Snapchat's potential performance based on how these stocks fared, all three were/are highly coveted stocks. The initial pop that BABA and FB saw (though the latter's was very short lived) ended with their depression to new lows. The aura surrounding these types of stocks, in my opinion, makes them tricky to trade right out of the gate. This is why I suggest waiting. When Snapchat hits the tape, be patient. The IPO could come at a time when the company has further developed its advertising strategy which, as I highlighted above, would pose a serious threat to FB. To me the long-term story of CHAT is extremely compelling, and I would be willing to wait to get in on the deal. The high risk associated with making fast money, in my opinion, is supplanted by the long-term opportunity. Patience is key.
