3 High Growth Stocks Best Positioned For 2016 | Seeking Alpha We evaluate growth from a non-dividend, high growth asset model. The investment community has long implemented the rational investor theory, paired with the capital asset pricing model. Within the non-dividend, high growth space a core constant within the CAPM breaks down. The CAPM assumes investors are risk averse, as Fama and French stated in 2004 . The very nature of non-dividend, high growth asset investing violates this key principle. As such, the CAPM has certain limitations within the non-dividend, high growth asset space considering this class of investments is inherently associated with risk. Does this mean the CAPM should simply be discarded for this asset class? Most certainly not. However, it should lead investors and analysts alike to evaluate the accuracy of these pricing models with greater veracity. The constant within high or hyper growth spaces is innovation. As levels of innovation rise, the greater the growth within the space. As innovation falls the subsequent rate of growth falls as well. This explains why industries, and the subsequent companies within, shift from infancy stage (high or hyper growth of innovation) to a mature nature (lesser levels of innovation). The three companies poised to succeed in 2016 have maintained and/or increased their respective levels of innovation in 2015, providing room for equity price appreciation in 2016. A bullish theme for each of the companies we discuss is a rising interest rate environment, which will draw investors' attention in an attempt to identify alpha for their respective portfolios. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) - In September of 2014 we published a piece using a more primitive form of the innovation model, more centrally focused on the macro model of innovation. We have since discovered that, not unlike the cyclical nature of the equity markets, while the macro market must be conducive to innovation, the micro model must also be appropriately positioned for innovation. The conclusion of the 2014 article provided a bullish outlook for Tesla. More than 14 months removed from the original piece Tesla is positioned to have a strong 2016. Strictly viewing the fundamentals of Tesla, however, provides a very different outlook. Tesla has a Forward P/E of 128.94, an 8.11 P/S, and a -1.84 PEG ratio. Most investors would run the opposite direction after reading these metrics. The bullish nature we hold on Tesla is derived from its innovation score. TSLA currently resides in a macro innovation environment of .14, which categorizes Tesla as residing in a mature industry (-0.2 : 0.2). On a micro scale Tesla holds an innovation score of 0.626. Akin to comparing commonly accepted metrics of P/E, P/S, PEG, et al of a single entity against the industry's average, we use the same approach with regard to the micro innovation score (single entity) and macro innovation score (industry average). The narrative of Tesla supports the quantitative metrics. Elon Musk stated the Model 3 will be unveiled in 2016, with production beginning in 2017. Additionally, Tesla's giga-factory in Nevada will begin producing in spring of 2016 and anticipates reaching full operating capacity by 2020. The same source highlights that the giga-factory was originally expected to begin production in 2017, effectively expediting the Nevada plant by a full year. Tesla also rolled out their Autopilot program in October of 2015, again being at the forefront of technological capabilities within the automotive space. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ): September of 2014 saw us use the same pricing methodology on the streaming juggernaut. Since that bullish outlook was provided NFLX has enjoyed an incredible amount of price appreciation, with more than 90% appreciation when split adjusted. What 2016 holds in store for NFLX is the key point of contention for the investment community. Netflix has a current P/E of 327, a Forward P/E of 471.19, 8.14 P/S, a 25.03 PEG, and $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Excluding the cash stockpile, NFLX's fundamental metrics are atrocious. The current valuation simply isn't sustainable when viewed only through fundamentals. When using the innovation metrics, however, we see a very different opinion. The macro innovation environment Netflix resides in is a mere 0.1, if an investor views NFLX as a pure media company, which illustrates a fully matured industry. If an investor views Netflix as residing in the technology sector NFLX holds a macro innovation rate of 0.46, categorized as a developing industry by a rate above 0.2. The proper categorization of the streaming giant is somewhere in between, with a bias, or skew, towards the technology curve. The micro innovation rate for Netflix is easier to discern as the metric is derived purely by Netflix's financials. NFLX holds a 0.867 micro innovation rate. This is exceptionally bullish as the micro rate is more than double the industry average, or the macro innovation rate. The superior rate of innovation compared to the industry average indicates a greater demand for the Netflix product than competition. Without belittling you as a reader, this is obviously bullish for Netflix looking forward. The narrative for Netflix fully supports the bullishness provided by the innovation indicators. Netflix received 34 Emmy Nominations the most recent award season, nearly tying traditional content providing Fox. Meanwhile, NFLX's domestic growth has begun to slow at a marginal rate. Whereas the overseas growth for Netflix has exceeded expectations at a rate more than offsetting the slowing of domestic growth. Additionally, Netflix continues to develop and deliver popular exclusive content such as "House of Cards", "Orange is the New Black", "High Profits", and Bill Murray's incredibly popular Christmas special. Cord cutting has also increased as more and more users cut ties with pay television models and opt for streaming services. Planned cord cutting rose again in 2015, from 2.9% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015. As additional consumers switch to streaming NFLX is well positioned to capitalize on that audience going forward. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ): Another September 2014 piece we provided held significant bullish sentiment for the penultimate social media company. The same, albeit less evolved, growth supply and demand model was used to ascertain the projection provided at the article's conclusion. Since the article was published on Seeking Alpha Facebook equity has appreciated 26.06%. 2016 looks to provide Facebook far more upward mobility. FB has a current P/E of 106.65, Forward P/E of 37.14, 18.95 P/S, a PEG of 1.67, and $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Save the cash, FB's traditional fundamentals only look attractive when compared to the aforementioned Netflix. The fundamental valuation metrics have been a point of contention for bears of FB stock since the S-1 filing came out. This is where the CAPM truly handicaps an analyst. Facebook resides in a 0.46 macro innovation space, the technology sector. If we choose to evaluate FB in a more comparative light, the social media space holds a 0.61 macro innovation rate. Meanwhile, Facebook holds an astonishing 0.868 micro innovation rate. Again, the micro innovation rate is derived purely from Facebook's financials, whereas the macro innovation rate is derived by using the industry's averages. The 0.68 macro innovation rate accurately describes a rapidly evolving social media industry. The 0.868 micro innovation rate illustrates Facebook's allocation of talents and assets towards constantly evolving the business model to stay at the forefront of the social media industry. Considering the high rate of innovation associated with the social media industry, and the exemplary level of innovation illustrated by FB superseding the already high requirement of the sector, this is a very bullish signal. The narrative for Facebook fully supports the lofty expectations placed on the equity by the innovation metrics. FB announced a new partnership with Uber, the "on-demand" ride provider, making the service available through Facebook Messenger. This allows FB to keep users on the platform for longer periods of time, and, subsequently, allow Facebook to display more ads to the user base. During the Q3 earnings release FB announced that more than 8 billion video views occur on a daily basis, which is more than the last reported number provided by YouTube. Also, Facebook's user growth grew by 12.6% year-over-year from Q3 2014 to Q3 2015. Facebook's WhatsApp acquisition is poised to begin paying dividends as well, with 50% user growth year-over-year from 2014 to 2015. Instagram, another FB acquisition, topped 400 million users in September of 2015. Instagram has already begun showing select ads to its user base, while Sheryl Sandberg is on record stating Facebook will look to monetize platforms when they achieve 1 billion monthly active users. More impressively recode.net released projections for the virtual reality market, which Facebook's Oculus Rift resides in, of $70 billion by 2020 . Healthcare, military, and various other fields are relying more and more heavily on virtual reality to train their fields of specialty. Moreover, FB is beginning to ramp up the marketing efforts for Oculus Rift through highlighting it's immense power for Fortune 500 companies and non-profits alike. Oculus Rift is still at least a couple years away from scratching the surface of its potential, but investors should begin to see the fruits of Oculus towards the conclusion of 2016. It would be wise to view Oculus as the tertiary monetization platform in FB's rather robust pipeline. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
