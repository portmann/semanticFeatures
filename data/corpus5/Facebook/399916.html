Microsoft Earnings: Another Buy Signal For Long-Term Investors - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha A disheartened market slammed Microsoft stock down by 10%, but is the sell-off justified? What are the real metrics underlying overall revenue numbers? Mr. Market was clearly disappointed after Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Q3 earnings were reported. After trading close to its 52-week high before the earnings call, the stock is now down by more than 10% and is now trading below $50. Let's take a closer look at the their earnings to identify if the sell off was really warranted or if it's a great buying opportunity in disguise. A quick glance at their quarterly earnings metrics is sort of disheartening to any Microsoft investor, as revenue declined 6% for the quarter and 9% for the first nine months of this fiscal. Reportable Segment Analysis - A Mixed Bag Their productivity and business processes segment (Office products and Microsoft Dynamics) posted a 1% increase, intelligent cloud (All cloud-related products, enterprise services and consulting) was up by 3%, and more personal computing (Windows, Xbox, devices and search advertising) increased by 1%. So all wasn't lost this past quarter. The major hit to overall revenues came from corporate and other, the segment which accounts for revenue deferrals related to Windows 10; that segment booked a loss of $1.545 billion for the quarter and $4.7 billion for the first nine months of the current fiscal. With PC on the decline and Microsoft's device business not taking off as expected, it was a given that more personal computing - the lead earner for Microsoft - would take the worst hit. The 1% growth they showed this quarter is overshadowed by the 7% they lost year to date compared with the same period last year, and this declining trend may well continue in this segment. On the other hand, the productivity and business processes segment is holding steady on the back of growing Office 365 subscriptions despite declining legacy Office product sales - something that has directly been impacted by declining PC sales since 2011. As for the intelligent cloud segment, it has taken the lead growth position, but did not grow as fast as some might have expected them to. This applies specifically to cloud-based revenues, to which the infrastructure component - Azure - is (or should have been) a significant contributor. Overall, the intelligent cloud unit grew 8% during Q1, 5% during Q2 and 3% during Q3. That was at the low end of their guidance, and Microsoft also iterated that it expects foreign exchange to negatively impact the segment by 3 points in Q4. The slowing growth in what was expected to be the lead growth segment, coupled with a not so enthusiastic guidance for the last quarter has taken the toll on the stock. Despite the struggles it's been having this fiscal, I think the recent sell-off is not at all justified. In the short-term, yes, the company has disappointed on several fronts. But in the grander scheme of things, 2016 is a transformative and transitory period for several companies in the tech space. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and many other companies are attempting to change their basic DNA - not an easy task, and certainly not one that is going to be given any leeway by investors. In Microsoft's case, the company is clearly trying to get intelligent cloud to swap places with more personal computing as the key growth driver of sustainable revenue growth. But it's going to take time, and that's exactly what's weighing down the stock at this point. Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds $8.2 billion (Q1-2016) Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds $9.4 billion (Q2-2016) Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds $10.0 billion(Q3-2016) At the end of third quarter, Microsoft said that commercial cloud's annualized revenue has reached $10 billion; to put it another way, $2.5 billion a quarter. The company aims to double this number by 2018, and that's exactly why the current slow down and the not-so-positive guidance has played a huge damper on the sentiments. To get to $20 billion in commercial cloud revenues, Microsoft has to grow in the 5 to 10% range every quarter, sequentially, from here until 2018; which, I believe they can still do despite the obvious slowdown from Q2 to Q3 when compared to Q1 to Q2. They have only just entered the hybrid cloud space with Azure Stack , and that promises to be a strong revenue earner in the enterprise segment where Microsoft already has a significant presence. In terms of stabilizing the other segments, I think they're gradually getting there. Here's a look at the past three quarters, where you can see the results of their efforts: So, even though this past quarter has been a sort of mixed bag with respect to growth in various areas, we need to look at the long-term implications of what Nadella and the company are doing in key strategic areas. The basic shift from being a product-based company into becoming a services-oriented one is a hard nut to crack even for a small company. And for a huge vessel like Microsoft, the challenges are compounded to a much greater degree. The important things to keep your eyes on are Windows 10 adoption (270 million users as of last count), commercial adoption of Office 365 (70 million+ with revenue growing by 63% in constant currency ), the embracing of the open source community via Xamarin and UWP, and their recent entry into the hybrid model for enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft is now trading at 18 times its forward earnings and, as each of the business segments claws back again with intelligent cloud taking the pole position, I think the upside is very much there for Microsoft, so loading up now while it's trading at the $50 level would be a good investment decision.
