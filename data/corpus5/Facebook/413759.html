Facebook Fears - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The global Internet expansion rate slows down. Further growth of Facebook's audience will be mainly provided by countries with low income per capita. Thinking about reasons to buy Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) shares at their current price level, I primarily try to assess its prospects to grow its audience. And I should confess that, having relatively small doubts in the quantitative growth potential, I still have some serious concerns about the qualitative parameters. According to statistics, the active Facebook audience has been growing linearly over the past three years. If the growth continues at the current rate, the monthly Facebook audience will definitely rise beyond 2 billion users in two years' time. But how real are such growth rates on a global scale? According to the Global Web Index's study , there are 3.4 billion Internet users in the World, which is 46% of the total population. If we take a look at the penetration of the Internet, the leader is U.A.E. (96%), and the outsider is India (28%), while the median belongs to Poland (67%). Based on that figure, it can be assumed that, without taking into account the natural population growth, the number of Internet users has a chance to grow up to 5 billion users, i.e. by 1.6 billion people. Thus, the Internet still has room to grow and this is a tailwind for Facebook. But the speed of expansion of the global Web is slowing down. According to internetlivestats.com, the new connections growth rate will slow down to 7.5% YOY in 2016, while up to 2012 the growth rate was at least 10% YOY. Perhaps, the initiative of Facebook to provide free Internet access for people in developing countries (internet.org) will yield favourable results, but it is more likely that the speed of the Internet penetration will decline in the future, and, hence, it will be harder for Facebook to sustain its growth rate. According to the United Nations, the Internet market in the developed countries has reached the saturation point, while in the poorest countries up to 90% of the population have no access to the Internet. The Global Web Index's research gives more detailed figures, according to which African and Asian countries have the greatest potential for the further growth of the Internet. And this draws us to the main conclusion: the further growth of Facebook audience will be mainly accounted for the countries with low income per capita. And the potential of China should not be considered at all, because Facebook is banned in this country. But if a user of a social network has a low income, will an advertiser be interested to pay for showing him the ad? In my opinion, the answer is clearly negative. This means that Facebook audience growth rate in the long term will not be accompanied by retention of the revenue growth rate. We must not forget, of course, that Facebook has WhatsApp - a powerful reserve in the context of monetization. This messenger on the early stage of development gave up on an advertising-based monetization model. That's why in the World full of advertisement this is definitely a unique product. However, its assumed revenue model which gives business the opportunity to communicate directly with the customers it's not fully clear so far, despite all its attractiveness. Moreover, there are no exact dates of when WhatsApp will begin to contribute to Facebook revenue. But despite these unknowns, Facebook shares are already traded at a P/S multiplier nearly three times higher than the average for the industry. And is the most alarming fact.
