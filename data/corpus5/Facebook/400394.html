Apple And Google's Next Big Thing - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha It's no secret that Apple and Google are developing autonomous cars. But itâ€™s not the simplicity, efficiency, pleasure, safety or cost-savings of the autonomous automotive experience in which they are interested. People spend a lot of time in their cars and, particularly, driving their cars. And everyone knows time is money. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) want to take control of that time. By freeing up driving and related passenger tasks, like navigating and looking around for landmarks, these companies hope to gain access to your eyes, ears, and wallets. Think about how much value there is in online mobile entertainment and web-surfing, activities like accessing iTunes, viewing YouTube, and watching TV shows, for everyone in the car. Not just the kids on a family trip, solo drivers, too. Targeted ads associated with specific people, like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) provides, built on specific preferences, but now also combined with travel data like moving location correlated with the time of day. This is very, very valuable to certain industries. An automotive data bank would be a useful tool for advertisers: it could hold both your travel history and your travel plans. This would provide a glimpse into your future thereby enabling the provision of narrowly targeted ads as you go on your way. How much will McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) be willing to pay to push out an ad to a traveling family between 10am-noon on a highway in the vicinity of one of their restaurants, especially if someone in the family is known to like to eat there? Yes, they'll know it's a family traveling based on the types of electronic interactions in the vehicle or even some built-in car diagnostics. They could identify ages, sexes, and weights from this data and sign-ins. If they know who's specifically in the car, they'll already know everyone's meal preferences, and if they don't, they can make demographic-based estimates. Highly tailored ads to traveling carloads. So how much time are we talking about? For this estimate, I'll assume autonomous car travel is equivalent to human-driver travel time. What could be different? Well, will autonomous cars be allowed to speed? Will they be required to come to a complete stop at stop signs and lights? Both of these factors could increase travel time. On the other hand, automated traffic flow optimization might reduce travel times in congested areas, so maybe it's a wash overall. Okay, back to the estimate. On average, American drivers over the age of 18 travel for 46 minutes per day . With 214 million drivers , the total on-road travel time is 164 million hours. Now, that's a lot of cumulative time but the spans aren't always very long. But they're ideal for short video content like YouTube and some TV shows, music videos, etc. I'm sure perfect-length original content will be developed by the likes of Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), etc. to fill these time slots. With a 2.5 hour per-person average time on connected devices, the extra road hours adds about 30% to the potential total device time usage. For the following estimates, I'll utilize current corporate revenues to assess the impact of the additional travel time access. Apple makes about $20B/year on 1B iOS devices for services, which includes iTunes and the App Store. That averages out to $20/device per year. I've seen as high as $40/device in the U.S. but I'll stick with the lower value for my estimate here. If we assume sales are proportional to time, that 30% translates into $6/device per year or $6B/year. If we just consider the U.S., that's maybe half of total sales and would come in around $3B. This is 3% of Apple's $234B 2015 revenue, a drop in the bucket in comparison. Even at double my estimate, the value of the extra automobile time is just 5% of revenue. This result highlights the need for Apple to either greatly enhance their service offerings or have their devices built in to get a significant bottom-line impact from the autonomous vehicle market. On to Google. Google's 2015 $75B annual revenue comes nearly entirely in the form of online service value, such as ads and apps. Consequently, the increased car usage time, assuming it's also proportional to sales, implies a $23B increase in revenue. If roughly half of that is U.S., my estimate is around $12B annually. That's 16% of Google's revenue, a meaningful amount. Knowing that 90% of Google's revenue comes from advertising, we can check this estimate using ad impressions per hour. Using two different methods, I've estimated that Google can get 40-50 impressions/hour, which seems reasonable. Something less than 1 impression/minute, depending on what you're doing. Assuming an average cost of $1.50 per 1000 impressions puts the market value of the travel time at over $10B annually. The actual value is probably higher based on the reasoning I provided earlier, being some multiple of this. Nevertheless, this result agrees with my prior estimate. On an absolute basis, the time value of the autonomous car market is at least 2x more valuable to Google than it is for Apple. On a percent of revenue basis, it's at least 6x more valuable to Google. As things stand now, Google will benefit much more significantly from autonomous cars than Apple. These results are likely the reason Google is openly and aggressively pursuing autonomous vehicle development as it works to expand into new markets. Another positive is that Google can benefit from any autonomous vehicle implementation, even if it's Apple supplied. Apple, on the other hand, appears to be stuck needing to get their devices integrated within autonomous cars to generate impactful revenue unless they come up with an associated service value driver. To conclude, let's think about the future. In 2020, when you first test-ride an autonomous car, take a look at the electronics layout around you, its integration and how it calls for your attention. Then, when you forget about being too scared to stop looking out the window, you'll relax and start acting like you're in your own living room. You'll be enamored by the convenience and experience at your hands. Not tethered to a steering wheel, but instead to an integrated electronic device that engages you during your trip. That's when you should start paying attention to the commercial aspect of it all. Sure, it's a good thing, but it's not entirely about you: it's about surrounding companies, your wallet and your time. Apple and Google are vying for it. Captive connected consumers equals cash flow.
