Facebook: Priced For Perfection At $92? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha I found and organized the relevant global and U.S. ad spending data for readers to consider. I present a high-level view of what's priced into Facebook's current valuation. I wrote this article to ensure retail investors understand the bet they are making owning shares of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) at current valuation levels. Before talking about valuation ratios, let's take a step back and understand the size of Facebook's total addressable market. It's easy to get lost down the rabbit hole with dozens of different audience metrics and become enchanted by Facebook's stellar past stock performance. Let me be clear, I'm not long or short. I mostly own bonds in my PA and the only two stocks that I own at the moment are Volkswagen (OTCQX: VLKAY ) and Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ). I have no hidden agenda and I'm not trying to win trading or investment banking services from Facebook, so I'm probably less biased than the sell-side cheerleaders. According to the widely cited and respected source eMarketer.com, total global ad spending in 2015 will be $592.4 billion. In the U.S. the figure is $189 billion with a significant 46% percent coming from digital and mobile internet. Here is Total Global Marker Share 2011 - 2013. I couldn't find 2014 figures, but as you can see, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is the 800-pound gorilla. Facebook only had 5.41% of global market share in 2013. When we are thinking about digital ad spending, we really need to think about search, display, mobile and to a much lesser extent video. Here is global net mobile ad revenue by market share. Facebook does much better in mobile because of its large audience and user engagement on its site as a percentage of people's time. Here is eMarketer.com's mobile Internet growth Pprojections. If Facebook maintains its 22% market share and the 2016 projections prove accurate then Facebook could see upward of $13.5 billion in global mobile ad revenue. Here is the overall U.S. ad spend by media type. Clearly, digital is displacing print and slowly nipping at TV and radio spend. Facebook does very well in US digital display. If you back out intangibles and goodwill on Facebook's balance sheet, FB is trading at over 12X book value. I'm not sure how investors can make money buying a stock with an absolute market cap of $260 billion and that's trading at over 12X book value. I want readers to focus on how employee share-based compensation as percentage of Facebook's expenses have jumped. What happens to employee satisfaction if the shares get dinged? What happens if the early employees are so wealthy that they get burned out and simply retire at age 35? What happens if Facebook's top talent leaves to pursue a new venture? Can Facebook maintain its unique culture as it grows? Can you say "Group Think?" Forty-six masters of the universe cover Facebook. The median price target is $111 and the mean target is $112. Surely, this must be a lock to generate a 20% return. Conclusion: The aim of this write up is to help retail investors organize and synthesize the facts so readers can make more intelligent and well-informed decisions. Clearly, I'm skeptical, but I recognize that Facebook is firing on all cylinders and benefits from the robust projected global mobile and display ad revenue growth outlook. However, in my simple mind, the shares look priced for perfection. If there is any hint of less rosy digital ad spending or Facebook doesn't continue to crush consensus expectations then look out below.
