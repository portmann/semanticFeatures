ETF Hub Sep  3 2015, 19:10 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has updated its Conversion Lift ad measurement tool to let marketers compare the performance of difference Facebook ads featuring the same objective, and to compare their impact across different online and offline channels. Previously, Conversion Tool could only be used to measure an advertiser's success with a test group that has seen an ad versus a control group that hasn't. Facebook has also begun testing an interactive/full-screen mobile ad format ( first revealed in June) that lets users browse multiple pages of photos, videos, and other material. Initial testers for the ads, which could bring much higher prices than standard News Feed ads, include Gatorade and Michael Kors. Other Facebook news: 1) Facebook's Parse app development platform has released SDKs supporting IoT devices powered by chips from Intel, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, and Atmel. 2) Four Facebook apps made App Annie's list of the 10 most downloaded iOS apps since 2010: The core app (#1), Messenger (#2), Instagram (#4), and WhatsApp (#6).
