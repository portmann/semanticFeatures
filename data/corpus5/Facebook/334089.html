Facebook: Call Me A Doubting Thomas | Seeking Alpha 2015 has been a phenomenal year for Facebook. Shares traded for 84 times its trailing earnings per share and more than 17 times sales per share. Looks like 2015 has been a phenomenal year for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Fabulous Q4 earnings of 79 cents per share on $5.84 billion in revenue surpassed even the highest estimates on Wall Street of 75 cents per share and revenue of $5.67 billion. Annual revenue from advertising jumped 57% yoy and free cash flow increased 67.6% yoy. On the day Q4 earnings were reported, Facebook's shares surged 14% in pre-market trading and now even a month later, investors are still rushing to become part of this rapidly growing social media giant. Currently, Facebook shares are being traded for 84 times its trailing earnings per share and more than 17 times sales per share. Kevin Landis, CEO at Firsthand Capital Management described it as: "It's doom and gloom all around us and these guys are just killing it." On the face of it, all sounds nice and rosy but a few things caught my attention: Annual revenue from advertising shot up 57% despite a 38% decrease in number of ads delivered. Data from 2014 reveals the same pattern: revenue from advertising increased by 65% although the number of ads delivered decreased by 40%. The skyrocketing prices of ads (140% and 170% in 2015 and 2014 respectively) may partly explain the sharply falling number of ads delivered. But when adding both variables together, sharply increasing prices and falling number of ads delivered, it is rather surprising to find on the right hand of the equation such a strong increase in revenue from ads. Fantastic growth rate figures of Daily Active Users (DAU). In 2015 Facebook managed to achieve a milestone of 1.04 billion daily active users worldwide. This figure means that DAU grew in 2015 by 17%. Admittedly, this is an amazing annual growth rate but please allow me to express my doubts regarding this figure: In the third quarter of 2013, then Facebook CFO, David Ebersman, admitted that the company was seeing a decline in the amount teenagers using the social network. Back then the rate for teens abandoning Facebook was estimated to be a million per year. A demographic report from 2014 made by iStrategyLabs went further than that and even suggested that 11 million young people left Facebook between the years 2011-2014. That report suggests that the average rate of youngsters leaving Facebook is more than 3.5 million per year in the US alone. A UK study on Social Media among youngsters conducted by UCL Professor Daniel Miller concluded that "Facebook is basically dead and buried. Mostly they feel embarrassed even to be associated with it." One can debate whether trends in the US and UK among youngsters "leak" into the rest of the world straight away or with a time lag, but it is a popular trend and therefore worth keeping it at the back of one's mind. Concerns have been expressed at a recent GlobalWebIndex survey which claimed that in Q3 2015 only 34% of Facebook users updated their status and only 37% shared their own photos, a decline from 50% and 59% in the previous year. Until 2015 Facebook defined Daily Active Users as follows: "We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, on a given day." It practically means that Facebook counted people as daily active users when logged into third-party apps and websites that are integrated with Facebook and those people who just clicked "like" on a website page or article but never actually visited Facebook. These elements alone are enough to massively inflate numbers of Daily Active Users. In 2015 Facebook amended the definition of DAU to include only users who logged into Facebook or its messenger app at least once a day. Logic dictates that the immediate consequence should have been a sharp drop in DAU. Instead we see a sharp rise of 17%. This does not ring true. Facebook's current rapid growth stands out. But it is growth normally only seen in the early years of start-ups. Facebook is no longer the young brash start-up company it was. It is more than a decade old large and well-established corporate giant. As such, it should be growing at a much slower pace than it does currently. The Beneish M-score is a model designed to detect earnings manipulations. The variables of the model are constructed from the company's financial statements. The score they deliver describes the degree to which earnings have been manipulated. M-Score of greater than -2.22 signals that the company is likely an accounting manipulator. When running the model on Facebook's financials, the resulted M-score signals that Facebook is likely to have manipulated its earnings between Q3 2014 and Q3 2015. All the points mentioned above may be part of Facebook's attempt to deal in a creative manner with ongoing troubles and woes such as: intense pressure to prove that its monetization plan for Instagram and Whatsapp is working well, its decreasing popularity, the expected stagnation of active users growth rates, the growing number of software and mobile apps designed to block ads, the rising scope of fake online activity on Facebook's platform and the threatening loss of marketers. Whether those creative tricks will still deliver fabulous results in the future is uncertain. Currently, the only thing that remains certain is the old adage: "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
