IBM's Opportunity In The Telecom Industry And Rivalry With Intel - International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) | Seeking Alpha IBM has a bright future in cloud and big data, especially in the telecommunications sector. Recently IBM announced that it is taking the charge of AT&T’s cloud business. IBM has built a robust cloud and big data ecosystem, which could limit even Intel’s data center growth. In a recent development , IBM (NYSE: IBM ) is taking the charge of AT&T's (NYSE: T ) cloud based managed hosting and application services business. The assets associated with the services will be included in IBM's cloud portfolio. This is in line with IBM's telecom strategy. Philip Guido, IBM General Manager of Global Technology Services for North America, said: Today's announcement represents an expansion of our strategic relationship with AT&T and continuing collaboration to deliver new innovative solutions. Working with AT&T, we will deliver a robust set of IBM Cloud and managed services that can continuously evolve to meet clients' business objectives. Telecom operators are expanding their focus on cloud, analytics and mobility like never before. For IBM this is a tremendous growth opportunity with its solution labs, research labs and innovation centers. In this article I will dig deeper in IBM's telecom business. Why AT&T Is Transferring Facilities And Hosting Divisions? IBM will acquire AT&T's equipment and access its data centers where the equipment are installed. AT&T (like many other big telcos) is offloading some of its non-core assets for paying off debt and raising funds for investments. This is a new trend traditional telecom operators are following. The telecom industry is witnessing a host of challenges, such as competitive pressure, mature markets, adapting to rapid technological changes and proliferation of product offerings. To cope with the situation, major operators are restructuring their business by bringing a meaningful shift in their operations. The shift primarily involves sharing similar tasks and selling data centers. This is what AT&T is also doing. Let's first focus on IBM's telecom strategy. IBM is targeting the CSPs (communication service providers), such as telecom operators, cable service providers, satellite broadcasting operators, content and applications service providers and cloud service providers, to help them generate revenue from the big data value chain. Internal telecom data combined with third-party data has tremendous potential that CSPs can exploit to drive their revenues with the help of advanced analytics. Third-party data include data from various social media like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). As I said above, the challenges telcos are facing today are resulting in softer revenue growth and decreasing profit margin. The only way to boost revenue growth and profit margin is adopting business-focused big data initiatives. Well, what is a business-focused big data initiative? The answer is building customer focus and improving operational efficiencies for expanding revenue and profitability via prudent use of big data analytics and other solutions. However, directly selling customer data to third parties, such as private companies and government agencies, is risky due to privacy issues. IBM's analytics solutions like Watson Analytics help telecom operators generate richer insights from internal and third-party data and develop new capabilities and business models leveraging the data. IBM's cloud-based services and APIs help telcos offer customers analytics-as-a-service. This is a nascent business opportunity with meaningful revenue growth potential for telcos. I would recommend investors to watch this video to better understand how big data analytics can boost revenue of communication service providers as well as establish new revenue streams. In addition to Watson Analytics, IBM's solution for Hadoop also helps telcos extract insights from the wealth of data they are sitting on. The solution, which uses Linux-based IBM Power8 server, is a reference architecture that offers CSPs a robust infrastructure for their big data workload. The x86-based servers powered by Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Xeon E5/E7 processor families offer telcos reliable solutions to meet the challenges they face. For example, Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL ) x86-based servers are widely used in the telecom industry. The company has stable customer-base in business analytics for big data. Earlier this year Oracle introduced its new application server for CSPs, which supports NFV (network functions virtualization) and SDN (software-defined networks) enabled networks. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also offers a host of big data services via its Azure cloud platform. Although business intelligence including analytics and Hadoop running on Intel's x86-based processors is the defacto standard for telcos today, IBM's big data solutions are fast displacing this industry standard. Realizing this, Intel and Oracle teamed up recently against IBM to drive customers away from IBM's Power Systems toward Oracle's Engineered Systems. Major telcos like AT&T and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) are performing well on sourcing and analyzing data on x86 platform. But as far as acting on the analysis is concerned, such as developing new capabilities and business models, IBM's solutions are capable of offering superior outcomes. The advantage of IBM's solutions lies in the following two factors: Since IBM's Watson Analytics supports natural language, it saves time with less daunting learning curve. As a result, it's capable of delivering superior outcomes. Telcos can customize IBM's Solution for Hadoop specifically to meet their workloads by selecting the optimal combination of CPU and storage, which isn't possible on the traditional x86-based infrastructure. In addition to the above points, IBM's full-blown ecosystem covering hardware, software and mobility makes it the most versatile big data solutions provider. IBM's Power servers are fast emerging as the most sought after servers for businesses that use IBM's big data solutions because of the ecosystem advantage. Power servers use the Power8 chip with up to 12 cores per socket. The SMT8 technology helps the chip support 8 threads per core, which is four times than what Intel can offer. For running big data workloads, the Power8 architecture is more suitable for telecom operators. These are the reasons why AT&T has chosen IBM for managing its cloud based hosting and application services business. Intel's networking venture jointly with its partners like Oracle will result in significant revenue growth for its data center business. Intel's data center revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% in the next three to five years with its strong reference architecture. I shared my views about Intel's reference architecture in another article . However, with IBM appearing in the scenario, Intel's competitive advantage in the data center business may not rise significantly going forward. I believe long-term investors focusing on cloud and big data should own the shares of both IBM and Intel. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
