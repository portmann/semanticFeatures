Prospects For Facebook's Payments Business - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook's payments business revenue has plateaued as the user base transitions to mobile. Desktop gaming is an indicator that payments revenue will continue to stagnate in the short run. Zyna's revenue from Facebook has declined from 94% in Q4 2011 to 37% in Q1 2015. Facebook can move to a transaction fee model with mobile payments in its messaging app. When we last looked at Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) payments business we predicted that revenue would plateau as more of its user base transitioned to mobile usage. We made this deduction by observing the trend in payments revenue and ARPU in Asia and rest of world regions, where platform usage is mobile-first or mobile-only. We can now conclude that payments revenue has plateaued as Facebook continues its structural shift to mobile. Further, by using games revenue as an indicator we can deduce that payments revenue will remain flat or decline in the short run. Payments revenue in Q1 2015 was $226 million, a decline of 5% over the year-ago quarter. According to the company, the year-over-year decrease in payments revenue resulted from a decline in revenue (including in-app transaction revenue) from games played on Facebook on desktop computers. Games revenue makes up materially all of Facebook's payments revenue, so it serves as a strong proxy for the viability of the payments business. The downward trend in games revenue has been acknowledged by Facebook in successive earnings calls since Q3 2014 , and it is reflected in flat revenue for payments. The stagnation of payments revenue is not necessarily the result of reduced interest in games on Facebook. Rather, it is the result of the shift to mobile consumption by Facebook's users . Mobile MAUs in the first quarter of 2015 increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to 1.25B users. Mobile-only usage (i.e. those users that hire Facebook exclusively on mobile devices) increased 10.5% over the year-ago quarter to 581M. Facebook does not provide data on desktop usage, but the company noted that revenue from advertisements served on desktop was down 4% from a year ago. We can better understand the decline in desktop usage and the consequent stagnation of payments revenue by using Zynga's (NASDAQ: ZNGA ) revenue as a proxy. Zynga's in-app transaction revenue has historically comprised the bulk of payments revenue on Facebook's desktop platform. On mobile that revenue is generally apportioned to the iOS and Android app stores, where in-app transactions are processed at the operating system level. As mobile supplants the desktop, the segment of Zynga's revenue from in-app transactions on Facebook has declined from a 94% of total revenue in Q4 2011 to only 37% in Q1 2015. The decline reflects the consequence of mobile adoption among users on both platforms. We can observe the effects of this downward trend through the lens of Facebook's average revenue per user (ARPU) for payments. Payments ARPU is flat or down sequentially and year-over-year in all regions. For example, Europe region saw a 26.1% decline in payments over the year-ago quarter. Aside from a one-time accounting recognition in Q4 2012, ARPU has remained unchanged or in decline in spite of significant sequential user base growth in Facebook's developing regions. This is unsurprising because most of Facebook's developing region growth is exclusive to the mobile platform, where Facebook does not accrue payments revenue. Despite the stagnation of the payments business, pundits continue to opine about Facebook's eventual participation in mobile payments. The pervasiveness of smart devices and the promise of mobile commerce supported by big data is an enticing narrative. Facebook's acquisitions in Instagram and WhatsApp continue to enjoy strong adoption. The latter entrenches Facebook's position in a number of emerging markets. Facebook has enjoyed comparable growth in its own messaging application, which it treats as a separate platform. Together, these platforms offer Facebook a robust foundation from which to enter mobile payments. Facebook has made some attempt to participate in mobile payments. The company recently launched a money transfer protocol in its messaging application. The new feature allows US users to transfer dollars from linked debit cards. Facebook does not currently take a transaction fee. Profitability in mobile transactions is achieved only at scale. If the feature is widely adopted by users then Facebook can transition to a fee-based transaction model. The company has stoked speculation to this effect by hiring David Marcus from PayPal to work on its messaging platform. It is likely that Facebook's messaging application will reach a sufficient scale to allow it to move a transaction fee model. The question is whether Facebook is actually interested in building the secondary revenue stream. The quarter-over-quarter stagnation of its payments business might suggest that Facebook is contented with its advertising revenue. However, the company has recently shown interest in mobile commerce by it business-to-customer connection efforts in Messenger. Furthermore, the WhatsApp subscription model also promises to increase payments revenue, particularly in emerging markets. The standalone platform generated $15.9M in the six months ending Q2 2014. Despite the low hanging fruit of a mobile payments business, the company is guiding down revenue from payments for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. As Facebook's mobile user base continues to grow, the company focuses its attention on mobile advertising. Even at scale Facebook remains at a comparative disadvantage to mobile operating systems at in-app transaction processing. The applications being delivered to users via Facebook's app install ads tend to rely on the operating system's more robust payments infrastructure. Facebook's position in the application layer of the software stack hampers its competitiveness. Therefore, in the short run we should expect advertising to continue to comprise the bulk of Facebook's revenue and payments revenue to remain unchanged or in decline.
