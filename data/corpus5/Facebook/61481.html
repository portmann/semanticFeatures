ETF Hub May 18 2015, 19:11 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "We think that enabling that [business-to-consumer] messaging has good business potential for us ... As we learn those things, I think there’s going to be opportunities to bring some of those things to WhatsApp, but that’s more longer-term than the near-term," said Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) CFO Dave Wehner at a JPMorgan conference. Facebook is less than 2 months removed from launching ( as part of Messenger's app platform) Businesses on Messenger , a solution that allows online retailers and other businesses to communicate with Messenger users via live chats and alerts. Nothing similar has been announced yet for WhatsApp, which has taken a minimalist approach to its apps and has been adamant about refusing to sell ads. Separately, The Information reports is talking with game developers about bringing game support (offered by many rival messaging platforms) to Messenger's app platform. The talks are said to come amid muted early adoption for 3rd-party Messenger apps, with developers complaining app discovery is difficult. Facebook's options for monetizing Messenger games could be limited on iOS, where Apple acts as a gatekeeper for all app installs and gets a 30% cut on related in-app purchases; one possibility is for Facebook to get a referral fee for installs, much as it does for its app install ads. The company might have more flexibility to monetize games on Android, where 3rd-party app distribution is allowed. Is there news here? It sounds from the body of the post that FB doesn't have any idea how to make money on Whatsapp (do not forget it paid $20 billion dollars for it) and the Messenger junk seems awfully small fry, especially in regards to profits that could be made from it. FB stock has had a large run, good job monetizing mobile, the next perhaps with major upside was recently selected by Facebook to create a video app for FB Messenger, KEK.V in Toronto, its U. S. tracking stock is KEEKF for those who can't buy Canadian stocks.  Nearly 1B ad impressions per month, its monetization efforts have been fully implemented now, low cash burn and tiny market cap.  Keek reported it's in negotiations with "a strategic investor who wants a controlling interest" -- news should come soon about Keek's near-term plans.  It reports earnings June 30, fiscal year is March 1.  I'm long of Keek of course. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
