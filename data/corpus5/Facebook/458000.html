Apple Watch Is Best In Customer Satisfaction Among Smartwatch Owners Says J.D. Power - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Customer satisfaction is rated highest among smartwatches for the Apple Watch. Fitbit ranks low for both smartwatches and fitness trackers. "Apple ranks highest among manufacturers of smartwatches, and Samsung ranks highest among manufacturers of fitness band devices, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Fitness Band Device Satisfaction Report and J.D. Power 2016 Smartwatch Device Satisfaction Report both released today." That was the news overnight delivered most favorably to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the Apple Watch fans and Apple shareholders. While this is obviously not earth-shattering news for the Apple Watch, Fitbit's (NYSE: FIT ) Blaze or Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Gear Fit, it certainly speaks favorably for the Apple Watch device in terms of consumer satisfaction. Investors should also recognize the survey conducted by J.D. Power on behalf of their constituency has nothing to do with sales and everything to do with consumer satisfaction. But that was likely designed by the survey. The problem with most surveys lay within the human element and the intended or unintended bias created through the interaction with the survey. I sometimes find it comical when I'm asked the question as to what the margin of error is within the survey. It's comical because the margin of error, based on human engagement, is literally infinite. Any surveyor can construct a survey to elicit any outcome they desire. Moreover, let's take a look at the survey results from J.D. Power & Associates, keeping in mind of course that these are the same guys that gave Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) numerous customer satisfaction awards over the years and through the scandal that broke back in 2015 regarding Volkswagen emissions falsification. Wolfsburg/Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 2015 - The respected American market research institute J.D. Power named the Volkswagen up! the winner in the "Supermini" category of this year's customer satisfaction survey. Thomas Zahn, Head of Sales and Marketing Germany of the Volkswagen passenger cars brand, accepted the prize this evening at the International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt. I don't even desire to get into J.D. Power & Associates awards and recognition offered to General Motors (NYSE: GM ) over the years and through the company's many failures pertaining to safety and overall quality. No more digression, onto the firm's survey as noted in the first chart of statistical findings. The survey's first consideration was with regards to fitness bands, which by and large have demonstrated greater market adoption than has the smartwatch. While Fitbit dominates this segment of the wearables category, garnering 85% of sales in Q1 2016, according to NPD Group data, the company's devices rate among the least favorite with regards to customer satisfaction. I had alerted investors of this issue in the past and as it pertains to Fitbit device users. In addition to a lack of differentiated revenue streams, Fitbit products continue to exhibit elevated return rates at existing retail chains. The Fitbit business has witnessed increasing return to vendors (RTV) as new products enter the marketplace as is to be expected and presently of limited concern due in part to consistent expansion efforts that generate revenue growth. However, at a current warranty reserve rate equal to 2% of revenues, Capital Ladder Advisory Group expects this metric to increase over the next 12-month period and impact profits to a greater degree. As defined by many warranty claims tracked through RTV receipts, most replacement issues are due to band breakage and/or connectivity failures. For the everyday tracking of warranty related issues, the Fitbit Facebook social media community identifies this subject of concern with a near 80% " Visitor Post " rate. (Rate not including promotion content) Unfortunately, while Fitbit does sell a great many fitness trackers and smart fitness watches, the numerous returns have already forced the company to increase their warranty reserve rate. The signs of things to come for Fitbit or any consumer-centric company are always available for investors to discover, it's just a matter of experience and devoting the time to discovery. As one can clearly identify in the results for fitness band customer satisfaction, Apple's Apple Watch doesn't participate. Even though the watch does have fitness capabilities and in great quantity, the surveyors decided the device should only participate in the smartwatch segment of the survey, hence the discovery of initial bias. Not so relevant in my opinion, however, and for this particular consideration. In the chart above, we see where the Apple Watch shines with regards to customer satisfaction and against the competition. 2,696 customers were surveyed who owned an Apple Watch over the last 12 months. In doing so, J.D. Power & Associates created the parameters for the survey or the intended sample size bias. Also identifiable in the survey for smartwatch customer satisfaction and like with fitness bands, Fitbit ranked near the bottom for customer satisfaction. The point differential from top to bottom isn't all that much on the surface, as it represents a small number of survey questions. Think of it in terms of the public school grading scale. If you miss 2 questions out of 10, you already find yourself with a grade of B. The takeaway from the survey and subsequent Apple Watch award is… well, quite meaningless other than the survey's ability to drive public relations for Apple. In discussing the survey results with a member of J.D. Power, I had the following dialogue: Seth Golden: What was the return rate you guys found in your survey? J.D. Power: That wasn't part of the survey. Seth Golden: What were the search results for the various product's surveyed? J.D. Power: Also not something we developed in the survey. But here is the biggest… issue with the J.D. Power & Associates survey be it this particular one or any of them. For J.D. Power & Associates, the surveys are not about knowledge, but about money. The surveys aren't conducted so the results exists for the sake of existing, they are conducted for the money that it brings J.D. Power & Associates. Companies pay J.D. Power upwards of $100,000 for this customer survey exercise and data compiling. If companies like Apple, Samsung, General Motors, Ford (NYSE: F ), etc., didn't pay for these surveys, they would not take place. The survey results help manufacturers design and sell products that consumers want and shows them how consumers feel about products already being sold to consumers. Apple, Samsung, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) have all paid for this data for years. Fitbit nor Jawbone pay J.D. Power & Associates for this data. Fitbit has another source of customer sales and satisfaction survey data, the NPD Group. Earlier in this publication, I offered that 85% of wearable sales for Q1 2016 were for Fitbit devices… 85 percent!! Most recently, NPD Group offered a new survey/report that positioned fitness trackers as a more favorable device among the activity tracker community when compared to smartwatch users. Seventy-nine percent of activity tracker users exercise on a regular basis, compared to 66 percent of smartwatch users, according to NPD Connected Intelligence So Fitbit pays NPD Group for sales and customer data and NPD Group delivers a favorable sales picture for Fitbit activity tracker products. Apple pays for surveys produced by J.D. Power & Associates as well as other data providers and receives top ratings in customer satisfaction surveys, even with declining sales for the device after less than 12 months of Apple Watch existence. I'm not saying that a bias is being exhibited from either of these data and survey operators; I'm simply identifying relationships and juxtaposing them with survey outcomes. Having said all of that, if we look at real-time customer ratings on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), we come to find that with or without an assumed surveyor bias, the consumer still rates the Apple Watch higher than Fitbit's Blaze product for customer satisfaction. However, where it is likely more relevant to AAPL and FIT investors, Fitbit is leading in unit sales through the e-commerce channel, at least. This is of course a fact and easily reviewable. The Fitbit Blaze has more than twice the number of reviews as the Apple Watch and is ranked as the best seller in the smartwatch category. The Fitbit Blaze has only been on the market for 3 months as well. Lastly, the Fitbit Blaze overtook Apple Watch as the sales leader on Amazon.com after only two weeks of sales. This is black and white, direct consumer reaction to these products in the market for every given day and without bias. For more understanding of just how poorly the Apple Watch or any smartwatch has actually sold through retailers, take a look at Target's (NYSE: TGT ) Q3 and Q4 2015 earnings call transcript, which specifically speaks to any strength in its electronics sales being tied directly to fitness tracker sales. Nothing stated about the Apple Watch or any smartwatch. Again, this is from an unbiased party that simply desires to sell what sells. These surveys offer the companies more data to play with than they offer investors anything of relevance. The Apple Watch has been recognized very widely as offering less potential to the whole of Apple's reporting metrics than originally assumed. More importantly, Capital Ladder Advisory Group point of sale and return to vendor data offers that the Apple Watch has the highest rate of return for any Apple consumer electronics product. In previous articles, I have also showed how appalling the Apple Watch sales had been. Again, real time sales data is without the existence of bias whereas surveys can and often do have intrinsic bias whether we desire it to exist or not. To reiterate, the J.D. Power survey results are noteworthy with regards to customer satisfaction, but unfortunately have no bearing on sales and offer no construct for identifying returns of product to the vendor. It's quite easy to look at headlines and judge them for efficacy or truth. I hardly ever assume the validity of a headline and always dive deeper into the subject matter. For those who read my analysis on the potential iPhone 8 curved glass subject matter, this is well understood. The article received great readership and even found itself to be quoted and recommended in a recent Forbes publication . In short, initial headlines for the iPhone 8 curved glass positioned the product to be the next great iPhone, but none of the coverage offered the complexities of utilizing curved glass or the fact that this was already pulled back by Apple in years past. Akin to my deeper dive into the iPhone 8 possibilities, I hope investors and readers have a better understanding of not only the survey process but what is being gathered in the survey and to whom it possibly benefits. As we head into earnings season, investors should better consider that the Apple Watch has been contributing the majority of "Other" category sales since the product launched in 2015. In Q3 of 2015, the Other category generated $2.6 billion in revenues for Apple, growing almost 50% YOY and 56% sequentially. In the most recently reported quarter , Other sales generated $2.189 billion, growing 30% YOY but declining 50% sequentially. With Apple Watch 2 launching in the coming months, we'll have to see how the Other category sales have performed since the last reporting cycle. Apple has continued to keep unit sales of the Apple Watch from the investor public. The company's actions concerning the watch, however, indicate sales have been less than anticipated. This sentiment is supported with price cuts for the device and improvements that better align the product to support greater utility among the health and wellness community. The Apple Watch 2 will likely show itself to have greater utility and improve Other category sales sequentially when the product launches. With the incorporation of WiFi in Apple Watch 2, the device should appeal to a broader demographic of consumers and retailers. Having said that, it still lacks the utility that would find it to be a replacement to the iPhone. As such, iPhone sales will still contribute to the bulk of Apple's sales and earnings for the foreseeable future. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
