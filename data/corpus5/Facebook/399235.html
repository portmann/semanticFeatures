An Objective Look And Valuation Of Twitter - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitter is a good business, with a lot of exciting prospects. It is not yet profitable, not even close to it. Its main assets are its MAUs, and I propose a valuation model for it that yields reasonable results. Tying MAU valuation with revenue and assets (minus total debt) gives us a good idea of Twitter's fair value. Twitter is ranging from fairly valued to overvalued territory, and currently is experiencing a negative trend. Short sellers can take advantage of this. The intention of this post is to provide a sober and unbiased analysis on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and its valuation. I preface this by disclosing I'm short Twitter via options, and that I would only write about something in which I have a position. Regardless of yours (long, short, sidelines), I sincerely hope the following piece is useful to you. Twitter's business model is to monetize as much of that public self-expression and conversation as possible. And the truth is that Twitter is getting increasingly good at it, as you can see in the following figure: Source: Twitter 2016 Q1 Earnings Slides - V4 It's been able to get more ads on the site, charge more for those ads, and the cost per ad has been decreasing consistently. It is a fantastic achievement and very promising. Also it ranks among the most visited social media sites in the US after Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Reddit as of March 2016. Source: Priit Kallas, DreamGrow, March 2016 So, at a glance, Twitter might look like the best social media investment you could possibly make at this moment. However, I'd like to bring the reader's attention to the fact the social media business comes down to: 1) Growing Monthly Average Users (MAUs). It's as straight forward as it comes. Twitter's revenue mainly comes from advertising, in fact about 90% of it. The remainder 10% stems from Data Licensing. This proportion has been holding steady since its IPO. I'll focus mainly on advertising revenue for the purposes of this article. Source: Earnings releases from Twitter plus own elaboration Well, first we should compare it to the social media giant Facebook. In its last quarter, Facebook grew its MAUs at 4% and reached 1.65 billion. Its advertising revenues topped $5.2 billion, which works to about $3.20 per MAU. It's worth noting that Facebook already is hitting saturation in some of its demographics. Twitter on the other hand grew its MAUs at 2% and reached 310 million users. Its advertising revenues topped $531 million, which works to about $1.7 per MAU. However, given Twitter's size, one would expect growth to be accelerating, not slowing down (or stalling), which seems to be the case. Source: Earnings releases from Facebook and Twitter plus author's forecast It's worth noting that in Twitter's case, its costs of goods sold (COGS) aren't increasing as fast as its revenue, which would bolster a bullish stance on the stock. This is probably because it has to buy servers and not necessarily build new infrastructure. Nonetheless, once you add the selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) - namely salaries and executive compensation - including stock-based compensation - then it becomes a losing proposition. This is a completely operational look for Twitter, no interest expense or taxes taken into account. However, I did add back stock-based compensation because it represents a form of SG&A that although it's not a cash expense (and therefore doesn't appear on the income or free cash flow calculations), it is money shareholders pay to its executives in the form of share price dilution. "The stock-based compensation may not represent cash but it is so only because the company has used a barter system to evade the cash flow effect. Put differently, if the company had issued the options and restricted stock (that it was planning to give employees) to the market and then used the cash proceeds to pay employees, we would have treated it as a cash expenseâ€¦ We have to hold equity compensation to a different standard than we do non-cash expenses like depreciation, and be less cavalier about adding them back. - NYU Professor Aswath Damodaran Sadly, it seems that Twitter is employing accounting tricks (see GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, page 16 ) that may mislead investors into believing it's profitable. Truth be told, it's far from it, because its executives and key talent won't work for free. In fact it's extremely expensive. This cost isn't covered from a loan, or the proceeds from advertising revenue, but from the shareholders' pockets in the form of share dilution. And the market will continue to reflect this on Twitter's declining stock price. Twitter has a monstrous amount of stock-based compensation (SBC) since 2012 this figure has totaled over $2 billion. As of today, Twitter's market cap is just over $10 billion. The aggregate SBC represents 20% of its valuation, which is a complete insanity. There is a silver lining in favor of Twitter because it seems to be cutting its operational costs and squeezing its MAUs for revenue to the very last drop. Still, remember that it has to pay taxes (if it ever becomes profitable) and interest expenses, which again sets the company into steeper losses. Depending on which quarterly release you read, growth numbers vary, suggesting misleading intentions. Source: Twitter's earnings slides Q1 2016 and Q4 2015 If we compare Twitter's MAU growth to Facebook's, it is clear that TWTR is starting to lag behind on social media. At any rate, it's not growing as fast as Facebook (which might be approaching saturation). This is a little alarming for Twitter. Source: Earnings releases from Twitter and Facebook plus own elaboration The company needs to extract as much cash from its MAUs as it can: On this front, Twitter seems to be stepping up its game. Still, if you compare what advertisers are willing to pay per MAUs on Facebook ($3.20 per MAU) vs. what they're willing to pay on Twitter ($1.70 per MAU), you see clearly that FB is definitely doing better. There are lots of reasons for this, but all point to the same conclusion sellers get more out of publicity on Facebook than on Twitter. But for the sake of argument, let's assume that Twitter could demand the premium per MAUs that Facebook does from its advertisers. If so, results would have been similar to the ones shown in the following figure. Note: If Twitter was able to demand this kind of premium, I wouldn't mind paying $10 per share for TWTR, but then again that's a big if. Source: Twitter's earnings releases and own elaboration On a side note, in my opinion, there is some room for improvement in Twitter's ability to extract additional premium from its MAUs. However, I doubt it will reach Facebook's level any time soon (i.e. in the next 3-5 years). The reality is that competition is fierce in social media advertising, and whatever ground Facebook gained, it most likely took it away from its competitors. Look at it this way, if in 10 years Facebook becomes the Coca-Cola of social media, do you really think Twitter is going to be PepsiCo? If the answer is no, then Twitter will most likely just get bought out in the end and nobody can predict when and at what price. From my point of view, this would be the best-case scenario for shareholders, but that's material for another article. It seems Twitter has hit the wall on its cost cutting, and it's not profitable yet. Even if it would cut costs by another 20%, it would barely come close to profitability. And even then, remember there would be taxes at some point (if it ever does become profitable), so from this angle Twitter is performing very poorly. There are simply a lot of "ifs" on this front. Source: Twitter's earnings releases and own elaboration Most of its costs come from stock-based compensation (SBC) - this is what mainly dictates net income. The problem is the moment management cuts compensation beyond a certain point, it has to increase its SG&A expenses, which in turn would further damage its EPS. And then the stock would take an even bigger hit. Source: Twitter's earnings releases and own elaboration There are three components to valuing Twitter at this point: earnings, revenues and assets. Earnings: There are none, if you look at GAAP figures. It hasn't been profitable since the IPO. Revenues: Here's Twitter's strongest point, and 90% driven by advertising. It's composed by the following: Monthly Active Users (MAUs): Last quarter, it logged 310 million MAUs and $1.92 in advertising revenues per MAU. Growth: It's starting to lag behind social media competitors (such as Facebook); last quarter it grew just over 2% QoQ. Assets: Here's the "easy" part, we just have to go look at the last quarter's balance sheet. Earnings: If it becomes profitable in the future is another story, and that's priced on its revenues. In the following figure, I construct a normal distribution graph for my valuations. I use the mean of $14.54 and a minimum of $11.50. Its purpose is to help the reader visualize the possible price ranges of my assessments about Twitter. Twitter may be a fantastic company with pretty nice prospects for the future. But, as investors, we need to look at the cold hard numbers and not be deceived by empty promises and high hopes. In this order, I come to the conclusion that Twitter has about an 80% chance to trend below $15.15 in the long term (see graph above). Shorting it for the remainder of the year could prove very profitable (just mind borrowing costs and entry-exit points), with targets ranging between $10.50 and $14.00 a share. In the short term, we can try riding the present negative trend, after last quarter's disappointing earnings results and expect lower lows. For those long this stock, I'd advise a lot of caution, because when you buy Twitter, you're paying a huge mark-up for hope.
