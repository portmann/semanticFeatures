Facebook Stock: Buy On The Pullback - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Spending control impressive in high growth industry. While earnings season is not close to over yet, I think we can give the award for the best quarter to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). The company's fourth quarter results smashed expectations on the top and bottom line, sending the stock to a new all-time high. Most impressive, Facebook has been able to grow revenues at a strong clip while keeping expenses fairly in check. With the stock now above my previous target , I'm raising my price target to $130. Facebook had nearly $18 billion in full year revenues despite a more than $1.1 billion hit from currencies. While Facebook's percentage growth may slow down as the company faces much higher base numbers, the chart below shows the impressive growth picture that makes this name not only a technology sector leader, but an overall market one. The item that impressed me the most is Facebook's cost control. After originally guiding for 2015 non-GAAP expense growth of 50-70%, the company came in around 51%. Most new tech firms aren't known for keeping spending habits in check, but Facebook has done a great job, allowing earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to soar. At the Q4 2014 report, the company was projected for $1.92 in non-GAAP EPS for 2015, and Facebook delivered $2.28. As a result, we've seen a dramatic increase in non-GAAP EPS estimates for this year, seen below. I believe that 2016 will be the year where Instagram really takes off for Facebook. Sheryl Sandberg mentioned that 98 of Facebook's top 100 advertisers are now also advertising on Instagram. Brand Networks also believes that Instagram impressions could top 1 billion per month by the end of Q1 2016, which would be almost double what was seen in Q4 2015. Instagram ads are also fetching 21% more than they were in the prior year period. Instagram could pass 500 million monthly active users in 2016, which would give it a user base more than 50% higher than Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). It has also been reported that Twitter's former VP of Product, Kevin Weil, is joining Instagram. As the mass exodus of executives at Twitter continues, Facebook is first in line to grab some top talent. One item that didn't get a lot of attention was Facebook's balance sheet and cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was more than $6 billion, so the company ended the year with more than $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents. In recent years, Facebook used a lot of stock when it made acquisitions, but a strong cash position could limit how much equity is used in future deals. While the company's share count is still rising by the quarter, keeping the count as low as possible could have a meaningful impact to earnings per share figures. Facebook's cash position is so strong currently that it could buy Twitter and GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) for a decent sized premium and still have cash left over. When looking at valuation, I've compared Facebook against Twitter, LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Facebook currently goes for 35.7 times expected 2016 non-GAAP EPS, while the average of the other three names is 35.5 times. Facebook is growing much faster than Alphabet and LinkedIn currently, and has more impressive user base growth than Twitter. A premium valuation of 40 times seems appropriate, and at $3.25 in non-GAAP EPS (Street average is currently $3.14), you get a $130 target. It was certainly another strong quarter for Facebook, as the company smashed even the most bullish expectations. You won't find many companies of this size growing at these rates, while trading at a valuation comparable to many peers. With Instagram's growth continuing to explode, Facebook should continue to see revenues and non-GAAP EPS soar to new highs. While I'm raising my price target to $130 today, the chart below shows how investors do best when buying the stock at or below the 50-day moving average. Those buying on the next pullback will likely be rewarded, like those who bought prior to earnings during the recent market panic. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
