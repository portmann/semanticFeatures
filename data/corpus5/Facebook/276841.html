ETF Hub Dec 30 2015, 04:43 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet has certified two shareholder class actions accusing Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) of hiding concerns about its growth forecasts prior to its initial public offering in May 2012. The ruling means retail and institutional investors who assert they lost money by purchasing shares at inflated prices may pursue their claims as groups. Facebook made its market debut on May 18, 2012 at $38 a share, but its stock price fell to $17.55 on Sept. 4, 2012 and stayed below the IPO price for more than a year.
