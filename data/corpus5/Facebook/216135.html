Facebook: Whatsapp And Messenger Don't Compete - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha I address a key misconception about Facebook that I believe will lead to hugely positive EPS estimate revisions in the future. I also believe that because of this catalyst, and several others outlined, Facebook is much cheaper than it appears on full-year 2016 expectations. Taking a levered long position in Facebook currently is a bet that at least one of its catalysts works out - historically that bet has paid out big. I think currently the hardest variable to value within the Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) ecosystem is messaging. The long-term and potentially far-reaching implications of Facebook having success via its messaging vertical are incredible and that can lead to sensationalism if leaned into. Sensationalism that Wall Street as well as anybody writing about Facebook wants to avoid. Once branded an irrational "pom-pom" waver it's a hard title to shake. But, is it fair that analysts have had to be so measured in pricing in any level of success to the Facebook financials? I don't think it is. I mean, to say that the level of success that "messaging" at Facebook can experience, inclusive of both Whatsapp and Messenger, could be model altering is to put it mildly. If M develops to the extent Facebook is intending, my bet is on this coming to fruition, and if societal communication trends don't completely pivot to a new direction messaging could be equally as lucrative as the core Facebook platform. Yes, that big. But before you disregard this opining as the overzealous hopes of an investor long $87.50 JAN 20 2017 CALL options (at $9.60), break out exactly what messaging is, what it does for Facebook, and what it could be. The key concept to grasp and one that I grasped in leading me to my purchase of long-dated CALL options is that Whatsapp and Messenger don't compete. Not at all. Nor will they ever. That's huge. Why's it so huge? Two reasons. First, Wall Street for some reason thinks the two platforms compete and by way of that cannibalize each other (pull a report on Facebook from any of Wall Street houses that cover Facebook). Second, Wall Street doesn't realize the 1) funneling capacity that Whatsapp provides to Messenger and 2) that eventually Whatsapp will be killed off or folded into messenger (likely within the next 10 years). Whatsapp is essentially a farm team, customer aggregation engine for future Messenger users. Don't think that the eventual realization of all leads to some EPS growth being modeled into Facebook? I do. Being that Whatsapp is a data-light, (currently) low-feature, (currently) low-functionality app it's well suited for developing markets. This is something that Facebook has never been shy about. Why hasn't Whatsapp been built out further than it has? Because Facebook has a built out Whatsapp in Messenger. Messenger is the developed market, white glove competing solution to WeChat (which Messenger clearly aspires to be and is its largest and most formidable global competitor), etc. At least that's what Facebook is working towards before WeChat works towards the West. With the recent additions of M, Businesses on Messenger, and the overlay of Facebook at Work Messenger is appearing to be Facebook's marquee ecosystem product for enterprise capture. If you didn't know it, this is a hugely important market that Facebook is looking to capture. So, Messenger serves a sort of universal capture and retention function for all Facebook users but especially those that drive its advertising business - the non-consumer. Again, as global infrastructure constraints allow for it more and more users will be transitioned to Messenger from Whatsapp. Eventually, I believe (as stated above) Whatsapp is folded into Messenger entirely. Facebook is about user experience over everything. Messenger now and especially in the future will have a much better, much distinguished user experience. Not only this, but with Messenger's constantly evolving, constantly moving forward enterprise capacity (ecommerce, funds transfer tech, live customer service, concierge service via M, etc.) Messenger is the future portal for how businesses operate outside of brick and mortar. Facebook is quite literally making Messenger more important than flagship websites or apps. Yes, in the near-future it will be more important for an enterprise to have a capable Messenger team than to run a dot-com. Look no further than what WeChat is doing for examples of how this evolves over time. Again, a lucrative forward look that no analyst is pricing into forward looking Facebook EPS. But for now at least, above anything else, understand that the two platforms don't compete. They just don't. Whatsapp is the startup tech to the tech-giant's better tech. Whatsapp will be "acquired" by Messenger. If Wall Street viewed each as their own company I believe analysts would be pricing in a much different, much more lucrative earnings picture for full year 2017 (and soon to be full year 2018 estimates). Wasn't it doing this before Facebook acquired Whatsapp? Why did Facebook's acquisition suddenly change how Whatsapp was viewed and how it changed the Facebook model? In addition to this a legitimate related question can be asked in is Wall Street valuing M at all? Can it at this point? I don't think it is because I don't think it can. Again, this near-term change - Wall Street being able to value M - too should add to EPS estimates when forward looking. I guess the broader point to be made within this article is that when I view the spatial race to have the most capable and widely used communication platform, both on the private side and the public side, I have to look at Messenger as a stand-alone that isn't competing for the same function. For instance, Slack, Skype for Work, Hangouts, etc., are all wanting to help you perform a function or be more productive (consumer and non-consumer use cases). Messenger wants to be a platform. It wants to be an internet within an internet, a platform that you never exit. A platform where you can send a family member a happy birthday message followed by a $25 money transfer while checking with Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL ) to make sure the birthday shirt you ordered your family member is still on the way. That's fundamentally different in competition and in monetization capacity. With M, Messenger might not want you to have to do this at all. It might want its concierge to do all of this for you. So I caution against viewing Facebook's 2016 P/E at 37.2X and its 2016 FCF yield at 2.5%. Because I just don't think those figures will stand the test of time. I think when we reach 2016 full year conclusion that those estimates have been stepped up 50% or so. History would agree with me as this has been the case at Facebook dating back to 2014: As realizations come in substantially better, quarter after quarter, analysts will be forced to positively revise estimates higher and higher (as they have consistently as illustrated within the charts above). But what if they were revised higher today? What if Facebook's EPS expectation was, say, 50% higher than it is today and its P/E expectation substantially lower? Would that change the naysayer investment thesis? I think it most definitely would. History has shown us this will happen and never before would I have said that there are so many visible catalysts to drive forward looking outperformance. Whatsapp. M. Messenger buildout. Facebook at Work. So on and so on. Doesn't it make sense to just buy the estimates (and realizations) revisions to come now? It would have in the past. Taking a levered long portfolio position in Facebook currently is a bet that at least one catalyst on the board is successful. Maybe more than one but certainly not all. I believe that as bullish as analysts have been forced to be that there is still a very measured take on Facebook currently, leaving room to the upside from an analyst driven standpoint. Being levered long allows for a smaller capital outlay to participate in a bigger upside than taking a position in the common. It does this with more risk, potentially catastrophic risk if Facebook suffers a long-term setback, but again at a lower net risk per dollar than buying common (on an equal basis). I've done well (so far) being levered long Facebook and based on my expectation that EPS is consistently positively revised I would think others who initiate soon, prior to this happening, would stand to be positioned attractively as well.
