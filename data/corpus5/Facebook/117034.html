Netflix Investors Be Wary Of China's Potential Costs - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is expanding into the world's second-largest economy, China. Investors should not assume that this move will be beneficial for the company, however. There are a multitude of factors that can negatively impact Netflix in China going forward. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is a global entertainment powerhouse, boasting over 60 million subscribers in over 40 countries around the world. The firm has plans to enter several more markets in late 2015 and 2016, and recently announced its intentions to enter the Chinese marketplace. While many Netflix shareholders might be cheered by the news, as China is home to the world's third-largest entertainment market, there are some significant questions investors should ask themselves about Netflix's Chinese endeavor. How will Chinese consumers react to Netflix's model? The entertainment industry in China is largely dependent on advertising revenues. That is, the content itself is free, but there are advertisements to cover costs and make a profit. Netflix's business model, however, is not free. The company has different subscription plans at different rates, but all might fall victim to the same reality: China might not be receptive to a paid subscription service. And speaking of Chinese consumers, it's worthy of note that the Chinese middle class, the segment most likely to tune in to Netflix when it arrives, isn't exactly a huge part of Chinese society. Michael Pachter, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities, forecasts Netflix's total subscriber base in China to reach just 5 million to 7 million over several years, and said: You need to think of China as having a middle class that's roughly the same size of the entire U.S. It's growing, but not by more than single-digits (percentage range). The middle-class income there is about half of that in the U.S., and there's no indication that Netflix will charge less for its service in China. For a nation with a billion people, having a middle class roughly the same size as a nation with 300 million people is indicative of the challenges Netflix may face there. Perhaps the single biggest "question mark" about NFLX's Chinese adventures is how the government will respond. China's government is very controlling of media content and has outright banned Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) from operating in the country via the "Great Firewall of China." It's likely that the Chinese government would have to screen anything Netflix wants to show in the country, which is time-consuming and potentially costly to the company, especially if a film or TV show is censored. Compliance with China's labyrinth of red tape could decrease NFLX's profitability big time. Not only that, but also the Chinese government has a history of funding home-grown companies and competitors in a bid to maintain its tight control on content and increase Chinese innovation. Which leads me to the next question… Even if the company can successfully remain operational within China with relative freedom (and that is doubtful), there are several potential competitors that may undercut Netflix in China. Netflix needs to see strong growth in China to continue propping up its burgeoning share price, but that may become difficult if the likes of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Letv have anything to say about it. According to QZ.com: The Chinese internet behemoth Alibaba…has struck a deal with Lionsgate the production house behind the Hunger Games and Twilight young adult film franchises, and the iconic TV series Mad Men, for a subscription-based streaming television service in its home market…Alibaba has its finger in just about every pie in China. It's not just the country's Amazon, but also its Dropbox, PayPal, Uber, Hulu, ING Direct, and more. To that list we can now add Netflix. Alibaba has spent more than $3 billion since March on content initiatives, according to Reuters, as part of an aggressive push into home entertainment. This should be especially troubling news for Netflix, as Alibaba is the "jack-of-all-trades" Internet company in China, with big investments in Internet industries across the board. Alibaba has a huge head start on Netflix. While Netflix may be able to chip away at Alibaba's lead, BABA is heavily invested in the entertainment industry already and can most likely easily undercut Netflix through market competition. But Alibaba could be the least of Netflix's concerns in China. Letv is also a big player in the Chinese entertainment scene, and as Wired Magazine reports: When I describe Letv as the Netflix of China, Mark Li corrects me. "It's the other way around," he says. "Netflix is the Letv of the US." He has a point. Letv launched its Internet video streaming service three years before Netflix (2004 versus 2007). It was producing original movies and series long before Netflix rolled out House of Cards . And in recent years, the Chinese behemoth has expanded in ways Netflix hasn't: It sells TV settop boxes and smart TVs-devices that can help you watch all that video. "We want to control the screens too," says Li, the ex-Googler who is head of data analytics at Letv, a company with a $12 billion market cap. What's more, the company soon will move into the US, encroaching on Netflix. Li will lead the effort, bringing Letv's video streaming service, its original programming, its Apple-TV-like settop boxes, its smart TVs, and, now, smartphones. Alibaba and Letv could pose serious challenges to Netflix. And that leads me to the "bottom line" question that summarizes the above analysis… Will China cost Netflix more than the money gained from new subscribers? Many people may assume that Netflix's expansion into China is a good thing. But ultimately, if NFLX is embroiled in the same type of situation as Google and Facebook, two companies banned from China, then the costs would far outweigh the benefits. Netflix investors should be happy that the company is seeking out new areas to continue fueling growth, but maybe should take pause at what I view as a premature move on Netflix's part. Netflix remains a highly priced, yet strong stock. But China could prove to be a negative catalyst rather than a positive one if the challenges cut into NFLX's growth rather than increase it.
