Apple: Who Said Buffett Didn't Pull The Trigger? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha We think Berkshire Hathaway's "intrinsic value" would fetch a $180 target on Apple. We don't think the Apple purchase is a change in direction for Berkshire Hathaway. If Apple used cash for a takeover it would be dilutive. Their only hope for cash is a major tender. We think Buffett may be in to encourage such a direction. Upgrade to hold. We can't go to a buy rating yet because of our below street estimates but we feel valuation catalysts could be setting up. Click to enlargeDecisions Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) management needs to make regarding their large cash position are not easy. Many choices may be dilutive, hurting shareholder value. Warren Buffett may see a different opportunity. There has been speculation that Warren Buffett was not part of the decision process to buy Apple at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A )(NYSE: BRK.B ). Buffett has been famous for admitting that he doesn't understand technology. Many have said that the recent Apple purchase may have been made by other managers at the firm. We think there was a fair chance that Warren Buffett, himself, was a part of the decision process based on a Berkshire measure called intrinsic value. On his own company, Warren Buffett has been reported to say that he expects to make a large repurchase of his own shares up to as much as 120% of book value. When looking at Apple's book value, however, you may not find the will to dive in at $21. But intrinsic value may be Buffett's key. In the 2012 shareholder letter, Berkshire Hathaway wrote that ( page 20 ) intrinsic value is extremely important when buying back shares. "But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are made above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefited in a meaningful way by purchases up to our 120% limit." We think the 120% limit may refer to book value. That said, the communication above specifically cites intrinsic value. 120% of Apple's $150 intrinsic value would be $180, or 80% upside from current levels. That's in Buffett's wheelhouse. Cash Position May Be Holding Back Apple Value - Need Of A Tender Because of Apple's low PE, by definition, any acquisition they make will be dilutive to earnings. Because of their size, to move the needle, they would need to make a larger purchase. Taking the two together, a large acquisition would elevate the PE, lower the earnings per share and could be an initial hit to the valuation. When we spoke to Apple, they said they were not afraid to make larger acquisitions. When asked if they would make a dilutive acquisition, they said they would consider it. The company views any acquisition that is strategic as accretive. That implies that earnings accretion is not their focus. We understand that based on our low PE comments above (any acquisition would be dilutive). Unless Apple does a more meaningful tender or buyback, the current pace is having a very small impact to overall earnings. You can see from the above chart that the overall impact to earnings of buybacks is under 2%. Their current pace is not helping the overall valuation or PE. The buy backs are not supporting the stock price either. If they were to increase the pace or buy back a more meaningful amount in one shot, that would make a bigger impact on the shares and create real shareholder value. Apple spent a billion dollars on Didi recently. CEO Tim Cook said the move was for "a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market." This speaks to the value of cash at a company. What multiple do you put on cash? When cash is being spent on new initiatives based on one's core competency, it is valuable. We value a company based on their ability and flexibility to continue in pursuit of their expertise. A company's cash position gives the company the latitude to grow and build out what it knows best. When that cash is spent on new and different avenues of business (Didi), the value of that cash is worth closer to its nominal value (or worse, a degradation of value) because of the risk involved with newer projects and dilution. Cash does not deserve a multiple for being spent in newer projects unless the company has proven to be successful in adapting those purchases to bottom line performance. Apple has had success in smaller technology tack-on acquisitions but hasn't proven itself in larger acquisitions in new directions. We know the cash position that Apple owns is powerful, but does it make them stronger? Can it make them stronger? Is there the type of acquisition that they would make that would enhance the value of the Apple brand, and more importantly, strengthen the company? Head's likely turn to critique Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), in comparison. Facebook spent large amounts of money on new strategies but those strategies actually fit into their core strategy of, as we previuosly wrote , their desire to own human interactions. Which has proven to be successful and profitable. We think the latest move investing in Didi and rumors about auto (although the company did not confirm such moves to us) are signs that Apple is looking for the next big thing. The problem with that next big thing is that if it is not going to be made in house it could be something that reduces their exposure to their smartphone dominance. The strategy of diworsification. Moving from your core strategy into new areas increases the risk profile to earnings and is a clear sign that the next big thing isn't necessarily iPhone. The Berkshire Hathaway 2010 Annual Report said: "This "what-will-they-do-with-the-money" factor must always be evaluated along with the "what-do-we-have-now" calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company's intrinsic value. That's because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the company's earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the company's current value; if the CEO's talents or motives are suspect, today's value must be discounted. The difference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears' or Montgomery Ward's CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton." This is an amazing statement when put into the context of their Apple investment. Based on our analysis, it sounds like you can erase the 2010 and put in 2016 and see that they could be referring to any company including Apple. We think that Berkshire Hathaway sees the value in a bigger buyback and sees the risks in a larger merger or acquisition. We think Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Apple could help guide Apple's management. We think Apple can stand to use a little direction with their cash position from the "best of them." We think and hope this will be the direction of Apple's board. If so, we think this will have positive ramifications on Apple stock. When reviewing businesses we like to look at what is the core product or segment that is driving the growth and margins. We like to see what opportunities are coming from those core franchises. In house, we talk about the McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) Test (No copy-write) all the time. Their main business is burgers and anything that goes with a burger. A major move or change from the core is problematic. It may sound too simplistic, but we constantly analyze companies in all sectors using the McDonald's Test. Is the company selling burgers or pizza. Success requires adapting around a core expertise. Based on Cook's comments these investments seem to be based on discovery rather than core strengths. Investors and analysts are hoping to make a story how Apple services will now be able to expand in cars or through Didi, but, generally, you don't need to buy your way into a new segment for expansion. Apple already is selling into auto suppliers without Didi's help. You need to make great products and maybe have important strategic relationships and partnerships in core categories. That is what best enhances value. What The PE May Imply: Need Of A Tender Street numbers for September 2017 are for $9.09. At $100 stock price that is an 11xPE. The repurchase of more meaningful amounts of shares would lower the share count, raise the earnings and lower the multiple further making it an even more attractive purchase for investors. The fact that Apple's cash has been widely reported to be held overseas may be holding back a major buyback. The company needs to fund share buybacks with US cash. To end-run around the issue they have to issue debt here in the US. We think they have many ways to fund a buy back with their outside cash and probably can get more creative through swaps or hedges. In the end, if Apple did want to do a more meaningful tender - we think they have the ability and recourses to figure it out. We hope the Berkshire Hathaway investment can speed up the pace of buybacks. We don't see any other meaningfully accretive use for Apple's money. It's certainly nice to have a pile of cash, but we want the use of it for earnings accretive purposes. The only solution we see is a more aggressive share buyback which we hope can be encouraged by Apple's newest famous owner. We hope it will not be used for a large acquisition. We are changing our rating from Sell to Hold. We think the valuation story is something in process. Our near-term offset however is that our expectations are below the street as we wrote ahead of last quarter and a few days ago . So for now, we are on the sidelines with a Hold Rating but we think there could be valuation catalysts setting up.
