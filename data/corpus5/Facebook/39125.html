What I Liked And Wall Street Hated Most About Facebook's Quarter - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub What I find most encouraging about FB's last quarter is what Wall Street criticized most. This difference shows the shortsightedness of the market, unable to realize what FB is doing now is necessary for long-term growth. Because FB is focused on the future, and not the present, I bought more stock, and believe its outlook is better than ever. For a company as well covered as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), and with as many users it has on a single platform, the company's recent earnings release has by now been dissected from all angles. Investors have already looked at the good and bad, with one thing in particular being considered bad, and that's the company's high R&D. Facebook's high spending was considered a big reason for the stock's post-earnings decline. The company's decision to spend over $1 billion on R&D during its last quarter had a negative impact on margins, and is considered by many to be discouraging. However, Facebook's decision to spend so aggressively is the single greatest thing I liked about the quarter, prompting me to buy more shares. You might ask why I am so bullish on higher spending, and the answer is simple: Facebook is a company with many moving parts; it has an enormous user base and must figure how to monetize these things as effectively as possible. It costs money to gain this knowledge, to perform the research needed, and to ensure that once a product is implemented, it doesn't destroy the user experience. Facebook now has over 1.4 billion monthly users on its core platform, over 930 million of which are daily active users. We already know that Facebook has the largest network in the world, but the question is how to better monetize that network so it creates well over the $3.5 billion in revenue from last quarter. As explained in a Venture Beat article , Facebook has invested in world-renowned researchers and acquisitions of start-ups that could one day give it highly intelligent algorithms to more effectively pair ads with consumers of interest. We have seen Facebook do this in recent years, which is why the company's advertising prices have soared triple digits year after year. In essence, advertisers are more willing to pay when their ads result in site traffic, higher placement, or sold products and services. With Facebook reportedly testing a "Buy" button, the opportunity to increase its appeal among site advertisers continues to rise, but to keep the momentum, R&D spending is necessary. Furthermore, there are a lot of new opportunities to monetize within Facebook's core site. The company has successfully become a legitimate player in the video space. It now has more than four billion video views per day across its PC and mobile app. That's up from 3 billion in the fourth quarter and just one billion in the third. Once more, R&D was needed to determine how to make videos successful, and now that volume has spiked, the company has the opportunity to monetize that viewership. Reportedly, Facebook is selling 24-hour video advertising spots for north of $2 million per day, multiple slots, 365 days a year. That's one way to monetize, because even with two slots sold per day, Facebook could earn an extra $1.5 billion in annual revenue, and this is revenue that doesn't even account for the four billion views of non-advertised videos. The bottom line is that with each new product Facebook unveils, the potential to monetize is created. Video is one of these new services/products for the company, but with 1.4 billion monthly users, the opportunities to expand into new categories are seemingly endless. For example, Facebook also disclosed that it now has over one billion daily searches on its mobile app alone. Eventually, mobile search will become an monetization opportunity just like timeline ads, but once more, knowing how and when to monetize requires R&D. All things considered, it costs money to make money, and Facebook is a true testament to that old saying. Personally, I find it highly encouraging that the company spent nearly 30% of its quarterly revenue on R&D, and honestly, I wish it had spent more. Particularly, Facebook is not one of these cloud or big data tech companies spending 30-50% of its revenue on marketing, and lowering the prices on services. It is spending on tangible items, things that increase the value of its platform, all the while raising ad prices instead of lowering. That said, Facebook may look like a mountain of opportunities, based on the information presented thus far, but we haven't even scratched the surface of the many applications that it owns that have equally great monetization potential. These include WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, which have 700 million, 600 million, and 300 million users, respectively. While Messenger's user base is the same as Facebook, it is an entirely different platform for the company to monetize. Earlier this year, the company unveiled the Messenger Platform, which, I explained, could mean billions of annual revenue for the company long-term. However, for Messenger to reach this point, it had to test source codes within the app, hire David Marcus, and find compatible partners, all of which required R&D. As for WhatsApp and Instagram, those two services still aren't being monetized that well. Given what the company is spending on R&D, my guess is that it won't be long though. We're talking about enormous platforms, where Facebook not only owns the PC in many categories, but also smartphones via applications. While many investors sold shares in fear that higher R&D and lower operating margins could become a trend, I bought more stock , as I am now more bullish than ever. The reason: I think higher R&D will continue to translate into higher revenue and profits long-term, as Facebook has yet to give me one reason to doubt the direction in which it is headed.
