Microsoft: 110 Million Windows 10 Users Get Candy Crush Soda Saga - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha As of October 1, there are now more than 110 million people who installed Windows 10. King Digital kept its promise. It released Candy Crush Soda Saga to all Windows 10 users. Windows 10 users are now able to play Candy Crush Soda Saga on their desktop computers without having to use Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and King Digital (NYSE: KING ) have released the top-grossing freemium match-3 puzzle game, Candy Crush Soda Saga, on the Windows 10 app store. King is obviously expecting that the popular Windows 10 PC platform could help it increase its pool of paying players. There are now more than 110 million people who actively use Windows 10 as their main desktop operating system. Such a huge user base is always attractive to mobile game publishers eager to monetize their games outside of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) app stores. Below is my retired level 208 Candy Crush Soda Saga account, which I now only occasionally use to give lives to my Facebook friends. Microsoft is now poised to get a cut of King's revenue stream from Candy Crush Soda Saga when players do in-app purchases via the Windows 10 app store. King made the Candy Crush Soda Saga cross-platform last December. However, while I could play the same account on Android, iOS devices, and on Facebook's website, King never released any version for Windows Phone 8.1, or a standalone version for Windows 8.1/7 desktop computers. The 100 million strong Windows 10 user population is a rich pool for King Digital to find paying customers. Candy Crush Soda Saga is free to play. However, like Candy Crush Saga, it strongly favors players who make in-app purchases. The highly social nature of this game requires competitive players to buy premium currency from King. Spending real dollars allows a player to progress much faster than their friends/relatives who do not make in-app purchases. Since King Digital has successfully ported Candy Crush Soda Saga to Windows 10 PCs, I expect the Windows 10 OS mobile version to also come soon. The mobile version of this game is a super cash generator for King Digital. As per the latest data of Sensor Tower , Candy Crush Soda Saga's net sales (30% commission of Google and Apple was already deducted) for September was $32 million. King Digital will likely again use Microsoft's free Project Astoria conversion tool to port Candy Crush Soda Saga to the Windows 10 Mobile OS. King is probably only waiting for Microsoft to do its final release of Windows 10 Mobile before it announces Candy Crush Soda Saga for Windows phones/tablets. King Digital is one of the world's leading game publishers. Its support for Windows 10 is a small but important tailwind for Microsoft. The Candy Crush game titles are certified blockbuster hits that generate millions of dollars in daily sales. It is good that the Windows 10 PC app store will now have a chance to enjoy a commission from big-spending, addicted Candy Crush Soda Saga players. Microsoft's willingness to give away free Windows 10 OS licenses is a smart bet that should help it attain the same measure of popularity the Android OS currently enjoys. The 30% cut of Google from annual in-app purchases done through its Play Store is already a 9-figure revenue stream. Microsoft's free Office 365 and other mobile apps are just baits to gather more users inside its Windows 10 ecosystem. Once app developers notice a substantial increase in Windows' mobile user base, they will heed King Digital's example and will also port their top-grossing games. Microsoft intends to have 1 billion Windows 10 devices on the planet. Ignoring this massive pool of potential paying players will be painful for any self-respecting game developer/publisher. Imitating Google's successful formula is really not that hard for Microsoft. In my own analysis, the cheat sheet that Google used toward its $440 billion glory only took five simple steps: Cheap Android devices led to 1.4 billion people using Google's mobile OS. The huge population of Android users made it very attractive to app/game developers.
