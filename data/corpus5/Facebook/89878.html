Instagram Isn't Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha I argue that the street is viewing Instagram and Facebook too closely together from an ad platform standpoint and that this has created a chance to buy FB at a discount. I make the case that FB is cultivating Facebook and Instagram into highly distinct, two very specific ways to prepare for its long-term advertising efforts. I also use Kissmetrics data to explain why Instagram might be the real advertising platform of the video-ad future. Continue to be long FB - it should see a parabolic move higher once the street learns to silo the platform use cases. Let me just get that out of the way early because that's going to be an important differentiation as your read this article. It's also going to be something that I try to drive home - the undervaluing of Instagram as a platform as a reason to be bullish FB. On Monday RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney came out with a reiteration of his Outperform rating and his $105 price target for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) - the $105 price target is roughly a 30% premium to FB's most recent close. Largely these expectations are being driven by the secular demand expectation, which is already evidencing itself presently, for video advertising and what should be Facebook's and Instagram's collective ability to service this demand effectively. I couldn't agree more with Mahaney that FB should be able to deploy video ads across its platforms. But my reasoning for why and to what level for each platform, at least based on what has been made public from Mahaney's report, appears to be quite a bit different from his. I've spent quite a bit of time the last few weeks opining on why I believe Facebook's ability to advertise effectively should only get better and better. My thoughts on this have been strengthened by my belief that FB is positioning the Facebook platform for content and inbound marketing, the early results of the Creative Accelerator program, and the fact that FB has developed Lite - a low data Facebook app for international or stressed infrastructure environments. Now, my thoughts on Instagram and why it will have high levels of ad efficacy are again quite a bit different from those for Facebook but they basically boil down to the fact that Instagram isn't Facebook - and that's a very, very good thing for those long FB. So, what I mean by "Instagram isn't Facebook" is exactly what's implied. These are two very different platforms with two very different conceptual "flows." Excuse the lack of a better term. I hope I can make my point regardless. If ancillary, largely photo, only quasi-social "networks" Pinterest, (give me some rope here) Spring, Instagram and a handful of other apps have shown us anything it's that they aren't Facebook. More specifically, when users deploy these apps they aren't in the same state of mind and they aren't "desiring" the same outcome they are when they deploy Facebook. Facebook has contributed greatly to this via its algorithm, and it's a more intimate social network that's about familiarity, about connecting and about intimacy. Again, FB has worked hard to keep this the status quo by constantly working to eliminate viral content proliferation (read: Upworthy, Gawker, Viralnova, etc.) and limiting what viewers see from an ad standpoint. The former names are about discovery, about the unknown and about entertainment. Pinterest has perfected leveraging this "flow" into most recently the release of monetization efforts like Buyable Pins and an updated Guided Search. Instagram, which by the way has no algorithm but is a real-time feed display, has slowly allowed greater advertising efforts as well. Kissmetrics put out an incredible Infographic recently on the major structural differences for advertisers and brand marketers to recognize between Facebook and Instagram. In summary what it showed was that slowly advertisers are taking to Instagram to advertise in volume (abandoning volume efforts on Facebook - which are largely thwarted by the algo anyways) and that Instagram users don't care that this is happening. That's right. Instagram users have been unaffected by the increased overt marketing efforts. First, this doesn't mean that advertisers are abandoning Facebook altogether - FB's financials show that just isn't true. BUT, what it does mean is that the ads on Facebook are clearly being selected more carefully whereas the ads on Instagram are being deployed in shotgun fashion. The Kissmetrics data shows that this is actually the more efficacious way to advertise. Again, this is a good thing for FB longs. Kissmetrics has been able to show that Instagram, again simply being a real-time feed display, becomes more effective for advertisers as they advertise in volume. It also shows that with enough volume an advertiser or brand can create network momentum, meaning that users will advertise for it using the brand's hashtag even if not directly following the brand. Also excellent in data, it appears that there is no preferable time or day of the week to post for engagement. Doesn't that seem like an advertiser dream? The total FB ecosystem, especially the Facebook and Instagram platforms, should only get stickier (as if they aren't already) as FB can silo its two platforms further. What I mean by that is the less untargeted, un-algo checked advertisements users see on FB (thanks to the elimination of viral content farmers) - the more attractive the network becomes to FB users. The more volume of advertisements Instagram users see, apparently according to volume-to-unfollowed hashtag usage data, the happier Instagram users are to attach to a brand. That's an incredibly powerful message to a massive ad-spend budget slowly transitioning from TV to video - both mobile and desktop based. For me this is the big miss currently by The Street. FB as a company is currently cultivating, almost petri-dish style, two very big, very distinct, very effective advertising platforms that marketers and brands can use across use cases. It's going to be the one-stop shop for advertising. It's close now but again there are similarly competitive platforms like Pinterest that I would say rank parallel, once it can further dial-in the silos for both networks. I think The Street, outside of Mahaney apparently, is too closely viewing the Facebook and Instagram platforms too closely together. Instagram isn't Facebook and Facebook isn't Instagram. These networks need to be thought of as completely different segments rather than "FB" as a company. As FB can continue its experimentation - Instant Articles, Creative Accelerator, Instagram ad-backlinking, etc., it should only be a more and more valuable outcome generator. That means a more and more valuable company. Again, I think The Street is too rigid in thinking about FB as a concept. I think there's money to be made in this misread as well.
