The Next Big Thing For Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is betting on live-streaming. Company has spent over $50 million signing content publishers in an effort to get regular users to upload videos of their own. Facebook Live will be key for driving engagement and monetization as media consumption continues to shift from cable to digital. Live streaming will be the next big thing for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Mark Zuckerberg thought as much when he rolled out Facebook Live, FB's live streaming platform, last year. In March, Facebook started paying publishers to stream content exclusively through its website. While the service is still in its developing stages, the Wall Street Journal reports that FB has spent over $50 million signing deals with 140 media companies and celebrities (Figure 1). Contract values are based on the publishers' popularity on Facebook, the number of videos they stream, and average broadcast length. The move is part of a broader effort to get regular users to broadcast, watch, and share their own live videos. Video is a relatively new area of focus for Facebook, and it will be a crucial driver of growth going forward. But live streaming offers something special. While FB trails its peers in the streaming video market, it will not take long for Facebook Live to catch up. Video has become an important area of focus for Facebook as more and more consumers have shifted from cable TV to digital media. Facebook users watch 100 million hours of video every day on the website, and video will be the fastest growing ad segment on both mobile and desktop devices. According to Cowen and Company, the digital video market in the US will expand from $9.8 billion in 2016 to $28 billion by 2020. Compared to print, video is a more lucrative ad medium because it provides a more immersive experience and "better captures the attention of audiences". In the latest quarter, video ads on FB fetched $4 per 1,000 views , compared to an average of $3.14 for all ads run on the website. This was up from $3.14 for video ads in the same period last quarter. Zuckerberg sees live streaming as a natural progression in the realm of video. He believes that it will not only attract more users to Facebook, but also get them to stay for longer, expanding the pot of potential ad dollars the firm can extract. Compared to regular videos, live streaming can achieve higher levels of engagement and, by extension, monetization . According to Julia Greenberg, the "live" aspect creates a call to action where, in order to get the most out of the stream, you have watch it in real time: "Facebook wants to create those must-be-present experiences. It's an intimate experience, and you have to be there when it happens". This creates a sense of scarcity, and drives viewership. As Greenberg explains, "there's no better way to get you to come back and stay than by promising live experiences you won't get anywhere else". But not only does the "live" feature attract viewership, users also tend to spend more time watching live-streaming content than other videos. Early test results show that users spend three times longer, on average, watching live video than other types of video. This is due to the fact that live videos tend to stream events, rather than clips of content. This allows FB to accumulate more data and sell more target ads, so not only does the volume of ads increase, but the quality (value) of ads does as well. Compared to those of other social apps such as YouTube, Twitter, and Periscope, Facebook's live streaming service is in its infant stages. However, we expect it to catch up to its peers quickly, thanks to network effects that have made FB such a successful company. FB's massive users base (more than 1.5B users worldwide) makes partnering with Facebook an attractive proposition for publishers. There is no better way for publishers to get exposure than by working with the world's largest social network. As more publishers post their content on Facebook it attracts more viewers to the platform, and the cycle continues. Facebook is reinventing itself as a media company, and live streaming will play a key role in this transformation.
