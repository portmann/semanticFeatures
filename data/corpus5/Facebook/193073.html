Twitter: It Might Be Too Late For Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitter investors reacted positively to the news that Twitter was rehiring former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey. So far, there isn't much clarity on how he plans to turn things around. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has been making waves this year, following a precipitous decline in its stock price which has left investors shell shocked. Indeed, the company finds itself in a tough spot, as it struggles to grow its user base and is seemingly incapable of keeping up with Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) mass appeal. Shares saw some relief when the announcement was made that Jack Dorsey would be returning to the company as CEO. Yet, with few tangible plans on the table, and a user base increasingly frustrated with the website's interface, the leadership change may be too little, too late. Few have over the last year or so disagreed with the notion that Twitter needed a change of direction. User growth languished under CEO Dick Costolo's lead, as the platform simply did not offer users the simplicity and range of functions offered by competitors, most notably Facebook. Twitter investors would perhaps like to imagine the return of Jack Dorsey to the company he co-founded as similar to Steve Jobs' return to Apple, turning the company into the world's highest-capitalized stock under his leadership. Yet, Dorsey faces many challenges as he assumes the driver seat. Several things are currently limiting user interest in the platform. First of all, the GUI has barely seen any changes since the system was launched, and is by now looking a bit dated to many. Secondly, the user interface is regarded as clunky and complicated, according to some, even challenging sophisticated users. At the moment, the service seems to appeal more to celebrities and other high-profile figures than the average Joe, which is a huge problem in terms of growing the user base it needs to sustain revenue growth. So what can Jack Dorsey do? According to Twitter's board, the previously ousted CEO is a product-driven and passionate leader who has the creativity and insight to freshen up Twitter's user experience and give it a more broad-based appeal. Not everyone is convinced, some commentators arguing that bringing back old leadership does not signal the kind of change the company needs in order to become competitive. So far, he has indeed announced a few new measures, including the removal of the 140-character limit for private messages and a "Buy Now" button, but without much clarity on the "ambitious road map" for product changes in 2016, investors still don't have much insight into the company's future. Another issue worrying investors is that he will simultaneously be CEO of Square, a high-growth tech company that will presumably require quite a bit of his attention. Facebook isn't currently eating Twitter's lunch; it is eating Twitter's three main meals of the day as well as its snacks in between. Twitter, as of June 30th, counted 316 MAUs, eking out a 2.6% sequential gain. Compare this to Facebook. The social media titan at the end of the same period counted some 1.49 billion MAUs, up 3.5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Twitter is currently simply not playing in the same league as Facebook. Two main factors seem to distinguish Facebook as the social media platform of choice over Twitter: its user-friendly interface and constantly expanding range of features. Facebook offers users more things to do, and does these in an easier, more streamlined way. Twitter will thus have to come up with something similar in order to remain relevant, simultaneously giving its platform a facelift and introducing new futures in order to attract and retain users. At the moment, it's simply not clear whether Jack Dorsey will be able to make these changes in time and to the necessary degree. Until he outlines a clearer plan for product development, and we see the numbers coming out on engagement with this updated platform, I remain bearish on Twitter in the near term. Twitter's change in leadership sent stocks up around 7%, investors cheering any kind of change at the moment. However, this enthusiasm may prove to be short lived. Twitter is currently being outmaneuvered by Facebook on all sides, and many wonder if he has the time in his dual-CEO role to put through the changes necessary in order to remain relevant. Without more information on what exactly he plans to do with the platform, and we see these updates in practice, I see little reason to be bullish on the stock.
