Facebook: The Return Of Notes Means The Capture Of The Mass Market Blogger - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook has repositioned Notes in an effort to capture the entry level blogger as well as add overall functionality to its content creation engine. Again, another brilliant move by Facebook in repurposing a tossed to the side but now useful tech. I think this is meaningful to Facebook when you understand the platform comprehensiveness Facebook is working toward with Notes in addition to what's been rolled out the last six months. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is one of my favorite stories to follow and one of my favorite investments. If you haven't been following my coverage of the ticker here at Seeking Alpha, I happened to have been lucky enough to pick up some long-dated CALLS just prior to Facebook's last technical move past what at the time was some serious resistance. You can imagine that might be shaping my view of the company in that the CALL options have returned more than I could have imagined in such a short window. But, thanks to the power of crowd sourced research and the springboard that is Seeking Alpha, the community here has kept my investment honest and has tested the reality underlying my theses to which, I have many for the company. That's actually what's prompting today's Facebook article, the idea of crowd sourcing something - content in this instance. Facebook has worked really, really hard and dumped some serious R&D efforts into reshaping its platform from user aggregator to content aggregator. There's a big difference in that and there's a big difference in making one the primary goal. It should also be noted that Facebook doesn't "halfway" do strategic pivots, it goes all in. I think it's become readily apparent that Facebook has gone all in on the shift taking place and I think the shift is brilliant. In the last six months alone, Facebook has refined its core platform to include content curation tools like Instant Articles and Author Tags, refined its algorithm to be more content friendly and attractive, and it appears it has now brought back Notes. Techcrunch has detailed that Facebook has revamped the tossed to the side micro-platform, which I thought had been outright replaced by Instant Articles, and has apparently relaunched Notes as what I'm calling a Wordpress-light. This matters guys. If this is true, for which Techcrunch has provided screenshots so I'm assuming it is even without a blog post from Facebook to confirm this, this would give the core-Facebook platform an almost completely verticalized content curation optionality that isn't available elsewhere. Well, it is, but "elsewhere" in this instance would require multi-platform housing (read: combining a low-grade Wordpress with a similarly low grade Medium) or a sophisticated Wordpress or webpage housing unit. ("Sophisticated" varies by the user of course, but for many, using the "9 out of 10 people I know rule," developing a Wordpress page on their own would require a level of sophistication that simply isn't there). Facebook, in its efforts to become all things to all people would like to be the substitute for this and I think it stands a great chance of pulling this off. First, sites like Wordpress, Wix (NASDAQ: WIX ), and Squarespace are well known enough to tech enthusiasts and are easy enough to launch for those with some experience with operating non-perfectly user friendly/non-perfectly user familiar interfaces. But I can tell you right now, my mother would not visit any of those sites to start up a recipe blog with her social circle. Nor would she be able to convince her social circle to make the jump to any of those places nor do I believe any of those places could create a social loop effective enough to host a recipe sharing circuit. This is just one example, of course. She does, however, have a Facebook page. So do her friends. And, maybe most importantly, she's proficient in using Facebook in creating "content." I think she could easily be taught or self-learn how to create a Note with some well-placed Note advertisement by Facebook (think: workshop). That's really my point to be made in this article. My point is that while Medium and Tumblr and (insert hot blogging/micro blogging website/app here) are hot right now and are pulling in the tech savvy masses, Facebook with Notes will be able to pull in the masses in general. If Facebook can pull in my mother and her recipe collection, which might not be perfectly useful for anybody outside her immediate circle - she isn't going to become the next million unique visitor per day blogger, that still means more time on the platform, more dialed in advertising opportunities, and likely more page "likes" for similar recipe bloggers creating Notes themselves. But that's just the beginning. Sure, the fringe user of Notes is great for all the reasons just described above. But what I think Facebook stands to really gain here is in how comprehensive this drop-in of Notes makes its content engine when paired with Instant Articles and off-platform Moments, Live, Mentions, Instagram, Messenger, etc. What this does, when viewing Facebook as a total platform, is create really inexpensive optionality and total platform comprehensiveness that flat out doesn't exist elsewhere. That really matters. I run a digital property that's Wordpress-based and that monetizes content. I can't tell you the level of support necessary, the "plugins" necessary, the constant updating necessary, the total stress on my MacBook necessary (it takes quite a bit of backend work for the MacBook to even load the Wordpress architecture of the page itself), and the headache involved with simply keeping the property running. Oh by the way, I have to use third party chat function, I have to use third party forum function, and I have to use non-integrated (well, not perfectly) customer support housing because Wordpress (and this is just one platform) isn't sophisticated enough (I know I could use other platforms and coding to fix this) to host all of these itself. To the comments that I'm sure are to come of why don't you use a more sophisticated coding base - should I have to? If Facebook can prove out its integrations for the above described, if Facebook can create a seamless fluidity between what it just spent the last 6 months working on (likely much longer - that's just the time it's taken to announce all of the above) you better believe I'll be making the jump to running my property on Facebook. And that's the grand scheme, I believe, at Facebook. Facebook is trying to bring sophistication with ease. Actually, it's trying to bring everything with ease. Facebook doesn't just want its core platform to be a social network - it wants it to "replace" a large chunk of the internet. It wants it to be the core platform of your entire web experience. Think about if, say, the New York Times ran its platform on top of Facebook because it had better open architecture (maybe discounted advertising as well?) using the platform. Because it could pipe in live streaming interviews via Live to a massive user base that it had secondary access to via News Feed recommended social circles of its core users (or via a promotional News Feed placement). Because it's just easier to click a second button (I'm hypothesizing at this point) and auto-post to Instagram a photo that's just been uploaded to an Instant Article. Because its Zendesk (NYSE: ZEN ) customer service engine is already integrated into messenger and it doesn't have a plugin issue every third day of operation (totally a hypothetical). Because to load a Note takes 10 seconds and comes with the ability to make the short fire post more than just text and it can do it at a speed that other platforms can't. I mean, doesn't that just make sense? I think it does. I also think that when the market finally digests exactly how huge the content curation monetization momentum potential is here that the market will reward Facebook with much, much higher pricing. There's still a large faction of the market that doesn't get it when it comes to the new normals that aren't coming - that have arrived. Facebook understood this a long time ago and it jumped on the vision of the future with everything from an optimized platform to secondary functionality like Mentions, Instagram, and Live (built within mentions) that could further verticalize and make comprehensive its vision. Facebook is well on its way to becoming the platform of choice for content and content monetization. I can't wait to see what's next. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, ZEN.
