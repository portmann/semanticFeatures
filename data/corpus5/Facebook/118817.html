Is Google Finally Growing Up? - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Signs are emerging that the new CFO is starting to implement some financial discipline at Google. The Internet search giant has long frustrated shareholders with out of control expenses. Google has operating margins far below the other tech giants. The hiring of a new CFO a few months back had shareholders hopeful that the new finance leader would help constrain the spending at Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The Internet search leader has long spent heavy on research and development for projects far astray of the main money generator. The stock though hasn't always seen the impact due to consistent revenue growth that hides unnecessary costs. With a market cap of $383 billion, investors can't really complain. If the new CFO can realign the business into a focus on costs without cutting back on legitimate growth areas, the projection is for substantially higher profits per share. One quick way to view the operating margins of Google is in comparison to other tech giants including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). In comparison, the other tech giants are producing considerably higher operating margins. One can make a reasonable assumption that Google should even top the operating margins of Facebook. While Apple is a mostly hardware firm that typically has lower margins, Google and Facebook are similar in their advertising focus. With Google having the significantly larger revenue base of $74 billion vs. $17 billion for Facebook, the bigger base would typically produce the higher margins. Not to mention, Facebook is aggressively building out services and ad products for not only the standard Facebook platform but also the new services of Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The company has even forecasted costs surging over 50% this year. This brings us back to the news of the day that CFO Ruth Porat is actually requiring internal teams to justify spending including the hiring of new employees. The head count totals detailed by the Wall Street Journal is probably the most notable shift in the Google mindset with reduced hiring taking place even prior the CFO joining back in May. Looking at the operating margins from a non-GAAP basis that excludes stock-based compensation, the Google margins jump to 33% in Q1. Those improvements are in large part due to the lower employee growth, but the hidden costs of extra stock issued hurts the EPS. In the last year, the share count grew by 4.2 million shares, or up 6.2%. In essence, the slightly better margins were far outweighed by the higher share count causing a muted increase in EPS growth. The EPS growth far trailed the 12% revenue growth for the quarter. On the flip side, Facebook generated non-GAAP operating margins of 52% for the quarter. Even with the ramp up in expenses that reduced margins from the Q1 levels last year, Facebook is still far more efficient with expenses. Where an improving margin will really help Google is with the valuation multiple. The stock trades at about 17x 2016 earnings estimates that could jump if the new CFO can constrain operating expense growth. Analysts only forecast the EPS growing by nearly 16% in 2016 with revenue jumping 15%. Google isn't projected to produce a ton of leverage at that rate. Along with controlling costs, Google needs to limit the growth in shares outstanding. One way the company could do itself a huge favor is to use the cash balances of $65 billion to return capital to investors. With a market cap of $383 billion and strong cash flow despite the out of control expense growth, the company could reduce the share count if it spent a billion or more each quarter on buybacks. According to the below chart (ignore the blip in 2011), Google has consistently hurt the EPS growth by the surge in outstanding shares. GOOG Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts Going forward, a 1% increase in operating margins would add roughly $1 to 2016 EPS estimates - an amount equivalent to adding over 300 basis points to the EPS growth rate. Now if Google can mirror higher margins with a buyback that is able to reduce the outstanding shares, the search giant would see EPS growth that could approach 25%. The key takeaway is that some fiscal responsibility could go a long way for the stock valuation of Google. The company could easily generate higher profits while the market would award the company a higher PE multiple. The resulting impact is a large jump in the stock price to new highs. A simple increase in 2016 EPS estimates to $34 (up from $32.72 now) and a higher forward PE multiple of 20 would send the stock up to $680, or roughly 16% higher from the Tuesday close. Now imagine if the company produces margins inline with those of Facebook. Source: Is Google Finally Growing Up? Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
