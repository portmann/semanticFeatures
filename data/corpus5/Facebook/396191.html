Game Plan For The Week - Cramer's Mad Money (4/29/16) | Seeking Alpha  |  Includes: AMZN , APC , ATVI , BRK.A , BRK.B , CAB , CLX , CMI , CVS , CY , DENN , EPR , F , IDTI , NOK , RDS.A , RDS.B , VTR , WFM Cramer likes Warren Buffett since he is an investor and not a trader. He doesn't keep calling the tops as many others do. "Buffett is a welcome joy versus people who just blast away and call tops all the time or seek to make their negativity known with broad sweeping gestures," said Cramer. Whenever Warren Buffett appears on CNBC after the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A )(NYSE: BRK.B ) meeting, the market gains 0.5% on average based on the last 10 years. That gain is then lost by the end of the week. This means that the Buffett bounce does not last long. "Maybe save the ideas for later in the week when the rosy hue is long since forgotten," said Cramer. With that, he gave his game plan for the week. Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC ): With oil heading towards $50 due to decline in supply coupled with increase in demand, this stock should be watched. The US and China are using up oil and producing less. Denny's (NASDAQ: DENN ): Cramer wants to figure out what is happening in the dining space. He thinks that McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) is taking share from everyone. He will watch the earnings and conference call from Denny's closely. Clorox (NYSE: CLX ), which is one of the least economically sensitive companies, will report earnings on Tuesday. Cummins (NYSE: CMI ) is the most economically sensitive company. Cramer will be watching both to look for patterns and the market's mood. CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) will report earnings on Tuesday too. Cramer would like to know if Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has taken away sales from drugstores. Royal Dutch (NYSE: RDS.A ) (NYSE: RDS.B ) is one of the most challenged of the major oil companies. When it reports earnings, things could get ugly. Cramer will be watching it closely. Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ): Cramer will be watching the earnings to see how the new small-format stores are doing. The stock will move up if they are doing well, but will have limited downside if they are not doing well. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) will report on Thursday. Cramer is not willing to bet against CEO Bobby Kotek and thinks it will beat estimates on top and bottom lines. CEO interview - EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR ) REITs were negatively impacted after a rate hike in December. After the Fed changed its stance on the four rate hikes in 2015, the group has revived. Consider EPR Properties which is a diversified REIT owning entertainment, recreation and education related properties and now entering into the casino space as well. The company's stock is up 16% since December rate hike. Cramer interviewed CEO Greg Silvers to hear what lies ahead for the company. The $600M casino being built in New York just received its gaming license. It will be at the center of the leisure resort that will include a water park hotel and entertainment-centered complex with a movie theater. Silvers mentioned that Millennials are spending money on experiences. EPR Properties are tying up with such companies to build memories. With new content being available all the time, there is something new to experience every time. "We've got the balance sheet, which is another thing investors occasionally miss about the company is we're going to be there for the long-term. The balance sheet is good," said Silvers. Based on Amazon's last quarter, everyone says that the consumer is dead and so are the brick and mortar retailers. With Amazon taking share from retail does it mean that retailers are dead? "The idea that Amazon can assassinate every single retailer is simply untrue," said Cramer. There is no doubt that Amazon is a vicious competitor, but Cramer thinks people will still go to the store. The retail group has been under pressure since personal income has risen 0.4% but spending has risen only by half of that, even though consumer spending is expected to rise when employment is at the peak. Millennials are the new demographic of shoppers who will not spend money on themselves but pay for services like Uber (Private: UBER ) or buy a cellphone. "Those cellphones are their own personal mall and we know from Facebook and from Amazon it is where they do their shopping. That eliminates the impulse buying that comes when you go to the store itself," said Cramer. Good quarters from Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPD ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) show that the internet food chain is strong. The success of internet businesses is overdone in Cramer's opinion. "I see an overreaction occurring right now, where all retailers are getting clipped and I think that is excessive," he said. Retailers cannot be abolished overnight and hence one should buy shares of retailers when they become oversold. They will get too cheap to ignore. CEO interview - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP ) The utilities group has pulled back due to market-wide stock rotation. "Here's the thing, as long as the Federal Reserve stays data driven and deliberative when it comes to raising rates, I bet the utilities will be able to bounce back," said Cramer. American Electric Power has the nation's largest power transmission network serving more than 5M customers in 11 states. The company's earnings missed the estimates by a small margin. Cramer interviewed CEO Nick Akins to hear more about the last quarter and what lies ahead. Akins mentioned that the 13% decline in revenue was due to the weather. "When you look at the weather impact, it was a substantial 11-cents per share. So we are through with the winter, and we are moving into summer and it's still going according to plan. That is why we left guidance the same and that is why we reconfirmed our 4-6% earnings growth rate," he added. Akins also believes that many companies are taking advantage of cheap natural gas including autos, leisure, manufacturing and chemicals. Commenting on the company's unregulated business in Ohio, he was confident that it will not impact the company's dividend. Cabela's (NYSE: CAB ): This stock has a takeover premium. If they have a bad quarter, it will go down. Stay away. Ventas (NYSE: VTR ): They are a great company. Buy the stock if not done already. Ford (NYSE: F ): Cramer thought their quarter was good. This is the beginning of a turn on Ford. Cramer would be a buyer at current prices. Integrated Device Technology (NASDAQ: IDTI ): Their last quarter was weak. Cramer would rather wait for the next quarter to make sure they are doing well. Nokia (NYSE: NOK ): They are re-inventing themselves, but Cramer wouldn't go there as there are better companies.
