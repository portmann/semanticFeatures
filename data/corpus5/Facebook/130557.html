Facebook Earnings Preview: Profit Taking Before Wednesday - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is set to announce Q2 FY15 results on Wednesday, July 29, after the close. We believe Facebook will beat estimates. We are concerned with the company's valuation and the stock's run-up performance in an otherwise flat market. Tech giant Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ) is set to announce Q2 FY15 results on Wednesday, July 29, after the close. The Street is looking for EPS of $0.47 on revenues of $3.98 billion. FB Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts Q1 FY15 results came in weaker-than-expected for FB due to forex headwinds. Revenues increased 41.6% YoY to $3.543 billion based off of a 12.9% increase in MAU to 1.44 billion and 25% increase in ARPU to $2.50. MAU and ARPU trends have been strong of late, especially in Asia-Pacific markets. The main driver behind Facebook's impressive revenues is the company's ads. Facebook's COO explained their plan for improving continued revenues from their ads by improving user interaction with ads, targeting users, and general ad customization. In our view, if Facebook can continue to optimize their ad penetration and feedback, they will have great success reaching similar monetization levels for Instagram and WhatsApp. For Q2 FY15, we have projected revenues using historical growth rates for ARPU and MAU as we have not identified any significant catalyst that should thwart strong ARPU and MAU trends. It is estimated that there are 3 billion internet users in the world, and Facebook's MAU was 1.441 billion MRQ. In our eyes, Facebook's addressable market is currently twice the size of its current user base. Facebook's revenues are segmented into "advertising," and "payments and other fees." To keep our projections simple, we will assume that payments and other fees will stay constant to Q1's number of $226 million. This is consistent with historical data. To get to the Street's revenue estimates, assuming MAU stays constant, ARPU must increase to $2.61. If ARPU is constant, then MAU must grow to 1.5 billion users. If we take a historical MAU growth of ~3%, Q2 FY15 MAU will grow to 1.484 billion, and if we take a historical ARPU growth of ~5%, Q2 FY15 ARPU will increase to $2.62. Taking these projections, our Q2 FY15 advertising revenues come in at $3.89 billion. Next, we have to add back our "payments and other fees" revenue of $226 million to bring net revenues to $4.114 billion, beating estimates by $134 million. We feel that FB's huge scope of products - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus - poise them for further growth moving forward. Our concern, though, is valuation based. Of the 3.2 billion potential internet users, let us say Facebook can net about 2.5 billion MAUs for Facebook/Messenger combined (up from 2 billion MRQ), 1.5 billion MAUs for WhatsApp, and 500 million MAUs for Instagram by 2020, implying net MAUs of 4.5 billion by 2020 (up from roughly 3.1 billion MRQ). Let us assume monetization flows to Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to grow on all platforms to ARPU of roughly $4.00 by 2020. This all implies roughly $72 billion in annual revenues by 2020 ($4 ARPU * 4.5 billion users * 4 quarters). A consistent 20% profit margin implies $14.4 billion in annualized revenue, which equates to EPS of $6.40 on 2.25 billion shares out. If we use analyst consensus estimates for 2015 and 2016 EPS, and then a straight-line CAGR from 2016 EPS to our forecasted $6.40 2020 EPS, then we arrive at fair value of $102 per share. This fair value is derived from a DCF model with 1% perpetuity rate and a 6.42% CAPM discount rate. Our assumptions herein are quite bullish, as we assume that not only does ARPU and MAU for Facebook continue to grow, but also that the company is able to monetize its other platforms as well as grow MAUs for each platform. While these assumptions are not unrealistic, they are bullish. Considering a bullish model lends itself to an intrinsic value of $102 per share, we are not particularly bullish on FB's current valuation as we feel it does not equip investors with favorable asymmetry heading into earnings. We were proponents of the stock earlier in the year, but are now worried about the company's steep valuation. All that said, Facebook could deliver a blowout quarter and shares could pop, ignoring the stock's rich valuation. This, however, does not seem like a shrewd investment, and as such, we are profit-taking before FB announces this week.
