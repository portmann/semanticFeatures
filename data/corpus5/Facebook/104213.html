ETF Hub Jul  1 2015, 19:23 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Furthering its efforts to challenge YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) as a video hub, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) plans to roll out Suggested Videos, a feature that (using an algorithm) recommends new videos for a user to watch that are related to one just seen. The feature will be tested for "a few months" before fully launching. In addition, starting in the fall, Facebook plans to give content providers such as the NBA and Fox Sports a 55% revenue cut (on par with YouTube's) for ads run against Suggested Videos. The news comes a day after Facebook began giving advertisers the option to only pay for video ads that have been watched for at least 10 seconds, and less than two months after the launch of Instant Articles , for which Facebook is allowing publishers to keep all of the ad revenue produced by their content. With over 4B daily views for its autoplay videos and plenty of high-profile publishers sharing videos with followers, Facebook has already become a major indirect threat to YouTube, even if its video library and discovery features aren't yet comparable. In recent months, the company has begun letting users embed hosted videos on other sites, and has also added a Videos tab for Facebook Pages. Last month, RBC predicted video ads (carry much higher per-view prices than display ads) would account for a majority of Facebook's ad revenue over the long run. Video ad tech platform LiveRail was acquired last summer . Remember folks, Youtube has never made a profit either, and is already a far superior video delivery service than FB will ever be.  And starting very soon all FB and GOOG datamining will be banned or severely restricted on Apple's IOS, so that will immediately cut by 30%+ all revenues for both companies.  The market has not priced this in yet but will be sooner or later. And right now FB is so overvalued it appears to be the perfect BIG SHORT. The real value of FB is no more than $30 per share. So beware and hold this stock at your own risk. Bjnflix by saying "youtube has never made a profit either" you are implying that facebook does not profit from video adds. What is your justification / source for making such a claim? You're far too blind to the realities facing Apple, which is why you continually bleat—to the point of boredom—about how unfair Wall Street treats AAPL. But your pessimism about the remainder of tech remains well-founded. You just need to apply that pessimism to AAPL, as they will be going down like everyone else before the end of 2016. Apple needs or will need FB to keep growing. A market of 1,4 bl worldwide smartphones or tablets users you have to be stupid to disattend.
