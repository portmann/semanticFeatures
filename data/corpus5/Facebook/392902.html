Zuck's Facebook Coup - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Facebook (FB) , Includes: AAPL , ABT , AET , APO , BXLT , CMCSA , DWA , EVR , GOOG , GOOGL , HUM , JPM , MDVN , ORCL , QLIK , SHPG , SNY , STJ , TEX , TFM , TWTR , TXTR , UVXY Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) founder Mark Zuckerberg is creating a third share class in order to maintain control of the $344 billion publicly-traded company. He plans to give away most of the economic value of his Facebook shares to his foundation. At the same time, the new share class arrangement will let him keep voting control. Today, he has 60% of the vote due to the dual share class structure. In solidifying his control into the future, he is following the route laid out by the Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ) founders. This gets poor marks for corporate governance, but Zuckerberg should be judged on a net basis (just like anyone else). By that standard, he is more than friendly to his public shareholders. Google and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) suffered in a quarter when Facebook thrived. Revenue is booming and Zuckerberg's big M&A bets from Instagram to WhatsApp are paying off. If anyone deserves to steal the vote, it is Mark Zuckerberg. Why is he changing the share classes?

Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes a long-term commitment, not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. We're focused on the long term, and that's the main reason for today's proposal. Abbot (NYSE: ABT ) is buying St. Jude (NYSE: STJ ) in a $25 billion cash and stock deal.
