Disney Has Received Multiple Upward EPS Revisions, And Goes Ex-Dividend This Week - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Double Dividend Stocks , Double Dividend Stocks (2,313 clicks) Disney recently declared its second semi-annual dividend of $.71, which goes ex-dividend this week. There's a long-term option play that pays $10.50, in addition to Disney's dividends, for a potential 11% yield. Disney has beaten analysts' consensus EPS estimates for the past 4 quarters. This is the latest in our recent series of articles that illustrates options selling as a way to increase your yield on dividend stocks that may not have a very high dividend yield, such as GE (NYSE: GE ), or, alternatively, to create some income on non-dividend paying stocks, such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). In most of these articles, we've listed options trades with an expiration date that's around 3-5 months out. However, since Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ), is now paying 2 semi-annual dividends, one in December, and the other in July, we took a look at how Disney's long-term LEAP options that expire in January 2017 would compare to its most recent semi-annual dividend payouts. Dividends: Up until 2015, Disney had been declaring an annual dividend in late November/early December. However, in fiscal 2015, it changed its policy to paying 2 semi-annual dividends, the first one of which went ex-dividend on 7/1/15, and paid $.66. The second semi-annual dividend pays $.71 and goes ex-dividend on 12/10/15, with a pay date of 1/11/16. DIS has a very impressive 5-year dividend growth rate of over 40%, but its trailing dividend yield is only 1.22%, hence our curiosity in seeing if we could improve upon this yield via selling options. Options: To be sure, even though this option trade doesn't expire until January 2017, if your strategy is strictly long term, then this idea may not be for you. For example, Disney's price/share has risen over 20% in the past year, so covered call sellers would have missed out on some of those price gains. The million dollar question, of course, can DIS do it again in 2016? There has been much debate about the company's highly profitable ESPN cable franchise, due to lower subscription rates, which has helped to depress Disney's price/share over the past month: Given all of the potential uncertainty the market faces in 2016 -- how many Fed rate hikes, the 2016 US elections, etc., it might make sense to hedge one's bet. This January 2017 covered call trade has a $115.00 strike, which currently pays a bid of $10.50, around 5x the amount of Disney's next 3 projected dividends. It's $3.06 above Disney's $111.94 price/share, so you would have room for some potential price gains. Since we don't know how large a dividend DIS will declare in July and December 2016, we've just added the current December 2015 $.71 dividend, plus a repeat of the $.66 July 2015 dividend, and a repeat of the December $.71 dividend, in 2016, for a total of $2.08. Could DIS pay more than that? Absolutely, given their dividend growth history. However, the $115 strike price would compensate you $3.06/share if your shares get assigned/sold before the ex-dividend dates.

(NYSE: A ) If DIS doesn't rise above $115.00 before the 3 ex-dividend dates or before expiration, your profit would be $12.58, which includes the dividend $ and option $. You'd keep your shares. (NYSE: B ) If DIS does rise above $115.00 before the 3 ex-dividend dates, your profit would be $13.56, the $10.50 in option $ and the $3.06 difference in price between the price/share and the $115.00 strike price. Your shares would be assigned/sold. (NYSE: C ) This scenario is also possible, given that this a 14-month trade, you may be able to collect all 3 dividends, and still have your shares assigned for a $3.06 profit/share, for a total profit of $15.64, if DIS rises above $115.00 after all 3 ex-dividend dates. However, this is probably the least likely of these 3 potential outcomes. Puts: DIS also has attractive long-term put option yields. This January $110.00 put option pays $11.25, but you won't receive any dividends, since you don't need to own the stock to sell puts against it. The caveat here is that you have to be willing to buy DIS at $110.00/share, since it will get "put," sold to you if DIS goes much lower than $110.00. However, your cost will be $98.75, $110.00 minus the $11.25 in put option $ you received. Put option assignments tend to happen closer to the expiration date. Analysts' Estimates: DIS has received 17 upward EPS revisions for fiscal 2016 from analysts over the past 30 days, and 12 for fiscal 2017. It has also beaten analysts' consensus EPS estimates over the past 4 quarters. The buzz surrounding the upcoming 12/18/15 release the new Star Wars movie has been intense, and promises to be a blockbuster for Disney -- the teaser trailer had 110 million downloads. (Source: Disney 2015 Annual Report) Here's an oddity, though -- with 25 analysts covering this stock, you'd think that there'd be a closer price target range, but there isn't. There's a $56 dollar spread between the lowest target and the highest one: Valuations: You can't really say that DIS is undervalued on a trailing P/E basis, but its forward estimated P/E is going in the right direction. However, even a Forward P/E of 18 is at the high end of Disney's 5-year P/E range. The consensus estimate for 2016 EPS growth would represent 15.71% growth, which is still impressive, for a mature company of Disney's size. However, it doesn't look undervalued on a PEG basis: Disney's Media Networks and Consumer Products segments had the best margins in fiscal 2015: All of the company's segments had positive growth in fiscal 2015, with Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products leading the way -- keep clamoring for that "Frozen" and "Avengers" merchandise kids!
