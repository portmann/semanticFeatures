Apple Has A Bright Future - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Q2 FY2016 earnings results and revenue guidance for the June quarter marks the end of an era. The iPhone's growth trajectory shows increasing maturity. Despite current growth problems, I remain confident in the company's executive team, premium strategy, and product pipeline. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Q2 FY2016 earnings results and revenue guidance for the June quarter marks the end of an era. The company has reported the first year-over-year sales drop in iPhone's history, and forecasts another decline in sales. Even if we avoid the tough iPhone 6 comparisons from 2015 and look at year-over-two-years sales growth, my iPhone Q3 FY2016 unit estimate based on Apple's guidance would still show one of the slowest iPhone growth rates on record. Management refers to economy and currency headwinds, yet at the same time, sticking with the Q3 FY2014 comparison, Apple now benefits from having 3 new iPhone models, including 2 larger form factors, a new lower price point with the iPhone SE, and extended distribution reach in developing countries. There is more to iPhone demand than just the macroeconomic factors and tough comparisons. The growth trend clearly reveals the increasing level of iPhone's maturity, and suggests it will be more and more difficult to achieve further growth for Apple's most important product. The very fact that the current talking point regarding iPhone's growth has centered on India shows just how much the product has matured over time. We are now at a stage where iPhone has 200,000+ POS, 40 SKUs, 7 different price points, and features so advanced that they increasingly over serve its user base. All of this is set in a mature smartphone environment where most of the growth in developed markets has been extracted, the Chinese economy is slowing down (Apple went from 81% sales growth in the year-ago quarter to an 11% decline in Q2 FY2016), and there are questions whether future growth in markets like India can even offset declines elsewhere. Adding up to bad news, sales of the iPad and Mac are declining, the Apple Watch is only being established in the very young wearables market, and the healthy and growing services business doesn't quite fit AAPL's hardware narrative on Wall Street. Carl Icahn's exit from the stock then only underlines the current situation. Despite current problems with growth, I have confidence in Apple's leadership, strategy, and product pipeline. I understand it is unnerving when a corporation hits a bump, and tempting to call for an immediate solution and suggest actions like changing the leadership and/or strategy, engaging in large M&As, or being more like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) which seemingly introduce new products on a monthly basis. However, such thinking conveniently ignores several important facts: It has been Tim Cook's executive team and its focused, premium product approach that have led Apple to record sales and profits year after year. The context of the company's current problems points to product maturity, not issues within Apple. Apple's new products and services like Apple Watch, Apple Pay, and Apple Music are very successful in their respective categories and in absolute terms, but viewed as lackluster when compared to the blockbuster success of the iPhone - the most successful and profitable technology product of all time. The more experimental, broader, and open product development approach of the likes of Google and Amazon is attractive from the media's point of view, however, such a strategy often results in high-profile failures like Google Glass or Amazon Fire Phone. This would not be sustainable for Apple's premium brand and its key component - customer trust. At the end of the day, Apple's narrow product portfolio generates more profit than all FANG companies combined. Company's big ramp-up in R&D, hiring talent from the automotive industry, recent large real estate transactions, as well as various leaks strongly hint that Apple is working on a connected electric vehicle. As far as new product categories go, I don't think it can get any better than that. Apple's culture and focused product strategy is better suited for smaller acquisitions, targeting talent and technology that fit into the existing product plans. I don't think that Apple needs a significant change in leadership and strategy. Apple's capital return program may give investors the best hint about the future of the company. Apple has again expanded the program , adding $50B to the total program size of $250B, and extending the timeframe to March 2018. The CRP consists of dividends and share repurchases, with the majority of the program allocated for the stock buyback. I understand that as management having high confidence in the sustainability of the current product portfolio, and in the prospects of the future product line-up. Dividends. Apple has again increased its dividend by ~10%, and, as per CFO Luca Maestri, plans for further annual increases going forward. Despite current revenue growth problems, the company is still a big cash flow machine, having generated $10.5B of profit in the last quarter alone. The iPhone business may be maturing, however the smartphone remains the most important computing category with much room left for innovation. The iPhone business is very likely to remain relevant for many more years, and will continue to generate strong cash flows for the company, fueling investments in future products and the CRP. Stock Repurchase Program. Apple continues buying back its stock, having now completed $117B of the $175B share repurchase authorization. This suggests, and Luca Maestri confirms as much, that the company is highly confident in its future product line-up and the value of its stock. Apple plans to enter a brand new category with its rumored connected vehicle and its potential is not yet reflected in the share price. Apple has hit a sales growth bump, but this has to do more with the maturity of its key products rather than with fundamental flaws in the company's leadership and product strategy. Apple has a bright future and the company's capital return program may be its best summary: continuing strong cash flows from existing products and an exciting future in new product categories, namely in re-imagining personal transportation.
