ETF Hub Apr 18 2015, 17:18 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor WhatsApp (NASDAQ: FB ) has surpassed 800M monthly active users (MAUs) 3 months after reaching 700M , co-founder/CEO Jan Koum shares on his Facebook page . Given the pace of growth, the world's most popular mobile messaging platform has a good shot of reaching 1B before year's end. The disclosure comes 3 weeks after WhatsApp began supporting VoIP calls on its Android app (iOS support is on the way), a move that makes it an even bigger headache for carriers who have seen WhatsApp eat into their SMS cash cow - over 30B WhatsApp messages are now sent daily , topping global SMS traffic of 20B/day. In spite of the friction, WhatsApp has struck deals with dozens of carriers, often for providing unlimited access to its services for a small monthly fee. WhatsApp's MAU base is ~200M larger than Facebook Messenger's, which recently topped 600M; Instagram has over 300M MAUs, and Facebook proper had 1.39B at the end of Q4. Whereas Facebook launched a 3rd-party app platform for Messenger last month, WhatsApp, which is mostly monetized via $1/year subscription fees charged in some markets, has no plans to launch something similar. Its mobile messaging share is huge in Europe and various emerging markets (e.g. India, Brazil), but relatively small in the U.S., Japan, and China. Meanwhile ahead of Facebook's Wednesday Q1 report, ad partner Nanigans has reported a 17% Q/Q and 260% Y/Y increase in its customers' Facebook ad click rates (CTRs). Their ad prices fell 17% Q/Q and rose 4% Y/Y for ads sold on a cost per click (CPC) basis, and fell 3% Q/Q and rose 273% Y/Y for ads sold on a cost per 1K impression (CPM) basis. While seasonality played a role in the Q/Q drops, it's worth noting e-commerce ad CPCs were also down 14% Y/Y; gaming CPCs and e-commerce/gaming CPMs were all up strongly Y/Y. Video ad spend among Nanigans clients rose 180% Q/Q, as Facebook continues ramping video ad products launched last year . Spending on multi-product ads (launched last summer, support 3-5 images and links) rose 420% Q/Q. You think the shorts are through then... I'm not so sure. Great quarters have not produced immediate results before, but I hope you are right as I am long FB. Agree. Anecdotally, look around you, almost everybody seem to be using facebook. I like to point out though that unbeknownst to s lot of Americans, Wechat is nipping at its heels. The numbers are almost as large, and is growing fast in Asian countries. The chat is technologically more advanced in functions and use compared to whatsapp. Chatting apps come and go. Every few years we see a new dominant app and the older ones die slowly. Props to Facebook for keeping this app alive still but.. for how long. After all its just an app. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
