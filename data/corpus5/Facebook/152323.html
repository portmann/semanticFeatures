Livetext Can Help Yahoo Replicate The Success Of Snapchat And Line - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo hopes to make a return in the messaging apps arena with the global release of its video-messaging app, Livetext. Livetext is a hybrid app that combines the best features of Snapchat and Twitterâ€™s Periscope. Last month, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) used a Tumblr post to announce the release of its latest mobile messaging app, Livetext in the United States, Germany, Canada, U.K., Canada, and France. Yahoo has also launched Livetext in other countries six days ago . The new video messaging app is courtesy of the 8-man team behind MessageMe, which Yahoo bought last October. MessageMe was a smartphone app that was somehow similar to the older version of WhatsApp (no calls/video) before Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) bought it. Before Yahoo shut it down, MessageMe enjoyed 5 million Android/iOS users. Livetext is now the reincarnation of MessageMe … and it might just help Yahoo replicate the success of Snapchat . Livetext's most distinctive feature is that it doesn't offer voice calls and its video chatting feature is bereft of audio. Instead of typing text messages over the static photo of your friend (like on Snapchat), Livetext lets you type out text messages on top of the live video feed from the camera of your chat mate's smartphone. Livetext is therefore also similar to the live video streaming of Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) Periscope app. The combination of silent video streaming while chatting via text only conversations could be a differentiating feature that could help Livetext attract users. Yahoo acqui-hired the people who created MessageMe because the company's alleged plan to invest in Snapchat last year did not materialize. The failed negotiations instead led Marissa Mayer to MessageMe - which itself was allegedly also a target for acquisition by Snapchat. Yahoo's eagerness to release a new messaging app is understandable. There is serious money to be made for tech/web companies to have their own popular mobile instant messaging platform. Line Corporation's mobile messaging app suite generated $656 million in revenue last year, a 126% Y/Y increase over 2013's $338 million. Line achieved this by selling cute stickers , VOIP minutes, and in-app game items to its 189 million users. The long-term stickiness of messaging apps users is why WhatsApp and Snapchat now have $19 billion valuation . On a long-term basis, people do really spend more time on their messaging apps than on other activities when using their mobile devices. The 12-month user retention rate of messaging apps is 62%, which is way higher than the average 11% user retention rate for other mobile applications. Snapchat and Line also made their mobile messaging apps into digital wallets. They now allow their users to send/receive money and shop online for things. Line Corporation has become the sixth-top grossing mobile games publisher too, thanks to its early decision to build an app store within its messaging ecosystem. Line makes around $200 million /quarter from selling virtual items to its users who play games when they are not chatting. Livetext is now also replacement app for Yahoo Messenger users. The mobile version of Yahoo Messenger was still popular among tablet/smartphone users in the U.S. last year. However, Yahoo's removal of the bug-laden (and was infrequently updated) Messenger app from the iOS app store meant iPhone and iPad users have abandoned it for good. Snapchat users and Periscope-using fans might try Livetext because of its unique one-to-one (no group chats) text-only chat service. However, Livetext might not find warm welcome from some diehard loyalists of Yahoo Messenger like me. I can tolerate the lack of voice/video calling in Livetext. However, I am still not sold on this app because, while it allowed me to use my old Yahoo Messenger account to log in, it did not let me add friends from my existing Yahoo contacts list. This might be one of the reasons why Livetext's download count went downhill after it was released last July 30. The ability to add friends from our Yahoo (or MessageMe) contacts list is a great important feature that should be implemented on the next update of Livetext. Livetext is a unique video messaging app that gives Yahoo another chance to benefit from the monetization potential of messaging apps. Livetext user count catching up with Snapchat and Line is no longer a possibility. Those two are growing their user base even faster than WhatsApp is doing now. On the other hand, growing a solid base of users for Livetext, say 20 to 40 million monthly active users, could still help Yahoo increase the target audience for its growing $ 1.2 billion/year mobile advertising business. Livetext could also be a vehicle for Yahoo to create a mobile digital wallet and an app store business like what Line did. Disclosure: I am/we are long YHOO, FB.
