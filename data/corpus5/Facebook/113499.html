Facebook Suggested Videos Isn't A Legitimate Competitor To YouTube - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is creating an ad-supported video model that will clutter news feeds with suggested videos. YouTube is a much stronger platform for content creators as it's easier to build an audience organically and the placement of content is much more democratic. Finally, I don't think the new ad-sharing model will win over more established content creators or move the needle much for shareholders. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is in the initial stages of releasing a revenue sharing video model in which they'll split revenue 45/55 (with Facebook taking 45% and partners taking 55%). The suggested content will come from partnered content creators like Fox Sports and the NBA. However, this strategy is unlikely to hurt Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) by much, because YouTube is simply the most dominant video viewing platform. Sure, Facebook video has grown, but it's not designed to scale the way YouTube allows content creators to expand, grow and build an audience over time. Google's moat in crowd-sourced video is hard to compete with, even for an established platform with a huge audience like Facebook. Google has perfected the various algorithms for surfacing relevant content and has worked closely with top YouTube channels to ensure a unique mix of high quality content. Unlike YouTube, Facebook attempts to adjust the signal to noise ratio by filtering content before a user even gets anything into their newsfeed. However, YouTube tends to be pretty agnostic with what it shows a user on the homepage so as long they've subscribed to the various channels. In other words, Facebook inherently puts content creators at a disadvantage via its algorithm, so why bother? There's so much content, and so little attention span, where do you fit in the suggested videos with ads? Unless if they're broadcasted out to a wider number of users, you're limited in reach by the number of friends you have or the number of followers. Furthermore there's a cap on the number of friends you can have, which is set at 5,000, and the Facebook Pages don't do anything for advertisers or content producers because Facebook doesn't surface that content on user's newsfeeds. The only way for someone to earn money is if the algorithm picks up on a trending video and a ton of people share in response to how funny or insightful the videos is. But even then, that's not going to woo any of the major YouTube stars nor is it going to get the Vine stars over onto Facebook either. In other words, Facebook has to compete with YouTube directly, but given the constraints of the platform, there's low probability of success or scalability for anyone wanting to make a living off of Facebook videos. In other words, just because FB boasts impressive video statistics does not mean the individual partners will be successful. On the Internet we often hear about the kid on Vine (NYSE: TWTR ) who gets paid a couple thousand dollars per video just to include a product, or in the case of YouTube you have multi-millionaire independent video creators who have built a following, i.e. Michelle Phan, PewDewPie, Bethany Mota, Justin Bieber. Yeah, I included Bieber because he became famous thanks to YouTube then blew up once he got a record label to get behind him. The point is, YouTube and Vine have a consistent track record of shooting out super stars, whereas Facebook is more for the community oriented guy who needs a way to plug into his social life while he stalks grandma on a Saturday afternoon and his girlfriend later into the night. It's not a place for people who want to build a strong online presence nor is it going to generate the kind of additional revenue that will lift the eyebrows of investors. The stock really hasn't reacted that much to the news either, so it's an attention-grabbing story, but in reality, Facebook isn't really in any position to knock YouTube off of its lofty pedestal. Also, the content will be dropped at random into everybody's Facebook feed. My guess? People won't want to see content that they have not first subscribed to. Also, building an organic audience on Facebook is next to impossible, hence YouTube is a great place for aspiring video bloggers, and will continue to be. So to conclude, I still think Facebook is a great stock to own and invest into. But I don't see its recent move in videos adding much value to shareholders. Google on the other hand is still expensive for my tastes, but it still owns dominant web and mobile properties, so you can't complain about the durability of Google's earnings.
