Facebook Will Win The 2016 Election - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Anthony Ruben , Inflection Point Consulting (653 clicks) If Ben Carson has placed 240 separate ads on FB, imagine what the more media savvy candidates are doing. 2016 is expected to be the most expensive election cycle in history (local and national, primary and general election). Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) just finished another strong quarter, earning $0.57/share ahead of the consensus estimate of $0.52/share (which was above Q2 earnings of $0.50/share. In Q4, the company is expected to earn $0.67/share, an estimate which grew from $0.63/share in the past week. In the last 30 days, there have been 48 estimate changes - 100% of the estimate changes were positive. As the company has put points on the board, the stock has responded, up 37% since the beginning of the year and 10% since post-Q2 earnings. Clearly, FB is clearly on a roll. In 2016, FB is expected to earn $6.5 billion ($2.85/share), 32% more than the $4.9 billion ($2.16/share) the company is expected to earn in 2015. It is my belief that the 2016 estimates materially underestimate the impact of political spending on FB's earnings. FB COO, Sheryl Sandberg, in talking about Q3 political advertising in the recent conference call noted, "over 68 million people (or about one-third of domestic FB users) on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate and every member of Congress is on Facebook now." More relevant to earnings, she said, "We offer something pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with very unique targeting. So on Facebook, you can target an ad by district, by interest. Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences, and so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise, and to share." Read this again, Ben Carson, who I'm betting is not running the most tech-savvy campaign, has 240 separate ads on Facebook. The Iowa caucuses are February 1, with three other primaries later in the month. Unless all of the Republicans and Bernie Sanders drop out of the race, Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 are going to be huge for Facebook. In 2014, Borrell Associates estimates social media will get about $1 billion , or 9.5% of political media spending . Citibank analysts recently wrote (Source: BusinessInsider.com ), "In our conversations with industry sources, an overriding theme across all conversations was that Facebook and Google will be the largest recipients of political digital ad spend over the 2016 cycle." In an August article (" Facebook: Political Advertising Will Drive Victory in 2016 "), I postulated that political spending could add another $0.17/share or $390 million to 2016 earnings. The previous estimate was based on political advertising revenues of $600 million. However, after reading the Q3 conference call transcript, and seeing how the 2016 election season is shaping up to be the most aggressively (financially) contested of all time, I think my previous projections are light. The Borrell projections were reported in Q2 2014, since that time 1) not only has the penetration of social media continued its relentless advance, 2) FB has "proven" the model and the 2016 and 3) the 2016 election cycle is showing every sign of being the most aggressively contested (for president, of course, but also for House and Senate races). FB's social media revenue has consistently beat projections. Along the same vein, I think the $1 billion social media number is light - $1.5 billion (which would still be less than 20% of total 2016 spending) is a more accurate figure. Assuming FB gets "only" 50% of the spend, the company should receive $750 million in incremental revenue and close to $500 million earnings (an extra $0.22/share in earnings). If my thesis is correct, political spending will be a big driver of Q1 2016 earnings, with a sense of the magnitude becoming known on the Q4 (full year) earnings release/conference call. I would expect the impact on Q4 to be discussed by Ms. Sandberg or Mr. Zuckerberg along with a sense of Q1 (well underway at the time of the call). With FB trading for about 38x forward, it's hard to see the stock as a screaming Buy. However, the company continues to show positive momentum on almost all fronts and, if I am correct, has a material upside "surprise" from political spending.
