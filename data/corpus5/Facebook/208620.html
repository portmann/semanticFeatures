Can Facebook Challenge YouTube's Digital Video Domination? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is making significant moves to integrate video in its platform. Video views and content uploaded on Facebook are growing rapidly. Compared to YouTube, Facebook offers advertisers and content creators broader reach potential for their videos via network effects. Watching videos online has, in recent years, become almost synonymous with 'going on YouTube'. While such a degree of market domination would probably justify a hint of a sense of security for most companies, most companies aren't witnessing the biggest social media platform in the world planning to devour a large piece of their pie. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) recently announced that it would begin testing: A dedicated place on Facebook for people to go when they exclusively want to watch video - whether that's videos they've saved for later, or videos from friends, Pages they follow, and other video publishers on Facebook. This new videos section helps people discover, watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them. It can be accessed by tapping a "Videos" icon at the bottom of the Facebook app on iPhone or in the "Favorites" section on the left-hand side of News Feed on the web. While Facebook is still far from challenging Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube when it comes to watching videos, the growth of its daily video views is nonetheless impressive, climbing from 3 to 4 billion within a quarter. Needless to say that the market in stake is constantly growing. According to a recent worldwide study by Millward Brown, people aged between 16 and 45 that have both a TV and a smartphone/tablet spend equal time watching videos on the two mediums. If we narrow the segment down to the so-called 'Milennials', digital video is already the number 1 choice. So what other moves is Facebook making to make their user experience more video-friendly? Two new features particularly stand out. While they may not seem like the most ground-breaking changes in the world, most Facebook users can easily understand how important they are. One of the key characteristics of the Facebook experience is the scrolling down of the newsfeed. It is quite often the case, however, that you don't have time to read the X interesting-looking article or the Y funny-looking video you will stumble upon in that journey. While the 'Save' feature which debuted last year was meant to address this issue, it didn't catch on as much as was hoped. Since last summer Facebook has been testing a more prominent 'Watch Later' feature, in a more direct attempt to boost video viewing. From the look of it, it will be integrated within the aforementioned space dedicated to video. The second change is also related to the scrolling down nature of the platform. While going down your newsfeed you may want to play a video but hesitate if it means you will have to stop your scrolling. Well, problem solved, or at least it will soon be solved, since Facebook is testing a feature that will allow you to watch a video in a floating window while continuing your browsing. Both these features, it should be noted, already exist on YouTube. Another long overdue move was announced a few months ago as well, namely the beginning of ad-revenue sharing with content creators. This generates a massive incentive for unique content creation, although it remains to be seen how exactly it will play out, given that Facebook does not, at the moment, offer the traditional type of pre-roll ads YouTube does. Speaking of content, YouTube has more reasons to worry. Although Facebook was always the main pipeline for video sharing, the actual videos being shared were, up until recently, mainly YouTube videos. This trend is shifting drastically. According to Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research: Facebook offers advertisers and content creators a type of value that YouTube lacks: It serves videos to users, instead of relying on users' discovering them. If you want to search for a specific video, there is no doubt that YouTube is and will, at least for the nearby future, be the place to be. But allowing your video to gain a foothold in users' newsfeeds holds the potential for much broader reach. This connects partly to the fact that user interaction with videos via Facebook is much more common. People are much more accustomed to liking content and commenting on it on Facebook when compared to YouTube. And the network effects that can be generated (e.g. a video a friend liked appears on your newsfeed) is exponentially larger. In conclusion, while it might appear that YouTube's position as leader in the digital video market is unchallengeable, Facebook possesses the assets required to grab a big part of its pie. While it is still too soon to make specific predictions, there are good reasons to expect that it will acquire a significant market share in the coming years, further leveraging its uniquely strong mobile presence and generating a massive new revenue stream.
