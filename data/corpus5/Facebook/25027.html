Facebook Messenger Makes MagicJack A Good Short Candidate - magicJack VocalTec Communications Ltd. (NASDAQ:CALL) | Seeking Alpha Facebook will either expand its VoIP services or simply expand its Messenger service into business-to-customer communication. These expansions are bad for magicJack as the firm can't even compete with products such as Viber. The high churn rate will continue as Facebook provides more competition. This will cause the stock to continue to collapse this year. In this article I will explain why shorting magicJack (NASDAQ: CALL ) is a good position to take. I have detailed in past articles why magicJack is not going to be able to grow its earnings as the last earnings report was horrid. Recently the stock has moved upwards by about 7% making now another great time to initiate a short position or simply sell shares. This recent increase is likely a dead-cat bounce. My motivation for writing this article comes from my research on Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) F8 conference. Facebook's possible VoIP initiative and its Messenger initiative are two new catalysts that will crush magicJack this year. I will detail these initiatives and explain why they are negative for magicJack in this article. The major problem of competition is going to be the downfall of magicJack. As you can tell from Facebook's presentations, management wants to become more involved with online communication. This is why it separated the Messenger app from the big blue app and it is why WhatsApp was purchased. If I was an investor in magicJack I would be very worried that Facebook could destroy the business quickly. At the F8 conference Facebook mentioned that 10% of worldwide VoIP calls are on Facebook. This is impressive because only basic calling features are offered and users can only call people who have messenger. Its success probably is due to the popularity of the app and the fact that it is free. The question is whether or not Facebook decides to actually enter the market further and offer more features, making it fully competitive with magicJack, Viber, Skype, Vonage (NYSE: VG ) and other VoIP services. Besides having VoIP on Messenger, Facebook has recently added this feature to its WhatsApp texting app. Considering the fact that this new feature has been added after Facebook bought WhatsApp, it gives you the clue that Facebook feels voice calling should be a priority for the company. WhatsApp has 700 million monthly active users. It is free for the first year of service and costs $.99 per year afterwards. The free VoIP feature currently is only on the latest version of the app on the Android PlayStore, but it makes sense to assume that this feature will be rolling out onto other platforms in the future. By owning both WhatsApp and Messenger, it is possible that in the near future Facebook may control over 20% of VoIP calls. Obviously, this is not good news for magicJack. (click to enlarge) Facebook may not go in the direction of a premium VoIP at all, but it can still hurt magicJack with its new messaging features. As I have stated in a previous article people are communicating less over the phone. According to a survey done by HeyWire , 53% of those aged 18-34 prefer electronic media (email, web chat, text, or social) to the phone for customer support. This directly eats into magicJack's small business initiative. This is an important category that it sells to as the average consumer may choose non-HD voice phone calls if the option is free instead of having to pay for high quality sound. Paying up for a better service makes sense for businesses, but if the customer prefers texting with the business for support then the second phone line purchased from magicJack becomes unnecessary. 52% of overall respondents in the survey stated that they would likely text with a customer support agent. Obviously messaging on a company website has existed for many years. Facebook revolutionized this communication with its Messaging service for businesses. It essentially kills off the phone call that people have with a business. The Facebook management team was correct when they stated that no one actually enjoys talking of the phone with a customer support representative. The great thing about Messenger is that small businesses will be able to easily sign up. Facebook demonstrated the new service with Everlane which is a clothing retailer. The fact that a clothing retailer was the first to sign up shows how easy it is to sign up. Most small businesses already have a Facebook page, so this would be a product extension for Facebook. Messenger personifies companies. It simplifies the ordering process because instead of several emails being sent to the customer, it simply is added as a conversation on Messenger. Instead of calling the firm about a product question or a change in an order, the customer can simply ask a question in the conversation. I see the impact of Facebook Messenger for Business to be adopted much in the way Apple Pay has been rolling out. Apple created a great product that makes payment easier. It needed to get companies to sign on to the services. Some agreed and some decided not to accept it. Apple Pay only works on iPhone so it is a closed system. Messenger also will need to get stores to sign up for its product. It's a product that makes communication between customers and businesses easier. Some companies will sign up and some won't. The reason why some businesses won't sign up is that they may have an issue with Facebook being able to access a private conversation between customer services reps and the consumer. Messenger is closed in the sense that only people with the app can use the service. The app is free and has 600 million MUAs, so it is definitely more open than Apple Pay. Apple Pay has been a successful product so far, so Messenger being compared to it implies a great amount of adoption and usage. As you can see, whether Facebook goes after a paid VoIP service or simply expands Messenger for Business, the encroachment on magicJack's turf seems likely. magicJack hasn't even been able to deal with services such as Viber, so obviously a titan in the tech space may spell the end for the company. I know that magicJack is a small company that has a much smaller budget for R&D than Facebook does, but the firm needs to show vision if it wants to compete in this space. The firm's app has had zero growth in the past few quarters because it isn't being improved enough. Bullish investors point to the large cash hoard that the firm has as a reason to purchase the stock, but investors shouldn't buy it just for the cash if the stock is being valued at higher than the $4.25 cash value. A viable business must exist or else the $20 million that it is spending on buybacks will be money that is wasted. I think the stock is a short, but if you are holding the stock I would be fed up with the complacency of the management team. Improvements in the service and advancements in the app must be made if subscriber growth is the goal. It seems as if the management is willing to ride this company into the ground and collect money on the subscribers as long as it can. My reasoning behind this opinion is the fact that new pricing plans were the only new launch discussed on the conference call . I think it is clear now that there never was a turnaround in the business last year. Management piggybacked off investors' excitement about the stock last year, specifically Whitney Tilson's bullish call. It caused some investors to mention the possibility of it being acquired. These ended up being completely reckless predictions as the hype wore down and the business continued to decline. This is a perfect case study on investor sentiment. In reality nothing has materially changed about the company in the past 14 months, but the stock has collapsed lower as investors have come to realize what was happening with the business all along. The key to a turnaround would be a lowering churn rate, but before that happened management would have to lay out a plan to improve the value that it provides customers. I have zero faith that this management team will do that, so that's why I am recommending that the stock be shorted.
