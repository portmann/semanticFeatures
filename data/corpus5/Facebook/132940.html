ETF Hub Jul 29 2015, 19:05 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) annual revenue growth rate - 39% in Q2, 42% in Q1 - will continue declining this year, CFO Dave Wehner forecast on the earnings call. As it is, the Q3 revenue growth consensus is at 35.8%, the 2015 consensus at 37.3%, and the 2016 consensus at 34%. ( live blog ) Wehner also stated Facebook is narrowing its 2015 GAAP cost/expense growth guidance to 55%-60% from 55%-65%. Also, the 2015 capex budget has been cut by $200M to $2.5B-$3B (still up from $1.8B last year). Mark Zuckerberg disclosed Facebook now handles over 1.5B searches/day - the company overhauled its search engine in late 2014 - and has indexed over 2T posts. Zuck also mentioned the average Facebook user is spending more than 46 minutes/day on the platform (not counting WhatsApp), and predicted immersive 3D content (read: Oculus) will be the next big thing after video. Over 450M people use Facebook Events, and over 850M use Groups. Sheryl Sandberg noted Q2 ad revenue growth would've been 55% Y/Y (rather than the reported 43%) if not for a strong dollar. She offered positive comments on the performance of video ads, Instagram ads, and Facebook's recently-launched Buy button, without sharing many specifics. "We continue to get more than one out of every five minutes on smartphones in the U.S." Twitter also reported lower Ad revenue and forecasted lower going forward. Companies across the board will be cutting spending. Could be why it is trading lower. That's the story. Long run, sure, maybe it will weather the storm etc. This is nothing but ad buying. There is no product here. That is not why it is selling off today. But long term this is nothing with nothing. I don't know a single person who ever bought anything from an ad on this site. And i just dont get how one can be happy, mesmerized or glued to Facebook (the website u know where (some) people feel it is important to share every little bit of their miserable life (coz if you REALLY have a great life fulfilled and complete, you really dont have time to post on FB). Google is a bit different in that you need to proactively search for goods and services. This is more of a push based on who you know. Thanks for a sane reply though. The others here are infantile. @ITArchitect - I assume that you are in IT - so, let me give you an analogy there.  You need operational systems to run your business - they are like groceries, cheap margins, good to have. You hardly see an ad for potato, or tomatoes in TV. On the other hand, if are buying analytical software, they are good to have and often times they improve your business. In this case of 'life' people indulge. They buy alcohol based on instincts and based on brands. there is so much the people who want to 'live their lives' buy because their friends have it.  Luxury goods are bought based on interests - this requires brand building.  FB based ads just do that. Yes, I do -  I got elit recently - and I saw several of my friends recommended Kaufmans, which I had never heard off. and I also search for my next vacation destination based on my friends recommendations - and I make my car choice - just the same way . I would rather have 39% growth of $1bil as opposed to 90% growth of $1mil! Obviously as revenue grows, on a percentage basis will have to slow somewhat. Everything was pretty good on the report. The only reason for the pullback is the run up of 24% YTD, plus high expectation into earning. The only negative from the report which may have pulled down the stock price AH is: "Costs and expenses rose 82% in the second quarter with research-and-development costs more than doubling. Facebookâ€™s operating margin shrank to 31%, down from 48% a year ago".
