Facebook: Is Moments The New Version Of Paper? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Is Facebook’s (FB) Moments the new Paper? I think it might be. For those unfamiliar Moments is a stand-alone app that you grant access to your on-device photos; moments then uses face recognition software to silo your photos into convenient categories. At its core Moments does two things and it’s learning to do two things better and better – assist in collaboration and machine learning. I think Facebook is using this to test a future collaboration and communication application, and call me crazy, but I think an app like that could have serious non-consumer use. If you use Slack or you use Intellinote or another collaboration/file sharing application download Moments and tell me the crossover and similarities aren’t striking. Those who follow my coverage of Facebook know that I've equated the failed Paper app initiative to the eventual creation of Instant Articles - Facebook's new push to become a content and inbound marketing powerhouse. I think this is the future of marketing and advertising and that Facebook smartly made the Paper investment into preparing for that future. It also should be noted that it did this long before it made obvious sense to - at a time that the market was seriously asking who was minding the shop. You also know now that I think Facebook's See First is a move into further dialing-in its News Feed in an effort to optimize the effectiveness of its more overt advertisement efforts. In my opinion, See First is an effort to give Facebook some insight into who influences you and who it can leverage into greater add efficacy. For those unfamiliar - Moments is a stand-alone app that you grant access to your on-device photos. Moments then uses face recognition software to silo your photos into convenient categories - mostly separating particular friends into searchable silos but also helping group together events. Still, it's actually quite useless in my opinion. Useless, that is, as a photo sharing and collaboration app - its stated purpose. Moments was created to increase user engagement and to help users with photo tracking. Again, not mission critical issues for the current user base - at least not ones that I'm aware of. But at its core Moments does two things and it's learning to do two things better and better - assist in collaboration and use machine learning. Both are huge for what I think Facebook is using this to test. I think Facebook is using this to test a future collaboration and communication application. And call me crazy, but I think an app like that could have serious non-consumer use. Meaning for business use. Facebook has this desire to be all things to all people - its equity owners share a passion for seeing Facebook satisfy this desire. What Facebook doesn't have is a vehicle that's productive to folks in the one environment where presumably its users are not using its app (although we all know that isn't true) - the workplace. If Facebook can develop a Box (NYSE: BOX )/Dropbox/Slack (because Slack has a well-known and awesome chat interface) type application that can assist in collaboration and/or sharing management is there any excuse not to be on Facebook pretty much all day every day? Think about it. Facebook already has face recognition software on its main platform and it already has messenger/Whatsapp for sharing/collaboration - in fact Whatsapp is used quite often in workplaces. Slack notably replaces it on the SMB side often (at least I can say that anecdotally). In my opinion, because Moments allows Facebook to create privacy walls within the sharing environment, it allows for multiple users (when selected) to collaborate behind a privacy wall, and it allows its algo to make smart suggestions on an automated basis. Its algo also makes smart suggestions using device access which greatly expands the capacity and relevancy of the algo and for the first time takes Facebook "off-platform" and on-device. Facebook making that jump is huge. Obviously I don't think that Moments is the final iteration of whatever Facebook is cooking up and I certainly don't see it going viral - again, as is for photo sharing it's pretty useless. But if you use Slack or you use Intellinote or another collaboration/file sharing application download Moments and tell me the crossover and similarities aren't striking. With Facebook's massive network and absurd influence I just don't know that it wouldn't make sense for it to at least test-pursue something collaboration based - something that's more than simply facilitating the collaboration. Something where it doesn't try to be a value-add and monetize. Again, you won't be overly impressed with Moments but I wasn't overly impressed with Paper yet I love Instant Articles. If I'm right and Moments is the next Trojan Horse at Facebook it could be the start of something very special. Source: Facebook: Is Moments The New Version Of Paper? Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.
