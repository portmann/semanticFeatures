Confirmed: Bidding war drove up Microsoft's offer for LinkedIn - Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) | Seeking Alpha Jul  3 2016, 09:20 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor A bidding war with Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) forced Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to pay nearly $6B extra  last month to seal its planned takeover of LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ). Details of the frenzied bidding were revealed in a filing with the SEC ahead of a shareholder vote to approve the transaction. A month-long back-and-forth between the two rivals pushed the value of the all-cash deal to $26.2B, making it the third-largest acquisition in the tech industry. No wonder paid with Debt Bonds? How does Apple pay for anything? Debt Bonds, because they'd have to pay 40% deferred US Taxes on anything they pulled out of Foreign Offshore Securities Markets! I would assume that this is the same for Microsoft. Who also has much of it's Cash piled up in Foreign Offshore Securities being basically untouchable without paying a 40% Deferred Tax Penalty for spending any of it! Now if money wasn't so cheap with FED lowering rates, that'd be a different story too. Why pull money out of Offshore Securities earning higher interest than what you'd be paying for just using it. Just like hey.... I'd never pay CASH for a new car with Interest Rates near or at Zero. Just use OPM.... Other People's Money for Cheaper! LOL it doesn't even make sense for CRM to buy it. That would be an even stranger marriage. I'd dump CRM just for bidding on it. They get a dumb hat along with Microsoft for the deal. When you over pay it financially impacts the company buying. I'm sure that's not Microsofts situation. LinkedIn is not a Nokoia and Nadella took care of that blunder. Both LinkedIn and Microsoft will compliment each other in there growth of technology. Just sit back and watch. I have invested heavily in MSFT and expect a good return. Msft wildly overpaid. Lnkd worth $75/ sh and that's generous. I predict msft will never earn this money back. Most of LinkedIn is useless and many just use it to socialize like Facebook. Eventually it won't be any different than many websites that came before it. Marginalized. What' s the big deal? it's normal for a seller to solicit as many bids as possible, so as to ensure the highest price.  if MSFT were the only bidder it would raise the question whether the target was worth it. I don't care If I was selling anything I would want multiple buyers I'm struggling to see what the news is? When you're the big dog it's your role to overpay more than the next guy.  Maybe that's why big dog acquisitions almost never work out financially.
