Facebook Becomes What Google Was In The 2000s And Microsoft Was In The 1990s - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook stock is divorced from financial reality. The company continues to try new things as Google did in the last decade. Remember Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) Phone? Of course you do. It was a disaster , a custom "skin" on Android phones that went about as far as Amazon's Fire Phone in the marketplace. Yet Facebook hasn't suffered the way Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has for this failure. The reason is that Facebook, unlike nearly every other big company in Silicon Valley, just keeps trying new stuff. Facebook is Silicon Valley's Peter Pan, refusing to grow up. Just in the last week, Facebook announced moves to host major news sources inside Facebook, to support embedding of videos directly in the platform , and make an entry into the Internet of Things, at its F8 developer conference. These may work, or they may not. Most companies hosting videos wouldn't risk angering Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube in the way Facebook has , but the company seems to relish it. It's for things like this that the stock has become disconnected from financial reality. As I noted recently in comparing the stock to that of Amazon (a piece that was widely panned by commenters ), Facebook's valuation is completely disconnected from financial reality. The company had revenues of $12.5 billion in its most recent year, yet its market cap is $227 billion? Yes, advocates will point out that Facebook brought a Google-like $1 in every $4 last year to the bottom line, and the Price/Earnings multiple of 76 is actually lower than a "staid" company like Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ). But it's still, for a company this size, absurdly high. For many investors today, Facebook is what Google used to be. Facebook shares are up 44% over the last year, while Google's have gone exactly nowhere, down 1%. This is true despite the fact that Facebook is now running TV advertisements , has opened a new headquarters complex and gotten into the crosshairs of European regulators - just like Google. While Google has more than five times the revenue of Facebook ($66 billion vs. $12.5 billion) and almost five times the profit ($14.4 billion vs. Facebook's $2.9 billion), Facebook now has 62% of Google's market cap, trailing it just $227 billion to $366 billion. All this for a company that is, for all intents and purposes, becoming just like Google, only with search tied to people instead of things. Which brings me back to the Facebook phone. Might Facebook try again? Right now it is busy integrating its WhatsApp App into Google Android. But it's also bringing its latest features to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows Phone as quickly as it does Android, including voice calling . Microsoft, which has a market cap of $330 billion, could really use the new momentum if its phone is going to be competitive and not get buried like BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) was due to lack of support. Could a more formal tie-up between Facebook and Microsoft be in the works? I don't know. It's entirely speculative. But the fact is that Facebook is the kind of company that might try something like that. It's making Google look old and Microsoft look ancient. And that, as much as anything, is why investors continue to love the stock.
