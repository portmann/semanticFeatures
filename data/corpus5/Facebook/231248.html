Facebook's Q3 Affirms Growth, Upside To $116 - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (496 clicks) Facebook's investments in its ad business are paying off, and although margins are compressed, we believe Facebook has shown that its spending generates strong revenue and user growth tailwinds. YouTube Red's cannabilization of its free service and loss of some content, notably ESPN content, provides Facebook with an opportunity to upgrade its own video content. In the quarter, Worldwide ARPU growth more-or-less met our expectations, as some geographies performed better than we expected while APAC lagged due to FX headwinds. User growth was very strong during the quarter, and we have hiked up our MAU projections in all but one geography as a result. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) reported a strong Q3 ER that topped estimates across the board. Revenue came in at $4.5 billion, 41% higher than a year ago and above the consensus for $4.37 billion. Ad revenue grew a better-than-expected 45% Y/Y to $4.3 billion. The company continued its mobile dominance, with mobile DAUs growing 27% Y/Y to 894 million and mobile MAUs growing 23% Y/Y to 1.39 billion. Facebook's investments in its ad business are paying off hugely, and although margins are compressed, we believe Facebook has shown that its spending generates strong revenue and user growth tailwinds. Shares have sold-off after touching $110 in trading the day following earnings likely due to investors worried that a potential rate hike could impede corporate ad spend. We believe this sell-off is a good time to add. Given the strong user growth and engagement in the quarter, we have updated our fair value to $116. Facebook continues to display excellence on its video ads platform. Facebook users now watch 8 billion videos per day, up from the 4 billion daily views reported in April. In just a few months, Facebook has doubled its daily video view count. Some argue that Facebook's video view count threshold is too low and that the 8 billion daily views number is deceiving. YouTube counts views as a video that has been watched for 30 seconds or more , whereas the threshold for Facebook is merely 3 seconds or more. We agree that it is rather easy to rack-up views with a 3 second watching threshold and Autoplay video feature that instantly plays videos when you scroll. From this standpoint, the 8 billion views per day might be inflated. We are, however, more focused on the growth from April than the absolute number. Views doubled from 4 billion to 8 billion, and we believe this is indicative of significant growth regardless of viewing threshold or absolute view count. Facebook is continuing to benefit from strong synergies between News Feed and video discovery. According to CEO Zuckerberg, a "vast majority" of Facebook content is people scrolling through their News Feed and discovering content through either suggested content or content posted by friends. Facebook's News Feed should continue to promote video discovery as user growth continues to be strong. Although this was not mentioned on the call, we believe YouTube Red is actually presenting Facebook with an opportunity to upgrade its video content. YouTube's odd, coercive deal for content creators is causing them to lose valuable content. Because YouTube is trying to create uniformity among its content creator base, YouTube is forcing all of its content creators to be supported on both the paid YouTube Red and the free ads-supported YouTube. Those content creators unable or unwilling to sign up for YouTube Red will have their videos made private. While YouTube claims that 99% of their content creators agreed to YouTube Red terms, one such notable content creator that hasn't is ESPN. Due to a series of licensing conflicts with professional sports leagues, ESPN cannot feature its videos on the paid YouTube Red. As such, most of ESPN's YouTube channels have " gone dark, " and very little ESPN content is now available on YouTube. The now-empty main ESPN YouTube channel has 1.6 million subscribers, and this is only 1 of the 13 ESPN YouTube channels. Of those 13 channels, 11 have "gone dark." This is a significant hit to YouTube's free content library. YouTube Red's cannabilization of its free service and loss of some content, notably ESPN content, provides Facebook with an opportunity to upgrade its own video content. Specifically, it gives Facebook an opportunity to expand its video content that is not available on YouTube, and we see this as valuable going forward as YouTube and Facebook battle for ads revenue. Overall, we are bullish on both Facebook's recent video ads update as well as growth prospects into the future for further monetization. In the quarter, Worldwide ARPU growth more-or-less met our expectations, as some geographies performed better than we expected while APAC lagged due to FX headwinds. US and Canada ARPU growth in the quarter was strong, but continues to slow on a Y/Y basis. We expected a hike in Y/Y ARPU growth due to the prevalence of video ads, but the continued trend of slowing Y/Y ARPU growth shows signs of difficulty in accelerating Y/Y ARPU growth from a ~40% level. We have pulled our US and Canada ARPU growth projections down slightly. Europe ARPU only grew 3% Q/Q, but Y/Y growth accelerated roughly 250 basis points. This was a bigger hike in 3Q15 ARPU than we were expecting, and we have accordingly adjusted our Europe ARPU projections upward. APAC ARPU was disappointing, with both Q/Q and Y/Y growth decelerating more than 150 basis points. A majority of this was driven by non-terminal FX headwinds, and we expect these to ease sometime in the future. We have kept our APAC ARPU projections unchanged. Rest of World ARPU growth was impressive and in-line with our expectations. We have kept our Rest of World APRU projections unchanged. User growth was very strong during the quarter, and we have hiked up our MAU projections in all but one geography as a result. US and Canada MAU growth was impressive during the quarter with the fastest Q/Q growth in the past two years, far exceeding our expectations. We remain, however, concerned that Facebook is reaching MAU saturation in the US and have kept our MAU projections unchanged. Europe maintained strong Y/Y MAU growth of ~6.5%, and this was better than we expected. We have accordingly hiked up our Europe MAU projections as we believe the European market is far from saturated at 315 million monthly users. MAU growth saw particular strength in APAC and Rest of World. APAC MAU growth accelerated to 22.5% Y/Y in the quarter, while Rest of World MAU growth accelerated to 16.3% Y/Y. We are bullish on the accelerating growth trends in these two regions, likely boosted by the Internet.org initiative which has now brought more than 15 million people online, and we have significantly hiked up our MAU projections in both of these regions. Given our updates to our ARPU and MAU forecasts outlined above, we now expect revenues of $25.1 billion in 2016. We now expect the company to hit revenues of nearly $73 billion by 2025. We believe there exists a large amount of growth in the digital ad spend area, and we expect Facebook to continue to capitalize on this increase in demand. Operating margins compressed roughly 1200 basis points to 32% as expenses were up 68% Y/Y, led by R&D more than doubling Y/Y. This was expected, though, as Facebook did say this was going to be an investment intensive year. These investments in the ads business have paid off as user engagement and user count is soaring. GAAP operating margins are well off the highs of 48% reached in 2Q14, but are expanding marginally Q/Q, proving that heavier spending is paying off in sales ramp. We have maintained our margin guidance into 2025, which calls for margins to improve but not return to their 45%-plus highs. Despite this heavy investing, capital expenditures were actually lower than we expected in the quarter. Capex for the quarter was $780 million and management is guiding for capex for the year between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. We believe our original forecast for capex to fall between $3.5 to $4.0 billion per year is an overestimation relative to the management-guided Fy15 capex, which is markedly lower. We believe capex will remain in the $2.5 to $3.0 billion per year range to support a more complex data center infrastructure. While net cash flow in the quarter was -$815 million, net cash grew to $15.7 billion in the quarter thanks to an increase in marketable securities. The company also netted free cash flow in the quarter of $1.41 billion. Our 3Q15 Update DCF Model can be seen below. The major changes are slightly higher revenue forecasts and lower capex forecasts. We use a WACC discount rate and add back in net cash to arrive at a fair value of $331.3 billion. On MRQ weighted average diluted share count of 2.863 billion, this equates to a $116 fair value. Despite trading at all-time highs and eclipsing a $300 billion market-cap, we believe Facebook still has room to run. There remains a significant amount of traditional ad spend to shift to digital ad spend, particularly mobile ad spend, over the next 5-10 years, and Facebook's current strength in digital and mobile advertising positions it well to benefit from this continued influx of digital and mobile ad spend dollars.
