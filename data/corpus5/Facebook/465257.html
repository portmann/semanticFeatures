Apple Watch sales down 55% Y/Y - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 21 2016, 15:37 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor A report by IDC describes a 32% fall in the global smartwatch market and a steep 55% decline in Apple's ( AAPL -0.5%) Watch sales from Q2 2015 to Q2 2016. Global smartwatch shipments in Q2 were 3.5M vs. 5.1M Y/Y with Apple contributing 1.6M (-55% Y/Y) and Samsung ( SSNLF ) 0.6M (+51% Y/Y) to that number. Lenovo (+75%) and LG Electronics (+26%) each shipped 0.3M and the remaining shipments were contributed by Garmin (+25%) and other undisclosed companies. Although the decline is sharp, Apple remains the leader in a competitive smartwatch market. A concern as it relates to this sector, however, is the extended product refresh period Apple has so far adopted for its wearable device lineup. More than a year after launching (April 2015), a second generation Watch has not been released. With an already extended refresh cycle for the iPhone and though an upgrade is rumored to be released in fall of this year, it remains to be seen what time frame will eventually be adhered to for the Watch. While Samsung, Lenovo and LG Electronics have managed gains in this arena, it seems sales resulting from the initial spark of the Apple Watch launch in 2015 have slowed drastically into 2016. Apple has not commented on this report and has not released official figures regarding Watch sales since April 2015.
