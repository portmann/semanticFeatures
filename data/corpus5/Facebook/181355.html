L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (422 clicks) Instagram is the top social networking site used by US teens, with roughly 32% of teens using Instagram. Instagram was the fastest growing social media platform from 2012 to 2014 among online adults, roughly doubling adult audience penetration in that time frame. Instagram has announced that it will be launching ads in 30 new countries on September 30, including large markets like Italy, Spain, Mexico, India, and South Korea. Instagram's user base should see significant gains in particular due to urbanization and increased smartphone adoption in rural areas. We believe that a matured Instagram business will bring in more than $5 billion in advertising revenue per year, and further believe this rate will exceed Google's and Twitter's. Instagram recently broke the 400 million user milestone , and this has significant implications on Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) ad revenue. eMarketer believes Instagram's mobile ad revenue will surpass both Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) by 2017, and we believe that eMarketer's $2.81 billion mobile ad revenue figure for Instagram in 2017 is actually conservative, considering newly opened international growth opportunities. Growing domestic popularity among the key teen demographic, coupled with these newly opened international growth opportunities, ensures that Instagram will become a sizeable piece of the Facebook ad revenue pie in the near future. Facebook makes its money from advertisements, and the biggest section of advertising is mobile advertising. Advertising comprised roughly 94% of Facebook's net revenues through the first 6 months of 2015. Facebook estimates that about 76% of total advertising revenue in the second quarter was from mobile advertising. That is $2.9 billion in mobile advertising revenue in 2Q15 for Facebook. Annualized, that is an $11.6 billion run rate for mobile advertising. That's a big number, and we believe that number is set to explode more than most believe, thanks to what we believe is the world's most potent social media app for advertisers: Instagram. Instagram is not only one of the fastest growing and most popular social media platforms, but its popularity is strongest among the key youth demographic. Instagram is the top social networking site used by US teens, with roughly 32% of teens using Instagram, according to Piper Jaffray . This represents a 15 percentage point increase since 2013, which makes it the fastest growing social media platform among teens in that time period. This is especially important considering Facebook's popularity among US teens is dwindling, from 33% usage in 2013 to a 14% in 2015. Facebook is now the third most important social network among US teens, and only 1 percentage point ahead of newcomer Snapchat. The ramping popularity of Instagram among a young demographic in the United States ensures the longevity of Facebook's advertising revenue. As it turns out, Instagram isn't only growing on teens, but adult online users as well. While we believe this demographic is less important for ensuring advertising revenue longevity, we do believe it is important for current advertising prowess and displays that Instagram is more than "just a kid's" application. Instagram was the fastest growing social media platform from 2012 to 2014 among online adults, roughly doubling adult audience penetration in that time frame, according to Pew Research . Facebook's growth has steadied, while Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) grew at slower rates. Instagram has a cross-generational appeal that ensures high advertising demand, and this is captured in Instagram crossing the 400 million users milestone. According to Debra Aho Williamson , eMarketer principal analyst, Instagram's new ad products, including direct response, the ability to buy ads via an API, and enhanced targeting features, are generating high demand for Instagram advertising space among advertisers: Now that Instagram is opening up, there is a lot of pent-up demand. The rollout of new features over the next several months means that by the end of 2015, Instagram will have a host of new ad products for advertisers large and small. In particular, Instagram advertisers will be able to use a full slate of Facebook targeting tools, including the popular Custom Audiences feature. That will be a key drawing card. This makes sense to us, as Instagram's popularity among teens constitutes Instagram as perhaps the ideal advertising space for teen-tailored products, and in an industry where the consumer (teens) is being swayed more and more by what they see online, we believe competition will be especially keen for Instagram advertising space. eMarketer pegs Instagram's worldwide mobile ad revenue at $595 million for 2015, and believes this will constitute 3.7% of Facebook's total ad revenues. By 2017, eMarketer believes Instagram will rake in $2.81 billion in net mobile ad revenues worldwide, good enough for what eMarketer estimates to be 10.6% of Facebook's total ad revenue. eMarketer believes that of that $2.81 billion in mobile ads revenue worldwide, $2.39 billion will come from the United States. At $2.39 billion, Instagram's US mobile display ad revenues will be greater than both Twitter's and Google's. eMarketer released their report in July 2015. At that time, Instagram advertising was only available in seven international markets. Since then, Instagram has announced that it will be launching ads in 30 new countries on September 30 , including large markets like Italy, Spain, Mexico, India, and South Korea. From this standpoint, we believe the eMarketer worldwide estimate for $2.81 billion mobile ads revenue by 2017 is actually conservative, as it assumes only a 15% mix from international markets when 75% of Instagram's user base is international . Additionally, considering that soon 37 international markets will support Instagram ads, as opposed to just 7 as of July 2015, and we believe the international mix will be much larger than 15%. Because we do not believe domestic advertising will be affected by international expansion, we believe the $2.81 billion estimate is actually very conservative. Adoption of the iPhone 6s and Plus has been surprisingly strong , and urbanization should further help smartphone sales globally and increase Instagram's users concurrently (more smartphones, more potential Instagram users). Instagram's user base should see significant gains in particular due to urbanization in developing countries. In 2014, roughly 54% of the world's population lived in urban areas, and the global urban mix is expected to increase to 66% by 2050. Studies show that urbanization coupled with global population growth will mean an extra 2.5 billion people living in urban areas by 2050. Roughly 90% of that growth will be attributed to Asia and Africa. This urbanization of formerly rural areas will increase Instagram's reach and potential user pool, and this will result in a tailwind effect for international mobile advertising revenue. In our opinion, Instagram will rake in more than $2.81 billion in 2017, with the potential to rake in far more than $2.81 billion. As the smartphone market continues to grow driven by urbanization of rural areas, Instagram's reach will only broaden, and we believe that a matured Instagram business will bring in more than $5 billion in advertising revenue per year , a rate which some have pegged as the mature run rate. At a $5 billion run rate or higher, we believe Instagram's mobile advertising revenue will be greater than both Twitter's and Google's in the near future.
