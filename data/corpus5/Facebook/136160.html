Google Gearing Up To Take On Facebook's Suggested Videos - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is set to soon launch Suggested Videos to compete directly with Google's YouTube. YouTube has become one of the most important growth drivers for Google. Google has already lined up important changes to the video platform, including the recent announcement that its users will no longer be required to have a Google+ account. News that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is planning to soon launch Suggested Videos to compete with Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube must have been received with some degree of trepidation by Google investors. After all, Facebook remains Google's most formidable competitor by a mile. Facebook's auto-play videos are already immensely popular, and garner some 3 billion views per day . Throw in the fact that Facebook user growth momentum shows no signs of slowing down, rising 13% during the last quarter to hit 1.49 billion users, and it's not hard to see that Google has its work cut out for it. But that's not all. Facebook has borrowed a few plays from YouTube, including Google's 55:45 ad revenue sharing plan between the search giant and content creators. FB might even decide to integrate its newly launched feature that allows marketers to only pay for videos that get watched for at least 10 seconds in a bid to match YouTube's Skippable Ads. But that's just part of why Suggested Videos appear poised to pull the rug from under YouTube's feet. Google has already taken a major step to prepare to take on Suggested Videos by abandoning the requirement that YouTube users sign up for a Google+ account. But more of that a little later. The scariest part of the whole setup is that Facebook has one big problem that cripples Google's ability to make money with YouTube licked: using user data available to the company for ad-targeting purposes. Facebook is a social media company, and faces minimal or no restrictions regarding freely using the massive cache of user data at its disposal to target users with relevant ads. Things though have not always been this way. FB was poorly ranked by marketers in 2013 for failing to use its social data when targeting users with relevant ads. In other words, many marketers felt that their Facebook ads delivered poor ROI, and ranked it at the bottom of the heap for their preferred digital marketing channels. But Facebook must have listened up to the marketers' rant and done something about it. Though FB does not reveal details such as click through rates, or CTR, for its ads (a good measure of the efficacy of ads being served up), one of the company's ad exchange partners recently divulged some information related to this. Nanigans, one of Facebook's ad exchange partners, recently revealed that its clients had realized 142% growth in CPC rates for video ads and 187% growth in CTR for ads designed using Facebook data. Facebook's ad exchange partners consist of companies that buy ads that are designed using FB's tracking cookies. This means that the ads reflect the efficacy of Facebook's targeting methods. Clearly, Facebook's ad targeting has been improving, and gives the company plenty of leverage when negotiating CPM rates with marketers. Now, let's turn our attention to what Google has been doing with YouTube. YouTube has grown in leaps and bounds since Google bought the company in 2006 for $1.65 billion. The platform brought in a healthy revenue of $4 billion in 2014, up from $3 billion the year before. Jefferies even pinned a $40 billion valuation on the platform last year. All that sounds very good, until you hear the other part of the story: YouTube does not make any profits for Google, which appears a bit odd for a video ad platform. After all, video ads have considerably better CPC rates than static ads. So what's happening here? The answer lies in the efficacy of YouTube's ads. Google only uses data from DoubleClick's partners when targeting YouTube users with ads. Unfortunately, DoubleClick partner networks represent just 30% of Google's search revenue, leaving Google in the dark regarding the preferences of 70% of its users. Close to half of YouTube viewers come directly from Google's sites. Many marketers also hold the view that YouTube is a platform that is mostly patronized by younger folks, which might be great for marketers looking to build brand affinities with this demographic, but not for everybody. The result: Google is unable to negotiate for top CPC rates with marketers for YouTube. Low CPC rates mean Google is unable to make meaningful profits with YouTube, despite attracting 1 billion unique users every month. But even worse, low CPC rates by YouTube have lately been impinging on Google's overall CPC rate. Google's aggregate CPC fell 11% during the last quarter, and the company blamed YouTube for this unfortunate outcome. Google has seen falling CPC for many quarters now. The company has only managed to maintain top-line growth because growth in volume of clicks has always managed to outpace the contraction in CPC. Google has in the past blamed rapid mobile and international markets growth for the trend. This marked the first time that the company pinned the blame for falling CPC on YouTube, a clear indicator that the platform now has a tangible impact on overall company performance. But Google can no longer afford to treat YouTube as just another ancillary revenue source. According to Credit Suisse, YouTube and Google Play combined will bring in 15% of the company's revenue in the current year, and almost a quarter of its overall revenue by 2020. YouTube is therefore currently one of the most important growth frontiers for Google. Google has already made some significant changes to YouTube, such as Skippable Ads feature that it introduced back in 2010, which has been one of the key reasons the video platform has become popular with marketers. Google in 2013 allowed marketers to use traditional Nielsen benchmarks to get a view of who sees its ads instead of using Google's homegrown benchmarks. Then, there is the recent doing away with Google+ requirement to post content on YouTube. Google's intent on enforcing this requirement was to increase user engagement on the social media platform. But the experiment has been a flop. Though there are more than 2.2 billion Google+ profiles, active users clock in at a measly 4-6 million, reflecting really poor engagement rates. There are many reasons that have been advanced to explain the utter failure by Google+ as a social network. But perhaps the most potent is that many people view it as just another way for Google to glean more information about them and use it to the benefit of marketers and, of course, to line its pockets. So let's just say that short of merging with a company like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), it's going to be incredibly hard for Google to shake off this perception and crack the social media dilemma. The requirement that YouTube content creators had to have a Google+ account has therefore been more of a hindrance than a real aid for the platform. But perhaps the most important change that Google plans to bring to YouTube is to start using Google data when targeting users with ads. WSJ says that YouTube executives might start using Google data on YouTube as early as this year instead of just relying exclusively on DoubleClick data. Google has of course been reluctant to do this in the past due to its past run-ins with the law regarding matters of privacy protection. But with a competitor like Facebook breathing down its neck, the company has little choice but to use every weapon in its arsenal if it hopes to attract more marketers to the video platform and command higher CPC rates for YouTube ads. Depending on how Suggested Videos works out, do not be surprised if Google starts investing heavily on TV content to improve the quality of content on YouTube. Of course, this might put Google's margins under pressure once again, and give the bears a chance to pounce, but it will be well worth the risk. After all, if an improved YouTube platform can slow down CPC contraction to the mid-to-low single digits, or even manage to reverse it altogether, you can bet the upside to Google's shares will be big - maybe as much as 40% if CPC rates can stabilize in maybe a 2-year time frame.
