Baidu: Best Way To Play Chinese Plunge - Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,569 clicks) Baidu continues to slump more than the Shanghai Composite. The company has formed a partnership with Microsoft that should help with desktop search market share. Though domestic-listed Chinese stocks didn't benefit from the rise in the Chinese stock market over the last two years, they are getting crushed nonetheless. Chinese Internet search leader Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is approaching a 50% collapse in the stock price from a high of $250, similar to the drop back in 2012. In fact, over the last two years Baidu is now trading down 10% compared to the Shanghai Composite that is still up 40% for the period. The Chinese Internet giant continues to aggressively invest in growth to capture the booming opportunity in the country as the economy moves toward services growth that will benefit Internet players. The company is busy forming partnerships and implementing a stock buyback that could signal a shift in investment focus and an attractive time to buy the stock. At a time when Qihoo 360 Tech (NYSE: QIHU ) is gaining market share in the desktop search market in China, the recently announced partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has some positive implications for Baidu. Microsoft estimates that over 600 million PC users in China run various Windows products. The partnership has a goal of replacing outdated Windows XP users that Baidu estimates stands at 228 million. The combination hopes to take Baidu's knowledge of the Chinese market and the operating system from Microsoft to get Chinese PC users onto legitimate software that will use Baidu for the Internet search and browser functions. The ability to cut out pirated users would be a huge win for Microsoft and it would help maintain or possibly reclaim marketshare for Baidu in the desktop market. Of course, Baidu is rapidly moving towards mobile search with revenues now exceeding 50% on mobile. The biggest problem with the Baidu investment thesis over the last year is that the company has aggressively spent on new business avenues. The announcement in July that the company will spend up to $1 billion on stock buybacks over the next 12 months was an encouraging sign. Despite all of the investments in the last few years, Baidu had a cash balance of $12.1 billion at the end of June. In addition, the company generated Q2 operating cash flow of $923.8 million while only spending $148.9 million on capital expenditures. Most investors don't understand that the higher spending constrains profit growth, but it hasn't reduced the high level of profits and cash flow. As highlighted in previous research , the stock offers the best growth potential of the major global Internet players. Now with the recent collapse of the stock price, Baidu offers a much more compelling valuation as well, compared to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Baidu continues to make partnerships and investments that set the company up for the Internet growth in China as the country transitions from a manufacturing focused economy. The stock offers an attractive valuation and the stock buyback should help stabilize a stock beaten down substantially more than the Chinese stock market. The recommendation is to use the slump to load up on one of the best global growth stories while the company itself buys shares.
