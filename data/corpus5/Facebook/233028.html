Will A U.S. Court Kill America's Cloud Advantage? - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha Nov. 11, 2015  3:19 PM ET  |  About: Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) , Includes: AAPL , AMZN , CSCO , FB , GOOG , GOOGL , MSFT by: Dana Blankenhorn An appeals court decision in a case involving Microsoft e-mails held in Ireland is expected soon. A decision for the government could kill many advantages U.S. cloud companies presently hold. The big winner here could well be China. American cloud companies are accustomed to having a huge advantage in the market, especially compared with companies from China, thanks to the protection of American laws. This may be in the process of changing, and the winner could easily be Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), whose Aliyun cloud has begun challenging Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Web Services in many markets. The story is centered in New York, where a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will soon decide what is called the Microsoft-Ireland case , in which Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is challenging a warrant issued against e-mails it is storing in Ireland. The case, taken alongside a recent European court ruling eliminating the previous "safe harbor" allowing U.S. tech companies to move user data freely, could be the one-two punch that leads many international companies to prefer Alibaba's cloud, which prides itself on following local laws (even China's), over American companies. The safe harbor ruling could be gotten around by having European data stored in Europe, and American data stored here. Most American cloud companies, now have extensive networks of cloud data centers, in various jurisdictions around the world. A ruling against Microsoft, however, would give American law control over all data held anywhere in the world by an American cloud company. The current workaround would no longer work. U.S. tech companies are lobbying legislators, but you can't lobby a court. The three judges who heard the arguments in September - Gerald Lynch , Susan Carney and Victor Bolden - are all Obama appointees. In the run-up to their decision tech companies have been, subtly or not, pounding the table for what they consider the "right" decision for some time. If the decision goes against Microsoft, businesses around the world will face a choice between going with a U.S. cloud operator, whose government claims jurisdiction over their data, or a company like Alibaba's Aliyun that promises to strictly follow local laws. A decision for the government would make extra-territorial control of data housed in the computers of U.S. companies our official government policy. That's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) offered a joint "friend of the court" brief on behalf of Microsoft's position. At minimum, all the legal hassles are raising costs for U.S. tech companies. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), for instance, is now appealing a Belgian decision that it no longer attach cookies that track the Web use of people who aren't its customers. Forrester Research has suggested that Internet sites simply charge users for privacy protection. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google service is trying to do that through its "Contributor" plan . Given the user resistance to paywalls, that's not going to work. Either way, the costs of doing business in the cloud, both business and consumer, would seem to be heading higher. Like other U.S. industries, U.S. cloud companies may soon find themselves competing with China while having one legal arm behind their backs.
