Can Intel Capitalize On The Silicon In Mobile Base Stations? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has unique growth opportunities tied specifically to logic silicon in mobile base stations. The company believes that through data center virtualization and disaggregation technologies the base station space is ripe for Intel-based architecture. The performance advantage and cost advantage seems disruptive. The segment is growing at 5 times the industry CAGR and will scale into a $18 billion a year business over the long run. However, it's not exactly clear whether those assumptions are inflated. Needless to say, the growth from this segment isn't reflected in the long-term growth assumption of the DCG segment. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) went into great detail about "Network Transformation," but basically there's a huge opportunity in logic silicon TAM. The market potential is estimated at $18 billion, according to Intel, and is very specific to mobile base stations. Much of these mobile base stations run on ASICs, which are highly-specialized CPU-units that focus on a specific algorithm/application. However, ASICs aren't as effective as a medium for developing network scalability when compared to deployments with general purpose CPUs via a data center due to development cost and lack of flexibility with workloads. Intel believes that it can compete for these dollars due to the transition of mobile base station workloads to cloud virtualization. Mobile carriers will transition workloads pertaining to packet, application, control and signal processing into the data center, rather than processing the information on site at the base station. Intel is starting to build momentum as they've deployed its CPUs into 10 mobile base stations. Over time, they expect that they can gain more of the base station market as various telecoms are starting to experiment with data center based workloads versus on-site processing. Intel mentions that the environment these ASICs based systems operate in are very harsh. With broad ranging weather conditions, paired with the fact that the processing of these various workloads isn't as decentralized, which means that the workload should be handled via a disaggregated system, i.e. a server. The efficiency gain comes from a combination of both hardware and software level acceleration along with data center architecture. For large-scale disaggregation to work Intel Silicon Photonics is a requirement so various components can be disaggregated so resources can be quickly shared via separate systems. In the case of base stations the bandwidth needs are much more extreme. In a disaggregated system main system memory and storage-based needs can be increased based on the stated demand for those resources rather than buying an entirely new ISS (industry standard system) to make up for the difference in storage requirements or memory requirements for the entire data center. So, if more storage resources are required, the data center designer can simply implement industry standard storage solutions into the disaggregated rack. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) mentions in its annual technology conference that they have already accomplished large-scale disaggregation, which correspondingly lowers the cost of adding resources into the data center. Disaggregation tackles the challenge of scale and cost and can be implemented in large scale data package processing and signal processing. This explains why there's a huge opportunity for Intel to take its platform into mobile base stations. Intel has developed technologies to help amplify the performance of packet processing through an Open Plane Development kit and Openvswitch. The performance scaling from these technologies generated a performance improvement of 12 times. This is why Xeon-based systems can compete with ASICs based systems, and in narrow use cases Intel can then implement FPGAs and co-processors to close the performance between ASICs and general purpose CPUs. Also, for those of you who are wondering, Openvswitch is the software aspect of enabling resource disaggregation through enabling a creation of cross-server switches, which works within virtual machine hypervisors. A virtual machine at the servers scale basically differentiates workloads and creates an independent environment for compute resources to be dedicated to specific programs. When operated at scale there are huge cost advantages. Clearly, Intel is in a position to displace competitors in the space through its proprietary hardware and software. The company mentions that it's currently at $1 billion in annual revenue and its R&D pertaining to this specific market segment has doubled. The projected growth rate of the segment is at around 5 times the market, which is driven by saturating more of the available market share and broader trends in data usage. These combined factors imply that Intel can eventually generate its long-run goal of $18 billion in annual revenue from this specific market. As you can tell, $18 billion in incremental revenue is enough to move the consolidated revenue figure for FY 2014 as the company generated $55.87 billion in revenue, and I anticipate flat revenue growth for FY 2015. So, if PC sales continue to slump, the growth will have to be driven by new business opportunities and new product categories. In this case, the incremental revenue opportunity is expected to become much more meaningful in FY 2016 onwards. However, the aggressive growth assumptions from network processing weren't really factored much into the long-run 15% CAGR assumption for the DCG. Without knowing exactly what data consumption will be like in five years or if competing solutions can close the performance and cost advantage Intel believes it offers, there's the potential that the revenue potential from this segment could be overstated. On the other hand, if implementation of virtualization takes course across all future mobile base stations, then yes, Intel will corner the entire market. Intel chips provide the lowest total cost of ownership in any data center. Therefore, implementation of Intel chips in network virtualization seems like a pretty high probability, but to the extent to which Intel can capitalize on the opportunity remains a bit of an uncertainty. That being the case, I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation and $31 price target. I think the long-term growth prospects and fundamentals will substantially improve in FY 2016. Therefore, opening a position may mean outperformance over the long haul. It will be awhile before sentiment around the stock improves, which is why I think the stock will perform in-line with the market this year.
