ETF Hub Apr 11 2015, 21:26 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Major social data/analytics provider DataSift has announced its licensing deal to access Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) data firehose will expire on Aug. 13, after Twitter suspended negotiations. Twitter, which bought DataSift rival Gnip last year, states "companies building analytic solutions using Twitter’s data and platform" will now "need to have a direct relationship with Twitter." Twitter insists those accessing its firehose via third parties won't see an impact, other than that they'll now pay Twitter directly. "Direct relationships help Twitter develop a deeper understanding of customer needs, get direct feedback for the product roadmap, and work more closely with data customers..." DataSift, which provides data from 20 sources besides Twitter, has a different view of things. "80% of our customers use technology that can’t be replaced by Twitter ... social networks make money from engagement and advertising. Revenue from data should be a secondary concern to distribution..." The company uses the occasion to praise Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) more liberal stance towards data access. DataSift partnered with Facebook last month to launch Topic Data , a solution that lets advertisers access mountains of anonymized Facebook content (including status updates, comments, likes and shares) sorted by topic, to better gauge consumer sentiment. DataSift on the Facebook deal: "For the first time, aggregate analysis is enabled across the entirety of Facebook users – not just the public profiles ... We are now providing our clients with the most powerful tool in the world for understanding consumer opinion." Facebook, which hopes Topic Data will help brands deliver better targeted ads (any by doing so, lead them to spend more on Facebook ads), isn't charging DataSift for now. Twitter's data licensing/other revenue rose 110% Y/Y in 2014 to $147.3M (10% of total revenue). IBM, which has launched enterprise analytics services for mining Twitter data, was recently added as a client. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
