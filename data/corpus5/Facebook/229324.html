ETF Hub Nov  9 2015, 03:51 ET | About: Snapchat (CHAT) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Snapchat (Pending: CHAT ) is closing the gap with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) in the social networks' battle for scale in video, FT reports , stating that the number of daily videos viewed on its messaging app has tripled since May to 6B. That compares with the 8B daily video views announced by Facebook last week, which has doubled since April (YouTube in comparison measures its video by hours and not views). The race for eyeballs comes as the feature develops into one of the most popular activities on social networking apps and analysts predict huge growth in digital video advertising. Note: How long does someone have to watch a video for it to count as a "view"? For Facebook, that number is three seconds, while for Snapchat, it's reported that just a few milliseconds will suffice.
