Facebook Bets Live Video Will Be The Next Big Thing - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Facebook (FB) , TWTR , Includes: CHAT , NYT This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at new features unveiled for the Facebook Live streaming platform, along with a report media firms are being paid to join. Remarks from Mark Zuckerberg indicate he has made live streaming a company priority, and expects usage to soar. Twitter's Periscope live streaming platform still has a large early lead. However, Facebook's aggressive efforts and the size of its base will help it gain ground. Back in 1995, Bill Gates reportedly spent a night browsing the Internet (or what passed for it back then) and had a "eureka" moment, realizing this thing that let virtually anyone retrieve messages and content pages on demand from servers thousands of miles away will be huge. What's known for sure is that Gates sent a lengthy memo to Microsoft employees on May 26, 1995 declaring the Internet to be a company priority and outlining a series of steps he wants Microsoft to take to embrace it. Taking in Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) latest set of live video product launches, management remarks, and media reports, I can't help but wonder if Mark Zuckerberg had a similar eureka moment while browsing videos on Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) Periscope live streaming platform. Zuck was reported in February to be "obsessed" with live streaming, and to have told Facebook's video product and engineering teams the company's Live streaming service is now their top priority. After today, it's hard to question that report. Live was originally made available to public figures last summer, and was recently expanded to all U.S. iOS and Android users . Now, Facebook is: Adding support for Facebook's recently-launched reactions buttons/emojis, as well as for Instagram-like video filters and the ability to replay comments made during live streams. Facebook says people comment more than 10x as much on live videos than they do on regular videos. Providing tools for discovering live video, including a global map of where videos are being broadcast, and giving users the option to invite friends to watch with them. New filters and a pending drawing tool Also, a video tab now exists on the main menu bar for Facebook's apps. Tapping on the tab takes users to a video hub page that contains both live and recorded video. Meanwhile, Re/code reports Facebook is paying the likes of the New York Times (NYSE: NYT ), BuzzFeed, and the Huffington Post to stream live video on its platform. The site previously reported Facebook is willing to pay celebrities to use Live. A Facebook exec admits the company is providing "a financial incentive" to some Live partners. The report follows one from Bloomberg stating Facebook ended its bid to stream Thursday night NFL games partly because it wants live videos to be ad-free (presumably to create a better user experience and keep users engaging with a live stream). The NFL announced a deal with Twitter yesterday. As with many prior services (and some current ones), Facebook is taking a go-it-slow approach to monetization, looking to hook users on the service and optimize the experience they get before finding ways to create revenue. Also: Zuckerberg and Facebook product chief Chris Cox sat down with BuzzFeed to discuss Facebook's live streaming efforts and future plans. The money quote from Zuck: "The big decision we made was to shift a lot of our video efforts to focus on Live, because it is this emerging new format; not the kind of videos that have been online for the past five or ten years," He also declares it wouldn't be surprising "if you fast-forward five years and most of the content that people see on Facebook and are sharing on a day-to-day basis is video." BuzzFeed states Live "became Facebook's monomania" over the last two months, as the company aggressively pitched engineers to join the project and scrambled to add many of the features announced today. " The site also notes Facebook worked hard to have live streams load quickly and run with little lag time, and that a lot of the recent changes made to Live seem designed to enhance "that sensation that you're not seeing something scripted or performative." In spite of Facebook's efforts, Twitter and Periscope still have a lot going for them, not the least of which is Periscope's head-start. Periscope recently disclosed it streamed over 200 million broadcasts through its iOS and Android apps in its first year of availability, and that 110 years worth of live video are watched on its platform each day. And the latter figure doesn't count broadcasts seen on Twitter, which recently integrate Periscope live streams, or on the web or via replays. In addition, Twitter's status as a go-to medium for following and seeing the world react to events in real-time works in Periscope's favor. If you were looking to see the immediate reactions of dozens of celebrities and media personalities to the ending of Monday night's NCAA title game, you probably went on Twitter to do it, not Facebook. But Facebook has some big advantages as well, with the largest arguably being its scale: The company had 1.59B monthly active users at the end of 2015, or nearly 5x Twitter's 320M. Moreover, it's easier to get a large audience for a live stream if users are constantly logged in or checking in to a service. And all signs suggest Facebook has a big edge on Twitter in monthly usage per active user. There's also a chance for Facebook to target different use cases than Periscope. While Periscope's live streams (much like Twitter's content) have often been public-facing, Facebook can (in addition to enabling public streams) pitch itself as a way to share live video of events in your life with family and friends. That would fit well with what Facebook is used so often for today, and could over the long run be a big opportunity in its own right. And if Facebook is nervous about Snapchat's (Private: CHAT ) growth, as writer/VC Om Malik argues , a platform for quickly sharing live videos with friends could be a potent weapon. Ultimately, live video might not be a winner-takes-all game any more than recorded online video or photo-sharing have been to date. But Facebook's big investments in Live, its giant user base, and its aggressive efforts to recruit celebrities and media partners should help it steal some of Periscope's thunder and create another big service for the world's most ubiquitous social networking platform.
