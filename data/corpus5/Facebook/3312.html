ETF Hub Mar 13 2015, 23:07 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has bought TheFind , an online shopping search engine that lets users compare listings from Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, and many other online retailers/marketplaces - the startup claims to index more than 500M products across 500K stores. Terms are undisclosed. While announcing the deal, TheFind says its search engine will be shuttered within the next few weeks, but adds it will be "working hard to integrate our technology to make the ads you see on Facebook every day better and more relevant to you." A source talking to AdWeek states Facebook will use TheFind to deliver better retargeted ads (i.e. ads based on activity on non-Facebook sites/apps), something that could yield better ROIs and ad prices. "Say you're looking at a pair of jeans on the Gap's website. You won't see those ads after you buy them." Facebook already does plenty of business selling retargeted e-commerce ads both within its news feed, and on its site's right-hand column. However, delivering relevant product ads to consumers is still often a challenge , as it is for many other retargeted ad platforms. The acquisition comes just a month after Facebook launched a news feed ad unit meant specifically for product ads, and which are tailored to a user's activity interest. The company has also been testing out a Buy button that could improve ad ROIs/prices by allowing users to make purchases without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using payment data previously saved to their accounts. I hope the  purchase price is not in the Billions $$$.........but.....I think this format will be a big winner for Facebook****** Finally they are making moves again. This could be good even in the short term, while also in the long term. Good job Zuc! It is probably going to give the final push to the stock to go to $85 ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
