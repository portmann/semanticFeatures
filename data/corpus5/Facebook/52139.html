Western Union Buying MoneyGram Doesn't Solve Potential Facebook Problem - The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub MGI would help add value to WU, strengthening areas of concern. However, FB remains the biggest risk, and acquiring MGI does not protect WU from these risks. MoneyGram International's (NASDAQ: MGI ) stock soared over 20% on a report that Western Union (NYSE: WU ) is in talks to acquire the company . The deal would combine the number one and two money transfer providers, but in a highly fragmented market the combined market share would equal just 20% worldwide. Still, JPMorgan thinks the deal could result in EPS growth if under $11 a share for MoneyGram, and could also provide pricing power while also increasing Western Union's global footprint and adding to the growth seen in electronic transfer products. However, while MoneyGram would address several problems, it's still not a solution for Facebook. Just two months ago Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) unveiled the Messenger Platform at its f8 conference, and immediately I explained how this platform could lead to billions of dollars in annual revenue for Facebook. While consumers remain focused on the user to business experience that's created from the Messenger Platform, the real opportunity for Facebook is in payments. Among the many new services associated with Messenger, Facebook announced it would have payment and money transfer capabilities after months of speculation. Right now, Facebook only allows users to send money to one another, user-to-user, and to pay retailers or service providers for goods. However, there is a vast opportunity for Facebook to incorporate bill pay, and to partner with retailers and other companies with a large brick-and-mortar presence to allow for in-store money pick-up of Messenger sent funds. Most importantly, Facebook is currently providing the service for free, whereas competitors like Western Union and MoneyGram charge a fee. Therefore, Western Union has a big problem on its hand. It faces a competitor with a network of 600 million users plus (Messenger) that is offering its core service for free. Specifically, 80% of Western Union's business is currently at risk, that which offers consumer-to-consumer services. Albeit, most investors realize that where Facebook's strongest is in the U.S., where its revenue per user and user engagement is highest. Chances are, Facebook will have the highest volume of money transfers in the U.S., at least initially. That said, if Western Union acquires MoneyGram, it will bolster the company's ex-U.S. position. MoneyGram earns 86% of its revenue from non-U.S. and U.S. outbound transfers, a business that grew 10% in the company's last quarter in constant currency. This would at least provide a nice hedge against Facebook if its money sending services begin to experience rapid user adoption, initially. Furthermore, a big risk facing Western Union is that Facebook's money service targets all of its growth products. During Western Union's last quarter, it had 25% transaction growth from electronic channels like westernunion.com in its large consumer-to-consumer business. That's down from 64% transaction growth in Westernunion.com during the fourth quarter. These electronic channels now account for 7% of Western Union's total sales, and are growing fast for a company whose overall revenue declined 2.2%. Meanwhile, MoneyGram's growth comes from self-service transfer products. These include online channels, but also do-it-yourself kiosks at top retailers like CVS. MoneyGram's self-service transfer revenue jumped 45% and now accounts for 11% of the total. Importantly, the kiosks business is not directly targeted by Facebook at the moment, as Facebook is yet to partner with a retailer where users can pick up sent funds. The bottom line is that MoneyGram does strengthen Western Union in certain ways, those markets where Western Union is at most risk. But, it still leaves Western Union at great risk depending on what moves Facebook makes next. In addition, Western Union is about four times larger than MoneyGram by revenue, meaning that its very large consumer-to-consumer business is still at risk regardless of whether it acquires MoneyGram. Also, if Facebook does cause an accelerated decline in Western Union's revenue from the adoption of money transfers, its stock is sure to fall, and JPMorgan already noted that stock would likely be involved in any MoneyGram takeout because of its high debt load. All things considered, MoneyGram seems like a good fit for Western Union, but it is not a fix, and certainly not enough to feel good about a long-term investment with Facebook right around the corner in its core payments business.
