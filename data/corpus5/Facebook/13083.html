The Zendesk Story Is All Coming Together With Its Facebook Partnership - Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) | Seeking Alpha ZEN's announcement today that it is partnering with FB to help facilitate FB's new "Businesses on Facebook" initiative is huge for many reasons. This positions ZEN as a mid-term M&A option for FB as well as plenty of other companies. I also believe this partnership will lead to massive amounts of operating leverage for ZEN as it's able to decrease S&M spending in the immediate term. I expect ZEN to have a huge 12-18 months in front of it when it comes to revenue growth and customer acquisition. Today will be remembered as a defining moment in the history of ZEN, be long this moment and ride the ZEN wave. How awesome does Zendesk's (NYSE: ZEN ) Zopim acquisition look now that it has announced that Zopim chat can facilitate businesses' "Businesses on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB )" participation? I mean, really? As if making it convenient for the company to have Asian exposure and for the company to launch its Far East expansion wasn't enough, Zopim just secured a partnership with a company that should now be considered a potential buyer longer term. Heck, it should be considered a buyer in the mid term or however long it takes ZEN to prove its competence in this matter. Oh yeah, that company is Facebook. That's right. ZEN's Zopim chat platform through an integration with Facebook Messenger will begin allowing businesses to chat with customers via Messenger. You can imagine with FB's Messenger user base of over 600 million people that this makes ZEN an immediate must own and long-term hold. By the way, that's as of today. That's not including the potential merging of FB's Messenger and its WhatsApp application. That's not including the potential integration of the infancy stage messaging capability of FB's Instagram. Did I mention we're still talking just about FB? If you don't think this is the first "shot fired" in what will be a perpetual and endless list of followers (you don't think that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is now going to be forced to find some way to integrate an offering that's similar?) in which ZEN will be the only proven and scale tested option for facilitation. You better believe that matters. I believe this news to change the long-term outlook for the company from one of high visibility of success to one of almost guaranteed success. FB cannot allow this venture to be non-success in that this venture - bringing businesses to consumers via its centralized platform - could end up being its biggest revenue segment. Yes, maybe bigger than advertising when it's all said and done. Regardless of that, I can't remember the last time a FB "project" failed. The investment community thought it was crazy for buying Instagram, some thought it marked the top of the social media bubble at the time. The investment community thought it was crazy for buying WhatsApp for a multiple of the price it paid for Instagram. The investment community recommended rehab for FB when it bought VR company Oculus. Is it really that big of a stretch of the imagination to think FB would buy a company with a $1.72 billion market cap that it "self-made" on the back of an excellent service that's already proven to have global scalability? Really? Expect ZEN's revenues to see a material uptick from the already fast rates of growth that we ZEN investors were expecting. When you factor in this FB news with the international expansion news the company released just a few weeks ago I think ZEN has an absolute blowout 12-18 months in front of it. Today's PR also goes a long way into explaining ZEN's recent cash raise , which was perfectly explainable prior as well, which it did most likely with the FB news in hand. I'll look to get in touch with ZEN IR over the next few days to see if ZEN can release anything around the economics of this partnership but even if they can't this is hugely bullish on all durations. I'm expecting the above mentioned revenues explosion, obviously a customer count explosion, sequentially falling S&M expenses as a percentage of revenues for the next hopefully 3 or 4 quarters as ZEN should need to do less S&M as it can live on the FB network effect (forgive the pun), and I'm expecting ZEN to realize a marked level of operating leverage as a result of all of this.
