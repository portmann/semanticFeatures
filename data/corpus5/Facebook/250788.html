Why Southeast Asia Is Important To Facebook's Instant Articles - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha After launching Instant Articles in India, Facebook is now also implementing it in Southeast Asian countries. Localized versions of Instant Articles are necessary because of Facebook's growing number of users in Southeast Asia. The Wall Street Journal published a report saying that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is actively hiring positions in its Asia-Pacific office. These new job requirements is to help Facebook create local-friendly versions of its Instant Articles service for Vietnam and Thailand. Facebook obviously wants Vietnamese and Thai-speaking employees to help it recruit local publishers to sign up for Instant Articles. I strongly agree with this move of Facebook. The growth of the ads-dependent Instant Articles service is better off when it can offer local content that is published only in native Asian languages. Instant Articles' rival, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Play Newsstand's Android and iOS versions here in the Philippines offer localized news/article content. The Google Newsstand app has partner publishers that only publish content in the Filipino language and in the local regional dialects, Cebuano and Ilocano. Instant Articles will be in great disadvantage against Google Play Newsstand if it cannot be used by domestic publishers whose content/news are non-English. Investors know that Facebook's core web and mobile apps are still banned in China. Facebook is also not the most popular social network in Japan. The next best thing therefore is for Facebook to find growth in Japan and China's neighboring Southeast Asian countries. The Southeast Asian expansion of Instant Articles is only more than a week after Facebook launched Instant Articles in India . The Think Global, Act Local expansion strategy of Facebook includes disseminating its services to Southeast Asian countries. Investors should care that Southeast Asian countries represents one the most active population of Facebook users. As we can see from eMarketer's chart, Facebook's estimated users in Vietnam is now more than 29 million. Thailand now also has 17.3 million Facebook users. India only has 130 million Facebook users. Southeast Asian countries presents a bigger combined population of advertising eyeballs for Facebook's Instant Articles. Facebook's popularity is in spite of the fact that Southeast Asian countries still have low internet penetration rate. Thailand only has 54% internet penetration rate, while Vietnam only has 45%. Facebook's decision to push Instant Articles in those two emerging markets is an early-bird advantage move. Southeast Asia represents a huge growth opportunity and Facebook is wisely being pro-active. Once more people get access to internet and more affordable smartphones/data plans, Facebook's number of users in Southeast Asia will likely grow proportionately. Looking at the chart above, it's surprising that Indonesia has almost 68 million Facebook users. That country of 237 million still has less than 30% internet penetration rate. I expect that Facebook will also soon be recruiting employees that speak Bahasa Indonesia to help it implement Instant Articles in Indonesia. The most important thing now is that Facebook is exploiting early its brand's popularity among Southeast Asian social network users. The app-based and ads-laden news/information dissemination program of Instant Articles cannot afford to ignore the huge popularity of Facebook in all Southeast Asian markets. Furthermore, there are now sub-$50 Android phones available which are perfect for price-sensitive Southeast Asians. The more people in this region that gets access to affordable mobile phones, the more chances that Facebook and its partner publishers will have bigger audience for localized Instant Articles content. Instant Articles' future success will also depend on how fast people in this region gets access to cheap mobile web too. Southeast Asian Carriers Offer Cheap Unlimited Facebook Mobile Access International and domestic content publishers should be more willing to sign up for Instant Articles intended for Southeast Asian news readers. In my country, the Philippines, Smart Communications and Globe Telecom offers unlimited prepaid mobile Facebook access. Globe's cellular P25/day ($0.43) unlimited call/SMS promo also includes free full Facebook mobile app access for 24 hours. Talk 'N Text, the budget wireless brand of Smart Communications, offers 1-day unlimited call/SMS and Facebook access for only P15/day ($0.32). For Filipinos who are better-off, they could also avail of the 30-day SurfMax unlimited 3G/4G LTE mobile internet for only P995 ($21.7). My point is that Southeast Asian carriers provide very affordable mobile web access. Cheap mobile web access, combined with sub-$100 Android or Windows phones, is a growth catalyst for Facebook and Instant Articles. The more people there are that gets access to Instant Articles content, the better it is for Facebook's partner publishers. Publishers need ever-increasing population of mobile users to better monetize their content via Instant Articles. As of now, Facebook is still allowing its partner publishers to get 100% of the ads they directly sell via their content published through Instant Articles. Of course, publishers who only want to push their own direct advertisements through Instant Articles will not get access to Facebook's hyper-targeted ads delivery platform. Meaning, freeloading publishers of Instant Articles will have to eventually pay Facebook to access that social network's huge database of personal user data and location. Facebook and its investors are the ultimate long-term winners if Instant Articles become a major channel for content dissemination. Mobile app-based news distribution is a great way for content publishers to reduce the impact of browser-based ad blocking. Publishers needs Instant Articles to grow in all markets, not just in India, North America, or Europe. Southeast Asian countries, where sub-$100 phones/tablets and Facebook mobile usage are popular, are also obvious growth opportunities for distribution of news/information content.
