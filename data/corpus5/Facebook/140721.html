Facebook begins livestreaming, but only for celebrities - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Aug  6 2015, 03:04 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Following in the footsteps of Meerkat and Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) Periscope, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is rolling out its own livestreaming app. For now, the company is limiting use of the product to celebrities who use its Mentions app, which it introduced last year to encourage "influencers" to use Facebook. A big advantage of the service is that videos will be archived. Clips are immediately deleted on Meerkat and only live for 24 hours on Periscope (though you can save them to your camera roll). Does that mean periscope is finished now letting Twitter get dragged to 20. Wow !!! Stupid Twitter has a first movers advantage and still will kill it because of Jack the egoist at top , I wish he kept his head on square and support someone smarter to run the show , I am sure he owns some stock that's down 40 points .
