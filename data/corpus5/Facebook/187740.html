Mark Zuckerberg Creates Opportunities To Launch Facebook In China - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha There's no denying that Facebook is banned in China, and for the company to sustain high rates of growth, it has to win over Chinese politicians. Well, Mark Zuckerberg is making progress in that he's met directly with the president of China Xi JinPing twice over the past week. Assuming Facebook can make some compromises here and there, and it appeals to the political interests of China, the company should be able to launch its family of products. That would bode well for shareholders as it would add substantial upside to growth assumptions. But even without those optimistic circumstances, I think Facebook is a solid buy as there's room for more upside in 2015 and 2016. So, Mark Zuckerberg could be making some headway when it comes to foreign politics, as he posted a photo of him attending a dinner with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. This is important because Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is not in China, and the only way for Chinese Facebook users to gain access to Facebook is to use a VPN. Going forward, however, I anticipate that Facebook will eventually gain enough political capital to enter the Chinese market so as long as they adhere to strict censorship laws or strike some other compromises when pertaining very specifically to cyber security. Mark Zuckerberg also met President Xi Jinping at the eighth annual US-China Internet Industry Forum in Seattle on September 23rd. With various opportunities to meet the Chinese president, it's likely that Facebook will eventually win over the Chinese political elite, which could be a noteworthy earnings catalyst at some future point in time. Having met the president of China twice, the probability of Facebook entering into China increases, as the president of China is looking to improve U.S. relations and continue the discussion of cybersecurity, the Internet, and various other political themes that are very standard when two leaders of state meet over dinner. Of course, the people attending the dinner are Silicon Valley and business elites, and from what I can tell, this is one of those golden opportunities in which Mark has a much better opportunity to cold approach the Chinese president than via phone or e-mail. Mark's wife, Priscilla Chan, is dressed in red as a sign of formality and respect, but also her heritage is Chinese. Mark Zuckerberg practiced speaking Mandarin, so he can intermingle with his in-laws more and used those skills as he attempted a conversation in Mandarin with full fluency with the president of China. In a prior article, I mentioned that China is going to be a very important theme going forward, as I anticipate that the company's growth rate in terms of daily and monthly active users will slow further as the company is going to face saturation issues at around 2 billion monthly active users. However, saturation becomes less of an issue, assuming Facebook can set up shop in China, as it would expand the Internet addressable market to 3.6 billion users by 2018, which would reduce the saturation impact over the foreseeable three years, as I project that Facebook could reach an MAU figure of 2.45 billion over that respective time frame. The stock has outperformed the broader market over the 12-month trailing period, and as such, investors are pricing in a lot of earnings and revenue growth to sustain current pricing levels. This implies that Facebook would need to sustain a fairly high compound annual growth rate, and that results will need to be driven by Instagram, WhatsApp, and market opportunities as well. While, I'm not necessarily pessimistic, the market environment hasn't been very conducive to momentum names lately with the exception of Facebook. So, good news in terms of China would be unexpected and would drive the stock to even loftier levels. Of course, that's assuming Facebook can compete in China and put itself in a position where it can be a truly international platform in which everyone in China can intermingle with the United States and vice versa. This all goes back to censorship and whether China has the stomach to deal with further westernization. Also, U.S. and Chinese relations pertaining to cyber theft hasn't been that good, and it's also fair to say that the United States government does use social networks as a means to combat terrorism. Therefore, because Facebook is complicit to the demands of various foreign governments, it's not exactly clear whether China is going to be very comfortable with data pertaining to Chinese social user accounts stored on U.S. servers. Of course, Facebook would have to build data centers in China because it wouldn't be efficient to operate a large network on Facebook's scale without situating the data within China. Nonetheless, the political friction is there and it's why Facebook continues to be banned in the Chinese mainland. However, it's not like all hope is lost. China is moving toward more of a consumption-driven economy, which will eventually result in some political compromise. Furthermore, opening the virtual borders to social networking could stimulate growth in the Chinese service sector. This is because tourism and various other industries would benefit significantly by having an online presence via Facebook. If more people had access to the Chinese via Facebook, there would be much more reason for foreigners to travel to China and for the Chinese to travel outside of the country's own borders. Over the years, Facebook integrated translation directly into status messages so people in foreign countries can interact with one another. I would know because I have met foreign exchange students from Germany, Netherlands and South Korea, and when they go back to their native countries, I'm still able to interact with their posts as a result of being able to translate status messages within Facebook. Going forward, I anticipate that this unique feature will appeal very specifically to China's political and economic interests. Furthermore, China can't remain isolated from the remaining G8 states, much less the rest of the world, as it's on its way to becoming a superpower, and as such, politicians need to demonstrate openness and collaboration with the international business community to win more political capital within the United Nations and with their own constituency. However, even if Facebook were granted entry into China, the challenges don't end there. The company faces an uphill battle with attracting mobile active users onto Facebook. In other words, the remaining social networks RenRen (NYSE: RENN ), Sina/Weibo (NASDAQ: SINA ) and WeChat (OTCPK: TCEHY ) would have to respond. The good news though for Facebook bulls is how fragmented these services are. They're very focused on certain aspects of social networking, whereas Facebook tends to pool social accounts into a web of different services. Furthermore, Facebook would inherently have a larger database of social accounts in which users can interact with, as people in mainland China can connect to friends and family overseas. Currently, Facebook does have an installed base of users in China. Admittedly, it's not clear what the figures are, but the number of Chinese users accessing Facebook via VPN could be a somewhat meaningful figure. According to a recent study by Global Web Index, there are 90 million Chinese using a VPN service to gain access to censored websites and social networking services. Of course, there are no figures to clearly establish how many are using Facebook out of that number, and furthermore, it's not exactly clear how effective China's efforts to combat VPNs have been since the beginning of 2015. The Chinese market does offer immense value to Facebook, I anticipate that the total addressable market is around 800 million internet users by 2018. The ARPU figure for those users is around $4 to $5 based on APAC (Asia Pacific) results and is currently growing at a 20% growth rate, according to Facebook's most recent annual report. Of course, the Chinese advertising market is growing much more quickly than the average CAGR of APAC markets. By 2018, the TAM would be approximately $6.9 billion (800 million internet users times $8.64 ARPU). The current TAM is approximately $3 billion (669 million internet users times $4.50 ARPU). If Facebook were to enter into the Chinese social media market, it wouldn't be that saturated in terms of users, so the actual revenue from Asia Pacific would mostly be driven by India, Japan, Russia and other Asian markets. However, the uptake in demand will likely be strong, and it will likely impact revenue and earnings more meaningfully by the 2018 to 2020 time frame. I anticipate that Facebook's non-GAAP EPS will grow to $3.25 in FY 2016 when compared to consensus estimates at $2.75. I'm anticipating much lesser earnings growth deceleration than the consensus as I anticipate profitability metrics to improve following an investment year. And while revenue could decelerate slightly, pricing of ads and engagement metrics will offset the modest deceleration in user acquisition. While, I acknowledge that these figures are optimistic, they're not inclusive of Chinese impact, so I think Facebook is a buy regardless of whether or not they're able to expand into China. There's a lot at stake here, but it's not enough to derail investor sentiment and growth in terms of earnings or sales. Hence, I continue to recommend the stock and maintain my current price target of $111.21. There should be a little more upside to the stock even after the relatively solid year it has already had.
