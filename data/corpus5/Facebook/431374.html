Snapchat Is Overhyped - Snapchat (Private:CHAT) | Seeking Alpha Snapchat cannot monetize the way Facebook can because it can't target ads. Twitter is the better comparison. Snapchat will actually have even less targeting than Twitter. This article is going to be a combination of the past two social media articles on the Scout account , this time with a focus on Snapchat (Private: CHAT ). The point made in the Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) article was that social media is in competition with other websites/apps such as messengers, news websites, and entertainment. Snapchat does have a messenger built into its app, but users are now using the story feature more. Even Facebook, which is the king of monetizing usage, hasn't been able to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger to the level of Facebook itself. The reasoning is simple. Ads cannot be targeted to users unless the app reads messages to see what the conversation is about. That would make users uncomfortable and shun the app, so it's not a viable business operation. The point made in the Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) article was that Twitter is not profitable because it cannot target ads the way Facebook can. If Twitter isn't profitable at this point, when will it be profitable? It needs to cut costs and figure out better targeting methods like Facebook has done. Snapchat has both problems listed above. Snapchat existing in the social media space has taken share from Facebook, but the inherent concept that social media usage will grow forever and never decline is flawed. As I showed in Facebook article, there was a total of 22.4 minutes spent less on social media in America in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015. U.K. usage is considered a leading indicator for future trends in social media. Usage on Snapchat in the U.K. fell from 18.32 minutes per day to 15.45 minutes. Current installs also declined for Snapchat in most markets. The side metric on the graph below is the percentage of Android smartphone users with Snapchat installed on their phone. In the U.K the percentage of smartphone users with Snapchat on their phone fell from 24.34% to 18.36%. Snapchat is in a similar position to Facebook as I'd reckon very few users are on Snapchat specifically to check the news. This means original sharing is the glue that keeps users coming back to the app. Users just happen to be on the app, so they tap on various functions such as news and entertainment. Showing additional content to users represents Snapchat's goal to incrementally increase usage and to become more relevant as sending selfies to your friends isn't exactly a pivotal part of society. The point of Twitter having less ability to monetize users is even more prevalent for Snapchat. Snapchat has no ability to find out information about users in order to target ads to them. Even worse Snapchat doesn't have a place for advertisers to put links in order to direct them to their websites to spend money. The funnel doesn't exist. Also a conversation about the product cannot occur as there is no comment section. It doesn't take an expert to figure out a disappearing ad is simply not that valuable to firms. There are also sponsored lenses which are a unique way to capture users' attention. This cannot be scaled as it is a difficult process to create a lense as firms can't onboard marketing projects used on other platforms. Also only one or two can be shown at a time. The more sponsored lenses there are, the less each is worth. Snapchat has even tried charging for its service such as for different lenses, but it stopped doing so as it didn't work since other social media apps are completely free. To me this shows the firm is having trouble monetizing. Snapchat may be used for more time than Twitter, but its monetization challenges are even more difficult. You can see the charts of both Twitter and Facebook below on the Scout Finance app . Facebook is up 43% in the past 12 months and Twitter is down 61%. Based on this inability to target users with advertising, I see Snapchat as following the trajectory of Twitter instead of Facebook. Snapchat is currently being valued at $22.7 billion in the private market. The company is projecting revenues of $300 million in 2016 and $500 million to $1 billion in 2017. If it does hit its lofty expectations, its valuation will grow. Snapchat is a story stock, so if it does go public in 2017, then I'd expect the valuation to rise further at the IPO price. We don't know the specifics of Snapchat's bottom line until it files with the SEC, but judging by the type of business it is in, I'd expect the valuations to be absurd. Snapchat is closer to Twitter than Facebook in terms of monetization potential. Even if Snapchat can grow its total users and time spent to reach the heights of Facebook, it will never be as profitable. When the hype surrounding the company fades after the IPO a realistic valuation will take hold sending the stock lower. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
