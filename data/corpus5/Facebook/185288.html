Facebook And Instagram: What's The Upside And What Are The Risks? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The trend in growth is astonishing, but the management team also is missing out on a lot of opportunities. Facebook continues to grow but has become more mobile app dependent, which has proven to be a sound strategy. Ad-blocking has become a meaningful risk factor, and while Facebook is well-positioned to tackle these problems, PC ads may generate lower CTRs and CPMs over time. However, revenues and earnings are still growing at a healthy pace and the company is much better positioned to handle the risk factors when compared to other media companies. Things have become a lot more interesting when it comes to Instagram lately, and I'm well aware that many of you already know that they have reached 400 million monthly active users. It was a few years ago when Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) was also floating around the same levels. However, many things have changed in the advertising space over those years, and as such it's fair to say that every incremental user gain that Instagram experiences will add substantially more to topline growth than in the case of Facebook back in 2010. However, there also sre things that the management team has been slow to execute upon as users are extremely sensitive to advertising in the Instagram feed. That being the case, native advertising seems to be the most effective form of advertising for mobile devices, and as such I anticipate more and more publishers to adopt native advertising. However, integrating these type of ad formats becomes somewhat difficult for programmatic ad exchanges and while many publishers are sensitive to the commoditization of ad inventory, the advantage to third-party attribution also offsets some of the downside to commodity like pricing. These days, there are advanced technologies to track user behavior from one website to the next, and if the user clicks on an advertisement it's likely that the advertisement will continue to follow the user from one web page to the next. Hence, advertisers want to know how to effectively attribute conversions and re-target ads at their intended audience. However, the only way to really understand the impact of an advertisement is through pooling data onto a third-party network that tracks behavior across multiple web publishing platforms. In other words, programmatic ad networks are the way to go. Ad networks have become much more crucial in this day and age and to address this issue Facebook has devised Atlas, which is a very promising technology, but it doesn't have as extensive of a publishing network as perhaps Double Click Ad Manager. Going forward, attribution is key to the growth potential of Instagram, and as such it would be fair to say that the company really needs to develop a strategy for integrating its ad-bidding system into a broader network so advertisers can understand the behavior of the user and whether that user decided to purchase a product after viewing the ad maybe days or months down the road. Of course, if a user purchases the product then Instagram will get a cut off the action via conversions, and it substantiates the CPMs they charge to advertisers. Of course, none of this has actually happened yet, and only a small group of advertisers are allowed to purchase ads on Instagram. The mobile app tends to operate on an older Madison Avenue model of selling ads directly to companies. Of course, they offer a user interface and custom back-end dashboard for advertisers to understand the effectiveness of their campaign, but it's not like data can be pooled together into a comprehensive ad campaign manager. Therefore, the potential to further monetize Instagram is there, but obviously the lack of involvement in programmatic ad-bidding will start to take a toll on growthr even as platform specific advantages and growth in audience metrics were to offset some of that impact. The growth in mobile programmatic has been huge and while Facebook is typically integrated into some programmatic ad managers, Instagram is left in Facebook's shadow. In a sense, this has limited the growth rate of Instagram's ad revenue, and it's why Facebook doesn't report Instagram results separately as it's a small fraction that's less than 10% of the consolidated company's revenue. Of course, Facebook isn't in any hurry to quickly monetize Instagram as the core social platform generates enough growth to keep shareholders happy. However, any extra bit does help and it's fair to say that Facebook needs to develop Instagram's monetization model if it wants to sustain mid-30% growth for the next couple years. Furthermore, there are some threats to the business model and while Facebook is well positioned to combat those risks, there's no denying that ad blocking software has been a consistent reoccurring risk factor amongst web publishers. In 2015 alone, it has been estimated that $22 billion in ad revenue was lost to ad blocking software, according to the Adobe 2015 ad blocking report. Native advertising on mobile devices seem somewhat resistant to these risk factors. However, going forward it becomes a lot less effective to advertise on web browsers and conventional PCs. Mobile web browsers also are starting to block ads and 16% of mobile Firefox users currently block ads. Not to mention 16% of the US online population blocked ads during the second quarter of 2015. I anticipate that there will be meaningful growth in ad-sensitive users and the best-known workaround is to package the web-based experience into mobile applications and sell the ads via a third-party ad network or sell directly to mobile advertisers. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also has backed these efforts by integrating software tools into the iOS 9 developer kit so ads can be blocked on the Safari mobile browser. Of course, Apple has plenty of incentive to block ads because it's not dependent on an ad-model and would weaken tech rivals that rely on advertising to fuel investment into software and product development. Of course, there are losers in this transition, and all of the major publishers are losing money as a result of Apple's attempt to black ads on Safari. So, going forward it's easy to anticipate Facebook's core web audience becomes a lot less efficient in terms of CPMs and CTRs, and it's likely that mobile DAUs and MAUs become a much bigger factor to growth going forward, hence the importance of Instagram because it's a mobile only platform. Do all these risk factors make the stock a sell? Not really. For the most part, Facebook is a stalwart among web publishers primarily because they have already addressed this issue in its business model more effectively than any other web publisher. Furthermore, Facebook has much better data and it is able to market that advantage to advertisers while also integrating that data into programmatic ad-managers like AdRoll, for example. The stocks you really have to be wary of are the ones that have a very limited mobile presence or face competitive dynamics that are very difficult to overcome and have not successfully transitioned to a web-publishing model. Good examples of this include News Corporation (NASDAQ: FOXA ), New York Times (NYSE: NYT ) and CBS (NYSE: CBS ). To conclude, it would be fair to say that Facebook is a solid play on mobile and desktop advertising. The company has a number of successful platforms that are more in-tuned with what consumers want, and as such, the business has generated substantial growth in an environment where conventional media players are total losers. As such, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation despite risks to the current business model and competitive threats from other publishing platforms.
