Line Corp. IPO: Growth Ahead Is Limited - LINE (Pending:LN) | Seeking Alpha Even though the IPO has been delayed for two years, there are optimistic aims to raise $1.1 billion. Monthly active users in Japan and Southeast Asia rapidly increasing but global data pointing toward maturity stage. China's censorship blocks "Line" expansion to second largest economy in the world, allowing WeChat to thrive. "Facebook" has established market share through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp in the U.S and also the global market. Line Corp. ("Line (Pending: LN )") is a global platform primarily focused on mobile messaging that also collects significant portions of its revenue streams from advertising and content distribution. The mobile application consists of integrating content and service offers to users via their "life platform" giving access to restaurant reservations, taxi booking services and payment services. According to recent F-1 fillings per share value is between $25 and $28 ADS. The company is aiming to raise around $1.1 billion . Some might have heard noise about the company's IPO before. Line has been delaying the public offering for quite a while now. Their position regarding said the delay results from multiple reasons. Developing their business outlook and fixing average financials have resulted in the valuation to decline severely over the two year time frame. First I believe it's important to illustrate the existing market layout of leading social networks so that we have a more clear picture of how Line stands against its market competitors as of April 2016. The graph above clearly portrays Facebook ("Facebook (NASDAQ: FB )") as the dominant market leader. *Data source: Line Corp. SEC Fillings After launching in Japan back in June 2011, Line has steadily increased its monthly active users (MAUs) respectively in the southeast region of Asia. Nevertheless, the mobile messaging industry in developing countries indicated (obviously the segment besides Japan) has been going through a growth stage as mobile phones become more and more prevalent in daily life, also cheaper to attain. *Data source: Line Corp. SEC Fillings Global MAU growth slowed down after the second half of 2015. The humdrum stage indicates a mature user base on the messaging application. Hence the notion the MAUs of Line are growing carries fallible characteristics from a global perspective. Integrating into developing markets in Latin America and Middle East carries drastic importance for the company. Furthermore, European and U.S. markets are heavily dominated by Facebook Messenger along with considerable support from WhatsApp. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption feature makes it a relatively more attractive application for developed world users with business-related backgrounds. Sidenote: Facebook has its own messaging application (Facebook Messenger) along with an ownership of the world leading messaging platform WhatsApp . The acquisition took place in February 2014. As indicated from the graph above, Facebook Messenger is using the vast user platform of Facebook as a means to attract more MAUs. This puts Line in a rough spot, making it difficult to compete in the global segment as Facebook Messenger is snatching up more and more market share. Similiar to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp is posing a major threat for Line in terms of as a barrier of entry. The gradual increase throughout the years has brought WhatsApp to 1 billion MAUs as of Feb 2016, making them the first in mobile messaging to reach such a figure. It's obvious that Line has a presence in the Asia Pacific, although for future growth the company would need to enter developing regions of the globe as I have indicated previously. The problem they face is that WhatsApp's usage penetration in Latin America and Middle East/Africa has already been well established. Almost two thirds of internet users in both these regions engaged with WhatsApp for mobile messaging purposes in Q42015. Amidst the established presence in Asian markets, Line has been facing one of its toughest challenges - they are blocked out of China. WeChat , a similar app in function, is dominating the messaging industry by using China's national Internet censorship rules for their fiscal benefit. Users of Line in China have to create Virtual Private Networks (VPN) tunnels to bypass censorship enforced by the federal government to access the application. China's censored societal stance deteriorates future growth projections for Line. Without entrance into the Chinese market it is not feasible to attract more institutional investors. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and WeChat are unlikely to lose market share to Line unless the aggregate industry dynamics go through a drastic change. Line Corp.'s expansion is reliant on the usage increase in mobile messaging in stronghold market Japan. Japan has already become a mature audience of market innovation in mobile technology, hence Line's best bet of increasing profitability relies solely on the constant increase in demand for mobile messaging. Expected mobile messaging user penetration in Japan implies that growth will slow down. I'm going ahead and stating the obvious - further Japanese engagement in Line is the key for growth for the company's future. However, it is evident that rapid growth seen between 2014 to 2015 will not reflect on the projections up to 2019. Growth is slowing down in user penetration in mobile messaging as technological innovation takes the Japanese to new stages in communication. *Data source: Line Corp. SEC Fillings The company uses monthly paying users (MPUs) to measure the different revenue streams they have. Stickers, games and advertising products make up a majority portion of revenue lines. Although monetizing has gradually increased through the years MPU growth reached a plateau after December 2015. Given the underperformance, MAUs have decreased 22.5% YoY in Q1 of 2016., indicating a decline in user participation for the company. *Data source: Line Corp. SEC Fillings Line is standing behind the growth projections in global mobile advertising. I'm not certain how this renders a legitimate argument for Line. Facebook forges a barrier for entry in both the U.S and the aggregate America market, therefore it is not applicable for Line to attract such a market segment in the ongoing years. Without an established presence in the border market of China or the U.S, how likely is it that Line will receive their fair share from the expected growth in mobile advertising? A low possibility even in an optimistic scenario. Taking into consideration limited growth outside of Japan and other Southeast Asia countries, limited growth space fueling the risk brings up a lot of question marks for the company. Line cannot compete with Facebook and its other entities. There has been a newly formed positive environment for tech stocks after the recent "Twilio (NYSE: TWLO )" IPO but this does not constitute a clear-cut outlook for Line Corp.'s future, thus the popular perception is misleading. Macroeconomic doubtfulness fueled with the recent Brexit from the European common market does not forge a benign climate for such a tech IPO. The rational behavior ahead for investors should be to avoid the IPO and wait for an increase of usage of the application within the global markets, particularly in the Latin America and Middle East/Africa segments. There could be a bullish argument made if Line were to increase its user base in developing regions but that would require assumptions regarding WhatsApp's existing presence. Secondly but foremost revenue streams have to keep growing consistently in a maturing Japanese market. Until then, there isn't reasonable room for growth.
