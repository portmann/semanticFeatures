Facebook Has The Potential To Replace Yelp - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital (549 clicks) We believe Facebook is gearing up to take on Yelp and Angie's List. We see Facebook Services and Facebook Places as Facebook's initial attempts to leverage the vast network of Facebook review data to create a service review and discovery platform. We believe Facebook's final product in this space will synergize the best parts of Places and Services in one consolidated application. Consolidation in this space makes sense, and Facebook has all the user-generated information in the world, so we see Facebook's finalized business search service being the market leader upon launch. With the recent announcement that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is prepping a local services site, we believe the world's largest social platform is gearing up to take on Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and Angie's List (NASDAQ: ANGI ). Given Facebook's scale and access to perhaps the world's largest pool of user-generated information, we believe Facebook's service discovery and review platform, when finalized, will ultimately takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angie's List. While Facebook Services is an early-test and it doesn't look like the company is ready to promote it yet , it does come on top of Facebook Places . The company now has two features of the social media platform which have been kept relatively quiet but separately address the local business search market. Facebook Services (still in test mode) has been live for about a month, and is more-or-less a searchable directory that looks like an overlap of Yelp and Angie's List. Facebook Services allows the user to search through local businesses' Facebook Pages, so this encompasses both professional services like plumbers, photographers, and painters and more leisure services like restaurants and bars. As it currently stands, though, Facebook Services is not anywhere close to being an Angie's List or Yelp-substitute. Facebook Places, on the other hand, allows users to explore things to do in a certain place. It is essentially a travel book for a certain location, complete with recommended places to eat, drink, and shop. For example, say you were looking for things to do in Sydney, Australia. You would go to Facebook Places, type in Sydney, and Facebook would return a page full of things to do in Sydney, including popular dining and accommodation. Clicking on one of these "Recommended Places" refers you to the place's Facebook Page. Perhaps more unique is Facebook Places allows you to see posts from your friends who have been to Sydney (or "checked-in") as well as view current and upcoming events in and around the Sydney area. Facebook Services and Places are two separate features on the vast social platform, and neither have been strongly promoted by Facebook management. Services is a very unfinished product still in test-mode, with the results section still omitting several businesses and lacking a sort button. Services is currently desktop-only. Places, meanwhile, is more fleshed out on desktop and accessible on mobile, but is buried beneath the Friends, Events, Groups, Instagram, and Pages icons in the More section on your phone. In essence, both Places and Services are Beta versions, and neither on their own without Facebook-management promotion are much of a threat to Yelp or Angie's List. This, though, doesn't mean Yelp and Angie's List should be unconcerned with Facebook's Beta versions. We are of the firm opinion that Facebook can (and will) unseat both of these market leaders in time. It certainly looks like Facebook is staying mostly quiet on this side of its social platform until it can perfect a way to appropriately leverage its extensive network of service review data. We have no doubts that this is the way Facebook is headed, as according to a Facebook spokesperson : "We're in the early stages of testing a way for people to easily find more pages for the services they're interested in." We take from this quote that Places and Services are Facebook's initial attempts to leverage the vast network of review data Facebook has (we think of Places and Services as test-runs at different angles). We believe Facebook's final product in this space will synergize the best parts of Places and Services in one consolidated application as well as add missing features such as the ability to sort results, an order from home / book now feature on all pages where applicable, and a cleaner and more complete results interface. There will also likely be some integration with Messenger, as Facebook took steps earlier this year to turn Messenger into a B2C communication tool. We are not sure when Facebook will launch this Yelp-substitute. It could take a great deal of time to figure out all the logistics involved and appropriately leverage all the user-generated data on Facebook, but we do believe that when Facebook does launch a local business search and directory ads service, this service will takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angie's List. In our opinion, consolidation here makes sense. Facebook is the world's largest social media platform, with 1.39 billion mobile monthly active users , and roughly 1 out of every 7 people in the world interact with Facebook on a daily basis (through desktop or mobile). Yelp's monthly mobile audience, meanwhile, hovers around 90 million . Facebook has access to more than 15x as many people as Yelp, which also means Facebook has access to more than 15x as many potential reviewers. Individuals on Facebook post about everything from what they eat to where they shop to how they feel. Facebook posts cover the gamut of options, and service review is no exception. Facebook recently announced that it has more than 50 million active business pages that collectively receive 2.5 billion comments each month. Our research (browsing through different companies' Facebook Pages and Yelp pages) suggests that Yelp, on average, currently offers more reviews than Facebook, but this is to be expected. Yelp is, after all, the service-review platform. On Facebook, though, you can see how many "likes" the place has, how many people have "checked-in" there, and which of your friends have been there. Perhaps most importantly, you can browse through all of the Facebook posts related to the location. This is all in addition to the reviews of the service. There is plenty of data on Facebook that platforms like Yelp cannot offer. In essence, a local business search and directory ads service fits perfectly into Facebook's platform, which is simply a collection of more a than billion people's thoughts about everything. Along that train of thought, we believe perhaps the best way to get a mass sentiment on something is to go through Facebook because it is a collection of opinions of more than 1 billion people. If Facebook establishes itself as a service-review platform, then the participation of these billion people in both discovering and reviewing services through Facebook will likely skyrocket. If customer participation increases, then businesses will more actively manage their Facebook Pages. This brings Facebook one step closer to converting its 50 million business page owners into advertisers. There are many ways in which Facebook can fully leverage its user-base for service review and discovery. One way is to do something like Facebook's Trending feature. Using the Trending feature, Facebook users can select a trending news story and see what people on Facebook are saying about it. Facebook Pages could be reorganized to look more like these Trending pages, where you can sort by things like top post and latest post relevant to the selected topic, and Facebook could add a feature that would be something like trending services/places in your area. Facebook could also add a Recommended For You and Our Picks section. It should be noted that advertising space in these areas could be a huge revenue driver. Whichever way Facebook chooses to leverage its user-base for service review and discovery, Facebook has the potential, given its user-base, to takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angie's List. Again, consolidation here makes sense. From the consumer standpoint, one application for both posting opinions and collecting opinions seems ideal. Facebook has all the user-generated information in the world, inclusive of likes, posts, pictures, check-ins, and reviews. It only makes sense that Facebook develops a local business search service, and it looks like they are in the works of doing so. We believe that when this finalized service launches, it will become the market leader. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
