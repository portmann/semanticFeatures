Twitter In 2016: Everything You Need To Know About Periscope - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti , My Janet Yellen Impersonation (1,201 clicks) In mid-January Periscope will update its numbers and will show over four million daily active users. Periscope will also release a major update in January, which should bolster growth. My estimate for Periscope's value is somewhere between $120 million and $480 million. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) stock continues to languish in the low $20s. On the bright side, the January effect, which sometimes lifts stocks that had a bad year, lifted Twitter stock 4% Thursday and should power it higher for the next week. Besides the January effect, there is more reason to be optimistic going into 2016: I think Periscope can help turn the company around. It was named App of the Year in the App Store. This should boost the number of users who try it. The biggest problem for Twitter has been that a lot the people who have tried Twitter have given up on it. I think if Twitter gets a similar number of people to try Periscope, we will see monthly active users potentially grow larger than Twitter itself. Integration with Periscope can help Twitter, but unfortunately nothing major has happened yet. My original motivation for writing this article was the interview Periscope CEO and co-founder Kayvon Beykpour did on CNBC . He said all of the platform's metrics have more than doubled since the August update when two million daily active users combined to watch 40 years' worth of video per day. This was a preview of the results Kayvon will report sometime in the next few weeks. I have been expecting Kayvon to do an update sometime in December or January, so that expectation seems to be on the mark. Not only will Periscope announce its latest metrics in January, but I'm also expecting a major update to the app. If you look at each major update, the average time between them is 68 days. As of December 31, it has been 50 days since the 1.3 version of the app was released, so an update in the next two to three weeks would be in-line with the average. The biggest function the firm is working on improving is search. Periscope is a live version of YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Obviously search is incredibly important to YouTube's user experience. Periscope has a unique challenge because the content is all updating dynamically. The search function will become even more important as the quantity of content increases. Because Kayvon has told us the firm is working on search I am fairly certain an improvement will come in the next update. There are three more improvements on my wish list that could vault the app to new heights. Hearts has room for expansion. Hearts is the killer feature that differentiates Periscope from other live streaming apps. The equivalent killer feature for Instagram (NASDAQ: FB ) is filters. The killer feature on Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) are lenses and the ability to draw-on and manipulate photos and videos. Lenses has been so successful for Snapchat that it actually charges $0.99 for some of them. You can see an example of a lens below with me looking like Santa Clause. These key features help these apps withstand copycats. Periscope has already improved hearts by making them seasonal. I want Periscope to allow streamers and viewers to change the colors of their hearts instead of having them randomly assigned. This may seem trivial, but by making them assigned Periscope can allow polls to take place. This would further improve communication between the viewer and content creator. This can great for businesses using Periscope to gauge the audience's opinion of a new product. It is a live form of Twitter polls. Hearts are a far superior engagement mechanism than likes and dislikes on YouTube videos because of these factors. My other two requests are for integration with Twitter Moments and adding filters. While those who aren't familiar with Periscope are calling for monetization, I am calling for integration with Twitter, which can help both platforms cross-pollinate. When watching Periscopes I have asked scopers about Twitter. They seem to all say they love Snapchat and Instagram, but don't have a Twitter. Just as Facebook has to get young Instagram users onto Facebook, Twitter has to get its young Periscope users back onto Twitter. Adding filters would be an example of Periscope copying the best feature of Instagram, which is what Snapchat did to improve its functionality. The last time Periscope gave an update in August I gave an estimate of what Periscope was worth based on the watch time compared to YouTube. The numbers are still the same for YouTube, since the last update was about five months ago. I assumed YouTube is worth $80 billion. YouTube last gave out the number of hours watched per month in 2013. Assuming YouTube grew by about 50% to 60%, the six billion hours watched per month in 2013 turns into about 14 billion hours per month in 2015. This left me with a valuation of $60 million for Periscope. Based on Kayvon saying Periscope more than doubled, Periscope would now, in my estimation, be worth $120 million. This isn't a perfect valuation because it assumes Periscope can monetize as well as YouTube. It also doesn't take into account that Periscope is growing much faster than YouTube. Since Periscope is growing at about four times the speed of YouTube, you could argue it's worth $480 million. However, as I said, assuming Periscope can monetize at the same rate as YouTube may be aggressive, so I'll stick to the $120 million valuation estimate. The amount Periscope is valued at, as a percentage of Twitter's total market cap, has grown exponentially since August as Twitter stock has declined 18.2% (as of the close on December 31st) and Periscope's valuation has doubled. In August Periscope was 0.31% of Twitter; now it is 0.76% of Twitter. Just as Instagram has grown to be a larger part of Facebook and YouTube has grown to be a larger part of Alphabet, Periscope should grow to be a larger part of Twitter. I'm betting that we won't see another 18.2% decline by the next Periscope update later in 2016. Another data point that we have is the estimate of total downloads on the Android Play Store. According to the Play Store, Periscope has between 10 million and 50 million installs and Twitter has between 100 million and 500 million installs (Instagram has between 500 million and 1 billion installs). This puts Periscope at one tenth the size of Twitter and one twentieth the size of Instagram, which is impressive for an app less than one year old. This momentum helps the app grow further because more streamers will want to capture this growing audience. An important point worth mentioning is the level of support Periscope is getting from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). As I have already stated, it was named the App of the Year. I was shocked to find the way Apple ranked Periscope under the "New to the App Store" tab. As you can see from the screen shot below, Apple has a category for social media for new users. As you can see from the Social Networking list, Facebook is first, Periscope is second, Pinterest (Private: PINIT ) is third, and Twitter is fourth (Instagram and Snapchat were under photo and video). Apple thinks users need to know about Periscope more than Twitter, Pinterest, and Tumblr (which was fifth). This shows how much support Apple is giving Periscope. This order is not random. The apps are not listed in alphabetical order. One way I know Apple meticulously selects these apps is it didn't put Spotify (Private: MUSIC ) under the music tab, probably because it considers it a competitive threat to its Music product. Support from the App Store will be critical for Periscope's success. One catalyst Periscope has is that it is the perfect app for the presidential candidates in 2016. Rand Paul did a livestream, but he chose to use UStream to show a day of his campaign. I think his choice in streaming services follows the direction of his campaign, which has had a number of poor choices. As I mentioned in my last article on Twitter, Donald Trump will have the biggest effect on the trail as he has been making news with every tweet he has sent to his 5.5 million followers. Since August 15th Donald Trump has done four Periscopes and has garnered 186,000 followers on the app. If he starts to use the app more regularly, it can be a catalyst for growth, similar to how the Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight drove usage growth. Donald Trump has about 400,000 more followers on Twitter than he has on Facebook, so he will maintain his usage on the social network. He has repeatedly praised the social network. I'm expecting him to connect with his followers with Periscope more often in 2016. He is currently the most likely candidate to be nominated by the GOP according to Pivit.io ( 34% chance ). In my article on Facebook Live, I mentioned that it was not a threat to Periscope because it wasn't in the same category. Everything I have said about Facebook Live came before I was able to try it out myself, so it was subject to change. Facebook Live has been released to some iPhone users as it slowly rolls out. Since I am one of those lucky users who have an iPhone, I have been able to test it out. My opinion on the live feature is that it is terrible. When outsiders notice that Facebook Live streams get millions of viewers when celebrities do them, they need to understand what this means. Facebook Live isn't competing with Periscope when it comes to total reach. Facebook Live is competing with Facebook video. While Facebook Live videos get more views over time than Periscopes, if they don't garner more views than a regular Facebook video, there is no point to it. From my own experience all of my views came after it was posted, thus defeating the purpose of a livestream. I'm willing to bet the livestreams that Facebook claimed received millions of views would have occurred even if they weren't live. As I mentioned in my last article, Facebook has to calibrate who it decides to give a notification when a person goes live. For Facebook Mentions, the livestream notified those who recently engaged or liked the page of the celebrity to get the word out about the stream without bombarding people who weren't interested. In my experience, my mom was the only one of my 240 friends to be notified. Two of my friends joined the stream after seeing it in their newsfeed. As I said, almost all of the views came after I posted the video. Obviously the number of views is anecdotal information, but my experience with the features within the app should be the same for all users trying it out for the first time. Going from Periscope to Facebook Live is akin to going from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 3Gs because the technology isn't up to par. Facebook Live had an incredibly long delay, making it impossible to communicate with my viewers. I measured the delay on both apps. Facebook Live had an average delay of 19.59 seconds and Periscope had an average delay of 3.11 seconds using the same Wifi signal and the same iPhone 6s. Therefore, Facebook Live isn't even live, which defeats the purpose. Keep in mind Periscope is the best experience as it does a few seconds better than Meerkat. Another negative is regular, non-celebrity users can't get followers or subscribers to grow their viewership. With the Mentions app celebrities can have viewers subscribe to get notified about future streams. Of course, Facebook Live also doesn't have hearts, which makes it like a photo sharing app that is trying to compete with Instagram while not having filters for photos. Finally, Facebook Live isn't really a broadcast because when you tap public, you can't see who is joining if you aren't friends with them. I doubt many people on Facebook will use it publicly; I only tapped it to test out the feature. Either way, this limited my ability to welcome these viewers, which gets them to stay longer. In conclusion, Facebook Live broadcasts aren't live broadcasts. I'm assuming the usability is better for the Mentions app, but I thought Facebook was testing it with celebrities to bring it to regular users. Apparently, it needs more testing. If it takes a few more months to get Facebook Live to have less of a lag, Periscope will continue to widen its lead in features and strength of community. There has been a major decline in downloads on the App Store for Periscope over the Christmas holiday. As you can see from the chart, it dropped to 260th place during Christmas and rebounded somewhat to 151st place . This decline is not because of Facebook Live. It is because Periscope isn't exactly a social media app. While most social media apps, such as Instagram, were probably used heavily during Christmas to share family photos, users who care about their privacy don't want to broadcast their time with their family to strangers. I expect Periscope to rebound further into 2016 and get back into the top 100 apps in the App Store. While monetization of Periscope will not come in 2016 for Twitter, it has already come for scopers. Alex Pettitt has done a livestream sponsored by SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ). Alex Pettitt and other scopers are excepting donations on PayPal.me (NASDAQ: PYPL ). Bree Olson is actually charging $10 for a follow on Periscope. These are small steps, but they show the potential of streamers to make real money just like on YouNow. If streamers can make money, they will make more Periscopes, and of higher quality. This is just like how YouTubers use the money they make from videos to improve their channel. As you can see from the Alexa chart below, Periscope's desktop website continues to grow exponentially. It shows how diversified its user base is, by having a better rank globally than in the United States. Blab and Meerkat have fallen off the map completely as their usage has declined. YouNow's Alexa ranking hasn't grown since October and is less popular than Periscope on desktop. On mobile it's ranking in the App Store has improved since October, but is still slightly behind Periscope. I don't think competition is the biggest obstacle for Periscope's success. Executing on improving the product is the biggest obstacle. That being said, less competition can't hurt the app. I don't see YouNow as a long-term threat to Periscope because it is so heavily geared toward younger users. YouNow has done great job at getting YouTubers onto its platform by engaging them directly. While this is a great strategy, the reason why social networks are successful is they have the best platform that makes the argument for joining without having to individually engage users. I doubt Periscope personally asked Jenna Marbles (one of the biggest YouTubers) to do a scope. This is why Periscope can scale better than YouNow.
