Apple buys voice assistant/language technology startup - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Oct  2 2015, 18:41 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has bought VocalIQ , a U.K.-based developer of a "self-learning dialogue platform" that developers and OEMs can use to create personal assistants that understand natural-language questions and commands. VocalIQ's technology, which could be used to help Siri better decipher conversational language, relies on A.I./machine learning to steadily improve its understanding of human dialogue. Notably, the auto market was a focus area for the company, with GM a partner. Google (Now) and Microsoft (Cortana) have also been making investments in natural-language processing driven by machine learning. Facebook, meanwhile, recently showed off an assistant (known as M) that relies on both machine learning and actual humans to provide answers. iOS 9 brought with it Apple's Proactive assistant , which uses both Siri and user data to push relevant content a la Google Now. This year has also seen the launch of the Siri-capable Apple Watch, and is set to see the rollout of an Apple TV set-top supporting Siri. Nuance (NASDAQ: NUAN ) is believed to help power the platform.
