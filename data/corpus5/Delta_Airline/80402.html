Intel Will Exceed $36 By Year End - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha According to CAPM, Intel will return investors 5.5% this year: I disagree with the traditional pricing model. After modeling various scenarios, I have an EPS range of $2.41 to $2.61 and believe that volatility will creep up in the back half of the year. The stock price could potentially swing from $31.18 to $41.26 as market expectations could change drastically on a quarter by quarter basis. After weighing both positives and negatives, I have conviction that Intel will at least reach $36 by the end of the calendar year. While the sky might not be falling on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), the share price surely is. Following the close of the Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) deal, Intel underperformed the broader market and fell by more than 10%. Like many, I found myself scratching my head. But that's okay, because over the long-term, the company can justify the premium it paid to buyout Altera by increasing prices across its server-class CPUs, Co-CPUs and FPGAs. While the company didn't mention the significant cost synergies from the deal in an intelligible manner, the added volume will improve the cost structure for operating more expensive fabs as operating at more advanced nodes will require disruptive changes in lithography, materials and design going forward. This increases costs, so to mitigate the impact, the next step is to create opportunities to drive significant wafer volumes. Therefore, the acquisition of Altera may prove helpful over the long haul. Now, according to economic theory, the best way to maximize profitability is to be the only major provider of a product or service. In our case, Intel operates a natural monopoly by erecting both artificial and competitive barriers to market entry. Intel holds the patents to various technologies pertaining to the X86 instruction set and has enough R&D resources to compete on two major fronts - fabs and chips. Therefore, Intel can sell at higher price points, which will reduce volume, so that pricing elasticity is maximized to the benefit of the supplier and not the purchaser. Now, I'm not a huge proponent of using CAPM for predicting stock prices, as it's not always an accurate forward indicator of expected returns. After inputting the expected returns for the stock market (7.9%), 10-year treasury yields (2.19%), and Intel's five-year beta (.94) into my CAPM Model the expected return is 5.49%. The stock has done much worse than that this year (-12%). So, to add emphasis, CAPM isn't always an accurate forward indicator, but it's nice to compare the year-to-date performance against the expected return of the security. I disagree with the expected return in this specific case. The reason? Beta captures volatility on a per day basis, and doesn't measure delta in context of monthly or yearly inputs. The average volatility per day over a series of time is different from the cumulative return of a stock in comparison to the index. In many cases I have seen a stock continuously increase in value, but at a lower rate of volatility when averaged over a period of months or years. In cases like that, a stock exhibits low volatility, yet produces a higher rate of return than the expected return. Generating alpha comes from foresight, an ability that humans have learned to develop via various abstract forms of logic. If you do something a certain outcome will occur. When studying economics and finance, I have often found that the quality of a business could easily be determined by the durability of earnings, the growth trajectory, and its relative valuation. Now, when you combine all three of these factors, Intel is an easy investment case to make. By the end of the year, I anticipate the company to surprise both on gross margins and revenue. Sure, the upgrade cycle might not result in a stunning rate of growth, but it doesn't need to. The DCG needs to sustain a high enough of a growth rate to offset the impact from lower performing categories. I've modeled various scenarios, and I think Intel will report an adjusted earnings figure that excludes the short-term charges from the Altera acquisition. I anticipate two scenarios. The scenario where Intel's PCCG generates 0% growth and the scenario where PCCG reports 5% contraction. Now in the best-case scenario, Intel reports EPS of $2.61 and trades at $41.26. The worst-case scenario is EPS of $2.41, which would drag my price projection down to $31.18. I think that the stock will stay within a low $30 to low $40 range. After factoring in the impact from the Altera acquisition, my bias is leaning toward EPS of $2.61 or more. This is because the acquisition of Altera generates enough meaningful revenue and net income accretion to offset a 5% reduction in PCCG revenue. Furthermore, the net profit margin should improve by at least a hundred basis points on the back of falling mobile subsidies and the integration of a higher margin FPGA business. Investors should anticipate the back half of the year to swing from wildly negative back into wildly positive territory. This implies that the stock should be bought on the recent pullback as results will be back-half weighted due to the seasonal nature of PCs and mobile devices. I'm going to lower my price target from $44.85 to $36.22. However, I continue to reiterate my buy rating on the stock. While I acknowledge the confusion that has surfaced from the acquisition of Altera, the stock has reasonable upside even after factoring in a year-over-year decline of 5% in PCCG and the integration of a bolt-on acquisition.
