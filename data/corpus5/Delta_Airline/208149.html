Boeing: Inevitable Production Cut In 777 Program Will Present A Buying Opportunity For Long-Term Investors - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is likely to report strong core earnings for the 3rd Quarter on the back of record Commercial Deliveries. Company commentary on the rate of production of the current generation of 777 could lead to a buying opportunity for long term investors. It seems almost certain that Boeing will have to announce a reduction in the rate of 777 production by the end of 2015. I recently wrote an article arguing that while macroeconomic trends make Boeing (NYSE: BA ) an exceptional long term investment, execution issues and dwindling demand for its most profitable commercial product, the 777, threaten earnings and cash flow in the medium term. Pressure on Boeing's management to announce its 2016 and 2017 plans for the current generation of 777 is coming to a head and investors should expect to hear an update on the current program with much greater specificity on production rates during this week's earning's call. The current generation of Boeing's 777 is widely known as the cash cow of Boeing's commercial business. The company has been ramping up production of its 737 and 787 aircraft to meet the company's staggering backlog of orders, but the 100 current generation 777's produced each year constitute the backbone of the company's profitability . An early October research note from Goldman Sachs estimates the current 777 program could account for as much as 45% of the company's pre-tax profit. While there is no consensus in the analyst community, due to uncertainty of contracted prices, many analysts are skeptical that ramping production of the 737 and 787 programs would be able to fully offset slowing 777 production rates in late 2016 or 2017. Boeing's primary obstacle to maintaining its current rate of 777 production is that its customers know that a vastly improved version of the wildly popular wide body that incorporates a variety of cost saving innovations and an improved customer experience will be available beginning mid 2020. Boeing has orders that push any new customer's 777X orders out to at least 2030, assuming a production rate of the current 777 program for the 777X, but customers are expecting that current generation 777's will come at a significant discount and as a consequence orders have largely dried up for the current generation plane. As of October 18th the company currently counts 190 orders for the 777-300ER, a little more than a year and a half of production at the current rate. Further pressuring the current generation of 777's, according to Goldman Sachs, is that 122 legacy 777's will be coming off leases over the next five years adding supply to a market with already weak demand. This supply and demand dynamic in the 777 market was referenced by Delta Airlines CEO Richard Anderson last week in admittedly self serving comments regarding pricing of used 777's over the next 12-18 months. It would seem that Boeing's current generation of 777 is being squeezed by both its eventual replacement as well as the used 777's coming off lease over the next 5 years. To be sure, steadily rising demand for air travel will absorb some of the excess 777's projected to be available via the used market and new production, but a significant production gap will remain between mid to late 2017 and the arrival of the 777X in mid 2020. The company faces a choice of either attracting new customers to fill vacant production slots from mid 2017 with significant price concessions on its most profitable commercial product or slowing the rate of production. In either event the company will likely realize a significant impact to earnings in the medium term that is unlikely to be fully offset by the ramping production in less profitable commercial products. Commentary during Boeing's next earnings report regarding the future of 777-300ER production may provide long term investors an attractive entry point. The comments of Delta's CEO regarding the used 777 market created a nearly 5% drop in shares of Boeing in a single day of trading, and a similar or perhaps even greater reaction to a production rate cut in the current generation 777 would present a buying opportunity for long term investors.
