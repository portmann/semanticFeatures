The Long Case For The Boeing Company - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha I believe Boeing (BA) is undervalued based on relevant multiples and future earnings expectations. Boeing is an industry leader and is poised for long term growth. As a commercial and defense aerospace leader, Boeing will continue to leveraged its position as a well-run and reliable company to improve customer/contract acquisition. Boeing is a well-managed value stock with an attractive 2.24% dividend to boot. This aircraft manufacturer has performed well historically, and based on analyst estimates, it is poised to steadily increase profit. With decreasing oil stocks, Boeing may receive residual benefits from the strong performance of commercial airlines. Based on my valuation, I believe Boeing is a strong long term investment. Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems. A top U.S. exporter, the company supports airlines and U.S. and allied government customers in 150 countries. Boeing products and tailored services include commercial and military aircraft, satellites, weapons, electronic and defense systems, launch systems, advanced information and communication systems, and performance-based logistics and training. Thesis & Catalyst For The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) Based on relevant multiples and projected earnings, I believe Boeing is good stock. I also believe Boeing is solid, well run company. Boeing's additional 2.24% provides an additional incentive for investment. Boeing also will likely receive residual benefits from tanking oil prices. As commercial airlines continue to benefit from cheap oil, Boeing will likely receive more orders from newly revised (ambitious) growth strategies. Additionally, cheap oil may reduce manufacturing costs for Boeing. Boeing is currently priced at $144.16, and it has a market cap of $98 Billion. It's forward p/e is 15.6, and its price based on expected growth (NYSE: PEG ) is very attractive at 0.3X. I performed my valuation based on moderate five year cash growth estimates. I based my model on the average of analyst estimates over the next five years (avg. 11%) growth over 5 years and 2.1% growth in perpetuity. discounting future cash flows to present value I came to a fair value of $195. 35% price appreciation with an added 2.24% dividend certainly provides additional incentive to invest long term. the CEO of Boeing is Dennis Muilenburg. Muilenberg previously served as VP and COO, and he is a business operations expert. The average tenure of Boeing's board of directors is 12.8 years which indicates industry expertise and wise macro management. Boeing's primary competitor's are Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ). The competition is fierce, but the sector as a whole (aerospace) has performed remarkably well over the last five years. Interestingly Boeing often works alongside its competitors, particularly for defense contracts. For example, Lockheed Martin and Boeing jointly own and operate Hellfire Systems, LLC (to manufacture AGM-114 Hellfire Missiles), and United Launch Alliance. ULA manufactures Delta IV and Atlas V launch vehicles for the airforce. Additionally, Boeing and Lockheed are jointly involved in manufacturing and production of: The F-22 Raptor defense program and the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. I believe Boeing's competitive advantage comes from its efficient processes and aggressive cost cutting efforts. I believe Boeing's full service approach (providing customer service, manufacturing, servicing, repair, engineering, upgrading, enhancing, and transitioning) have allowed Boeing to build a reliable and trustworthy brand, as well as increase customer acquisition. Boeing is a well run company with upside potential. Boeing offers an attractive dividend, as well as the opportunity to invest in American manufacturing. I believe Boeing's willingness to work alongside competition, as well as its focus on improvement and cost reduction, will continue to improve customer acquisition as well as profitability. I recommend a long position in Boeing.
