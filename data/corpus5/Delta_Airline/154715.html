Airbus, Boeing Face Defining Moments - Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSF) | Seeking Alpha As much difference as there can be with their visions on the air transport sector's future, later this year, both Airbus and Boeing will be reaching a watershed moment with their crown jewels - the A380 superjumbo will be breaking even on a per-unit basis and the 787 Dreamliner on a cash basis. Airbus's 2015 global market forecast (GMF), for instance, foresees a need for 1,550 very large airplanes (VLA) in the next 20 years, an addition of 49 examples from the prior year's forecast, on the back of 1.5 times growth in passenger traffic to 15.2 billion revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) in 2034, up from 6.2 billion RPKs currently. If anything, most Wall Street analysts reckon the 787 cost performance to be flat-lining, with the cumulative loss hitting US$27.7 billion, a US$790 million increase from the previous quarter and matching the last increment. In conclusion, 2015 is shaping up to be a momentous year for the commercial aerospace sector, with the A320neo entering into service in December after its 2 PW1100G-JM-powered test aircraft resumed flying, A380 and 787 breaking even, and Airbus's upcoming decision to launch the slightly stretched A380neo. For Boeing, trimming 787 costs is proving to be more complicated than simply reducing the use of titanium, whereas its middle-of-market (MOM) void will have to be addressed sooner, rather than later, amid mounting pressure exerted by the A320neo family, and the A321neo in particular, with the launch timing continuing to move to the left.

For Airbus, a widely anticipated decision on whether to re-engine the A380 in November's Dubai Air Show amounts to a doubling down on its bet that surging air travel demand, combined with airport congestion, will inevitably lead to increasing gauge of widebody aircraft. Its 2015 global market forecast (GMF), for instance, foresees a need for 1,550 very large airplanes (VLA) in the next 20 years, an addition of 49 examples from the prior year's forecast, on the back of 1.5 times growth in passenger traffic to 15.2 billion revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) in 2034, up from 6.2 billion RPKs currently. On the contrary, Chicago-based Boeing has its widebody product lineup arguably better positioned for the future. Where its biggest challenge lies is not lacklustre demand for its 787, which garnered 50 gross orders and 24 on a net basis so far this year, despite Aeroflot's ( OTCPK:AERZY ) cancellation for 22 -8 orders, compared to 2 net orders for the A350. Rather, it is turning this vision into reality, with Boeing also coming under mounting pressure to address the middle of market (MOM) void now that the A320neo (new engine option) family leads its Boeing counterpart by a wide margin, after having bagged IndiGo's firm order for 250 aircraft that takes the tally to 4,161. Cutting down 787 titanium use - solution or scapegoat? One does not need to look far to see Boeing's plight in programme execution. During the second quarter, Boeing faulted poor component designs in the KC-46A aerial refuelling tanker's integrated fuel system, crucial for using its hose-and-drogue wing pods and advanced fly-by-wire boom, for a US$835 million pre-tax charge, taking the entire early manufacturing and development (EMD) contract cost for 17 tankers - US$1.26 billion or 24% above the US$4.9 billion fixed price ceiling, to US$6.16 billion. The fuel system reportedly ruptured during a pressure test. Much was written about how Boeing undercut then-EADS, or European Aeronautics, Defence & Space Co.'s US$22.6 billion bid for 179 tankers by 10%, or how it vehemently rejected the US Air Force programme office's US$6.3 billion EMD cost estimate last year, but little light has been shed on how Boeing would have fared without the 77 US cents a share after-tax charge. Despite a solid 2015 first-half revenue performance with a 9.8% year-over-year growth to US$46.69 billion from US$42.51 billion, core operating profit fell by 5.9% to US$3.85 billion from US$4.09 billion, which would have risen by 14.5% to US$4.68 billion without the tanker pre-tax charge. By the same token, its GAAP 2015 first-half net profit would have risen by 13.9% to US$2.98 billion without it, instead of plummeting by 6.57% to US$2.45 billion from US$2.62 billion a year ago. That said, the underlying performance remained strong as GAAP operating profit nonetheless increased by 11.2% from US$3.33 billion in 2014's first half to US$3.70 billion with a 0.1 percentage point year-over-year improvement in operating margin to 7.9%. On a divisional basis, the tanker's impact on both Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) was evident. BMA's operating profit would have surged by 42.3% to US$706 million buoyed by the sale of 6 C-17 airlifters, instead of declining by 22.58% to US$384 million from US$496 million. BCA, which bore the brunt with a US$513 million pre-tax charge, its 2015 first half operating profit dipped by 7.5% to US$2.82 billion from US$3.05 billion in the prior year period, despite a 19.3% growth in BCA revenue to US$32.3 billion from US$27.0 billion during the same period. The operating profit would have otherwise been US$3.34 billion, a 9.31% year-over-year improvement. In light of the imbroglio of mishaps, Boeing parachuted in Scott Fancher, the current senior vice president (SVP) and general manager (GM) of airplane development to help oversee the tanker development whereas Bob Feldmann, the 777X head, will now share the responsibility of overseeing airplane development. This, however, is too late to prevent a slip in the first flight of EMD-2, the first tanker outfitted with functional wing pods and boom, to late September or early October owing to a chemical mix-up that damaged parts, even as the 767-2C EMD-1 completes flutter test . The award of the US$3 billion low rate initial production (LRIP) 1 contract to build the first 19 tankers will now be postponed by as many as 8 months. This casts a shadow over another immediate priority for Boeing: slashing 787 costs. Other than 2014's third quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' unit cost profitability has been consistently below that of Airbus's, even after factoring in currency fluctuations since the service entry of the 787 in 2011's fourth quarter. In 2015's second quarter alone, Airbus's US$1.88 billion earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) outstripped BCA's US$221 million operating profit by a factor of 8.5. Lately Boeing is getting creative, at least according to a Reuters story, in seeking to cut titanium use, with examples such as switching titanium door frames to composite and a "double plus chord" which requires Boeing to shave off much of the material from the titanium forging and into the intended shape that has a buy-to-fly ratio of 40-to-1. Yet perceiving the reduction of titanium use on the 787 as a panacea is over-simplistic, should this be the main theme of the 1,100 cost-cutting projects that Boeing chief financial officer (CFO) Greg Smith alluded to . Titanium is used in place of aluminium not only because it saves weight and has no corrosion issue when used in conjunction with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP), but also because it has considerably higher damage tolerance and less cracking, especially in areas that demand high strength or operate at an elevated temperature, or both. Ironically, Boeing has just switched to titanium main landing gear (MLG) sidestays on all 787 models from braided CFRP parts due to producibility issues, according to Aspire Aviation's sources at Boeing, not the other way around. It is also far from ironclad that substituting titanium parts with composite ones will necessarily produce savings in every instance. In fact, titanium's 15% composition of the 787's airframe materials is just marginally higher than the 14% found on A350, although it also uses more aluminium alloys at 20% and 10% steel versus the A350's 19% and 6%, respectively, as the Airbus twin-jet has 53% CFRP against the 787's 50%. Scapegoating the 787 cost issue on titanium use does nothing to change the fact that Boeing has yet to stop adding unit deferred cost to the mountain of deferred production balance, or the cumulative loss over the average unit cost obtained from a 1,300 production block, before it even starts digging itself out of a US$30 billion hole by the time its production rate hits 12 a month in mid-2016. If anything, most Wall Street analysts reckon the 787 cost performance to be flat-lining, with the cumulative loss hitting US$27.7 billion, a US$790 million increase from the previous quarter and matching the last increment. Depending on methodology, the per plane loss now ranges from US$26.3 million at Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse, to US$23 million at UBS and US$23.24 million at Aspire Aviation, which will not show any meaningful improvement until at least the fourth quarter. On the other side of the Atlantic, the focus of the defining moment will fall squarely on the future of the A380 people-mover, whose narrowing loss on 13 deliveries in the first 6 months of 2015, coupled with 4 A350 deliveries, propelled Airbus Commercial's revenue 8.5% up year-over-year to €21.08 billion from €19.43 billion with first half earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rising by 4.94% to €1.42 billion from €1.36 billion. As it currently stands, the A380neo (new engine option) would not only feature a new Rolls Royce ( OTCPK:RYCEY ) engine leveraging on the Advance and possibly UltraFan concept, on the latter of which Liebherr Aerospace will supply its gearbox, but also a slight stretch of around 3m on both upper and lower decks that adds around 50 additional seats. Combined with a 10-13% lower block fuel burn, the A380neo's seat-mile cost should match or even slightly beat that of the 777-9X. With technical feasibility largely out of the question, the debate boils down to the key question of how big is the market segment above 400 seats and to what end Airbus is willing to double down on its bet or if the A380neo would become what its sceptics call as throwing good money after bad. "This is one of our most difficult product decisions in years. What is clear is that there will not be an A380 with new engines only for certain customers," Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders admitted . Underpinning this product decision is the intricate relationship between passenger traffic growth and the means with which to satisfy this additional demand: extra frequency or capacity on existing routes or new routes. The up-gauging trend will only gather pace should passenger traffic growth outstrip the growth in the number of flight frequency, thus pushing up the load factorwhich in turn requires bigger capacity aircraft. Airbus bases the business case for very large airplane (VLA) on the number of mega-cities with more than 10,000 daily long-haul passengers growing from 47 today to 91 by 2034, covering 95% of the world's long-haul traffic and 35% of world gross domestic product (GDP). Importantly, Airbus points out 39 out of the 47 mega-cities today are already slot-constrained and lagging airport infrastructure investment will lead the drive to bigger aircraft. Boeing and its proponents, on the other hand, say the need to fill such a large aircraft is financially risky and will invariably lead to yield dilution despite its lower unit cost, as discounting and 'spillage' from a reduction of flight frequencies lead to a lower yield and hence higher break-even load factor (BELF = CASK/yield). Between 1984 and 2014, there were 450 new long-haul routes longer than 4,000 miles being added, yet there was a 50% increase in the number of flights. Closer to the present, from 2011 to 2015, new routes and extra frequencies accounted for 85% of widebody growth, according to Boeing's 2015 current market outlook (CMO). Airbus steadfastly refutes this, with its finding of a 14% share of premium passengers on routes between mega-cities, compared to an 8% share on routes between secondary cities. One may be surprised to learn that Airbus's and Boeing's visions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, Boeing acknowledged the modest up-gauging trend in average widebody capacity to 297 seats in August 2014 and that while "the average number of seats on the routes served has remained flat but are expected to increase modestly as airplanes such as the 787-10 and 777X come to market." Should this 1.7% widebody capacity growth rate be sustained over the next 10 years, a 297-seat aircraft around the size of the A350-900 in realistic airline configurations will eventually reach 352 seats, precisely the realistic usage of the 777-9X, which has a new 400-425 2-class seat capacity after revising the aircraft performance assumption of an average passenger and luggage weight from 210lbs to 225lbs, with its nominal range dropping to 7,600nm (nautical miles). Similarly, the 488 seats average of 13 A380 operators' 15 configurations will be reaching 578 seats in 10 years' time, exactly matching the A380neo's proposed capacity. Quite frankly, should Boeing have denied the existence of a modest up-gauging trend on widebody aircraft, the 777-9X's business case would not stand, which passed its firm configuration milestone with a 3-tonne growth on its 4-class Rev E operating empty weight (OEW) from 182 tonnes to 185 tonnes. This is, however, somewhat below the aircraft's listed 188,241kg OEW specification, Aspire Aviation's multiple sources at Boeing revealed. The 777-9X's GE9X engine thrust requirement is still staying at 105,000lbs, at least for now, as the aircraft already has better take-off field performance than its predecessor -300ER and there is another half of built-in margin to eat into, before the thrust needs to be increased. Boeing also ditched the hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) system on the 777X, and will review the use on the 787-9 and -10, as bugs constantly clog the system, especially in Southeast Asia. Conversely for Airbus, despite its contention that 70% of monthly passenger traffic growth will originate from existing networks, a 1.7% annual up-gauging rate, for example, will leave another 2.9 percentage points of the 4.6% annual traffic growth unexplained. The bulk of this can be attributed to frequency growth onboard "Big Twin" such as the 366-seat, 3-class A350-1000, hence explaining Airbus's reliance on the "Increased Cabin Efficiency" initiative such as the JAMCO-built ICE rear galley to add an incremental 6 seats. This is also why while the A380 can work well if it can be filled at good yields, such as with British Airways ( BA ) and being the most profitable aircraft type in Emirates' fleet, it can only be economically viable in a limited number of markets. What dominates, or "owns the sky" in the future, will continue to be medium-sized widebody aircraft such as the A350-1000, whose contractual definition freeze for Qatar Airways' first example was achieved on 4th May and first wing is now being assembled in Broughton, UK. The A350's sluggish sales performance this year will receive a crucial boost at the Dubai Air Show should it be able to seal the closely-watched Emirates order for 50-70 A350-900s or 787-10s. Since service entry, the 2-class 315-seat A350-900's economic performance is nothing short of spectacular, with an around 98% dispatch reliability and a 9% block fuel burn advantage against an 8-abreast, 2-class 291-seat 787-9 which already complies with the revised higher passenger weight assumption (" Airbus A350: Is the Xtra making the difference? ", 8th Jun, 15). Its Saft lithium-ion battery, which will be installed on production examples from MSN021 onwards, is certified at the highest DAL A level of the DO-178B standard with a failure rate of 10-9 per flight hour. While the A350-900's higher 84,000lbs thrust on each engine will ensure a full payload all-year round at Dubai, granting it a crucial advantage over the 787-10 whose "engines are 'spec'ed' at 70-72K, but the conditions we're getting it can't take the payload," as Emirates airline's president Tim Clark lamented , the 787-10 nevertheless holds several advantages over its Airbus counterpart. First and foremost, despite Airbus switching to composite window frames from titanium on the A350-900 to alleviate the 3.3 tonnes overweight issue, the aircraft will still remain heavier on a per-seat basis than the 330-seat, 6,430nm 787-10 configured with 9-abreast, 17-inch economy class seats. Its 192.8 tonnes maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW), or 584.2kg per seat, is 4.3% lighter than the 2-class A350-900's 609.5kg per seat. Given its 3,500nm medium-haul requirement and Emirates' existing use of 17-inch economy seats on the 777-300ER, it would be hard to imagine the Middle Eastern juggernaut changing tacks all of a sudden. Moreover, Airbus will have to move swiftly to increase the A350 production rate to 13 a month beyond 2018, consisting of 9 -900 and 4 -1000 slots to ensure early availability, as its order book appears to be severely fully booked. A case in point is Airbus's request for Singapore Airlines (SIA) to release 7 -900 production slots in FY2017/18-18/19 for a customer widely believed to be Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ). Were Airbus to win the significant Emirates order, follow-on A350-1000 and the A350-900LR orders, the latter of which are being mulled for a 2018 entry into service (EIS) with a 25% less block fuel burn per seat than existing models, an increase in production rate to 13 a month is long overdue. As KLM ( OTCPK:AFLYY ) converted 10 787-9 orders into 787-10 ones with 2020 deliveries, A350-900 deliveries in 2018 or 2019 would give Airbus a decisive winning factor in the Emirates campaign. From "moonshot" to "MOM-shot": Bubbles boiling beneath the surface Standing out in the Boeing 2015 current market outlook (CMO) dossier is its observation of a notable shift in the short-haul market under 3,000 miles from widebody to narrowbody aircraft, with the widebody share shrinking from 12% in 1994 to 5% in 2014, "due to the more efficient, economical, and longer-range single-aisle airplanes coming to market." Another noteworthy point is the 5-7% average annual single-aisle capacity growth, despite the current "sweet spot" converging around 162 seats. These highlight the bubbles boiling beneath the surface surrounding Boeing's middle of the market (MOM) strategy, over which it lacks a coherent competitive response, by first branding the A321LR's projection of a 1,000 aircraft demand as "laughable," before Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president (SVP) in global sales and marketing John Wojick saying "we sold over 1,000 757s and several hundred 767-200s so it would make sense that was at least that big, certainly more than 1,000." The need for such a 220-seat, 4,500nm MOM is growing increasingly acute as the A321, the biggest variant of the A320 aircraft family, becomes increasingly popular, with the A321 production rate ramping up from 12.5 per month currently to 20 a month and the A321neo's 866 firm orders dwarfing the 737 MAX 9's 286, excluding Wizz Air's provisional order for 110 A321neos. With the A320neo firm orders standing at 4,161, a 60 per month rate compared to Boeing's 52 per month rate in 2018 will yield a 53.6% production share, resembling its 59.5% re-engined narrowbody order share more closely. Hamburg, which will raise its A320 family aircraft production rate from 22 a month to 25 a month in 2017, is favoured as the site housing the 5th final assembly line . Above all, Boeing is at risk of being undercut on price by the A321LR at the bottom and the A330neo on top. The €2 billion development cost of the A330neo, which has entered the detailed design phase, will be spread across 1,000 aircraft, adding a €2 million premium to every factory-new A330's full-life base value (FLBV) of around US$104 million. For a US$10 billion development cost on the MOM, it would demand a US$10 million premium per aircraft. Ascend already reckons the MOM's FLBV needs to be at US$75 million, 40% above the A321's US$54 million, before the programme breaks even. Such a cost outcome is entirely possible as there is no off-the-shelf propulsion solution, unlike the A380neo and A330neo, which requires a clean-sheet engine of 40,000-50,000lbs of thrust to be designed. TAP Portugal is interested in swapping its order for 12 A350-900s into a combination of A321LR and A330neo orders, its chief executive Fernando Pinto told Aviation Week . "There's not an exact replacement out there. The A330neo may be the closest approximation to it," American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) vice president of network planning Charles Schubert was quoted saying, alongside its interest in the A321LR. Price is not the only challenge facing Boeing's MOM. As Aspire Aviation repeatedly pointed out (" Boeing NSA/MOM launch timing hinges on 737 MAX progress ," 19 Mar, 15), the technology out there to bring single-aisle economics to a small twin simply does not exist today. A 2-class small twin-aisle aircraft only has a 5.4% lower block fuel burn on a 1,500nm sector and yields a 9.43% reduction in COC per seat against 2 A320ceos, with each A320neo offering a 15% lower block fuel burn and a 14% reduction in COC per seat. Should out-of-autoclave (OoA) carbon fibre reinforce polymer (CFRP), rather than aluminium lithium, be adopted in an attempt to overcome this insurmountable technological challenge, the production cost of the MOM will inevitably rise, further compounding the aforementioned price premium problem. In conclusion, 2015 is shaping up to be a momentous year for the commercial aerospace sector, with the A320neo entering into service in December after its 2 PW1100G-JM-powered test aircraft resumed flying, A380 and 787 breaking even, and Airbus's upcoming decision to launch the slightly stretched A380neo. For Boeing, trimming 787 costs is proving to be more complicated than simply reducing the use of titanium, whereas its middle-of-market (MOM) void will have to be addressed sooner, rather than later, amid mounting pressure exerted by the A320neo family, and the A321neo in particular, with the launch timing continuing to move to the left (" Boeing eyes 2018 launch for New Small Airplane ", 26th Nov, 14).
