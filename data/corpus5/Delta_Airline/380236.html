Boeing Vs. Bombardier: What Do They Have To Offer Delta? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing in the underdog in a battle that already seems to be won by Bombardier. C Series optimized for the 100-150 seat market. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ) are in a battle to win the McDonnell Douglas MD-88 replacement order from Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ). Although Boeing is the world's biggest jet maker, the company seems to be the underdog in this battle. Delta currently operates 116 MD-88s, so the replacement for this fleet type will be a multi-billion order and a big win for any jet maker. In this article I will have a look at what both jet makers actually have to offer. What can be seen when comparing each of the aircraft with the aircraft that they have to replace is that they differ quite a bit, but the Boeing 737-700 seems to be superior in range. However, it can be questioned how useful that superior range is. The MD-88 has the shortest range of all aircraft and does the job for Delta Air Lines, so an improved range does not seem to be a requirement. Comparing the seat figures the Bombardier CS300 has the advantage. Since it is known what aircraft is being replaced and the routes the aircraft will be utilized on, Delta Air Lines already has an idea on how many seats that aircraft should have. In this case, it is about 150 seats. The Boeing 737-700 can transport up to 149 to in dense configuration. So the Boeing 737-700 is too small, while the Boeing 737-800 with roughly 160 seats is too big. The CS300, with an extra pair of emergency doors, can transport up to 160 passengers. Additionally, the fuselage design of the Boeing 737 is based on that of the Boeing 707 so it is quite old. Any new design probably is better than the 737 fuselage design, not only affecting passenger comfort but also maintenance costs. When it comes to maintenance costs the all new CS300 might have the upper hand, using composite materials, an on-board aircraft health management system and (again) a fresh design which removes some constraints allowing design teams to make a design that also has lowering maintenance costs. This all results in the longer maintenance intervals, thereby decreasing the direct maintenance costs. When it comes to performance, nothing can be said as of yet. However, one of the biggest advantages that the C Series has is the payload for which is designed, the C Series aims for the 100-150 seat market. Boeing on the other hand is better positioned in the 120-180 seat market. 150 seats is exactly what both jet makers seem to be targeting, Boeing does that with the 737-700 which is a shrink of the Boeing 737-800 and Bombardier does that with the CS300 which is a stretch. From a structural point of view, a shrink in general is less efficient than stretching. So that would mean that next to a clean-sheet design Bombardier has the 'shrink/stretch' advantage. So I expect the C Series to have a lower empty weight compared to the Boeing 737-700. In terms of drag, the skin friction drag or profile drag will be approximately equal. Since the lift-induced drag can be scaled down by the aspect-ratio of the wing, the lift induced drag (coefficient) will be lower for the C Series. Under the assumption that the empty weight and drag coefficient are lower for the C Series aircraft I do expect the C Series to be superior in terms of fuel economics, but I have no data available to verify this. The Boeing 737-700 is not a very popular aircraft these days and the only way to sell them is by giving huge discounts. United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) acquired 65 Boeing 737-700s with discounts in excess of 70%. This quite clearly shows how unpopular the aircraft is and also shows that Boeing is aware of the competitive threat the CS300 poses. Although I do not think the Boeing 737-700 is a bad aircraft, it is hard for Boeing to compete with an all new design that is better optimized for the mission Delta requires the aircraft for. All that Boeing really can offer in this 'battle' is steep discounts, steeper than what Bombardier can possibly offer... but that is about it. The operational advantages go to the C Series, an aircraft that probably to date has not received the recognition it deserves. While writing this article, the news that Bombardier and Delta Air Lines are nearing a deal that might be finalized and announced in late April was released. This fully supports my view of Bombardier having the upper hand, almost completely ruling out Boeing. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
