Yahoo Is A Buy As It Progresses Toward Becoming A Holding Company - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo sells additional assets in parallel to the core business bidding. Activist hedge fund Starboard receives a number of seats on the companyâ€™s board. After a long period of uncertainty, Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) future is becoming clearer as the company progresses in its efforts to offload unprofitable or non-core activities toward a lean enterprise structure. In the last year, since Yahoo attempted to spin off its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake into a newly, publicly listed company, a nontrivial question occupied the minds of the company's stakeholders and investors - what is Yahoo's core business? At first glance, this question has a very simple answer: Yahoo's core business is its internet services business. However, when asking different stakeholders in Yahoo, one sees that the answer is not very decisive. For years, Yahoo has been trying to turn the company around by investing further in its content and advertising businesses in a belief that strengthening the company's traditional core will improve its financial status and drive future growth. To execute its turnaround plan, Yahoo acquired a number of companies, restructured its content channels, introduced new initiatives and cancelled other initiatives. However, as shown in the chart below, Yahoo's revenues in the last five years grew by only 0.5% each quarter, which is an extremely low pace for a company striving to lead the internet sector. While Yahoo's management tried to turn the company around through strengthening its internet services business, the company's stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan ( OTCPK:YAHOY ) attracted most of the interest from investors. In a widespread sum-of-parts analysis , the total value of Yahoo's holdings and cash exceeds the current value of the company, which means that, according to this analysis, Yahoo's internet business is a huge burden on the company that destroys the company's value. Combining the disappointing revenue growth and the core business burden can explain why investors like Starboard Value find that Yahoo will spin off its internet business and remain in a narrow and lean holding firm structure. After Yahoo's plans to split the Alibaba stake in a tax-free spin-off had been cooled down by the IRS, the company pursued a different path and adopted investors' points of view to dismantle Yahoo as we know it. The first stage of breaking down Yahoo takes place these days when the number of companies participate in a bidding war over Yahoo's core business. Media companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Verizon (NYSE: V ), and AT&T (NYSE: T ) as well as PE firms such as Bain Capital, TPG and KKR are all interested in acquiring Yahoo's Internet business, and each interested entity has its reasons. This move to offload a company's core business might seem weird at first. However, with no other option to revive the company under the current management and business model, it requires a fundamental change. Offloading the core business and injecting a significant amount of cash into the company fits investors' preferences, and it's the first step toward becoming a holding company. Last week, Yahoo's CFO, Ken Goldman, told the crowd at Morgan Stanley's Technology, Media and Telecom Conference that Yahoo is looking to sell between $1B and $3B in patents, property and other non-core assets. This is a continuation of the patent selling process Yahoo started three years ago, which has already yielded more than $600M for the company. Offloading additional assets before the core business sale is finalized could maximize shareholders' value from the company's assets and bring it one step closer toward the end goal of a narrow and lean holding company. While Yahoo's sum-of-parts valuation reflects a share price between $38 and $44, well above the current price, Yahoo's current efforts to sell more non-core assets in the core business sale help the company to start closing the gap between the market and valuation prices. Yahoo is currently trading solely based on the fundamental change the company is going through. When the company and investors are committed to monetizing on the company's assets for the benefit of its shareholders, this is a strong indication to buy the stock. As I mentioned above, Yahoo is currently trading well below its sum-of-parts valuation which reflects a deep discount due to the high execution risk investors apply to Yahoo's chances to complete the core business transaction. The high spin-off execution risk is well established based on the company's previous experience with the Aabaco spin-off and amount of time it took Yahoo to execute other strategic moves in the past. However, these days activist hedge fund Starboard Value is negotiating with the company on how many seats the fund will receive on Yahoo's board. As Starboard is one of the most vocal supporters of the core business sale, having a number of seats on the company's board reduces the execution risk of the spin-off tremendously. With Starboard on its board, strong management commitment, and full shareholder support, there is almost nothing that could prevent Yahoo from completing this strategic shift in its business.
