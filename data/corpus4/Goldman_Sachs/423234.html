Hundreds of Verizon workers strike outside of the telecommunications company's Brooklyn offices on April 13, 2016 in New York City Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Verizonâ€™s strike was widely expected to hit May’s jobs report, and did. But the bounce back coming in June’s report will not come close to offsetting the disappointment from the overall May figures . The seven-week strike by many of the telecom giantâ€™s workers ended with workers returning Wednesday . The governmentâ€™s reference date for its establishment surveyâ€”the one behind the nonfarm payrolls calculationâ€”is the pay period that contains the 12th day of the month. For the purposes of the May jobs report, that was in the thick of Verizonâ€™s strike. The work stoppage reduced last monthâ€™s payrolls figure by about 35,000, the Labor Department said, in line with its estimate before the release. But the strike impact is â€œnowhere near enough to justify the weakness in the overall numbers,â€? said Ian Lyngen, rates strategist at CRT Capital. Also behind the paltry 38,000 increase in May jobs: Construction head count dropped 15,000, manufacturers shed 10,000 jobs and miners cut 11,000 positions. Service providers, who have been propelling job growth, added just 61,000 to their ranks. That is less than half of the April increase. Even adding back the 35,000 idled telecom workers, May payrolls only grew by 73,000. Heading into the report, economists at Goldman Sachs said their strike-adjusted estimate was 200,000 â€” equal to the average increase over the preceding three months. Michael Gapen at Barclays pegged payroll growth net of the Verizon strike at 175,000 to 200,000. (The Verizon jobs dropped from May’s report will show up in the June report in a month.) The Labor Department’s separate household survey, whichÂ isnâ€™t influenced by the strike, now shows a four-month trend of slowing job creation. From April, that number was up just 26,000. And from March, it tumbled some 290,000. Sharp labor-market shrinkage explains the drop in the unemployment rate. Part of the problem in May was a missing offset from temporary hires. The last time a work stoppage had a meaningful impact on monthly jobs dataâ€”at Verizon in 2011, incidentallyâ€”an increase in temp workers helped counter the strike effect. But the Labor Department said temp workers dropped by 21,000 last month. Verizon hadnâ€™t confirmed how many temporary workers it hired to make up for the shortfall this time around. And it did repurpose some office staff into field technicians , which didnâ€™t touch payrolls. One possible reason for the lack of a temp worker bump: â€œLabor markets are much tighter now than they were in 2011,â€? said Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz. That point is illustrated by the concessions workers were able to win. Aside from not offsetting the number of idled Verizon workers, the decline in temp help sends its own signal. Itâ€™s a leading indicator of total service-sector employment . Since 2000, there has been a 61% correlation between temp help services employment and three-month-ahead payroll gains, notes Guy Lebas of Janney Montgomery, who calls the slide in temp hires â€œperhaps the most concerning resultâ€? in the May report.
