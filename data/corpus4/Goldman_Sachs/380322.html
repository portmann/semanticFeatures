Bernie Sanders, companies including General Electric (NYSE: GE ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) are "destroying the moral fabric" of America. Such rhetoric is commonplace and would typically merit little notice or comment. What is unusual and noteworthy, however, is that some of his targets are fighting back. GE CEO Jeff Immelt defended GE as an employer and as a taxpayer. The Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) CEO got in on the action , too. In response, Sanders said, While Sanders is free to say whatever he wants and the CEOs are free (for now) to respond, I don't see what the fuss is all about. Sanders was not insulting them, he was complimenting them: All they want is more and more profitâ€¦ Despite making billions of dollars in profit, they pay nothing, not a nickel in Federal taxesâ€¦ Were it only true. My experience with business in the US involves managements whose focus on profits is middling at best and whose corporate income tax rate is the highest in the civilized world. Perhaps Sanders could be more specific regarding where I can find these profit-maximizing, tax-efficiency maniacs - they are just what I am looking for. Meanwhile, if you have a view of Sanders' political prospects, you can place a bet on both the Democratic presidential nomination and the general election (I have bets against Sanders winning either and - as always - seek counterparties).

The $1.31 net arbitrage spread in the Western Digital-SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) deal offers an 8% IRR if the deal closes midyear. ADT (NYSE: ADT ) extended the consent time for its consent solicitation from holders of its 6.250% Senior Notes due 2021 to April 22.
