Because with the suddenly collapsing labor market, in which only Americans 55 and over can find jobs, expensive and superfluous Apple Watches should be a game-changer.

The world will be a much better place  Mon, 04/06/2015 - 10:45 | 5963293 jimijon Apple is rolling out the AppleWatch with incredible precision and thought. This is a new category. It is not just about a watch. This is the beginning of wearables by a company that understands what we wear is fashion. Plus, the iPhones are rocking it, new laptops have people drooling for gold, and the software development and language tools keep pushing and pushing. Now with haptic touch on the best touchpads out there.... new interface possibilities open up. Mon, 04/06/2015 - 10:56 | 5963318 jtz5 I am a fan of Apple (iPhone and MacBook Air), but even I have to admit they are sliding.  The iWatch will be a bust (who wants to charge a watch battery two or three times/day) and the new MacBook is smaller than the Air, but has a crappy battery life, one port for power & usb and reduced specs...not to mention an inflated price tag. I think Apple's dominance is slipping and they are in desperate need of a new product category (that is not the watch).  JMO. Mon, 04/06/2015 - 11:37 | 5963438 Dewey Cheatum Howe Ever think that maybe the reason for crappy battery life is those products have 'undocumented' features causing the crappy battery life in the first place? Mon, 04/06/2015 - 12:54 | 5963698 rejected I have watches that are 80-100 years old and still run fine. Getting to be a problem finding a true watch maintenance person though, seems that position is now some teeny bopper at Wal Mart changing out a battery. Mon, 04/06/2015 - 12:22 | 5963594 FieldingMellish This is tech for the 1%. The iWatch is groundbreaking in no way. Androidwear was there a long time ago. The iPhones are 2 years behind Samsung/LG/Google... hell even HTC. A gold Macbook? Apple once used to stand for taste, I guess they decided its not as profitable as crass. The new MacBook is basically an Apple Chromebook at 5 times the price. Dow listings are doubled edged swords, especially at record highs. Mon, 04/06/2015 - 10:54 | 5963319 Scareddough I think this rip has more to do with folk understanding there won't be any rate hikes, and QE4 is forthcoming. Mon, 04/06/2015 - 11:10 | 5963374 Fix It Again Timmy How about an Apple Watch that has a 100W Stereo Amp and a battery life of 50 nanoseconds - how ya gonna keep the shelves stocked with that baby?....
