Bain and TPG reportedly eyeing Yahoo; shares close down 4.7% post-earnings - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Feb  3 2016, 19:30 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Shortly after Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) confirmed it's exploring "additional strategic alternatives" while pushing ahead with a reverse spinoff of its core business, the FT reports Bain, TPG, and other P-E firms are weighing potential bids for core Yahoo. The paper adds AT&T (NYSE: T ) and InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ: IAC ) "are also believed to be examining the company." Many firms are expected to make full or partial bids for core Yahoo. CFO Ken Goldman: "A number of companies have said they want to look at us, and there are a number of private equity firms that are interested in looking at us. I’m not saying that we’ve received offers ... I’m saying parties have expressed interest in us. And what we’re saying is that we’ll be open [to] that.” Re/code's Kara Swisher reports Yahoo has hired well-known tech i-banker Frank Quattrone to help it explore options; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are already on the payroll. "It is clear to us that what is happening inside is very dysfunctional," says an unnamed major investor talking to Swisher. Meanwhile, with a sale effort and job cuts already expected , Yahoo fell below $28 in regular trading following its Q4 report and myriad of job cut, writedown, and strategic review announcements. Weak guidance may have weighed: Yahoo guided in its earnings slides (.pdf) for Q1 GAAP revenue of $1.05B-$1.09B and 2016 revenue of $4.4B-$4.6B, below consensus estimates of $1.14B and $4.78B. 2016 ex-TAC revenue guidance of $3.4B-$3.6B is below 2015 ex-TAC revenue of $4.09B, which itself was below 2014's $4.4B. Non-GAAP op. income is  expected to drop to $150M-$250M from 2015's $342M and 2014's $755M. Also of note: 1) $230M of Yahoo's $4.46B goodwill writedown was related to the $1.1B Tumblr acquisition. On the earnings call ( transcript ), Yahoo disclosed Tumblr failed to hit the company's $100M 2015 revenue target. 2) Along with everything else, Yahoo has begun exploring the sale of "non-strategic assets" such as patents and real estate. It estimates such sales could yield $1B-$3B in cash by year's end. With 7billion cash, 30%BABA, YHOO Japan, Tumblr and some properties holding. Yahoo is ready below valuation for a company still earning less than a billion yearly. Wow we are going to see a lot of heat this year. I heard that Yahoo implemented those HR strategies where the bottom X% of employees are fired; apparently this doesn't apply to their CEO.
