Ford Motor: I Don't Care About The Recent Insider Sale, Here's Why - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha A Ford Motor executive has sold 140,000 shares recently, which gets some attention. The sale is nothing unusual at all and shouldn't be blown out of proportion: There are no implications for Ford's share price; I discuss why. Ford's chart setup is getting more bullish. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) is one of my investments that I have gradually build up over the last two years by buying the dips, and I specifically loaded up the truck when the company released its overrated profit warning in September 2014. The majority of my long position now consists of January '17 Ford Motor calls with a strike price of $17, although I do own the stock, too. Ford Motor is a long-term investment for me because of its compellingly low valuation and because of Ford's F-150-related potential for earnings growth. Last week, Ford Motor made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to a stock transaction by David Leitch, identified as a vice president and general counsel at Ford Motor, that took place on June 18, 2015. According to the insider filing , Leitch sold 140,000 shares at an average transaction price of $15.01, thereby netting $2.1 million. Company insiders, usually executives, board members, or influential stockholders, often have superior information about the company's financial condition, sales prospects etc., so insider transactions like the one mentioned here are watched closely because investors like to see how insiders evaluate their businesses. In theory and practice, insider ownership is a very good thing for shareholders. Having skin in the game aligns management's interests with the interests of shareholders and properly incentivizes management to do the best job it possibly can to create value for the owners of the company. Logically, selling shares as a company insider is often construed as an unwelcome and unfortunate event. However, this shouldn't be the case here. First, insider sale transactions take place regularly, to some extent, because insiders have legitimate financial/personal reasons to sell stock. Second, the insider in question here, Leitch, owns 150,312 shares of Ford Motor worth approximately $2.3 million after the latest transaction was executed. Third, the transaction volume is relatively small when put into relation to Ford's market valuation. Fourth, Ford's executives have regularly sold shares in the past, so I wouldn't characterize the latest transaction in any form as unusual. Bottom line: The latest insider sale has, at least for me, no implication at all with respect to how I see Ford Motor as a value investment. Ford Motor's chart setup is improving. After rebounding and recapturing the $15 mark in June, helped by a Goldman Sachs upgrade, the stock is trading in the low/mid $15 range to gather strength for another push north. In the absence of any short-term market dislocations or negative earnings surprises with respect to the second fiscal quarter, Ford Motor surely has potential to move higher from here. Insider transactions can give investors valuable clues as to how executives evaluate their company. But things must be put into context: The latest insider transaction is not unusual and the low transaction volume should not make anyone anxious. Now, if the CEO dumped all of his stock suddenly at 52-week highs, that would be another story. But the reported transaction should not be construed as a negative vote on Ford Motor at all. Long F.
