Is Adele Proving Apple's Music Strategy Is Wrong? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Pim Keulen , Follow me on Twitter (113 clicks) Music star Adele decided not to distribute her new album through streaming services. Digital album sales passed 1 million in the U.S. alone within two days after the release. Is Adele's success reason to expect Apple's music strategy to be the wrong strategy? Until the release of Adele's newest album 25, the future of the music industry was obvious and could only go in one direction: streaming. We could rely on a couple of certainties. Physical sales would become irrelevant at some point or a niche market, like vinyl, at best and streaming would overtake digital download sales. Even an innovative company as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was not resistant to the streaming trend. In fact, some may call the introduction of Apple Music, the company's very own subscription-based streaming service, on June 30 of this year quite late. One of the reasons for Apple to introduce the streaming service was an ongoing decline of digital downloads through its successful platform iTunes. How different does the music business look at these "certainties" after the first sales figures of Adele's latest album came in? Music Business Worldwide reported 25 overtook the all-time week one sales record in the United States within just 4 out of 7 days. Adele sold over 2.4 million albums during the first four days after launch. Even more astonishing is the fact that half of the albums sold came from physical sales, with Target (NYSE: TGT ) among the top selling retailers in the United States. Digital downloads represented the other half of the sales, with Apple's iTunes most likely to be the market leader in digital download sales. Wait a minute, 50% physical sales and 50% digital downloads add up to 100% of total sales. How about streaming? Well, Adele and her management team decided not to distribute the album through streaming channels, leaving Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer and other services in the cold. The move is even bolder than Taylor Swift who only withdrew her repertoire from Spotify. Deezer's North America CEO Tyler Goldman With Adele breaking record after record without the support of streaming services, people within the music industry start worrying about their assumption that streaming will take over most of the industry. Deezer's CEO in North America pointed out the threat for growth of streaming subscriptions if other artists were to follow Adele's example. As I mentioned above, Apple Music is all about selling subscriptions to music listeners. To do so, Apple Music intends to create a music ecosystem to attract users and increase loyalty to its service. Apple's Music Connect and its investments in popular artists to assemble playlists for users are two examples of this strategy. Now, there is a girl from the U.K. completely messing with everybody in the music industry. Without any support from powerful companies like Apple, she sold more albums than anyone before her. What will remain of Apple's strategy and philosophy of creating an ecosystem for its users if this trend continues? Apple investors should not worry immediately. True, Adele's 25 is a big time success and she did it without streaming support. In fact, the decision not to distribute the album through streaming services is a big part of the success in my opinion. However, investors should not consider this success to be a trend for other artists and, therefore, as a threat to the number of subscriptions Apple is able to sell. Adele is Adele and quite frankly there are not a lot of people who have the number of dedicated fans and the ability to reach these fans like Adele. Further, keep in mind that Adele did not release any new material for quite some time. She released her previous album 21 back in 2011. This must have played a part in the success as well. In my opinion, Apple Music's strategy should not be questioned because of the success of one extraordinary artist who was able to sell a lot of albums without streaming support. In fact, I believe that Apple Music is quite a success after its introduction in June of this year. After the trial period of three months ended, Apple Music was able to hold on to 6.5 million subscribers. That's almost 60% of the number of free trial users in August. Another 8.5 million are still enjoying the trial period. If Apple Music again holds on to 60% of the free trial users, the service will have 11.6 million paying users by the end of this year. This equals total revenue of over $1 billion on an annual basis (11.6 million x $9.99-month x 12 months and some deduction for family plan subscribers). I find Apple's turnover ratio quite convincing, especially compared to its most important rival Spotify. Spotify's ratio of free users versus subscriptions is far worse than the 40% of users Apple Music lost during the free trial time frame. Last year, Spotify counted 75 million active users and only 20 million subscription users. That's just over 25% of its total users. Therefore, I remain bullish on Apple and its music strategy going forward. Both early subscription numbers and potential growth are promising moving forward. And even if other artists decide to follow Adele's example, Apple is there with its iTunes platform to take the majority of digital download sales. Further, Apple building a music ecosystem will help increasing loyalty of its subscribers. Pandora (NYSE: P ) is a good example of how such an ecosystem contributes to the success of an online music platform. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
