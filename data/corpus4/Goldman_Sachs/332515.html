Cloud Investing: Buy The Space, Not One Company - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Domination of the Cloud space will give that company an edge over every other technology company. One has already emerged as a clear leader; another has the strong leadership and scalability to offer stiff competition. Here's why it's a good idea for investors to put their money into an industry as a whole rather than a specific company. Every business in the world is going to run on cloud eventually. -Sundar Pichai, CEO - Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) The race to dominate the technology industry is underway, and has been for quite some time. Nearly every major tech player has been competing for the top spot, with each trying to outdo the rest. None have come that far yet, though two contenders are vying for pole position. Who wins that war in the next five years will have a huge impact on the industry. As technology companies have shown time and time again, once you take the pole position in a specific tech space, no matter how many more laps are left, the rest of them can only attempt to play catchup with you. Case in point: Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Bing and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) Search never came close to Google's Search - and they never will. Another example: Android is the de facto leader for mobile operating systems for the masses, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) holding on to its own users by sheer brand supremacy. There is no one else even worth a mention here. Cloud dominance is the next battlefield, so I would highly recommend that we watch that space to see how it plays out. The players are already out of the starting gate, and it's getting clearer by the quarter which of the two current leaders might take the coveted top spot. For investors unfamiliar with the cloud concept, a short primer ... What is Cloud and What the Heck is IT infrastructure? During the spring years of technology, if you were an entrepreneur setting up your business, one of the first things you would have done is to set up your IT division. You would have hired a tech team that could develop your website or the application that your business needed, and the networking capability to keep employees and users connected to various systems from their cubicles and homes. You'd have bought a few servers and kept them all in your office. You'd have gotten your tech team to manage all things that were needed to keep your website or application running smoothly; and, if your business grew, the users on your application grew and the servers and the people working to keep them chugging along grew as well. All of this would have been your IT infrastructure, and would have involved feeding an endless pit that devoured money like it was going out of style. The size of your IT infra grew along with your company, often becoming the biggest expense item on your statement. Enter third-party infrastructure managers and the new age of IT infrastructure. These companies offer a virtual infrastructure that you can literally "sit your business on top of" at a fraction of the cost that you would have otherwise incurred. No servers to buy, possibly no need for a database administrator, and all the benefits that come with owning an infrastructure of your own. In addition, all the data that you have on the hosted service is typically accessible from anywhere in the world - but highly secure and extremely reliable. For a small business struggling to grow its bottom line, this is a huge attraction. For bigger companies that are non-technology-oriented, having an established player handle their infrastructure provides a massive cost advantage while nearly eliminating the ever-present problem of resource management. No hiring, training, firing and hiring again, because you've traded off that headache for a monthly fee - or whatever agreement you have with that provider. In addition to that, you can ramp up and ramp down in a matter of hours/days instead of weeks/months. What I just explained is the birth of the Cloud - an 'accessible-from-anywhere' environment where users can 'buy' virtual real estate that they temporarily own for the duration of the contract. A time-bound lease on a technology backbone, if you will. So now comes the question of who will dominate this space in the next five years - because the company that does this is guaranteed a long-term reign of this industry segment for the indefinite future. And it would seem that an unlikely underdog has taken everyone by surprise and usurped a position that was long regarded as the hallowed right of pure-play technology companies. As it happens, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Web Service is the thus-far undisputed leader of this segment - with revenues topping $7 billion last year and continuing to grow at double-digit rates. What's even more impressive is that the company is able to report a segment operating margin of 23.64%. If you are already excited, just wait for one more bit of news. AWS's operating margin is at this level after the company announced its 51st price reduction for web services since its launch, and I discussed this in Amazon Web Services: Holding The Profitability Bag For Amazon . What that means is that there is plenty of room for the company to get into a price battle if or when they have to, to stay competitive, which they already are to a high degree. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment reported $12.23 billion in the six months ended December 2015, a possible annual run rate of $24 - $25 billion. This segment consists of revenues collected from server products and Cloud Services along with Enterprise services and Microsoft consulting services. So the sales numbers are not because of Azure alone; it includes a mix of products that are related to infrastructure services. Bloomberg estimated Microsoft Azure's revenue to be around $400 million during the fourth quarter 2015 that ended June 30. During that same period, Amazon Web Service reported sales of $1.82 billion. So as far as this vertical goes, Microsoft is 4 times smaller than Amazon right now; but the rate at which the company is pushing its cloud platform, I expect them to keep closing the gap over the next two years. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) is one company that could have actually been on top of this segment. For starters, most of the Fortune 500 companies were IBM's clients for a long time. A proper strategy for a cloud division could have easily converted most of them to the segment. This was a huge missed opportunity for IBM. The company's biggest differentiating factor now is its Hybrid Cloud offering. "IBM makes $4.5 billion in revenue from cloud delivered as a service - that's separate from private cloud infrastructure it helps customers set up in their own data centers" - Datacenterknowledge Google doesn't provide the details of its cloud division's earnings power, but if there was a significant addition to the top line from this segment, the company would likely have reported it. In a segment that's growing by leaps and bounds, Google is not likely to bury those numbers if they were anywhere near where they hoped they would be. This also one place where I think the backgrounds of the two tech titan companies' CEOs come into play. Satya Nadella was EVP of Cloud and Enterprise group at Microsoft before he took the top job. Sundar Pitchai, on the other hand, was Product Chief at Google before he took the helm. During the last quarter, CSC's (NYSE: CSC ) global infrastructure services unit reported $864 million in sales and Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ) reported $509 million. Centurylink (NYSE: CTL ) is another provider that is also in the cloud computing segment - and let us not forget Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) very own Alicloud trying to gain a foothold in Asian markets - especially China. These are the three companies billion dollars in the cloud market, with annual run rates for AWS at $8+ billion, Microsoft $1.5+ billion and IBM $4.5+ billion. Google has a long way to go (if they are even in the race), and if they don't get aggressive now these three companies are going to leave it way for behind - and a key acquisition might be the only way to claw their way back into the fray. My personal picks for success in this segment would be AWS for the lead they have and Microsoft for their leadership they possess. As we saw above, Amazon Web Service, IBM and Microsoft have established a strong lead over other competitors in terms of size, scale and revenue. Although CSC and Rackspace have higher revenues than Microsoft right now, their scalability is something that poses a big challenge. As I said at the beginning of the article, the company that first takes the lead in technology usually stays there indefinitely - and that's where I see Amazon Web Service going into the future. Notice I haven't actually compared Amazon - the company - with Microsoft. That's because AWS pretty much operates as a company within a company. Very soon, it's going to be bringing in net incomes far greater that the retail division can ever hope to achieve - and will put the parent company in direct competition with Microsoft as a serious technology player. As far as Microsoft itself goes, I see it becoming (over several years, of course) more of a cloud service operator that has robust add-ons rather than a software company that also operates a cloud division. Of note here is that this industry is extremely ripe for mergers and acquisitions as smaller players will find it increasingly harder to keep competing against two fast-growing giants. Goldman Sachs shows that the industry will keep growing at a 19.2% rate for the next few years. Considering the fact that the entire industry is valued at under $40 billion, I am confident that it will sustain its fast-paced growth rate for a major part of the next decade - and then possibly slow down once most businesses and enterprises are already in the cloud, as Google's CEO prophetically put it. Investor-speak: Why I Want to Buy into Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Industry? There's a reason why Warren Buffett never invested in a technology company, with the recent IBM buyout being an exception. He has always said that he doesn't buy tech is because he doesn't understand the business, but I believe it's more because of the fact that the industry is prone to disruptions and is in a constant state of evolution. All it takes is one genius mind to chart a new course for the industry: Steve Jobs did it with Apple, Larry and Sergey did it with their search algorithm for Google; Zuckerburg did it with social media; the list goes on and on. So, no one really knows who might do what ten years down the line. In short, it's unpredictable, and all its needs it one brilliant mind to upend the industry. This is where I believe Cloud Infrastructure as a service stands out. The whole segment is actually a support system for technology, and for businesses that want to leverage their technology - not a technology in itself. Innovation will only happen on the computing side of things, and there is practically no room for anyone with an innovative idea to come and start a company and takeover all the business from their competitors. The costs are prohibitive for new players and, even if the concept is brilliant, without any brand value or proven expertise, businesses are not going to queue up to join them. Moreover, existing players are not going sit on their thumbs when they know that there is a way to improve their existing offering - to make it faster, more secure and more capable. For these reasons, I consider this industry to be one that is fairly immune to disruption - a rarity in the world of technology, you might say. Those that rule the roost now will hold on to their markets, they will have the scale, they will be able to offer plenty of auxiliary benefits to their end users and keep their sales ticking along handsomely for a long time. Instead of buying into one company, I think it would be wiser to invest in the industry itself - by buying into the top two or three players at the same time.
