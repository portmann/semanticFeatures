Goldman re-crunches numbers, raises estimates for 'Star Wars' - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Dec 16 2015, 12:52 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With its premiere done and early (and quite positive ) reviews beginning to roll in like a wave, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is ready for its moment. And after more number crunching, Goldman Sachs is bumping what were already high expectations for the box office (and for Walt Disney ( DIS +0.3%)). Goldman's Drew Borst has raised overall gross estimates for the film to $1.95B ($750M domestic, $1.2B international) -- the third-highest total gross of all time -- up from $1.5B. He thinks every $100M increase in global box means an extra $0.02 in fiscal 2016 EPS , while $6B in Star Wars consumer product sales should add $0.016 per billion. Multiplying the firm's 2016 EPS estimates by 18.5, Goldman is bumping its price target on Disney to $112 from $110 (a target that's priced in with Disney trading today at $112.50). JPMorgan Chase is making Disney its top pick for the month , pointing to "impressive ticket pre-sales, strong merchandise sales as noted by partners, and positive social media buzz following the film’s premiere Monday night." The firm believes the outlook already reads positively for the Parks and Consumer Products divisions going forward. The biggest opening weekend this year belongs to "Jurassic World" with $208.8M; what do you think, can "Star Wars" beat it this weekend?
