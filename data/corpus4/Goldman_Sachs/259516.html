Verizon-Yahoo Tie-Up? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Dec.  8, 2015  2:15 PM ET  |  About: Verizon Communications (VZ) , Includes: BEE , BMR , CP , CTL , ELUXY , FCS , GE , GMCR , ISSI , JAH , NSC , NWL , PBY , SLH , SMFG , YHOO by: Chris DeMuth Jr. FCS is up over 20% since mid-October. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is interested in buying core Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) if it can get it at the right price. The acquisition would include Yahoo's advertising technology, news and sports websites, and e-mail. It would combine Yahoo with AOL, which Verizon bought earlier this year. Such a combination would put Yahoo under the competent leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Yahoo activist Starboard Value would support such a transaction. Meanwhile, Verizon is seeking bidders for its data centers. VZ is working with Citigroup (NYSE: C ) on the sales process and is seeking around $10 billion. One potential alternative would be to combine the Verizon data centers with CenturyLink's (NYSE: CTL ). General Electric (NYSE: GE ) plans to sell its Japanese leasing business to Sumitomo (NYSE: SMFG ) for about $4.6 billion by year end. In addition, GE abandoned the sale of its appliances to Electrolux ( OTCPK:ELUXY ) over antitrust impediments. Plan B may be to sell the business to Qingdao Haier. The semi M&A boom keeps on booming with an overbid for Fairchild (NASDAQ: FCS ). Fairchild got an unsolicited offer to acquire the company for $21.70 per share in cash from China Resources Group. The board will consider it. It is working with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ). For background, please see 20% Upside In Fairchild Deal ; FCS is up over 20% since publication.

I suppose this makes me something of an insider. If I was at a publicly traded company, buying the stock knowing it was undervalued with insider knowledge would be illegal. Fortunately, buying a Sifting the World (StW) subscription with insider knowledge it's dramatically undervalued is not illegal. Chris posts a variety of ideas: some are his own, and some comes from friends and colleagues he respects and admires (sometimes including me). The investment thesis, risks, upsides and downsides are always laid out clearly and form the perfect starting point for individual research. In addition, a less talked about aspect of StW is Chris posts a variety of interesting investing opportunities that have limited size and scale and generally can't be mentioned to a larger group of people. These generally focus on odd lot tenders, but can include things as wide as airline mile arbitrage and free cans of tuna. It's not a stretch to say that simply investing in all of these "limited size" investments would easily cover the annual cost of a subscription. Finally, the community of people is excellent: each article generally has an active discussion that helps with the investment thesis, and the chat allows members to ask timely questions and alert each other to items of interest in real time. If you like Chris's writing or are interested in event driven / value investing, an investment in StW is the equivalent of investing in a company trading for well below intrinsic value with a strong capital allocator at the helm and a clear catalyst for value realization.
