Netflix Crashes After Forecasting Slower Subscriber Growth, Despite Burning $1BN In Last 12 Months | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! For a huge period of time, Apple was an absolutely awful stock. It had its ups and downs, but the 1983 to 2003, a period of two entire decades, the stock went nowhere. Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! While today's drift lower in NFLX shares was widely attributed to AMZN's more aggressive expansion into the streaming video space, some wondered if there was more to it. Moments ago, the answer was revealed and it was a resounding yes. The reason why NFLX stock is crashing in the afterhours session is (mostly) because of the company's guidance of its widely followed international expansion. Here, instead of guiding to or above the consensus estimate of 3.45 million subs, Netflix disappointed dramatically and now anticipates only 2 million international streaming net adds, down from both the 2.37 mm a year ago, and certainly from the 4.51mm net adds last quarter. While domestic adds were of lower significance as the growth rate there has already dropped substantially, NFLX reported 2.23MM net adds in Q2, above the 1.82MM expected, but its domestic Q2 guidance was also lousy, and the company now sees just 500,000 net adds in Q2. This is how Reed Hastings explained the sudden slowdown in growth, as well as the plateauing in margins: In the US, our Q2 net adds forecast of 0.5 million is inline with prior years (0.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.9 million from 20122015), taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of ungrandfathering. Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the Australia/New Zealand launch. The ANZ growth spike in Q2 last year resulted in international Q2 net adds more than doubling year over year (from 1.12 million to 2.37 million). While ANZ is growing steadily this Q2, it is less than the launch spike last year. ExANZ, international net adds would be forecast up this quarter. International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of signups). In the US, we are forecasting flat Y/Y contribution margin in Q2, due to a large slate of content releases and associated marketing. We expect strong y/y margin growth to resume in Q3 and we remain on track to achieve our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020. We expect Q2 international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable currency movements. We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of 2016 will be similar to the first half, as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature markets. Finally, on the holy grail, China, Netflix had nothing reassuring: On China, we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing. Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term. NFLX also gave details on its "ungrandfathering" process: With respect to ungrandfathering, currently, more than half of our US members pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for our $9.99 HD 2screen plan. We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longesttenured members getting the longest benefit. To reinforce brand trust, we wonâ€™t change anyoneâ€™s price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience, where they will see a dialogue box about their options. Members can choose our $7.99 SD 1screen plan, our $9.99 HD 2screen plan or our $11.99 UHD 4screen plan. We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn  as we go. Most of our grandfathered members are in the US, but weâ€™ll take the same approach internationally. The company also discussed the increasingly sensitive topic of competition: If you think about your last 30 days, and analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games, surfed the web, watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV, wandered through YouTube, read a book, streamed Hulu or Amazon, or pirated content (hopefully not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea. For example, while weâ€™ve grown from zero to 47 million members in the USA, HBO has also grown, which shows how large the entertainment market is. We earn a tiny fraction of consumersâ€™ time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving. The increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year, and we are taking up our expected spend from about $5B in 2016 to over $6B on a P&L basis in 2017. Which brings us to our favorite topic: cash burn. Here is NFLX's explanation: At the end of Q1, we had cash and equivalents totaling $2.1 billion. In Q1, free cash flow was $261 million, compared with $276 million in Q4 â€˜15. As we have written in the past, our investment in original programming (particularly owned content) is more cash intensive upfront, resulting in a timing-driven gap between net income and free cash flow. We currently have $2.4 billion of long term debt. With our low debt to enterprise value of 5%, our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016 or in early 2017. Expect that debt to grow, because as the chart below shows, NFLX burned through over $1 billion in cash in the past 12 months and has increasingly less growth to show for it. For a long time investors let if go. However, judging by the stock's reaction after hours... buy it with all ten of your Cramer stubby fingers, Mon, 04/18/2016 - 16:38 | 7450088 Bloppy Mon, 04/18/2016 - 17:03 | 7450174 TradingIsLifeBrah Maybe NFLX can raise its rates again, that's sure to bring in more customers.  Simple Demand Price curve economics 101 (Full Disclosure:  I failed Economics 101) Mon, 04/18/2016 - 17:50 | 7450340 Never One Roach For one thing, the movies stink on Netflix.

As far as netflix, I didnt have it long but I was able to watch the entire season of LOST, and a few other movies, but I am no expert cause I didnt use it that much. Off topic, but for those who want to know the people behind 911, here is about the best proof, with names, and ictures and history...its a 30 minute video, but if ya wanna see what is really going on, check it out...And, for those that say bad things about "jews", you need to get learned and start calling them rothchild zionists instead...There are many jews that wont be part of the rothchild zionists...listen and learn..

Mon, 04/18/2016 - 17:10 | 7450202 Twee Surgeon We cancelled Nutflix about 9 months ago (a trial after relocating.) We had started watching their homegrown content and it was truly abhorent, why do they want us to watch gay sex and murder, murder,stab, stab, empty B.S. That was pretty groundbreaking in 1986 I guess, but really, why do they think people want to watch the crap that they make ? We are not prudish people but we do have a functioning gag reflex. Hollywood, same thing. We have not been to 'see a movie' in a decade, we will rent one online sometimes but are mostly disappointed, the last one gave us Post traumatic buyers remorse and we had to sit in our safe area for an hour. I have not seen a network T.V. show for 5 or 6 years other than being in the same room where a T.V. is operating, mostly when visiting elderly people or the homes of window licking mouth-breathers, we do not know many people who 'Do T.V.'  Everything is online now, for the non-Alzheimer crowd, as far as I can tell. STARVE THE BEAST. If you are paying for cable you are paying for THEM to tell you how it really is, you are paying for NBC,ABC and CBS to remian in business. Why would you want to give them money ? they want you and your family dead so send them some cash, why don't you.
