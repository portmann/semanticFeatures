Buy Blue Chip Stocks Before They Become Blue Chip Worthy | Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell , Future Blue Chips (27 clicks) Buying the best of companies and giving them a long time horizon can pay off many times over -- especially with dividends. Look for high quality stocks, with sustainable growth and attractive business models. My top picks are Visa, MasterCard, Disney and Starbucks. What exactly is a Future Blue Chip stock? Simply put, these are stocks that I think can turn into tomorrow's top dependable companies, or blue chip companies as they're commonly referred to in the industry. Let's go back to 1980. Had you bought Wal-Mart WMT , Coca-Cola KO and McDonald's MCD , you would be a pretty happy camper. I simply chose these three at random. I'm sure there are better performers since 1980, but for simplicity let's go with these. Over those 35 years, Wal-Mart stock is up 45,770%, Coca-Cola is up 5,355% and McDonald's is up 8,722%. For its part, the S&P 500 is up 1,696%. Investing $500 in 1980 into each of these three stocks ($1,448 in today's dollars) would have vastly outperformed the S&P 500. And remember, this is only $1500 total and it was only in 1980 -- 35 years is a long time, certainly, but easily within an investor's lifetime. On a split-adjusted basis, these stocks were purchased for pennies. In Wal-Mart's case, investors who bought 1 share of stock in 1980 would have 256 today. While 486 shares of McDonald's today might not seem that impressive, it's pretty insane that buying just 12 shares 35 years ago would have turned into that many shares. It also helps when it comes to dividends. In this case, the annual dividend payments come out to nearly $10,000. While you can't live on that, consider it's nearly seven times the size of the initial investment, paid out annually, and continues to rise. In other words, your $1,500 investment in 1980 now pays you almost $10,000 per year, while the portfolio itself would be worth north of $300,000! You may think $10,000 in annual dividends is not all that impressive because you're not floating around on a yacht or whatever. But remember, inflation-adjusted for today, this is only $4,500 we're talking about as the total initial investment. Imagine buying $4,500 worth of stock today, and having it be worth $300,000 in 35 years! Want to up the ante? Let's say in today's world you had $30,000 to invest; $10,000 for each of the three stocks above. In 1980 terms, that would have been about $3,500 per stock. The returns are staggering. As if investing just $10,500 in 1980 and having $2.15 million today wasn't enough, that investor would be collecting $49,000 from Wal-Mart, $6,243 from Coca-Cola and $11,883 from McDonald's in annual dividend payments. By pinpointing these stalwarts before the price gains and mega dividends, investors can find modern day versions of some of yesterday's most successful stocks. That's what I'm aiming to do with this portfolio of Future Blue Chips , which includes Visa V , MasterCard MA , Starbucks SBUX and Disney DIS . Visa and MasterCard are cash machines, acting as the middleman between consumers and financial institutions. They collect a transaction fee each time one of its branded cards are swiped. This is a beautiful secular growth story, as the transition from using cash to using debit and credit continues to gain momentum. Disney and Starbucks are also great long-term growth stories, with Disney continuing to reinvent its portfolio of classic movies - think the live-action Cinderella film from earlier this year - as well as expand its collection of Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars films. The company is opening its Shanghai park next spring, further driving future growth in its theme park business. Disney's media empire continues to grow, and investors can sleep a bit more comfortably at night knowing it has an ace up its sleeve when it comes to the infringing streaming wars . For Starbucks' part, the company has developed an infectious charm among Americans, and apparently the Chinese, where according to CFO Scott Maw, growth remains strong despite recent concerns about the economy. Its Mobile Order and Pay solution in the U.S. should continue to drive revenue and comp-store sales growth for several years. Food is also playing a larger role for Starbucks, helping to also drive sales. (Maw and Disney's COO Tom Staggs both elaborated on China a lot more in recent conferences with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. I summarized those notes, here .) These four companies do not pay a hefty a dividend by any means, with Disney paying the highest yield of 1.3%, and Visa and MasterCard yielding less than 1%. On the plus side, the lowest dividend increase over the past five years between all four companies is still 14.6%, which is very good, with many increases of 30% or more. But the dividend is not the focus, at least not yet. We're looking for companies with solid fundamentals, strong earnings and sales growth, and businesses situated in long-term growth stories. Each of these companies have grown earnings per share at a CAGR of more than 19% over the past five years, and are expected to grow earnings double digit percentages through 2018, (excluding Disney's EPS growth estimates of 8.8% in 2018). That's pretty darn impressive. Some investors will argue about these stocks' valuation, but my argument would be that buying high quality companies with superior management and long-term growth trends rarely, if ever, come at a discount. At best, investors get selloffs like we've just seen as their best chance to buy. I can't tell you how many years I've been hearing that Visa or Starbucks is a great company, but the valuation is too high. All the while the share price continues to climb, climb, climb. When these stocks eventually do trade down to a low valuation, it will be because the growth story has faded, the market is tanking or they have finally matured into a mega company with sizable and respectable dividend payouts. That last point will hopefully happen, but not for some time. These stocks won't climb in a straight line, but I'm looking to find tomorrow's dividend titans today. So far, these are the four that have done best for me and are these are the businesses I continue to believe in going forward. In the future I will look to write more detailed articles on these stocks. I simply wanted show normal, everyday folks that it's possible to clean up in the stock market without being a hedge fund junkie or playing fly-by-night stocks, and these are my picks to get it done.
