Carl Icahn Is Right About Overheating Market - Cramer's Mad Money (6/24/15) | Seeking Alpha Jun. 25, 2015  7:44 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , BAX , C , DB , EYES , F , FEYE , FTNT , GS , MDLZ , NFLX , PG , SYY , UL by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Stock split is no reason to buy Netflix. Greece negotiations collapsed again and so did the market. On top of that, Carl Icahn said that the market is overheated. "I thought Icahn's beef was more with the lack of worth in the high-yield bond market than with equities, especially given that he still owns a ton of stocks," said Cramer. He said that Icahn did not say to short sell the stocks. Instead, he meant that stocks like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) have had big moves and it's time to take profits. He still found value in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and said that it should be bought on dips. One negative story that has been hanging on the market forever is Greece. "We simply cannot have this darned thing hanging over our heads and still believe we are going to get a big fat non-Greek rally, which is one of the reasons why I didn't want any Fed governors talking about one or two rate hikes until the fat lady sings and Zorba the Greek dances," said Cramer. If all this wasn't negative enough, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ) downgraded Citigroup (NYSE: C ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) to hold. Then Citigroup downgraded cyber security stocks Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ) and FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE ). Cramer however warned investors not to sell cyber security stocks, as next time a data breach happens, they would wonder why they sold them. Final nail on the coffin was the decline in transports. "So, you crush the banks and cyber security plays, sending down the two biggest sectors, finance and tech, then you get run over by a freight train and a big brown truck on a day when Greece is back messing up the narrative and you aren't going to go picking among the red hot rubble until it cools," said Cramer. The market is indeed overheated and one should wait till the weak hands leave the stocks. Is Baxter (NYSE: BAX ) turning around? Baxter was up on a down day. It is a giant medical supply company, which is in the middle of a break up, which could translate into a turnaround. The company has been too big to manage. It's taken a lot of time for the company to spin off its bio-sciences business. After the break up, the slimmed down version of the company is one that investors would want a piece of. "It's been a tough year for Baxter, but the long-awaited breakup is almost upon us. And once the company spins off its bio-science business as Baxalta (NYSE: BXLT ), I think the upside could be tremendous," said Cramer. Goldman Sachs has also upgraded the stock. The company has 2 divisions; medical products that accounts for 60% of revenue, and bio-sciences that accounts for the other 40%. The bio-sciences division is being spun off and it has a small monopoly in this business. The medical products line is the boring and steady business. Post spin-off, shareholders will receive 1 share of Baxalta for each share of Baxter. The stock has been a laggard as the company kept missing its own guidance, and decided to stop providing guidance at all. The bears pounced on the company as Baxter has been facing competition and has a lot of patent expirations. The dividend safety was also in question. The bull case for the stock now is that all the pain is behind it. Since the estimates are very low, the company will beat them. Baxter has also been punished by the strong dollar, and with the dollar peaking now, it will be advantageous for the company. The new company will be clean and simple. Cramer recommends it. Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ ) When Kraft broke itself up in 2012, its division Kraft Foods (NASDAQ: KRFT ) got a lot of attention. It's now being acquired by Heinz. The other division, Mondelez International, is almost forgotten. Mondelez is a snack and beverage company that owns brands like Oreo's, Chips Ahoy, Triscuits, Ritz Crackers, Trident gum, Cadbury chocolate and Toblerone. "The thing is that Mondelez has hit some serious bumps in the road in recent years. It's suffered from poor margins and sluggish revenue growth. However, lately Mondelez has gotten aggressive about fixing its business and the stock has suddenly become an outperformer," said Cramer. The stock is up 13% year-to-date. Does it have more room to run? Mondelez is a global brand and it gets 20% sales from North America, 40% from Europe, 15% from Latin America and the remainder from APAC. This means that the strong dollar has affected the top and bottom-line miserably, but with the dollar peaking, Cramer expects the headwinds to be tailwinds in the next 6 months. The company has been a leader in the snack and candy market globally. Since its spin-off, the company has been trying to streamline production and cut costs. The revenue has been shrinking as the company has been discontinuing many of the lower-margin product businesses. The activist Nelson Peltz has a 3% stake and is pressurizing constantly to eliminate corporate overhead and improve margins. "I think Mondelez has what it takes to go higher, even if Peltz's dream doesn't come true," said Cramer. He thinks there could be lot of growth down the road. Cramer went off the tape again to review a privately held company that is doing a great job. He reviewed Embrace Innovations, which was a non-profit created to provide infant warmers in developing countries. They invented a cheap and portable baby warmer that can be used in place of an incubator, which a lot of the developing countries' populations do not have access to. The business became popular and they decided to spin it off and create a profit business called Embrace Innovations, so they can commercialize the technology. They have a line of baby warmers called Little Lotus, that were designed as a swaddle and sleeping bag product for parents in the U.S. Cramer interviewed co-founder and CEO Jane Chen along with Kataoka, the artist who co-developed the Little Lotus line. "Embrace to date, has reached 150,000 babies with our infant warmer across 10 countries. But the goal was always how do we get to a million babies? The challenge was always to find the funding to do that to scale sustainably," said Chen. Due to incubators being expensive, almost 6 babies die globally per minute as they cannot keep warm. Little Lotus solves that issue at a fraction of the cost. Netflix was up $25 on the split news and it crashed down after Icahn said that it's time to take profits. "We know that broader ownership is key in a market like this one where home gamers tend to own stocks and institutions tend to rent them. That's why I don't turn up my nose at Netflix's seven-for-one split, even as I recognize that a stock split creates no value," said Cramer. The split is no reason to buy a stock. If you split a pencil into half, you will have 2 pencils and not more pencils. Right now, lots of institutions and funds hold the stock and management wants more retail investors to own it. Fund buying and shorting in huge quantities is causing the stock to be volatile. Cramer said that it is volatile as it is tough to value on traditional methods. "Here's the thing; Netflix is a company with a product that is enjoyed by the masses and this seven-for-one split allows users to buy more shares which can entice them into the stock," he added. The long-term road looks good for Netflix. "At the end of the day, if you want to own Netflix, you should buy it because the opportunity is so great and not because you can buy more shares with fewer dollars," said Cramer. On the flip side, the stock should be sold if it looks over valued and not because a fund manager said so. Ford (NYSE: F ): "The yield is fine but we've to see Latin America, Europe and China turn. That is a lot of turning." Second Sight (NASDAQ: EYES ): "The stock has doubled. Buy it below $14 and I think it could get there." Sysco (NYSE: SYY ): "They have lot of business to other players. I want you to stay away." Unilever (NYSE: UL ): "Make a stand. If the dollar has done going higher, then buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), else by Unilever."
