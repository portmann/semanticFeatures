Like BofA reporting millions in legal costs and demonstrating a Moynihanian martyr disorder, or Goldman using almost every quarter to prove that it is the Alpha. But sometimes these reveals can be a bit troubling, like this little tidbit from Yahoo: Yahoo said Chief Executive Marissa Mayer faced â€œspecific security threatsâ€? in 2015 â€” and the company accordingly spent more than a half-million dollars on her personal security. Last yearâ€™s tab came to $544,061 â€” more than 20 times the $26,891 Yahoo had spent a year earlier on protecting Mayer and her immediate family, according to a Monday filing. Sure, protecting Marissa and her family is serious business but so is corporate Stockholm Syndrome. While most human beings would argue that you can’t put a price on protecting a human life, some Yahoo shareholders are almost certainly looking at this latest revelation and privately thinking “$544,061? Really?” And Yahoo’s explanation was rather vague: â€œDuring 2015 Ms. Mayer faced specific security threats that we believed were credible,â€? Yahoo said in the filing. The company didnâ€™t elaborate on the threats. But outside of the threats from activist hedge funds invested in Yahoo, did Yahoo have to take every threat so seriously? It’s not like spending half a mil is going to go unnoticed these days and Marissa’s perks are now notorious. Yahoo said it doesnâ€™t consider the security tab a â€œperk,â€? and said it â€œis especially reasonable in light of the fact that Ms. Mayer does not ask the company to reimburse her private aircraft costs for business travel.â€? Stop making excuses for her, Yahoo. Blink twice if you want Ross Levinsohn to call for help. Finance Flack Not Interested In Commenting On Story About Him (Allegedly!)
