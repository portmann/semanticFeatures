ETF Hub Sep 21 2015, 20:33 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon ( VZ +0.5%) could go for a lease of Dish Network's ( DISH +2.4%) valuable spectrum haul by the end of this year , analysts at New Street Research believe. At Goldman Sachs' Communacopia conference last week, Verizon chief Lowell McAdam signaled that the company would be interested in talking with Dish about the airwaves, including a megabytes-for-spectrum swap. "Verizon seemed to shift their tone on Dish's spectrum last week, which we think potentially sets up a transaction between now and year end," writes New Street. The analysts think it would be difficult for Verizon to pay cash for the lease considering its debt. They believe Dish's spectrum is worth $63B, with the AWS-3 and AWS-4 airwaves worth $53B in themselves. The timing of the deal could be accelerated by a likely quiet period that the FCC could impose over spectrum negotiation, from the end of this year until mid-2016.
