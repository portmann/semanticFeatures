Will Amazon Kill GrubHub? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Amazon.com, Inc.

GrubHub works great in New York City ( much of which is revenue from me ordering crispy beef from Shun Lee ) but less well as it moves further and further from its initial locations - it has this in common with Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK ). GrubHub's dream would be getting acquired by Amazon; its nightmare would be getting copied by Amazon. The latter appears to be coming true. Amazon is now offering Prime Now exclusively for Amazon Prime members. The company is offering free delivery as well as $10 off of initial orders of $20 or more in San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego, Austin, Baltimore, Portland, and Tampa with more locations on the way. The service comes with a mobile app that is equivalent to GrubHub's. Combined with Amazon's store card , you get over half off that first order. Amazon is willing to spend almost any amount of resources to establish itself as a low cost, high convenience service. Can anyone beat them at that game? Probably not. After asking extremely politely, BCE (NYSE: BCE ) is buying Manitoba Telecom ( OTCPK:MOBAF ) in a $3.9 billion deal. Manitoba holders get $40 in cash or 0.6756 of a BCE common share for each MTS common share, subject to proration. The total consideration will be paid 45% in cash and 55% in BCE equity. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) is buying Opower (NYSE: OPWR ) in a $532 million deal. OPWR holders get $10.30 per share in cash. Oracle's Chairman was not always so enthusiastic about the cloud . Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) and Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ) walked from their deal. Halliburton will pay Baker Hughes the $3.5 billion breakup fee of $3.5 billion by Wednesday, May 4. All breakups would be easier if they came with three and a half billion dollar consolation prize. Interval Leisure (NASDAQ: IILG ) and Starwood (NYSE: HOT ) delayed the closing of ILG's acquisition of Starwood's vacation ownership business, Vistana, while both companies work to avoid unnecessary tax withholding. They are working to wrap up the process of identifying which holders are properly subject to this withholding. The merger agreement has been filed with the SEC for the First Cash (NASDAQ: FCFS ) acquisition of Cash America (NYSE: CSH ). GNC (NYSE: GNC ) is working with Goldman (NYSE: GS ) to find a buyer.
