Boeing's Lower Q1 Deliveries Fits The Profile - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Slow recovery of cargo market pressures deliveries. After Boeing (NYSE: BA ) reported Q1 2016 deliveries, a lot of people and news sites were reporting a 4.3% drop in deliveries, without actually looking whether this fits the guidance provided by Boeing. In this article, I will have a look at the deliveries per program and place the Q1 deliveries into the bigger picture. Table 1: 1Q 2015 deliveries versus 1Q 2016 deliveries Before looking at the deliveries per type, it is important to note that Boeing expects to deliver between 740-745 units. This is 17-22 units less than the delivery volume in 2015. As can be seen, year-over-year deliveries for the Boeing 737 were flat. While it was said deliveries would fall due to the transition towards the 737MAX, the flat Q1 deliveries feed the suggestion that Boeing has not been able to sell all available slots for 2016. If this is the case, deliveries are likely to drop in the second half of 2016. The Boeing 747 program is in a more than challenging position and has forced Boeing to cut production rate several times already. Currently, the production rate stands at 1.3 units per month, which will be incrementally reduced to 0.5 aircraft per month later this year. The 4 deliveries last year fit the production rate of 1.3 aircraft. The lower number of deliveries in 2016 on one side reflects brittle recovery of the cargo market, but on the other, also the delivery schedule of airlines. Last year, Lufthansa ( OTCQX:DLAKF ) took delivery of 3 Boeing 747-8Is. Despite Boeing having announced production rate increases for the Boeing 767, the number of 767 has been lower. This is caused by a ramp-up in tanker production. Another reason probably is (again) the slow recovery of the cargo market, which means that FedEx which ordered 50 freighters does not need them yet. Boeing delivered 1 777 unit less than in the first 3 months of 2015. In Q1 2015, Boeing delivered 6 freighters and 18 Boeing 777-300ERs. In 2016, freighter deliveries dropped to 2 units, but these lower deliveries were partly offset by higher -300ERs deliveries. Deliveries for the Boeing 787 were flat and in line with my expectations and are reflective of a 10 per month delivery schedule. A 12 per month production rate will be reached later this year, so I expect deliveries to rise later this year. Probably one of the most important things to do is connecting the quarterly figures to the bigger picture. For 2016, Boeing expects deliveries to fall by 2%-3%. So this has to be taken into account when looking at the Q1 deliveries. Year-over-year deliveries fell 8 units, which means that in the quarters to come, deliveries will be 9-14 lower or 3-5 deliveries less per remaining quarter. On average, Q1 deliveries account for 22.6% of the full-year deliveries. Comparing this figure with the Q1 2016 deliveries, it can be concluded that the drop in deliveries (compared to Boeing's most optimistic full-year delivery target) is not excessive and more or less fits the quarterly delivery trend. Given Boeing's lower full-year delivery guidance, I think the decline in Q1 deliveries is reasonable. Q1 deliveries mostly accounts for 22%-24% of the annual deliveries, and the Q1 2016 deliveries also follow this pattern. I do not see the lower deliveries as problematic and the lower guidance already has been priced-in quite a bit. My long-term outlook on Boeing remains unchanged, but the company does face some short/mid-term challenges that need to be dealt with. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
