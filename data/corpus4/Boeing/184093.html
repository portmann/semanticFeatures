Boeing Plans To Set Up A China Facility: Boon Or Bane? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing received its largest ever order for 300 planes from China. The company announced to set up a completion center in China to contest Airbusâ€™ growing dominance in the fast growing aviation market. Boeing has agreed to work with Comac at the China facility where the final touches would be given to the 737 before handover to the customer. Boeing would be sharing its technical knowhow with Comac, which could cost the company in the future as the latter is building its own narrowbody. China's President Xi Jinping's visit to Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) Seattle facility will be marked as a historic day in the company's calendar as it was followed by some record orders. The company also announced to spread its wings abroad for the first time ever. The current events have apparently come in as a sign of strengthening relations between the two economies. However, Boeing has always been very cautious of keeping operations within the domestic boundary in fear of transferring its valuable knowhow and technology to a foreign land. There's no doubting that China is among the fastest growing aviation markets and Boeing's been importing components from the mainland. But is it reason enough for Boeing to move outside the homeland? Certainly not. There's more to it. China is a hotly contested market with both Boeing and its European counterpart Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) battling to get a larger share. The latter has an upper hand in terms of orders, though China tries to even out orders between the two companies says Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group . Airbus, set up its assembly line in Tianjin, China in 2008. The company has been solidifying its hold in the country ever since as bulk of the total orders from Chinese aircraft customers were awarded to the plane maker, loading its order books. This year Airbus stated its plans of extending its China venture by constructing a completion center for its popular wide-body, the A330, for sales in Asia. Airbus's declaration was followed by a 45 jet, $11 billion order from China, and this is no coincidence. The order flowed in as a sign of appreciation for investing in the country's aviation industry. This has become a point of concern for Boeing. China is a growth market that demands more airplanes to manage increasing passenger traffic which is expected to grow 6.6% annually , as against other developed markets that primarily have replacement demand. As such Boeing got triggered to introduce operations in China to play catch up with Airbus to gain market share. The Chicago-headquartered company's efforts did not go without rewards. China was quick to place orders for 300 Boeing jets , which is the largest ever placed by the country. The deal is for 250 737s and 50 wide-body aircraft. However, the combination of the order for 50 wide-body planes is not known. Though the catalogue price of the deal calculates to $38 billion, aircraft manufacturers typically give huge discounts. The plane maker forecasts China to take deliveries of 6,330 planes in the next two decades, which translates to $950 billion worth of business. Of this, Boeing expects single aisle to count for over 5,600 of the total deliveries, which precisely means three out of four planes delivered would be narrowbody. As far as demand for wide-body planes is concerned, Boeing said China has opened 30 routes covering 3,500 miles over the past two years. Long-haul flights in these routes could see the company win orders for the 787 and 777-300ER. Considering Boeing's market share will improve in China over the next few years, it could bag sizable orders with only Airbus to compete. The decision of constructing an industrial facility abroad is a big strategic move for Boeing. Boeing's exposed to a broader market risk than just challenging Airbus' dominance in the mainland. The 300-jet order has been placed on behalf of three Chinese airlines and a leasing company, all of which are state controlled and tied to China's long term objectives. China has been long yearning to develop a solid aviation base and looks forward to the entry of foreign companies that could help its workforce learn the technology and the manufacturing process. The country has made a sound groundwork for an aviation industry, but now needs to develop its workforce and infrastructure to be able to manufacture planes. As such, the Chinese government formed a subsidiary named Commercial Aviation Company of China (Comac) to enter the manufacturing space from making component parts. Comac is currently involved in developing a single aisle plane, the C919, to get a share of the narrowbody market, and such arrangements would come in quite handy. As part of Boeing's agreement of setting up a completion center in China, it will work in collaboration with Comac to carry out the completion activities of the 737 jets until its handover to the customers. That is to say, Boeing will coach Comac workers with the skill sets to design the C919 that's being developed to compete with the 737. Boeing workers are certainly not happy to see the plane maker build a plant abroad. However, Ray Conner, CEO of Commercial Airplane division said that the move would not result in any job loss at Renton. In fact it would take some load off them, particularly when they are seeing the monthly production rate increase from 42 to 52 by 2018. The latest order flow and stronger China ties should pull up Boeing's top and bottom lines, but that's coming at the cost of building a non-U.S. factory and sharing the technical knowhow with Comac. While it might appear Boeing's assisting in building its future rival, China is going to learn the art anyway from its tie-up with Airbus. If that is the case, then why not capitalize on the ongoing surge in China's aviation market instead of letting Airbus gain dominion over the country. There's a great deal more to manufacturing planes than just fitting the interior and painting, which comes at the bottom of the value chain.
