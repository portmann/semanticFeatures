Boeing: EVA Air Chooses Boeing 787-10 Over Airbus A350-900 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha EVA Air ordered 7 Boeing 777 airframes in 2015, equivalent to 1 month of production. The deal is valued at $8 billion, but will be closer to $4 billion after discounts. In one of my previous articles I had a look at Norwegian Long Haul selecting the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787-9 as back bone for its long haul operations. Lately the Boeing 787 has been receiving some order inflow, helping Boeing to top last year's net orders for the Boeing 787. In this article I will have a look at the order that EVA Air will place and see how it affects Boeing's backlog and the EVA Air fleet. Rumors of an order to strengthen the EVA Air medium-haul fleet have been around for a while. The airline was considering the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 787-10. Eventually the airline chose the Boeing 787-10 and will also order the Boeing 777-300ER for the long-haul fleet. EVA Air will order 24 Boeing 787-10 airframes and 2 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. At list prices the deal is valued at $8.03bn, but after discounts AeroAnalysis estimated the market value to be $4.24bn. Figure 2: Infographic current and future wide body fleet EVA Air (Source: AeroAnalys.net ) Figure 2 shows the current division between Airbus and Boeing in EVA Air's wide body fleet, as well as the future composition. Currently the wide body fleet consists of 36 aircraft, while there are another 27 on order with Boeing and Airbus. Currently 66% of the wide body fleet is a Boeing aircraft. If we add the 6 Airbus A330-300 airframes on order, the 15 orders for the Boeing 777 and the 24 new orders for the Boeing 777-300ER, the airline has 45 aircraft on order. Subtracting the aircraft that will be faced out (Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A330-200), the EVA Air wide body fleet will grow to 76 units. If the deal is finalized before year-end, the net orders for the Boeing 787 will almost double. Taking into account the order placed by Norwegian, Boeing will have at least 69 orders by year-end. At current product rates that is almost 6 months of production. I expect that by year end Boeing will have 100 net orders for the Boeing 787. EVA Air will order the Boeing 787-10, the biggest variant in the 787 family. Currently Boeing sold 146 Boeing 787-10 airframes. Asian operators so far ordered 33 Boeing 787-10 airframes. With the order from EVA Air Boeing found a 3rd Asian customer for the -10 and will add 16% to its 787-10 back log. EVA Air prefers the Dreamliner over the A350 EVA Air wide body fleet will double in the coming years Year-to-date EVA Air ordered 7 airframes, equivalent to 1 month of production For Boeing it is satisfying that EVA Air selected the Boeing 787-10 over the Airbus A350-900 and I expect the airline to order more 787 airframes in the future.
