WSJ: Boeing beats Bombardier, Embraer for second United order - United Continental Holdings, Inc (NYSE:UAL) | Seeking Alpha Feb 22 2016, 12:37 ET | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor United Continental ( UAL +2.9%) is finalizing a second deal with Boeing ( BA +1.9%) for new single-aisle jets that would block smaller rivals Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF , OTCQX:BDRBF ) and Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) from gaining a coveted spot in the airline’s fleet, WSJ reports. Boeing last month won a deal to sell 40 737-700s to United, which utilizes the 118-seat jet as a staple in its fleet. The number of planes in the second order is not known, but any such deal would be a blow for Bombardier, which has sought to build momentum for its new CSeries jets.
