Boeing, Lockheed protest Northrop's U.S. bomber contract win | Reuters Northrop Grumman Corp CEO Wes Bush takes part in the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington September 7, 2011. Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) on Friday filed a formal protest against the U.S. Air Force's contract with Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) for a new long-range strike bomber, saying the selection process was "fundamentally flawed." The Pentagon's two largest suppliers said they believed the Air Force "did not properly reward the contractors’ proposals to break the upward-spiraling historical cost curves of defense acquisitions, or properly evaluate the relative or comparative risk of the competitors’ ability to perform." Neither Northrop nor the Air Force had any immediate comment on the challenge to one of the Pentagon's biggest contracts in over a decade - a deal valued at more than $80 billion. The Air Force last week selected Northrop, maker of the stealthy B-2 bomber, to develop and build the new bomber. Under federal law, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress that rules on federal contract protests, now has 100 days to evaluate the issue. Analysts had widely expected either losing team to protest the award, given the high stakes involved and the dearth of other large-scale U.S. arms programs in coming years. The decision reflected concerns about the Air Force's use of cost data from earlier bomber programs to assess the pricing of the planes, devaluing innovations and new manufacturing processes implemented in recent years, according to two sources familiar with the companies' thinking. The team of Boeing and Lockheed also believe the Air Force failed to properly evaluate the risks involved with Northrop's bid since the company has been a supplier, not prime contractor, on military aircraft programs in recent years, the sources said. Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing and Lockheed, said the review led by Boeing General Counsel Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, concluded that there was solid grounds for challenging the award. "This is shaping up to be a replay of the tanker award when Boeing challenged the way in which Northrop was awarded a future Air Force program," he said. The Air Force later canceled that contract with Northrop and ultimately selected Boeing to build the refueling planes. In a column in Forbes magazine on Friday, Thompson said the official estimate that it would cost $21.4 billion to develop the plane was roughly twice what the competing industry teams bid. It also leaves the government liable for possible cost overruns - despite repeated calls by lawmakers for a different approach. He said the Air Force chose Northrop's bid because of its "rock-bottom" price for developing the plane, and never rigorously analyzed the cost of production or maintenance over the life of the aircraft. Boeing and Lockheed agonized over the decision for a full week after a briefing from the Air Force last Friday, concerned about possibly mounting a protest they could not substantiate or win, and mindful of the Air Force's need to start replacing its aging B-1 and B-52 bombers. Air Force officials have been silent on how the two bids compared, saying only that Northrop's bomber represented the "best value for the nation" and would cost $511 million per plane, on average, in 2010 dollars, well below the program's cost cap of $550 million per plane.
