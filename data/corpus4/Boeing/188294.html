Fueling The Fleet - Boeing's KC-46A Pegasus - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha First flight of the Boeing KC-46A occurred on Friday; the first of the type in tanker configuration after test flights in the development of 767-2C. Delivery of the first of 179 Pegasus tankers is estimated for late 2017. Entry into service of the operational aircraft must run smoothly if Boeing plans to continue to offer the replacement of choice for the US Air Force’s KC-135 fleet. As Airbus continues to match Boeing’s annual orders of civil airframes, it’s crucial for Boeing to maintain its stronghold in the military sector. Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) next generation tanker/cargo aircraft, the 767-derived KC-46A "Pegasus" made its first flight in tanker configuration on Friday, a welcome milestone for the airframer who has endured substantial technical setbacks and test flight delays over its 8 years of development. Boeing hoped the $50 billion deal to replace the US Air Force's ageing fleet of KC-135s would be supplemented by orders from other nations who, so far, look to have favoured alternative manufacturer's offerings. This article reviews the technical merits of the Pegasus and its competitive placement in the world's fleet of support aircraft. The KC-46A program is of high importance to Boeing, whose military aircraft arm's revenues have not followed the upward trend of its commercial aircraft business [Figure 2]. As Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) continues to meet, and in some cases exceed Boeing's monthly order count, it's crucial for Boeing to maintain its stronghold in the military aircraft market, and as such, the performance of the Pegasus program should be considered significant for potential investors. Modern air forces are spoiled for choice of next generation "KC" aircraft. Figure 3 shows the deployment range and fuel transfer capability of current models, which fulfil three distinct performance envelopes. Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) currently offer highly versatile, sub-200,000lb MTOW aircraft that offers kerosene & cargo support; the KC-130J and KC-390 can operate as moderate capacity tankers from short fields while remaining combat ready for equipment and personnel transport. Larger, multi-role offerings come in the form of the Airbus A400M and A310 MRTT, and the B767 MMTT conversion offered by Israel Aerospace Industries, all of which attain longer on-station time performance and far greater ferry range. Two long range, high capacity tankers offer direct competition to the Pegasus - the A330 MRTT and Il-78 both offer comparable 200,000lb+ transfer fuel capability which enables them to offer fleet support to sizeable sorties for prolonged periods. Although both Boeing's and Airbus' airframes offer comparable ferry range and station performance in their high capacity tankers, the order books look very different [Figure 4]. In terms of commitment volume, the Pegasus is leading significantly with a staggering 179 aircraft on order, the sole customer being the US Air Force. The A330 MRTT, by contrast, has attained far fewer orders, the 40 strong order book is built on commitments from 7 different nations spanning Asia, Europe and the Middle East. There are several contributory factors that have led to Boeing's lack of buyers for the Pegasus tanker. The sizeable order attained from the US Air Force has enabled prolonged production of the 767 base-frame; however, it has also meant the design architecture is focused specifically around the US military's requirements, resulting in an aircraft not ideally suited, or priced, for a smaller nation's defense strategy. This is reflected in the KC-46's tanker-driven design, with cargo capability being very much a secondary role - a capability the USAF is not short of with its 650 strong fleet of C5s, C130s and C17s. The United States' position, both geographically and politically, requires the ability to operate anywhere on the globe, and the sheer size of the US airborne fleet requires extraordinary refueling capability. Figure 5 shows the relative refueling fleet size of some of the largest air forces. The US's reliance on air-to-air refuel capability is clear, with three times as many tankers per aircraft as any other nation. Figure 5 - Fleet composition by nation While the US will predominantly use the Pegasus for refuel missions, smaller nations require a true tanker transport, where the cargo function has not been compromised to enhance tanker performance. The A330 MRTT is marketed as a highly versatile tanker transport that offers more flexible solutions for smaller nations, making it just as effective during peacetime. Although industry sources estimate the Boeing is $24 million more expensive per unit than the Airbus offering, Boeing sources have stated its aircraft is about 25% cheaper to operate over its life-time, despite the higher acquisition cost. The problem being that this figure is flight hour dependent. Unlike the US, a lot of nations simply won't utilize support aircraft to the same extent, again making the KC-46A less attractive to more modest defense budgets. Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey has said that acquisition of the Pegasus enables the host nation to dovetail with the USAF program - this is an interesting statement, particularly in the case of South Korea who frequently exercise with US forces, and somewhat rely on USAF's ability to show force. The fact that South Korea invested in the Airbus A330 MRTT indicates that this selling point isn't as appealing to the average nation as Boeing may think. Another contributory factor to the differences in order count is the existing backlog. Both airframes have low (in comparison to the civil sector) production rates, and although order backlog will not reach the extremes of the single-aisle civil market, will still be considered by buyers, and Airbus' reduced price and lead-time will influence any decisions based on more than just technical merit. The KC-46A program has been at the centre of media attention since its inception. The estimated $1.2 billion worth of cost overrun and sizeable fines have helped to maintain the program's attention; however, the fact is, Boeing already has commitments for four times as many aircraft as Airbus and the single-digit percentage profit Boeing makes from $200m aircraft will soon absorb the unexpected costs. Perhaps, Boeing has indeed developed an aircraft that is specified for a single nation's fleet, but is this a concern for investors? No. Boeing would have still launched the project, knowing USAF would be the sole buyer. The US Air Force tanker fleet currently exceeds 450 aircraft, and the 180 Pegasus ordered so far are only the first phase of a much-needed replacement program. Any investor can overlook lost orders to lessor-nations if the KC-46A's entry into service is pain-free, ensuring USAF continues to turn to the airframer for their tanker fleet needs. The coming stages of the test flight program will remain under heavy scrutiny as the tanker displays its ability to fuel manned and unmanned aircraft from domestic and international forces. Whether or not Boeing attains orders from international customers, it has still achieved rejuvenation of an otherwise diminishing civil 767 production line and created a fit-for-purpose kerosene/cargo airframe for the world's largest air force. The day Boeing won the USAF contract, the KC-46A's success was set. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
