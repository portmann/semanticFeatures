Boeing: These 3 Things Could Drive Shares Lower Tomorrow - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is scheduled to Report earnings tomorrow before market open. Market reaction to the report will likely hinge on three factors: cash flow, 777 production rate, and progress on Dreamliner deferred costs. Boeing's share price could react to significant negative developments in any of these three areas of near term performance and present a buying opportunity to long term investors. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) represents one of the best long term investments in the Dow 30 as macroeconomic trends strongly favor its commercial business. The company is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow (10/22) before market open. Average analyst estimates are looking for $2.22 per share. The market's reaction in the near term, however, will likely not be driven as much by the company's earnings as it is by three pressing issues that threaten near and medium term performance. Investors have been focused on the company's cash flow as analysts remain largely divided on the company's ability to generate cash from ramping production in the Dreamliner and 737 programs. Investors have longed used cash flow as one of, if not the most important, performance metric for the company. Rising cash flows in 2014 from the company's commercial products allowed Boeing to boost its share repurchase program to $12 billion and raise the company's dividend by 25% in December of last year. The company's cash flow performance in 2015 has been mixed. First quarter cash flow largely disappointed analysts and bolstered the argument of some Boeing followers that the company had been accelerating aircraft deposits to improve cash flow in an unsustainable way. The company seems to have temporarily silenced its critics, however, in the second quarter when the company reported an impressive rise of $2.6 billion of cash. Boeing's 2015 cash flow story will have its next chapter written when the company reports tomorrow. A disappointment on the cash flow question could send Boeing's shares back down to 2015 lows. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program is still deferring costs on each aircraft it makes. This accounting technique allows the company to book profits on 787's it sells today based on what it projected each of the first 1,300 aircraft to cost instead of what the planes actually costs the company to build. The deferred costs have continued to grow, though at a slowing pace, throughout 2015. Boeing management has assured investors that the Dreamliner will reach the break even point by the end of 2015. As the calendar rolls towards the latter part of October, this assurance seems increasingly ambitious . Company commentary on deferred costs should be closely watched this quarter, but of the three drivers of short term performance of Boeing stock, deferred Dreamliner costs will likely have the least impact. In a recent article I argued that Boeing will almost certainly have to cut the rate of production of its cash cow 777-300 aircraft as it struggles to fill production slots bridging the current program to the next generation 777X. The time is fast approaching for management to announce a production cut and they may take the opportunity of the 3rd quarter earnings report to do so. Of the three drivers of short term performance of Boeing's share price, a 777 production rate cut would likely have the greatest impact as the 777 program has been estimated by a Goldman analyst to account for as much as 45% of the company's quarterly income. Boeing remains an excellent investment for long term investors due to macroeconomic trends that are highly likely to lead to strong growth in air travel over the next twenty years. Short term factors likely to affect Boeing in the short term will very likely provide a buying opportunity at a discount from current share price for long term investors.
