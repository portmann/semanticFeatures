UPDATE 1-Boeing signs deal to sell 300 jets to group of Chinese firms - Xinhua | Reuters Related: Stocks, M&A, Markets, Airlines BEIJING, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Boeing Co has signed deals to sell 300 aircraft to three Chinese firms and set up an aircraft plant in China, making it the first U.S. firm to announce a business tieup in the country since Chinese president Xi Jinping began a state visit to the United States, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China's ICBC Financial Leasing Co, a unit of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, on Wednesday separately confirmed it will buy 30 of Boeing's 737-800 jets, worth $2.88 billion at list prices. China Aviation Supplies Holding Company and China Development Bank Leasing are the other two customers for the aircraft, said Xinhua. The world's second-biggest economy is a key market for Boeing and its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA), which manufacture most of the passenger aircraft that are in service globally.  Boeing raised its forecast for China's aircraft demand by 5 percent in August, saying that the country will need 6,330 planes over the next 20 years. Boeing has also signed a cooperation document with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to build an aircraft completion centre for its 737 passenger jet in China, added Xinhua. The agency didn't disclose further details. Boeing executives and officials from the Chinese firms could not immediately be reached for comment. Xi, who arrived in Seattle on Tuesday, is set to visit Boeing on Wednesday.
