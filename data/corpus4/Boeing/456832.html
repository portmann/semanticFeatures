Day 2 At FIA 2016: Narrowbody Dominates, Airbus Cracks On A380 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Asian carriers continue domination on day 2 of the air show. Air Asia placed a mega order for 100 Airbus A320neos and 100 options. The bi-annual Farnborough International Airshow has started and traditionally the Paris Air Show, Farnborough International Airshow and Dubai Airshow are used as a stage to announce big orders. In this article I will have a look at the order inflow on Day 2 of the air show and notable news items. In the coming days I will be covering news and orders for Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), COMAC, Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) and Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ). On day 2 Qatar Airways and Boeing announced the launch of a performance improvement package for the Boeing 777. The performance improvement packages aims to cut fuel burn by 2%. TUI Group ordered 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft and 1 Boeing 787-9. Additionally, the leisure carrier took an option for an additional Dreamliner. Air Lease Corporation ordered 6 Boeing 737 MAX 8 airframes Chinese Kunming Airlines announced a MoU for 10 737 MAX 7 aircraft An undisclosed Chinese customer is planning on buying 30 Boeing 737 airframes; Likely 15 Boeing 737-800s and 15 Boeing 737 MAX 8s Volga Dnepr seems to have firmed up a commitment for 20 aircraft, adding 16 airframes to Boeing's backlog TUI will be adding GoldCare service to its 737 MAX fleet The firm orders have a catalog value of $8.1B, the market value will be closer to $3.4B. The Memorandum of Understandings and LoIs (Letter of Intent) carry a catalog value of $4.3B and market value of $2.0B. The order for 16 Boeing 747-8Fs does help Boeing a bit in filling delivery slots, but this order should not surprise anybody. Last year, at the Paris Air Show, Volga already committed to 20 Boeing 747-8Is. The order that has been announced today is nothing more than the commitment being firmed up. The combination of lower rates on the Boeing 747-8F and the firm order does give Boeing some confidence in the program. In terms of profit the Boeing 747 program does not add anything, since the program is in reach-forward loss position meaning that the jet maker is not allowed to book profits on future deliveries. Story of the day probably is Airbus cracking on production of the Airbus A380. The European jet maker had reached a break-even rate of 27 in 2015, but now will be reducing annual output to 20 in 2017 and 12 in 2018. Airbus CEO, Fabrice Bergier said the following about the rate cut: With this prudent, proactive step we are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting current commercial demand but keeping all our options open to benefit from future A380 markets. The words of the Airbus CEO show that Airbus was forced to cut. It either was keeping production alive at current breakeven, but unsustainable, rates and terminate the program after it runs out of backlog or keep alive production at lower rates. The business case for the Airbus A380 has been weak, also demand for a performance improved airframe is low. Additionally, Iran said it might not be taking delivery of the superjumbo after all. Positive news for Airbus was brought by the Airbus A320, which accumulated over 300 orders and commitments on Day 2 of the Farnborough International Airshow: Germania placed an order for 25 Airbus A320neos with an option for 15 more WOW Air ordered 4 Airbus A321ceo aircraft Air Asia and Airbus inked a contract for the purchase of 100 Airbus A321neos with options for another 100 Mumbai based GoAir ordered 72 Airbus A320neo aircraft The firm orders have a catalog value of $23.4B, the market value will be closer to $11.4B. The Memorandum of Understandings and LoIs (Letter of Intent) carry a catalog value of $14.2B and market value of $6.9B. Yesterday COMAC received commitments for 90 aircraft, while also Embraer some saw solid order inflow and commitments. On day 2 of the air show Bombardier added orders for 3 Q400s from Porter Airlines. Day 2 of the airshow was a whole lot better with over 160 more orders and commitments than day 1. Also compared to last year day 2 was more successful. After 2 days the order inflow (including commitments) is 20% lower compared to the first two days of the Paris Air Show in 2015. Customer of the day is Air Asia, which ordered 100 Airbus A321neos and took an option for another 100. This mega order accounted for 50% of the orders and commitments of Day 2. Boeing started the air show with an 80 units lead over Airbus. It is likely that Airbus took the lead in the annual order battle at Day 2 of the air show, but it remains to be seen how many orders were already in the order books with both jet makers.
