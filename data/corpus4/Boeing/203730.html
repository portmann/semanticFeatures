These Companies Might Not Be Impacted By The Turmoil In China | Seeking Alpha Mark Morelli , The Mathematical Investor (68 clicks) Bad news from China dominates the headlines. Will the economic slowdown and stock market crash in China migrate worldwide? Many articles and blog posts have been written and countless interviews held on TV and radio programs about the financial turmoil in China over the last few months. Business executives state that China is one of their top concerns . More than just a few analysts, pundits, and investors claim an economic "slowdown" combined with dramatically declining stock prices of Chinese companies, and problems in developing countries, Europe, and the U.S., will lead to subpar shareholder returns going forward. The thought process is that the Chinese problems will become contagious for many Western companies. However, there are a few companies, including Chicago-based aerospace giant the Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) and European powerhouse Airbus (OTCPK: EADSY ), that might not be affected, at least in the long run, by the negatives coming out of China. Boeing, manufacturer of passenger and military aircraft, space vehicles, and satellites, and many other products, recently published its annual projection for the commercial aerospace market for the next two decades, and the company is very bullish on things, including calling for a big increase in aircraft orders by Chinese airlines. Boeing predicts that $5.6 trillion worth of new aircraft will be delivered between 2015 and 2034, including over 14,000 in the Asia-Pacific region, in which China dominates. Within the prediction period China is set to become the world's largest domestic market for airline travel as its middle class expands and the population moves from rural to urban areas. Orders by North and South American, and European airlines, to handle increased international traffic to and from China, are also likely. Boeing and its top rival, Airbus, dominate the passenger jet industry with each capturing roughly half of the market in any given year. Both companies derive a significant portion of revenue and earnings from the commercial airline industry and are developing new aircraft to meet the anticipated demand. Boeing is planning to release new versions of its popular 737, 777, and 787 models over the next few years. Airbus is updating its short-haul, narrow-body lineup with a new engine option and the A320neo is right now undergoing flight tests. Major suppliers to both companies, including United Technologies Corp (NYSE: UTX ), will benefit too. The Hartford, CT-based conglomerate provides jet engines for the A320neo and 777, and electrical and mechanical systems for the 787. Growth in the aerospace market might help counteract a contraction in the Chinese building industry, a potential concern for UTC which also makes HVAC equipment and elevators. In spite of all the bad news coming out of China, a few companies might not be adversely affected. Commercial aircraft manufacturers The Boeing Company and Airbus should benefit as the market for its products grows. Suppliers, including United Technologies Corp, might also reap the rewards. Ignoring the bad news, investors with an eye out for the long term could benefit. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
