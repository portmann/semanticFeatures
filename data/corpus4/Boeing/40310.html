Boeing: Flying High With The Potential To Deliver Growing Dividends For Years To Come - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing posted $22.1 billion in revenue during Q1 2015, which resulted in an 8% increase over Q1 2014 results while EPS showed an increase of 12%. With a backlog of over $495 billion and orders for over 5700 commercial airliners, Boeing has the potential to book record revenues and profits for many quarters out. The potential success of the 777X will be a driving force for both increased revenues and earnings. With forward EPS estimates standing at $8.20-$8.40, the current 1Q-4Q 2015 dividend payout represents a very conservative 44.39% payout ratio. From a Dividend Growth Investment standpoint, Boeing has the ability to, not only maintain its current dividend yield, but to deliver increases in payout and yield over the coming years. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is considered the preeminent manufacturer of commercial airliners in the United States and the World. Also, it has been in a battle for sales with its rival, Airbus (NYSE: AIR ), for many years. The two companies seem to have an equal share of total shares of all airliners, but according to Boeing, its offerings for wide body jets, such as the 777 and 787, accounted for over 60% of all the wide body deliveries during 2014. During 1Q 2015, Boeing posted revenues of $22.1 billion. Those revenue numbers came in 8% higher than those posted during 1Q 2014. EPS came in at $1.97 in 1Q 2015 vs. $1.76 in 1Q 2014 which represented an increase of 12%. Revenue increases were driven by the delivery of 184 commercial and 42 defense aircraft. Boeing's orders remain strong, and its current order backlog stands at a lofty $495 billion. Boeing currently manufactures the most popular jet airliner in history with the 737. As of March 31, 2015, 4244 units are on order to be delivered. Although the 737 has been a fantastic success in its own right, Boeing is developing the 777X which will set new standards for long haul passenger aircraft. The plane will be the largest and most efficient twin-engine plane that Boeing has produced. It will incorporate General Electric (NYSE: GE ) GE9X engines which are the most advanced and fuel-efficient engines ever designed and developed. Additionally, new materials and technologies will be incorporated into many aspects of the 777X in the effort to reduce weight and improve efficiency. Strong orders for the 777X, currently standing at 286 units, has contributed at list prices, roughly $105 billion to the $495 billion order backlog. The 777X will be a significant revenue driver going forward, and it is scheduled for delivery in mid-2020. In the coming years, revenues booked from the 777X order backlog, along with new sales, will possibly contribute to increases in EPS and dividend payout. Based on the closing stock price of $148.40 on 4/24/2015, Boeing currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.45%. The 1Q 2015 quarterly dividend stands at $0.91/share which represents an increase of 24.65% over the $0.73/share paid during each quarter of 2014. From a Dividend Growth Investor's standpoint, the stock has the potential to deliver outstanding returns through dividend growth and reinvestment. Over the last 5 years, Boeing has delivered a 9.7% dividend growth rate. Furthermore, the 1Q 2015 $0.91/share payout represents an increase of over 300% over 1Q 2006 $0.30/share. For Dividend Growth Investors, an increase in of 300% in dividend income over a 10 year period represents a very compelling reason to own the stock. When coupled with reinvestment of those dividends, the total dividend payout would be even higher. In summary, Boeing has experienced 8% revenue growth from 1Q 2014 to 1Q 2015. It has seen its backlog grow to over $495 billion, with orders for its new 777X standing at over $105 billion. The forward earnings estimate for 2015 is $8.20-$8.40, with a dividend payout ratio of 44.39% which leaves room for future increases. Currently, the 1Q 2015 dividend of $0.91 has seen almost 25% growth over the 4Q 2014 of $0.73. Given the significant backlog, current dividend yield of 2.54%, and 5 year annual dividend growth of 9.7%, a convincing argument can be made for buying or increasing a position in Boeing.
