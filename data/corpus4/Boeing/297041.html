ETF Hub Jan 21 2016, 16:44 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor "The air cargo market recovery that began in late 2013 has stalled in recent months and slowed demand for the 747-8 Freighter," says Boeing (NYSE: BA ) Vice Chairman and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airlines Ray Conner. "We're taking the prudent step to further align production with current market requirements." The most recent data show air freight contracted in November by 1.2% from a year earlier, though passenger demand grew 5.9%. Starting in September, production will be cut from one airplane per month to half a plane. A reduction from 1.3 per month to 1 beginning in March was previously announced.
