Boeing: The Order Battle In August - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Year-to-date, Airbus took the lead in the order battle. The order battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) is one of the ways for the two companies to flex muscles, next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite the fact that the orders (in terms of value) are in no way a reflection of financial performance, it is important to have a look at the order inflow since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount, comfort, slot availability and efficiency. In July, Boeing 'won' the monthly battle, aided by FedEx's (NYSE: FDX ) mega order that was finalized. In this article, I will have a look at how the order inflow was divided between Boeing and Airbus and how the orders were divided between narrow- and wide-body aircraft. In August, Airbus and Boeing, together, hauled in 398 orders. Looking at the division of the orders, Airbus can be marked as the clear winner. Airbus received 346 orders while Boeing received 'just' 52 orders. Whereas Boeing's orders in July were lifted by orders for freighter aircraft, narrow-body aircraft naturally led the way in Boeing's order book in August: The only wide-body ordered in August was a Boeing 767-300F for FedEx, as part of the earlier announced deal for 50 freighters. Ruili Airlines finalized a deal for 30 737MAX aircraft that was announced during the Paris Air Show in June. The 2 remaining orders were placed by an unidentified customer. What can be concluded is that Boeing's order inflow was kept afloat by deals that were announced earlier. Secondly, most orders were for Boeing's narrow-body families. Airbus, on the other hand, seemed to be having a much better month, after a slow July: IndiGo accounted for over 70% of the order inflow with a mega order for 250 Airbus A320neo aircraft. IAG placed an order for 31 aircraft, a mix of 20 Airbus A320neos, 3 Airbus A330s and 8 Airbus A350-900s. Undisclosed customers ordered 43 Airbus A320neos and 22 Airbus A330s. 90% of the orders were for the Airbus A320neo, while the wide-body families accounted for 10% of the orders. Even without IndiGo's mega order, Airbus would end up on top of Boeing with 96 orders. So it is safe to say that in August, Airbus won the monthly battle in terms of numbers as well as in terms of value. Figure 1: Infographic Orders July (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Up until July, Boeing and Airbus were quite close to each other in the annual order battle, but aided by a mega order from IndiGo, Airbus took the lead. Boeing received 478 orders while Airbus secured 754 orders. After cancelations, Airbus booked 708 orders while Boeing distantly follows with 420 orders. Whereas Airbus was trailing in the order battle until July, it took the lead in August and now has almost 80% more orders. Helped by the IndiGo order, Airbus ended on top in August. Year-to-Date, Airbus took the lead in the order battle. Boeing's order inflow during August primarily consisted of deals that were announced at an earlier stage. Year-to-date, Boeing has achieved a book-to-bill ratio of .83, below the target of receiving 1 order for each delivery. Year-to-date, Airbus achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. Reason for the seemingly better book-to-bill is the fact that Airbus has lower production rates and, therefore, needs lesser orders to receive a book-to-bill of 1 As an investment, Airbus and Boeing both are nice investments, but Boeing's lead on the cargo and wide-body market means that the jet maker is leading on the market that potentially is more profitable on a per unit basis. On the other hand, Airbus sees a big order inflow for its A320neo family. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
