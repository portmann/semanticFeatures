Boeing Benefiting From Delivery Slots Scramble - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing's main problem on the Boeing 787 will be the availability of delivery slots. Cancellations and deferrals so far have brought Boeing orders, which shows the popularity of the Boeing 787. In 2014 Boeing (NYSE: BA ) received 1,432 orders, which set a new record for the plane maker. Despite the record breaking order inflow, the company also had to cope with some painful cancellations, deferrals and production gaps. One of the things that seemingly hurt Boeing the most is the deferral of 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, which were to be delivered starting in 2015/2016. The deferral yet has to be announced by Boeing, but so far Boeing refuses to comment on a possible deferral. Although it remains uncertain whether Air France-KLM (OTCPK: OTCPK:AFLYY /OTC: OTC:AFRAF ) will defer the delivery of the airframes, it puts Boeing in an uncomfortable position as the aircraft manufacturer still needs orders to fill its production gap for the Boeing 777 line, which has orders worth over two years of production whereas Boeing aims to keep producing the classic Boeing 777 at least until 2020. A deferral of 10 airframes means a gap of 1.5 months. On the other hand United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) is looking for a capacity expansion and replacement for the Boeing 747-400. The airline has the A350-1000 and Boeing 787-10 on order, both of which could replace the Boeing 747-400. Delivery slots, however, are not available until 2018. If the delivery slots of Air France-KLM go to United Airlines, Boeing could already deliver the 747 replacement in 2015 and 2016. If not, Boeing could deliver the airframe to United in 2017. United Airlines is seriously considering the purchase of 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, which should completely offset the possible deferral of deliveries by Air France-KLM. For United Airlines the Boeing 777-300ER is a bargain since Boeing is discounting the model and implementing performance upgrades as well. The drawback of the purchase of the Boeing 777-300ER is that United Airlines probably will cancel some of its orders for the Boeing 787-9. Due to the Boeing 787 being a popular aircraft Boeing has no delivery slots available until 2021-2022. This also can be seen in the order inflow during the last few years: Figure 2: Boeing annual orders 2004-2014 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The figure shows the accumulated orders (orange bars on the secondary axis) and the annual order inflow (blue line on the primary axis). It can be seen that during the last 4-5 years order inflow has been marginal, with the only exception being the year 2013. This is caused by the absence of early delivery slots. In 2014 Boeing booked 41 orders. Air Berlin (OTC: AIBEF ) canceled the order for 15 airframes amidst the challenging market and financial problems the airline is experiencing. With the cancellation of the 15 airframes, Air Berlin now has completely eliminated its initial order for 25 Dreamliners. Transaero canceled four orders for the Dreamliner as the airline focuses on bigger aircraft, but it is no secret that the Russian airline market is currently in a crisis while the Rouble has lost value. This reduces the need for new aircraft and makes it hard for Russian carriers to finance new aircraft. Lion Air was one of the carriers that was scheduled to take delivery of 5 overweight airframes known as the "Terrible Teens," but eventually canceled the order. Some of these airframes will now be delivered to Air Austral. In March 2015 Air France-KLM deferred the delivery of its first two Boeing 787-9 airframes. It is unclear how long these deliveries have been pushed back, but I do not expect the deferral to have a major impact on Boeing. In 2014 a total of 24 Dreamliner orders were canceled. But with orders from Air Austral (2), a yet unidentified customer (15) and Air Tahit Nui (4) these cancellation are almost completely offset. So although there are cancellations, there are always airlines in the row to take the delivery spots that are freed up. With the deferral of Air France-KLM's order for the Boeing 777-300ER a similar thing might happen. The unoccupied delivery slots might go to United Airlines, which subsequently will cancel or defer some orders for the Boeing 787-9. Boeing is already negotiating with Hainan Airlines, which is planning to order 30 Boeing 787-9s. The changed occupation of delivery slots has been shown in Table 1. So the table quite clearly shows that even the deferral of the 10 Boeing 777-300ERs is not a bad one since United Airlines might occupy those delivery slots which will free up 10 delivery slots for the Boeing 787-9. Those delivery slots will be occupied by Hainan Airlines, which will order a total of 30 airframes. So in the end Boeing is gaining 20 orders because it can offer early delivery slots for some of the airframes. All airlines involved seem to be benefiting from this. Additional conclusions that can be drawn: There are airlines lining up to take the delivery slots for every cancellation or deferral Most deferrals don't have anything to do with the airframe itself but with the exceptionally bad financial conditions some airlines are operating in Order inflow for the Boeing 787 has been lower due to an absence of early delivery slots Further hikes in production rate (excluding the ones already announced) should aid Boeing gaining more orders.
