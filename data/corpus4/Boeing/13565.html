Is The Stock Of The World's Largest Aircraft Manufacturer Overvalued? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Based on current P/E ratio Boeing shares are valued quite high. Based on PEG ratio shares seem to be undervalued. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares have risen almost 400% since the low in 2009. Year to date the stock climbed 16.7%. With order books at record highs and the stock trading near an all-time high as well, more and more people are wondering whether Boeing shares are overvalued. Based on high production rates and the Boeing 787 that should go cash positive soon, I think Boeing shares still have a lot of upward potential. In order to determine whether Boeing shares are overvalued (or not), I will use a few measures: One way to measure Boeing's stock performance is by looking at the rise of the stock price in a given time frame and compare it to other companies and indices. Figure 2 shows the rise of Boeing since January 2012 along with the rise of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ), the Dow Jones, SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA: XAR ), United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX ) and General Electric (NYSE: GE ). Boeing and Lockheed Martin are aerospace giants The XAR ETF is an Aerospace & Defense ETF United Technologies Corp. and General Electric are conglomerates that have a high affinity with the aerospace industry Figure 2: Boeing performance relative to industry and Dow Jones (Source: YCharts) What can be seen is that the conglomerates that have a high affinity with the aerospace industry are more or less following the Dow Jones, while the Aerospace industry rose twice as fast. Boeing rose 104.3%, while the XAR ETF trades 109.2% higher. Lockheed Martin is even trading 147.9% higher. So within the aerospace industry, Boeing is not showing a steeper rise than its industry peers. If there is something overvalued then it is the aerospace industry as a whole, but it should be taken into account that the aerospace and defense industry has been one of the last industries to profit from the economic recovery. Order books are filled and with a bright prospect the current and future outperformance that accelerated in 2013 seems justified to me. Additionally, it should be noted that Boeing, up until January 2015, was trading at a level just 75% higher than the Dow and only recently has been matching the performance of the XAR ETF. So Boeing has risen faster than the Dow Jones and is currently matching the rise of the XAR ETF, which climbed almost twice as fast as the Dow Jones Index. Taking into account the strong financial performance as well as the bright long-term outlook, I don't think that Boeing is trading at levels that are not justified by its financial performance or its growth prospect. Based on the price multiple (P/E ratio) it can be determined whether a stock is overvalued. Figure 3: P/E ratio development for Boeing and Lockheed Martin (Source: YCharts) As the figure shows, Boeing is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 20.31, compared to 18.06 for Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin shares rose sharper since 2012, but the lower P/E ratio indicates that the higher share prices for Lockheed Martin were more related to higher earnings than it is for Boeing. Currently, the Dow Jones has a trailing P/E ratio of 16.91 . If Boeing were to have the same P/E ratio as the Dow Jones, its fair value would be $125.30. However, each industry tends to have its own price multiple, which makes a comparison to the Dow Jones hard to justify. The Aerospace & Defense industry has a slightly higher P/E of 17.20. This figure shows a $127.45 'fair' value. This means that Boeing has been trading at fair value for the majority of 2014 and currently is trading 18.4% above its fair value. When adopting the rule of thumb that a P/E ratio between 17-25 indicates a high valued stock (unless the stock has a high growth potential), it can be said that Boeing is valued quite high. But it also has to be noted that Boeing has been trading at a P/E ratio of 17-18 in the second half of 2014 that is common for the aerospace industry and its P/E ratio increased after the January earnings report. Additionally, the P/E-ratio dropped from 23.75 in January 2014 to almost 20 in 2015, which is caused by lower stock prices but also by higher earnings. Figure 4: P/E ratio development versus EPS for Boeing (Source: YCharts) Figure 4 shows that the P/E ratio fell as earnings decreased as well. This indicates that lower earnings have an immediate effect on the stock price. Solely looking at the P/E ratio Boeing seems to be overvalued, but this high P/E-ratio has been caused by the earnings report in January in which Boeing was very positive about the future and its future growth. Boeing has a forward P/E of 17.84, which is more reasonable for an aerospace company and shows that investors have calculated in the bright prospect that Boeing sketched for its investors. One drawback is that the P/E-ratio does not take into account future growth, which somehow has to be calculated in the stock price as well. Since Boeing is a company that should be seeing some strong growth in the coming years, the PEG ratio might be a better measure. Figure 4: PEG ratio development versus EPS for Boeing (Source: YCharts) The PEG ratios are currently well below 1, indicating that the stock is undervalued. If the stock were to trade at fair value it would have a P/E ratio of 24-27.5. This P/E ratio seems high but incorporates future earnings growth. Doing some quick math the fair value according to the PEG ratio seems to be somewhere around $178, using the TTM ratio and $204.4 using forward PEG ratio. This means that currently (at the time of writing the stock is trading at $150.87) the stock has 18%-35% upward potential. The PEG-ratio supports the price target of $200 that Sterne Agee put on Boeing shares. Based on the forward P/E ratio Boeing is not overvalued Based on the PEG ratio the stock has 18%-35% upward potential With higher production rates in the coming years and the Boeing 787 that should go cash positive soon higher stock prices are justified. The only threat that Boeing stock is facing is if Boeing does not meet its target for the Boeing 787 to go cash positive, but Boeing is convinced the airframe will go cash positive soon.
