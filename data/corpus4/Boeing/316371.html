LMI Aerospace Stock Is Ready For Liftoff - LMI Aerospace, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMIA) | Seeking Alpha New management team is executing on business plan and turning the firm profitable again. New wins with Airbus for the A320 and A350. New wins and market share increases with Boeing for 737 Max and 787. "STRONG BUY" Investment Recommendation and Target Price of $13.00 The recommendation is based on new customers, new contracts, increased market share gains, higher productivity, lower operating costs, and increased synergies. Management believes the new wins and market share gains with Boeing, along with the recent new contracts with Airbus, will be a "game-changer". New customers also help diversify the business and allow LMIA to take advantage of growth in commercial aerospace. Due to the long lag in the aerospace cycle, the majority of the top line growth will not be recognized until 2017; however, 2016 will see a slight bump due to the increases in the Boeing 787, new Airbus wins, and a new customer announced on the Q3 earnings call. LMIA expects to use sizable future cash flows to reduce debt and, given the continued low rate environment, look to refinance existing debt at lower rates in the next few years. Synergies continue to occur after the merger of Valent in Q4 2012. Management is focused and making traction in growing shareholder value. LMI Aerospace is a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits & components, as well as provider of design engineering services to commercial, business and regional and defense aerospace markets. Its engineering services have touched every major aircraft designed for the past 10 years. In 2012, LMIA acquired TASS, Inc. which added aftermarket engineering capabilities, and Valent in Q4 2012, for its assembly and machining capabilities. The Valent acquisition was funded with debt. An earn-out limited LMIA's ability to fully synergize the two firms and resulted in a loss for 2013 and 2014. Ronald Saks retired in 2014 and led the way for a new CEO, management team, and several board members. The commercial aerospace industry is in a growth cycle and with a new strategy, additional customers, and new business wins along with greater marketshare, LMIA is poised to benefit. Saks, who once owned over 1,300,000 shares in 2014, has been diversifying his interests and selling LMIA shares. He owned roughly 270,000 shares as of December 31, 2015 per SEC form 4 . Over 20% of the firm is owned by insiders and owners who hold a 5% or greater position. LMIA has a relatively small amount of revenue derived from the 747 so the lower build rates recently announced by Boeing will have little effect on them. The aerospace industry is experiencing multi-year growth as global air traffic and is expected to grow between 5% - 7% annually for the foreseeable future. International Air Transport Association (IATA), projects 2016 to be a record year as passenger traffic is estimated to grow 7% and cargo to increase by 4%. The catalysts are fuel efficiency as well as an aging fleet with many aircraft being 30+ years old. Boeing estimates roughly 75% of the existing fleet will be replaced by 2034. New order breakdown is about 60% from growth and 40% from replacement. Air traffic in China increased 15% in 2015 while their GDP increased at a 7% growth rate. Boeing estimates the Chinese market is currently underserved by about 1,000 commercial aircraft. They also see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft over the next 20 years. Boeing and Airbus operate in a duopoly. Accorinding to Deliotte, commercial aircraft annual production is expected to incrrease by about 20% per year . Passenger travel increased 428% from 1981 to 2014E and air travel demand continues to increase. Airbus currently has a backlog for 5,535 A320 aircraft and 1,112 A330/A340/A350 aircraft. In 2015, they exceeded their target for achieving a new record of 635 aircraft deliveries. Total backlog sets a new record for the company at 6,787 aircraft valued at $996 billion. FactSet forecasts the aerospace industry to have sales growth of 2.2% in 2015 and 2.1% in 2016, with net margins improving from 7.5% in 2014 to 7.6% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016. Factset expects EPS to decline 0.7% in 2015 and then jump 11.8% in 2016. Fuel efficiency is one of the primary drivers for new aircraft orders . While the price of oil has fallen, the number of backorders for aircraft remains solid. The backlog for most commercial aircraft remains strong as LMIA management noted, commercial was up 8% year-over-year and corporate/regional was up 10% year-over-year. Demand on the Boeing 787 is very strong. Military was down 30% year-over-year; however, this does not represent a large portion of revenue for LMIA. Execution: Provide best in class execution on existing programs and support customer's planned build-rate expansions. Maintain position as trusted supplier of choice for value-added engineering services to Original Equipment Manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers. Organic Growth: LMIA announced in mid-2015 new contracts for the 737 MAX and higher build rates for the 787. They also signed a long-term supply agreement with Spirit Aerosystems and won supplier of the year in 2015. LMIA also secured new contracts with Airbus for the A350 and A320. Revenue from the A320 represents about $1 million annually but the "in" allows LMIA to gain certifications with Airbus and continue to increase business and market share. On the Q3 call, another new customer contract was announced representing about $5 million annual revenue and about $40 million total over the life of the contract. Restructuring: Plan to save about $16 million in expected and recurring cost savings. LMIA's management team continues to focus on core competencies and leverage best practices across company. Even though the engineering business has declined in revenue year-over-year since 2012, LMIA expects to save $3 million annually in 2016 from cost savings strategies and office closures. Management believes engineering revenues are at or near the low of their cycle and they have the ability to ramp this segment higher with short-notice when the opportunity presents itself. The new management team comprised of Dan Korte, CEO, and Cliff Stebe, CFO along with a changed board of directors has successfully executed their strategy thus far and the future looks strong. Deleverage: Focus on cash generation including working capital improvements, to pay down debt, deleverage the balance sheet, and reduce interest expense. New structural components on Gulfstream G500 and G600 New business with Airbus for A350 900XWB program o Permits LMIA to obtain additional certifications to compete for new business New business with Airbus for the A320 Revenue from the Boeing 737 can potentially double once the planned production rate increases. On Boeing's recent earnings call they stated firm orders for 4,400 737s and planned deliveries of 42-47 a month in 2017, 52 per month in 2018 , and 57 per month in 2019. This exceeds the number LMIA had forecast. Demand remains strong for the 787. New business with Airbus proves positive in many ways and opens the door for potentially substantial revenue increases. New customer wins, specifically the one recently announced on the Q3 call proves management is focused and executing their strategy to grow revenue and increase shareholder value. Boeing also confirmed planned production rate increases on the 787 to 12 a month in 2016 and 14 per month later in the decade as well as increases in the 767. The $13.00 price target implies a 14 multiple of forecasted EPS of $0.96 which is in line with the peer group multiples. While this presents a 32% upside from where the company is currently trading, is conservative considering a discounted cash flow analysis which would suggest a price target closer to $19.00. Taking the conservative approach, there is plenty of upside as the synergies are realized; top line grows as a result of new customers, higher build rates, and their cost of capital declines when debt is refinanced. The estimates used are toward the mid-point and could be conservative given the traction management has made thus far in 2015. LMI Aerospace is poised to return to profitability this year and have a strong year in 2016. Revenue will increase marginally due to the increased market share gains and production on the Boeing 787 and new customer wins. These will more than make up for the decreased production rates in the 747. Looking past 2016, growth looks stable and sustainable. LMIA can earn $4.00 a share looking out 5 years which represents a huge upside for investors. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
