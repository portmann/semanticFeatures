Strong Q2 Results For Boeing, But KC-46 Tanker Charge Weighs On Earnings - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha As anticipated Boeing posted a strong cash flow. As I expected earnings were strong, despite the charge on the tanker program. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) reported Q2 earnings before the opening bell on 22nd of July. The company booked strong results, despite the KC-46 Tanker charge weighing on earnings. It was the first presentation of results under lead of Dennis Muilenberg. Boeing has a history of beating analyst estimates and managed to top analyst estimates yet again. Boeing's history of topping the consensus can partly be attributed to the fact that the company's guidance is very conservative. Any other company probably would see shares tumbling on a light guidance, but this does not count for Boeing as investors and analysts already are aware of Boeing's history of giving a conservative guidance. Boeing's EPS came in quite strong, topping the estimate of $1.37 by $0.25 or 18.2%. I normally do not attach a lot of value to EPS as a measure of Boeing's success, but given the fact that the company was forced to acknowledge a charge on the KC-46 tanker and still managed to top estimates I do think the Q2 EPS shows Boeing's strength. Figure 2: Revenue Boeing Q2 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Whereas Boeing missed estimates on revenue during the first quarter it beat estimates by 1% in the second quarter. Boeing stocks headed higher pre-market as the company beat estimates, but beating estimates was not the only reason for the stock to head higher. Revenue increased by 11% on higher deliveries . Earnings were lower, reflecting the charge Boeing had to take on the KC-46 tanker program . The operating margin decreased by 2 pts. The operating cash flow came in strong with an 82% increase year-over-year, while the free cash flow almost doubled. Boeing taught its investors to pay more attention to the free cash flow and managed to deliver a satisfying cash flow in this quarter. Figure 3: Relative results Boeing Q2 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) One of the things that moves Boeing share prices up or down is the cash flow. Last quarter Boeing showed a very disappointing (free) cash flow, but back then I already noted that the fact that Boeing reaffirmed its guidance was a strong sign. Boeing aims for an operating cash flow in excess of $9 bn. Figure 4 shows the free cash flow and operating cash flow with the minimum average requirement to meet the annual target. Figure 3: Cash flow Boeing Q2 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) As can be seen in Figure 3 the cash flow increased significantly for the operating as well as the free cash flow. In order to meet the target of an operating cash flow in excess of $9 bn Boeing needs at least $2.8 bn in cash flow per quarter. Given the fact that Boeing mostly posts strong results and cash flow in the last quarter of the year, I expect that Boeing will be able to meet its cash flow target. Whereas Boeing reaffirmed its guidance in the Q1 presentation of financial results, it adjusted the full year guidance during the Q2 presentation to reflect strong performance and incorporate the impact of the charge on the tanker program. Boeing foresees a revenue of $94.5-$96.5 bn and still expects an operating cash flow in excess of $9 bn. The EPS updated guidance (GAAP: $7.70-$7.90 and non-GAAP: $7.60-$7.80) have been decreased by $0.50, while margins for the Commercial department are lowered by 0.5 pts and 0.25 pts for the Defense and Space unit. As expected quarter results were strong, despite the half billion dollars charge Boeing was forced to take. As I previously anticipated Boeing posted a strong cash flow. The Boeing 787 still has a dilutive impact on earnings. Boeing is still on track to meet its cash flow targets.
