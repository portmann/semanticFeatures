Boeing: The Order Battle In July - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing currently is leading on the cargo and wide body market. The order battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) is one of the ways for Boeing and Airbus to flex their muscles, next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite the fact that the orders (in terms of value) are in no way a reflection of financial performance it is important to have a look at the order inflow, since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount, comfort, slot availability and efficiency. In this article I will have a look at the order inflow during July and have a look at their role in the narrow and wide body market. In July Airbus and Boeing, together, hauled in 127 orders. Looking at the division of the orders Boeing can be marked as the clear winner. Boeing received 101 orders, while Airbus received 'just' 26 orders. Boeing's July orders clearly reflect its dominance in the cargo market . 51 out of the 101 orders that Boeing received were for cargo aircraft: FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) ordered 46 Boeing 767-300F aircraft The remaining 50 orders were placed by unidentified customers that ordered 50 Boeing 737-800s. So Boeing's July order book was split 50:50 between wide and narrow body aircraft. Airbus on the other hand received 26 orders: An undisclosed customer ordered 25 Airbus A321neo airframes. This customer could possibly be Asiana Airlines converting its Letter Of Intent into a firm order Parent company of Air Caraïbes ordered 1 Airbus A330 So whereas Boeing had an order inflow that was split equally between narrow and wide body aircraft, Airbus's order inflow is almost completely for narrow body airframes. That also means that in terms of value, Boeing ends up on top in July. In 2015 Boeing and Airbus are quite close when it comes to orders. Boeing received 426 orders, while Airbus secured 408 orders. After cancellations Boeing booked 380 orders, while Airbus follows closely with 367 orders. Helped by the FedEx order Boeing ended on top in July Boeing's dominance on the cargo market clearly becomes visible in July's order book In July Boeing has been leading on the wide body market, which is more profitable than the narrow body market. Year-to-date Boeing has slightly more orders and achieved a book-to-bill ratio of .87 Year-to-date Airbus achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. Reason for the better book-to-bill is the fact that Airbus has lower production rates and therefore needs less orders to receive a book-to-bill of 1. Airbus and Boeing both are nice investments, but Boeing's lead on the cargo and wide body market means that the jet maker is leading on the market that potentially is more profitable on a per unit basis. On the other hand Airbus received orders for the Airbus A321neo, which adds to the already robust order book for the narrow body next generation family and simultaneously demonstrates demand for an aircraft with range and payload capability similar to the Airbus A321 and Boeing 757. So far Boeing is lacking an answer to the A321neo. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
