A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In November - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing booked 89 orders, a 16% increase. Boeing deliveries exceeded expectations and compensated for a weak October month. As part of my monthly look at orders and deliveries for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) and a comparison between both monthly order books, in this article I will deal with the commercial orders and deliveries in November. Figure 1: Boeing orders (up until) November 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In October, Boeing booked 59 orders, with 32 orders for its single-aisle product and 27 orders for a wide-body aircraft. In November Boeing booked 89 orders. The orders were a healthy balance between wide- and narrow-body aircraft. At list prices, the orders are valued at $14.6 bn, but after discounts the orders have a market value of $7.4 bn: Probably most striking on Boeing's order overview is the order for 2 Boeing 747-8Fs by AirBridgeCargo Airlines. Despite these orders being listed as orders, it does not help Boeing that much as these aircraft are white tails. EVA Air ordered 18 Boeing 787-10 aircraft and 2 Boeing 777-300ERs with a market value of $3.3 bn Korean Air finalized an order for 2 Boeing 777-3000Ers and 30 Boeing 737MAX aircraft with a market value of $1.9 bn. BOC Aviation purchased 22 Boeing 737 aircraft, equally split between Next Generation and MAX aircraft Unidentified customers bought 13 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) November 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Boeing's delivery of 71 airframes was above expectations. Deliveries were a mix of narrow-body aircraft (60%) and wide-body aircraft (40%). The estimated market value of the deliveries is $6.0bn. Boeing delivered 9 airframes more than expected Deliveries for the Boeing 777 fell short of expectations by 1 unit Deliveries for the Boeing 787 exceeded expectations by 2 units Deliveries for the Boeing 737 exceeded expectations by 1 units So as expected Boeing compensated for lower deliveries in October and I expect the plane maker to have a strong December delivery volume as well. In November, Boeing booked 89 orders and delivered 71 units, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. For the full year, this ratio is .92 (excluding order cancellations). Boeing's full-year target is to receive 1 order for each delivery. So Boeing still has to add some orders to the order book to achieve its desired book-to-bill ratio. Orders climbed 16% compared to last month With 71 deliveries in November, the number of deliveries exceeded expectations. I expect Boeing to beat its full year delivery target of 755 units Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
