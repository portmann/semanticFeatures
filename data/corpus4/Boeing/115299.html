Spirit AeroSystems: A Buyout In The Making - Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) | Seeking Alpha And one that's heavily reliant on Boeing. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE: SPR ) is a roughly $8bn market cap aircraft parts maker. It's generating about $6.8 billion in annual revenue and only has a couple million dollars in net debt, having transitioned into a cash flow generating machine. The key for the company is that it's a key supplier of aerostructures to both Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus. Aerostructures include propulsion systems, fuselages and wing systems. Spirit makes every aerostructure for each Boeing commercial aircraft in production. It's heavily tied to Boeing, which is good and bad. Specifically, the company's top line is somewhat limited, but it's done a lot with costs over the years to boost cash flow. The biggest catalyst from an event driven standpoint is that Boeing could easily roll up Spirit AeroSystems. Spirit supplies Boeing and Airbus via long-term contracts - roughly 83% of revenues are from Boeing and 10% from Airbus. 97% of the products that Spirit makes for Boeing and Airbus are sole-source, making it very critical player - namely for Boeing. Spirit has been doing some divesting of late, in terms of dumping underperforming sites and factories. It's positioned itself nicely to have Boeing make a run at buying it. The current Boeing-Spirit relationship dates back over 75 years, to a time when Spirit was a division of Boeing. Now, the Airbus partnership came about when Spirit bought BAE. Since then it's been winning more business from Airbus (( OTCPK:EADSY ), ( OTCPK:EADSF )). Note that current CEO, Larry Lawson, took over in 2013 and has been shaking things up, including the selloff of underperforming and non-core assembly operations and plants. Spirit is now a leader in terms of volume production, thanks in large part to Lawson, where operating margins are up from 1.7% in 2012 to 5.8% over the trailing twelve months. Interim margin improvement should continue, given the divestment of its Gulfstream business last year. All this means more cash flow, where the company could do $600 million to $700 million in cash generation this year - a cool 7.5% to 9% free cash flow yield. There's a long runway in terms of revenue generation too, with a $46 billion backlog - equal to 7 times sales. In the meantime, Spirit should continue to succeed with Boeing's strong performance, including the success we're already seeing with the 787 and the orders being placed for that aircraft. The 787 is the twin aisle aircraft and Spirit already has a contract win that makes it the largest aerostructures content supplier for the 787. Scopia Capital Management is kingmaker here, owning 16% of the company and having over a quarter of its portfolio invested in Spirit . Hound Partners and Darsana Capital also have Spirit as a high conviction pick, with over 10% of their portfolios invested in the stock, owning 7.2% and 3%, respectively. Notable other hedge fund owners include Falcon Edge Capital, Findlay Park Partners, Eton Park Capital, Aravt Global, Greenlight Capital, TPG Axon, SAB Capital, Snow Capital, Newtyn Management and Lakewood Capital. All told - the funds above own over 40% of Spirit Aerosystems. Spirit has a solid flow of work, but the issue is that returns on capital are somewhat capped given the limited pricing power and customer concentration. And while new aircraft and orders are a positive, at some point the volume discounts built into its contracts will start to work against it. And given the divestitures and margin improvements by Spirit, it seems likely for Boeing that bringing a major producer of components for its jets in-house would be a big positive for its margins. Spirit already gets most of its revenues from Boeing and finding a buyer for its Airbus shouldn't be hard. In the worst case, there's still lower margin programs that could be dumped and its development-level programs can be further scaled back. Along with that, capital deployment should be a focus for Spirit in the interim, including buybacks and dividends, where given the visibility into its business and balance sheet, there's a large deployable opportunity for shareholder returns at Spirit Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
