ETF Hub Jun 12 2015, 16:38 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) chief salesman says the company believes there is sufficient demand for a medium-range jet that is not currently served by its product portfolio. John Wojick, VP of global sales, tells Dow Jones that airlines have expressed interest to Boeing in a jet that could seat ~250 passengers and fly medium-range routes (typically  5-9 hours) - bigger than its single-aisle  737 but smaller than its new long-range 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has not made a final decision to proceed, and any new jet would not be flying with passengers until the next decade, but its determination that such a product has sufficient demand is seen as a critical first step toward what could be its first all-new model since the 787.
