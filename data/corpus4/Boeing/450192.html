Boeing 777-10X: The Jumbo Killer - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing 777-10X will, as expected, compete with the A380 on the lower end of the 400-500 seat market. Boeing 777-10X will be the final nail in the coffin of the Boeing 747-8I. Sources state Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has been proposing a possible Boeing 777-10X jet to their customers. In this article, I will have a look at how this will affect the competitive playing field and how this places the Boeing 777X in the market. Just like the Boeing 777X family, the Boeing 777-10X is a push towards bigger aircraft but not too big. The Boeing 777-10X jet would turn the 2-member Boeing 777X family into a 3-member family, which could potentially make all members of the 777X family more attractive for airlines. Table 1: Seating and range for the Boeing 777X The Boeing 777-10X would have 25 seats (4 rows) more than the Boeing 777-9, which has 50 seats more than the -8. The range of the Boeing 777-10X is still unknown and probably one of the main subjects of discussions with airlines. The range requirement is one of the most important factors that could determine the success of the airplane. Assuming that the propulsion system and the wing planform stay the same, an educated guess for the range is 7000 nm - 7200 nm. AeroAnalysis expects that customers will require the airframe to have a range of 7500 nm, hence more fuel tanks, bigger engines or a bigger planform might be required. On paper, the Boeing 777-10X does not have any competitors. The Boeing 777-10X is seen by many as a direct competitive threat to the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A380. The Airbus A380 can seat up to 544 passengers with a range capability of 8200 nm. Those are the pretty figures on paper. However, there are a lot of Airbus A380s flying around with less than 500 seats. The Boeing 777-10X could effectively compete with the Airbus A380 and even beat the airframe in terms of cost efficiency. What needs to be said is that the Airbus A380 will be superior in the 500+ seat market, but this market is a small one and likely unprofitable for any player that wants to be active in this niche. Also for airlines, the 500+ seat segment is a risky one. The Airbus A380 has high capital costs and has shown to be hard to fill, making it very cost inefficient to operate. On the other hand, the Airbus A380 offers a standard of luxury that even a Boeing 777-10X cannot offer. So the Boeing 777-10X will target the lower bracket of the Airbus A380 market, which cannot be operated with profits. Although the Boeing 777-10X can compete with the Airbus A380, I think Boeing will provide the ultimate blow to their very own Boeing 747-8I when they launch the Boeing 777-10X. The Boeing 777-9 can be operated in 3-class configuration with approximately 357 seats, while the Boeing 747-8I has 8 more revenue generating seats. The Boeing 777-10X would have around 378-405 seats in 3-class configuration - thirteen more than the Boeing 747-8I. This means that the Boeing 747-8I will be squeezed by the -9 and the -10X. I think one of the most important conclusions that can be drawn is that the Boeing 777-10X would serve 2 purposes: Compete with Airbus A380 on the lower end of the 400-500 seat market. Replace the Boeing 747-8I. With the Boeing 777-9, Boeing already has a replacement for the Boeing 747-8I but it could be lacking some space to put some luxury in place. With the Boeing 777-10X, Boeing can either offer that extra space to add luxury and comfort or offer higher revenue potential by adding additional seats. An important thing to note is that the seat delta (difference in number of seats) between a Boeing 777-10X and Airbus A380 in 3-class configuration is substantial. There are only a few airlines that operate the Airbus A380 with approximately 405 seats. Over the past few days I have read and heard many people stating that the Boeing 777-10X is a hypothetical aircraft for an unsuccessful market segment. I think the Boeing 777-10X does make sense in some way, but will not be able to beat the Airbus A380 in terms of luxury. The Boeing 777-10X would be geared towards the requirements set by the Gulf carriers; carriers that currently are operating the Airbus A380, even on the unsuccessful routes. The reason for the market segment being 'unsuccessful' is because the Airbus A380 in fact is too big to operate with less than 450 seats. So far airlines have been serving this segment with an oversized airplane. The Boeing 777-10X seems to be a better fit for the job and Boeing already knows who will be buying it. It will take a while before the Boeing 777-10X will be launched, but what bodes well is that the Boeing 777X is a development that is supported by customer feedback, whereas the Airbus A380 was a prestige project that did and still does not center on customer feedback. In the end, the Boeing 777-10X could be the nail in the coffin of superjumbos in general, not only the Boeing 747-8I or Airbus A380. Airbus at this point does not have a suitable answer, which gives Boeing an advantage.
