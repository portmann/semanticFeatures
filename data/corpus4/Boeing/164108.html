A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In August - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Dreamliner deliveries are exceeding expectations. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has updated its orders and deliveries overview up to and including August. In this article, I will have a look at how the order inflow and deliveries affect Boeing's target and performance. Figure 1: Boeing orders (up until) August 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) During August, Boeing received a total of 52 orders: 1 for its wide-body Boeing 767F, 38 for the Boeing 737 MAX 8, and 13 for the Boeing 737-800A. The catalogue value of the orders is $6.6bn, but the estimated market value is probably around $3.7bn. Up until August, the jet maker has received 478 orders: The Boeing 767 order inflow is boosted by the FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) order. The 54 orders for the Boeing 777 show a healthy demand for Boeing's current 777 (including the freighter model) and the upcoming 777X. The Boeing 787 orders are looking good as well, considering that Russian Aeroflot canceled the 22 Dreamliners it had on order. Boeing had to scratch 58 orders from its order book, resulting in 420 net orders for the year. The number of orders grew by 12%. Growth was not as robust as in the previous 2 months, but it has to be noted that in June a lot of orders were finalized during the Paris Air Show, and in July, orders that were previously announced during the show were finalized as well. In the same period last year, Boeing booked 984 orders. So currently, order inflow is much lower than last year but are meeting expectations. In its overview until the 1st of September, Boeing already included a deal for 27 Boeing 737 that was announced on the 3rd of September. Boeing probably included this deal in the overview because it breaks some psychological barriers: While the number of orders tells something about the attractiveness of the product a manufacturer offers and the long-term prospect for the manufacturer, for short-term investors deliveries are more interesting to look at. Since most of the money comes in after delivering an airframe, it is important to meet the targeted number of deliveries in order to achieve the cash flow communicated to investors. Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) August 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Boeing's deliveries were in line with expectations. Deliveries were a healthy mix of narrow-body aircraft (60%) and wide-body aircraft (40%). The estimated market value of the deliveries is $5.2bn. Orders for the 737 were slightly lower than the expected 42 deliveries. The lower 737 deliveries were partly offset by the higher Dreamliner deliveries. Boeing's target for the year is 100 deliveries, but 8 months into 2015, the jet maker already delivered 90 Dreamliners. The deliveries also exceed the production rate of 10 aircraft per month. By year-end, Boeing could deliver as much as 115-120 Dreamliners. Increasing deliveries/production is one of the requirements to reach cash positive on the Dreamliner production, so the higher deliveries do bode well for reaching cash positive on the Dreamliner production. Boeing delivered 2 747 airframes. The 747 remains a program with more downs than ups; the jet maker saw ANA canceling an order for 4 Freighters, while Korean Air became the first airline to operate the Boeing 747-8I and the Boeing 747-8F. The Boeing 777 deliveries were in line with expectations. Boeing has set a delivery target of 750-755, which means that Boeing is on track to meet its delivery target. Key to meeting the target are high delivery volumes on the Boeing 737, Boeing 787 and Boeing 777 in the coming months. One of the targets Boeing has set for itself is a book-to-bill ratio of 1 for the full year. This means that Boeing aims to receive 1 order for each Boeing it delivers to customers. In August, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio was .84, which is in line with Boeing's orders and deliveries up until August. To reach the desired book-to-bill ratio of 1, Boeing needs more than 300 orders. Looking at the order inflow year-to-date, I think that Boeing will end the year with a book to bill ratio of .9-.95. Order inflow in August was in line with Boeing's book-to-bill ratio. Lower 737 deliveries were offset by higher Dreamliner deliveries. Boeing probably will exceed its delivery target for the Dreamliner. For the full year, I don't see Boeing hitting its desired book-to-bill ratio. Disclosure: I am/we are long BA. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
