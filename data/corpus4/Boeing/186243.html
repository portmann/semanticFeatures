Hexcel Corp., The Investment That Can Replace Precision Castparts In Your Portfolio - Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) | Seeking Alpha I like investing in companies that supply essential parts to airplane manufacturers. Hexcel's products are enjoying a secular increase in use. Precision Castparts Corporation (NYSE: PCP ) was one of my favorite companies, and just as shares were really starting to get cheap, Warren Buffett had to spoil the party. The stock seems like an unusual pick for a man who built a career buying companies that are easy to understand. But you don't need calculus to recognize the attractive economics of PCP. First off, a passionate CEO who has a reputation for aggressive cost cutting runs the company. They also have an attractive position in the value chain of aircraft manufacturing. Aircraft manufacturing is a bit like car manufacturing; being the final producer is a tough business, characterized by low margins. Boeing (NYSE: BA ), for example, has an operating margin of just 8%. That's better than Ford (NYSE: F ), which ekes out 3.7% operating margins. Usually, the most profitable companies in the car business supply essential inputs to the final manufacturer. The same is true in the airplane business. PCP, which supplied highly engineered components to airplane manufacturers, had operating margins of 25%. But the appeal isn't limited to high margins. The company operates with high barriers to entry. Since safety is paramount, airline manufacturers need to trust their suppliers; nobody is building airplanes with parts supplied by any old schmuck. Because relationships are long term, manufacturers are unlikely to switch suppliers once one is picked. Another benefit is that demand is set by regular maintenance schedules-creating a steady order flow. For these reasons, the airline parts business is one of my favorite industries to invest in. With PCP going private, are there any similar opportunities available today? One of the best I've found is a company named Hexcel Corporation (NYSE: HXL ). Hexcel is a manufacturer of highly engineered structural material that is used to build military and commercial aircraft, wind turbine blades, and some consumer goods such as skis and snowboards. It is one of the world's largest producers of carbon fiber and composite materials. According to the company, Hexcel materials are used on virtually every commercial and military aircraft produced in the western world. Their materials are also used to build satellites and satellite launch vehicles, high-speed trains and ferries, cars, trucks, tennis rackets, and golf clubs. Anytime a combination of strength and lightness is needed, Hexcel materials could be used. Notable planes that use Hexcel materials include the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 XWB. The A350 XWB in particular is a heavy user of carbon fiber materials. By weight, 50% of the plane is composite material, and this contributes to the aircraft's high performance, lightweight, and fuel efficiency. Hexcel's material sales for the A350 XWB and Boeing 787 increased more than 35% in 2014 compared to 2013. Both aircraft have a deep order pipeline, which will creates steady future business. (A350 XWBs pictured below ). Hexcel's materials are designed to last the entire life of the aircraft, so maintenance is not an important driver of growth. Instead, growth is driven by the replacement rate of old planes. The replacement rate is less tied to the general economy than you may think. The retirement rate of civilian aircraft is determined, in part, by regulatory agencies. It is also influenced by the desire of airlines to improve fuel efficiency and payload capability. Below is a chart showing the general uptrend of annual deliveries of aircraft by Boeing and Airbus. Currently, the combined backlog of orders at Boeing and Airbus is 12,175 planes-the largest backlog in history. Every generation of aircraft, especially military aircraft, uses more composite material than the previous, replacing heavy metals. Aircraft began using a meaningful amount of advance composites in the 1980's. Then, the Boeing 767 entered into service with 6% composite materials. One of Boeing's newest aircraft, the B787, entered into service in 2011 with over 50% composite materials by weight. Hexcel refers to the expansion of the use of composite materials as the "secular expansion of composites". Since composite materials reduce weight, increase performance, and boost fuel efficiency, the secular expansion of composites should continue well into the future. Financial Results and Expansion Plans Hexcel is nothing if not steady. Sales and operating income have grown every year since 2009, as the graphic taken from their latest annual report shows. One note about sales-they are very concentrated with two customers. In 2014, 32% and 31% of sales were to Boeing and Airbus respectively. In 2014, net income rose 13% while adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. They spent $160 million to repurchase 3.9 billion shares, and initiated a $0.10 quarterly dividend. Hexcel has fairly large capital expenditures, but they are investing to expand production to meet bustling demand. From 2007 to today, they tripled their fiber carbon production capacity. They plan to double it again by 2020. In 2014, they invested $260 million in expanding capacity. HXL currently trades at an 18.5 P/E multiple, hardly a demanding valuation. Business is steady; net income, sales and operating income are growing and are underpinned by organic growth. I consider the company a buy since its products are enjoying a secular increase in use, and because it trades at a fair valuation. Plus, the current backlog at Airbus and Boeing is the largest ever-equal to over 12,000 aircraft or nine years of manufacturing based on 2014 deliveries.
