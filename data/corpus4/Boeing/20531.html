Boeing: 5% Performance Shortfall Puts 737 MAX In A Difficult Position (Part 1) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha CFM LEAP engines cope with significant shortfalls. CFM LEAP-1B engine might need 2-3 PIPs to address the shortfall. Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) both are bringing their new narrow body airframe to the market in the coming years. Both airframes (as well as Comac's C919) are powered by CFM LEAP engines. The CFM LEAP-1A is powering the Airbus A320neo, while the Boeing 737 MAX is being powered by the CFM LEAP-1B turbofan. Both turbofans should reduce fuel burn by 15% compared to the current upgraded CFM engines. Recent tests, however, have shown that both engines are missing their target for fuel consumption. The LEAP-1A has a performance shortfall of 2%, while the LEAP-1B has a performance shortfall of 5%. The shortfall of the LEAP-1A, which should enter service in October 2015, can be addressed by a performance improvement package (NYSEMKT: PIP ). The LEAP-1B, which is scheduled to enter service in 2017, has a shortfall that might take 2 or 3 PIPs to bring the performance close to the spec. The 5% shortfall shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with some components of the engine, which are performing far below expectations. Whereas the LEAP-1A needs some tweaks, the LEAP-1B needs a bit more work. In this article, I look at the implications of the performance shortfall for the Boeing MAX aircraft. In a forthcoming part two, I will have a look at the implications of the performance shortfall for the Airbus aircraft and look at how the Boeing and Airbus airframes compare to each other. Figure 1: Comparison narrow body airframe efficiencies Boeing ( boeing.com ) The Boeing 737 MAX 8 will be 17% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A320. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 will be 12% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Boeing 737-800. The Airbus A320neo will be 12% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A320. The Boeing 737 MAX8 will be 6% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A320neo. Since Boeing and Airbus have their own way in comparing (and skewing numbers) to yield good results for their airframes, I will not use any of the numbers provided by them. Figure 2: Impact Boeing 737 MAX 8 on efficiencies compared to the Boeing 737-800 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) In my analysis I compared the Boeing 737 MAX 8 with the Boeing 737-800 with CFM 56-7B27 engines, which are 1% less efficient than the CFM 56-7BE. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 weighs 6% more, but benefits from a higher aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency. Additionally in typical 2-class configuration the MAX 8 can carry 2 passengers more. For a 500 nautical mile trip Boeing seems to be claiming 12% better efficiency compared to the current Boeing 737. My analysis only shows an 8.6% advantage per seat and this does not take into account the 4%-5% shortfall that the CFM LEAP-1B is coping with now. Figure 3: Impact on fuel efficiency compared to the Boeing 737-800 over a wider range (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The analysis above shows that even when the CFM LEAP-1B engines are meeting the specifications Boeing is not able to provide the 12% advantage in fuel efficiency over the Boeing 737-800. Now that the shortfall became apparent it is worth looking what the consequences of the shortfall are on the fuel burn figures. Figure 4: Impact on fuel efficiency (including shortfall) compared to the Boeing 737-800 over a wider range (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 4 shows that the fuel burn per seat shift upwards a bit. It is not a lot, but it puts Boeing in a very difficult spot. Instead of being 12% (as claimed) more efficient per seat, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 now only is 6.5% more efficient. This means that the Airbus A320neo will be more of a threat than Boeing would like to admit. Shortfalls on power plants seem to be nothing new. The Boeing 787 engines received 2 performance improvement packages and its engines are still running below specification. The CFM LEAP-1B engine is coping with a 5% shortfall. With each PIP addressing 2% of the shortfall, it will take 2-3 PIPs (or 1 major redesign) that have to be rolled out. CFM has 2 years to address the shortfall, since it was guaranteed that the engine would meet its specifications. If the turbofans miss specification on service entry it will probably costs CFM and Boeing money. Even when turbofans are running 'on spec' the fuel burn per seat reduction is not as big as specified. The 5% shortfall means that the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is only 6.5% more efficient, whereas Boeing claimed 12% higher efficiency. A 5% shortfall is quite difficult to address 2 years before service entry. Addressing a 5% shortfall in 2 years is quite a challenge and although I am convinced Boeing and CFM have some strong engineering skill and power I do not think they will be able have the engine running as specified within 2 years. In Part 2 I will address the shortfall on the CFM LEAP-1A engines used on the Airbus A320neo and see how both airframes compare to each other with shortfalls.
