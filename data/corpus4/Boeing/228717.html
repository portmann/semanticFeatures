Boeing: Even With A Strong Q3, Growth Could Remain In Limbo For A While - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing Company (BA) produced an impressive Q3 with EPS growing by 33 percent. While the company showed impressive wide-body sales for 2014, sales of narrow-body aircraft are lacking. Additionally, the A320neo and A350 models from Airbus may pose a competitive threat in catering to the long-haul sector. In my opinion, an investor would do well to wait for Q4 results before deciding on whether or not to initiate a position in Boeing. With strong financials and an impressive Q3 performance, Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) will continue to remain a solid company for investors going forward. Specifically, while I expect that while the company will continue to generate positive earnings and cash flow, uncertainty in the airline industry means that it could be a while before the market takes notice of the same. In the past year, we see that Boeing is up by 11 percent, compared to a cumulative 40 percent in the last two years: In this article, I use a SWOT analysis to compare both Boeing and Airbus and demonstrate that while Boeing possesses significant strengths and opportunities in the airline industry, concurrent weaknesses and threats make future performance somewhat uncertain and for this reason we may not see much in the way of share price growth for some time. Boeing takes the lead in sales of higher-priced wide-body planes. Specifically, between Boeing and Airbus, Boeing accounted for 63 percent of widebody deliveries in 2014. Given that wide-body planes have significantly higher margins, the total dollar value of net sales for Boeing at $233 billion was about 40 percent higher than that of Airbus at $175 billion. Moreover, sales of the Boeing 787 were far higher than expected at 114 in 2014, which even exceeded the 108 A330s delivered by Airbus. Should Boeing continue to dominate the wide-body market, then this means great news for profit margins going forward. Sales of narrow-size aircraft have been comparatively low when compared to Airbus. While Boeing has been successful in bolstering sales of wide-body planes, sales of smaller planes remain poor when compared to Airbus. For instance, sales for the 737 MAX 9 were 286 while Airbus sold 755 of the A321 model. In this context, Airbus could well compensate for margins by bolstering sales volumes of short-haul aircraft models. Moreover, there is speculation that Airbus could deploy the A321neo model on a range of long-haul flights which would give Airbus a first-mover advantage into the long-haul narrowbody market. Should this become increasingly popular, it may become too late for Boeing to compete effectively. The air cargo segment provides significant opportunity to bolster sales of the 747-8 model. Weak demand from the cargo market means that Boeing has decreased production of the 747-8 model down to 1.3 per month, down from 2 per month in 2013. However, in June the plane maker got a boost in 747-8 sales through a deal with Russian operator Volga-Dnepr to supply 20 aircraft to its cargo division. Boeing forecasts that world air cargo traffic will grow by an average of 4.7 percent year-on-year over the next twenty years, with 80 percent of long-haul cargo traffic routes flowing on east-west trade lanes. In this context, the 747-8 is an ideal candidate for such purposes and indeed the 747-8 has proven significantly more popular as a cargo rather than a passenger plane. Demand for smaller-size aircraft across short-haul Asian routes along with introduction of the A350. Given the increasing popularity of short-haul routes across Asia, the Boeing 737 has struggled to maintain competitiveness in this area. For instance, while Malaysian low-cost airline AirAsia previously used to operate the Boeing 737-300, the airline has since converted all its fleets to the Airbus A320-200. Moreover, China Eastern is currently the largest operator of the A320 aircraft, and placed an order worth $6.4 billion for A320 Neo aircraft in 2014. Moreover, the A350 threatens the dominance of wide-body jets such as the Boeing 777 and 787 on a wide range of long-haul routes, and this could be particularly true in Asia with major carriers such as Singapore Airlines and China Eastern having made significant orders for the model. With Boeing reporting a 33 percent increase in EPS for Q3, the company clearly has been performing well and much of this is due to gains in profit margins from wide-body airline sales. However, we have also seen that price has not moved significantly in response and on the basis of P/E ratios (17.5x for BA versus 18.5x for the aerospace industry), the company seems to be fairly valued. Is it advisable to jump in at the current price? It could be, but given that Boeing has seen lower sales in narrow-body aircraft compared to Airbus, in conjunction with a potential threat from the A350 model and low demand in the air cargo market, there is a risk that Boeing could face some short-term headwinds and the stock may be "dead money" for another couple of quarters. In my opinion, Q4 earnings will be a significant telling point as to whether Boeing can remain competitive through sales of wide-body fleets, and if this were the case then I believe this would mark a suitable entry point.
