Boeing Is A Long-Term Buy - Cramer's Lightning Round (5/28/15) | Seeking Alpha Talen Energy spin-off from PPL is not interesting. Under Armour (NYSE: UA ): "I think everyone is worried because it has stalled. It is shaking out of the weak hands and then it is going to have another move. That's the way it trades and we have got to get used to it. It may not rally instantly; it waits for the next quarter." Cellectis (NASDAQ: CLLS ): "That stock is going crazy because of the rumors that Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) is about to buy it. I don't want to comment on the rumors, but I do know that it does have a good chart. And by the way, that biotech group remains the hottest in the world." Boeing (NYSE: BA ): "Boeing is trading with the airlines, and that means the stock is going a little bit lower. Let's take a long-term view; McNerney's got it under control. I would not sell that stock." Opko Health (NYSE: OPK ): "I am a believer in Phil Frost and I am a believer that no one ever got hurt taking a profit. When you are up that much I need you to take out your cost. Take out the house's money and let the rest run. Phil Frost is a genius, we had him on the show and he's been right and we've been right."
