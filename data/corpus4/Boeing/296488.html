United to buy 40 Boeing jets in blow to Bombardier CSeries | Reuters A passenger looks at a United Airlines airplane, painted with its new corporate logo, at a gate at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey February 7, 2011. . United Airlines said on Thursday it will buy 40 small planes from Boeing Co worth $3.2 billion at list prices in a blow to Bombardier Inc, which has sought a major customer such as United to give momentum to its fledgling CSeries jets. United, the second largest U.S. airline by capacity, said in a news release that the Boeing 737-700 aircraft will enter its fleet beginning in mid-2017. The deal appeared to be a loss for Brazil's Embraer SA and Canada's Bombardier, which has looked for a headline-grabbing win from a top airline as its flagship CSeries jet prepares to enter service after years of delays and cash problems. Industry sources say United likely paid well below half the $80.6 million catalog price per plane, which is being phased out in favor of a newer model. Reuters reported last week that Boeing appeared well-placed to snatch at least part of a deal for small jets from United. The order comes as Chicago-based United cuts in half by 2019 the number of 50-seat planes that it contracts regional airlines to fly under its United Express brand. The 737-700s can seat 126 people and will be flown by Unitedâ€™s own pilots, reducing the company's reliance on contractors as a shortage of regional pilots looms in the United States. The new single-aisle planes also burn less fuel per passenger and have space for multiple cabin classes, giving United the chance to up-sell customers. "Our customers have a preference for an improved travel experience, including first class seats, Economy Plus, and Wi-Fi," United's Acting Chief Financial Officer Gerry Laderman said in the news release. "These aircraft are an efficient way to meet those needs while reducing 50-seat flying."
