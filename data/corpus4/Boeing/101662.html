Boeing Shares Are A Solid Buying Opportunity - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Gross profit of the company in the first quarter of 2015 was reported at $3.653 billion. Boeing share price looks undervalued on the absolute basis. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is one of the most famous US companies, producer of aircrafts, rockets and satellites for both civilian and military use. Based on 2013 revenues it was the second largest defense contractor and the biggest US exporter. Founded in 1910 it was one of the pioneers in the industry, the company's centennial operation has made it one of the most successful US companies. Recent higher demand of commercial aircrafts has increased Boeing's profits, 26% in 2013. Gross profit of the company in the first quarter of 2015 was $ 3.653 billion. The growth of passenger traffic and decrease in the price of oil has made the aviation industry very attractive in 2014 and it was a very successful year and the trends will likely continue in 2015. Only in 2014 over 1,490 jet airplanes were delivered, and airlines ordered approximately 3,680 new airplanes. Boeing is forecasting a need for 38,050 airplanes valued at more than $5.6 trillion in the next 20 years. Bearing in mind that Boeing is also operating in military and space industries, the company has a bright future. On June 22, 2015 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of ninety-one ($0.91) cents per share. To understand Boeing's prospects as a long-term investment, we take a step back and estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on their ability to generate cash flows. To complement the analysis, we will also asses the relative richness/cheapness of Boeing's ordinary stock compared to their peers. Our valuation model for Boeing is based on the company's ability to generate cash. The key measure of cash flows that we use is Free cash flow, which is the total cash inflow from operations minus the dividends and capital expenditure outlays. This is effectively the amount of "excess" cash that the company is making and therefore accruing to its lenders and shareholders. While we do look at historic cash flows, cash flows projections are of crucial importance because markets are forward looking. We start with the analyst consensus Free Cash Flow projections. For our own projection, we assume that the analyst consensus is correct for the next 5 fiscal years. After that, we assume that the growth rate of cash flows falls back to its previous trend and remains on it for the next 5 years, after which it normalizes towards the sustainable rate of 3.95% per annum, based on the average real GDP growth over the last 15 years and the average inflation rate of 2%. The chart below shows the historic (blue line) and projected free cash flows (red line). To calculate the total value of the firm, we discount the projected cash flows and the company's terminal value by its weighted average cost of capital ( OTC:WACC ). Our estimate of Boeing's cost of debt is 4.71%, based on their interest expense and amount of debt outstanding in the last fiscal year. The cost of equity is calculated using the 10 year treasury yield as the "risk-free" proxy plus the implied equity risk premium of 8.11% times the historic beta of 1.0026 for the stock. Some of the other key metrics summarized below: â€¢Fair Price = $261.11 (82.6% return) After discounting the projected Free Cash Flows and the company's terminal value in 10 years' time, we subtract the current value of debt and arrive at the total equity value of 180,564,392, which equates to $261.11 per share. With today's share price at $143, re-pricing towards the estimated fair value would require a return of 82.6%. The green line in the below chart represents the estimated "fair value" per share, with the dashed lines showing the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval based on stock's volatility.

The table below can help us understand Boeing's valuation in relative terms. Boeing is reasonably priced on Price to Earnings, which is currently below the industry median 19.40, and on Price to Cash, which is slightly above it. Historical Earnings per Share Growth over the last five years for this company was as high as 31.61%. Even though Boeing has a very high Price to Book of 11.66, it looks justified by its Return of Equity of 72.27%, implying fair valuation on relative basis. Boeing is a company with long and steady tradition operating in a highly lucrative industry. It is well positioned in the market and nothing seems to disrupt this in the near future. With general trends in the aviation industry and industries that are directly connected to it, it seems that Boeing is a secure buying opportunity. Its share price is quite undervalued based on consensus cash flow projections, thus offering high prospective returns to potential investors in this stock.
