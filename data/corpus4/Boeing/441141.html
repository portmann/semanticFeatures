null Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) will push back the delivery of 67 Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX 8 aircraft by up to six years, delaying $1.9 billion of spending, a spokesman for the airline said. Bloomberg first reported the news on Thursday, saying that the delivery of the planes will be shifted to 2023-2025 from 2019-2022. Southwest shares fell as much 5.1 percent in afternoon trading. The spokesman also said the airline planned to advance six orders for 737-800 planes to next year from 2018 to help cover the already announced early retirement of its oldest 737s. The new schedule doesn't change Southwest's debut as the first operator of the MAX 8 aircraft next year. Boeing has said the plane may be delivered as early as March, Bloomberg reported. Southwest has said it moved up plans to retire its classic Boeing 737 jets to the third quarter of 2017 from 2018. The move is aimed at resolving uncertainty about U.S.-mandated pilot training for flying those aircraft and their next-generation model, the Boeing 737 MAX. At the end of 2015, Southwest had 129 classic aircraft that it planned to retire, out of a fleet of 704. The company has said it expects to take delivery of 155 new planes through 2018 and has options for 18 more. Southwest shares were down 1.3 percent at $39.72 in late afternoon trading.
