In addition to the unprecedented $50 billion stock buyback announcement by GE earlier today, the biggest news of the day is the Apple iWatch launch. Or, rather, biggest dud. It all really depends on who you ask. As for the actual eyewitness truth, and the reason why everyone who took AAPL from $100 to $130 on hopes that the "New Paranormal" Casio will be the greatest thing since sliced bread, here it is. Scene @Apple Store 5th Ave., NY It's quiet as it should be. Ppl can see #applewatch today but can't get em yet. pic.twitter.com/5Dx8WUMEGy â€” Ed Baig (@edbaig) April 10, 2015 A line of OVER A DOZEN PEOPLE queueing for the Apple store to open. Might it be the new revolutionary watch thing? pic.twitter.com/AB4PjAz5iP â€” Marco Fontani (@mfontani) April 10, 2015 No line in Front of the Apple Store, and no new MacBooks either. Four Apple watches in a cloud of 40 people, though.. pic.twitter.com/tJSfJMoxjc â€” Philipp Engel (@nosyjoe) April 10, 2015 â€” Aleksey Sergeev (@alekseysergeev) April 10, 2015 Surprisingly short line for the Apple Watch in front of the Apple Store at IFC in Hong Kong (845am local time): pic.twitter.com/7k1Xg72tjr â€” Dr. Serkan Toto (@serkantoto) April 10, 2015 Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:24 | 5977956 Headbanger Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:25 | 5977972 Bullionaire Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:48 | 5978034 kliguy38 Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:20 | 5978165 Falconsixone Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:54 | 5978349 RU-GAY2 It should be pointed out to people calling Bitcoiners "iTards" etc, that Apple has been one of the biggest antagonists against Bitcoin.  So if you hate Bitcoin, you are in good company with Apple!

I know, doesn't really matter which team jersey the new boss wears. But, c'mon, could y'all be a little less obvious? Hell ~ It's prolly about time for Chelsea to pop out a puppy that has an uncanny resemblance to Webb Hubbell... Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:36 | 5977999 Ghordius I still like some few products from Apple, but I do find it strange how often I'm asked: "Gosh! You still have that oldest version?". And this in Europe, mind you on the other side, recently Apple flopped catastrophically with too many things, imho. as much as the newer Kindles, which seem to become less and less what readers want but be serious: despite the stock valuation, it's still a company that seems to attract the ire of many just because it symbolizes a "Latte and hipster" lifestyle and we encounter even here enough real damn political propaganda, the "real McCoy" of propaganda, to call commercial PR this way. just my two cents including that if you buy them on credit... and the newest one, again on credit... and then the newest one, again on credit... then you might want to pause and reflect Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:45 | 5978305 Harrison No, I think it has everything to do with Apple announcing that there won't be any in-store sales for the watches. So, people can't wait in line and walk home with one to play with. Therefore, no lines Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:28 | 5977979 MarketTruth Apple's watch is TWO generations behind the curve of current offerings within the marketplace. That might be part of the problem.

Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:43 | 5978015 DeadFred How is this thing supposed to be better than the Android Wear watch. My brother-in-law was showing off his Wear a couple months ago and I found it underwhelming. They'd better hope the herd thing works for them. I for one will keep my watch sefely in my phone in my pocket like the good Lord intended it. It is probably VERY quiet this morning at Apple HQ. Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:40 | 5978282 dicksburnt The Apple iWatch will go down in history as the last token from the 'great period of over consumerism'.  In the future as students peruse their history books on this chapter we are living now, long after we are dead, there will be a small photo of the golden iWatch.

Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:19 | 5977950 prefan4200 Why would I want a watch dangling from my wrist where I can bang it into stuff and break it when I have a cell phone that can do the same things, has a bigger screen, and can be safely tucked away from the elements and from banging it against things?  Maybe I'm an old fart, but I don't get why anyone would want this product.  I predict its sales will greatly underwhelm. Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:16 | 5978143 ghengis86 Precisely why my wife buys me $50 polished SS Fossil watches at Target; I bang it against shit all the time during the day. Tells time, looks decent, and if I smash it or scrape it up, just toss and replace. No need to smash a smartphone or ding up the expensive watches that get worn a handful of times per year. In order to stimulate sales of the Apple Watch, Apple has announced its latest iOS update will remove the clock and Apple iTunes will restrict all clock/watch applications from being downloaded on its devices...oh, except for the new Apple Watch. Fri, 04/10/2015 - 08:43 | 5977951 Dr. Engali It's a fucking "watch" people. Even the fan boys aren't excited about a stoopid watch. Apple has definitely jumped the shark on this one.
