Boeing patents Star Wars-style force fields - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Mar 23 2015, 19:03 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Science fiction becomes reality , as Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has been granted a patent on a system that is designed to prevent explosion shockwaves from harming a target. Just like the glowing energy shields seen protecting troops, machines and even spacecraft in science fiction movies and TV shows, the system is designed to protect a target such as a vehicle or building from the damaging effects of shockwaves from a nearby impact, using energy to deflect potential damage. The design may not be quite as fantastic as it seems; the force field likely would also deflect light, leaving anyone inside totally blind and making it unsuitable for enveloping a target and being held in place for any length of time.
