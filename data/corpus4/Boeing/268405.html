Amazon reportedly looking to lease or buy 20 Boeing 767 jets - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Dec 17 2015, 19:37 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor The Seattle Times reports (citing cargo industry execs) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is in talks to lease 20 Boeing 767 jets to provide air delivery services for its fulfillment infrastructure. Cargo Facts reports Amazon is "negotiating for the acquisition of perhaps 20" 767s. Amazon, which has been running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington, Ohio, is reportedly looking to avoid delays at the hands of UPS, FedEx, and other logistics partners - two years ago, UPS' inability to keep up with Amazon's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after Dec. 25. One cargo industry source says Amazon "expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a larger air cargo operation by the end of January." Leasing a new Boeing 767F is said to cost $600K-$650K/month, and leasing a converted freighter jet $300K-$325K/month. Even at $300K/month, 20 jets would cost $72M/year to lease, not counting fuel, labor, and other costs. Two weeks ago, Amazon disclosed it has bought thousands of truck trailers to create a fleet of Amazon-branded trucks (still driven by trucking partners) that would move goods between warehouses. AMZN has a different problem than everyone else...they will soon have to build their own aircrafts because Boeing wouldn't be producing them fast enough.. I found a few airplanes that Amazon forgot in Malaysia. Finders fee $1 million per plane. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) on Tuesday (Dec 8) denied owning any of the three aircraft that have apparently been abandoned at KL International Airport (KLIA), a day after the airport operator triggered a public search for the planes' owner. In a notice in The Star's classifieds section on Monday (Dec 7), Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB), which manages KLIA, gave the unknown owner of three Boeing 747-200F aircraft 14 days to collect his planes. "If you fail to collect the aircraft within 14 days of the date of this notice, we reserve the right to sell or otherwise dispose of the aircraft," the notice read, adding that the money raised would be used to offset any expenses and debts due. I don't immediately see the strategy benefit to vertically integrating in commodity distribution. Cost is significant considering the physical goods store struggles to break even. Well to compete with brick and mortar they need to dominate all year. Xmas is huge and if purchase arrive after December 25 then Amazon loses competitive advantage and lose sale. What they are moving may be a commodity, but the value they are creating (reliable, on-time, convenient access to anything in the world) is not.  This strategy makes sense only for a vision as grand as Amazon. Especially, if strategy is: build capacity to move their own product first, then build overcapacity to move other folks product second. look at their cost of delivery expense on the P&L, the CFO and CEO then have to ask themselves can we do it cheaper and better ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
