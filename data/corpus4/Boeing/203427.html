Boeing's Current Outlook: Examining The Indian Aircraft Market - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing will have a slight lead in terms of dollar value. Airbus benefits from fast growing domestic market. Recently Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has increased its market forecast for the Indian market. The most recent increased forecast comes after increasing the forecast in 2014 as well. Despite the increased forecasts, the Indian market has experienced difficulties in the past years. Kingfisher Airlines, which operated 37 Airbus (OTCPK: EADSF ) aircraft and had 77 aircraft on order, ceased operation in 2012. In this article, I will have a look at the forecast and also will have a look at how this will play out for Boeing. Figure 2: Boeing demand forecast for India (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 3 shows that demand forecasts have been rising for years. Currently, Boeing foresees an 8.8% higher demand for India. According to Boeing, there will be demand for 1,740 aircraft valued at $240 bn or $138 mln per aircraft. A year ago, the company forecasted demand for 1,600 aircraft valued at $205 bn or $128 mln per aircraft. By dividing the forecasted market value by the expected demand, it can be concluded that demand primarily will be for the narrow body airframes. AeroAnalysis dissected the current Indian market and had a look at current fleets and orders from the 7 biggest Indian airlines: The total fleet is 380, 83% (or 317) of these aircraft are narrow body airframes and 17% (or 63) are wide body aircraft With a market share of 55% (measured in units) Airbus is the market leader in India. In terms of value, both manufacturers probably have a share of around 50%. On the narrow body market, Boeing has a market share of 38%, the remaining 62% is for Airbus On the wide body market, Boeing has a market share of 81%, while Airbus does not come further than 19% As can be seen Boeing is dominating the wide body segment, while the narrow body segment is dominated by Airbus. In terms of units, the overall lead is for Airbus. In total, Airbus and Boeing received 613 orders from Indian Airlines. The orders received by Airbus and Boeing show the majority (97%) of the orders is for narrow body airframes. On the narrow body segment, Airbus is leading with a share of 88%, after IndiGo ordered 250 Airbus A320neo airframes. The wide body aircraft currently are slow sellers, but all 19 airframes currently on order are for the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 787. Table 1: Current Market Outlook 2015 for India Boeing valued the Indian aircraft market at $240 bn. The single-aisle segment represents 84% of the deliveries and 66% of the value. The wide body segment represents 15% of the deliveries, but 33% of the dollar value. Using the current market share, AeroAnalysis estimates Boeing's share (in terms of dollar value) to be 52%. Most deliveries in India will be to support the fast growing domestic market that operates on a low-cost basis. In order for Boeing to maintain at least a 50% share, it is key for Boeing to pitch their Boeing 737MAX to domestic airlines. Boeing could sell up to 100 Boeing 737MAX airframes to SpiceJet in the near future, one of the fastest growing airlines in India. On the wide body market, Boeing has a robust market share of 81%. Airlines are currently introducing their Boeing 787, favoring the Dreamliner over the Airbus wide body aircraft. In the future, more follow up orders for the Boeing 787 can be expected, while the Airbus A330(neo) could also be introduced on the Indian market. On the narrow body market, Airbus is leading and Boeing will have a hard time maintaining market share, but could be helped by a mega order from SpiceJet. A threat to Boeing's market share could be Air Asia India that commenced operations with an all-Airbus fleet a year ago and is currently trying to penetrate the market. Although one of the biggest customers for Boeing's wide bodies is currently struggling with its long haul operations, Boeing is leading on the wide body market. Since Airbus discounts its airframes a bit more than Boeing does, Boeing probably will be leading in terms of dollar value by several percentage points. Airbus probably will be leading in terms of units. For Boeing to benefit from the rising forecasts and maintain a comfortable market share, it is key for the jet maker to market its Boeing 737MAX for the domestic market and the long haul operations of Indian airlines have to show a more robust growth.
