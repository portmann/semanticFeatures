The Beauty Of Boeing, According To Michael Porter's 5 Forces - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is a well-positioned company, given Porterâ€™s 5 forces. The company is trading at an attractive valuation. The dividend is very attractive to income investors with the potential for capital appreciation. At a pub in downtown Toronto just 2 weeks ago, a friend of mine approaching age 60 asked another guy at the table "What do they teach in business school when it comes to determining good vs. bad business? In my day, almost 40 years ago, it was this Michael Porter 5 forces analysis." Answer: "40 years later, it's still Porter's 5 forces. He's not fashionable, but his teachings are a benchmark to evaluating good vs. bad businesses." As far back as I can remember, the airline industry was notoriously the worst industry to operate in, given Porter's 5 forces. Consumers could now easily compare prices on the internet, there were several unions to deal with and there were only so many suppliers of large planes. The airlines were at the mercy of companies like Boeing (NYSE: BA ). Let's take a look and see if Boeing is actually a good business to hold, according to Porter's 5 forces which are: Although I am by no means an expert in the airline industry, I will still share my breakdown of Porter's 5 forces as they apply to Boeing. Please feel free to comment below. Currently, the airline industry is heavily regulated and the production or creation of a new airplane would be incredibly lengthy and costly. Although Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ) which has made smaller aircraft for quite some time has tried to break into the bigger market, we can see how they've been faring. Bombardier has recently accepted money from the Quebec provincial government, hoping to stabilize their liquidity and solvency headwinds. The stock of Bombardier has been trading in the $1-$2 CDN range for several months now. Also, the new planes Bombardier is offering are not 300-seat aircraft. This business still belongs to Boeing and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ). There are a few alternatives to taking a 10-hour flight aboard a Boeing aircraft. By taking a smaller aircraft, there will be a need to stop and refuel (potentially more than once), or of course it is possible to take a boat instead of hopping on board a Boeing or Airbus plane. Effectively, the substitutes may exist but they certainly are not great. In the current market structure, there are a number of airlines which need to purchase these very large aircraft for flight over the ocean. Given that there are only 2 suppliers, this round goes to Boeing and Airbus and not to the airlines. Although there may be a number of used aircraft available, this is probably not a long-term solution, but only a short-term Band-Aid. Although the suppliers may be able to have some influence in the process, no company is a 100% perfect investment. Although the suppliers may have some power, the airplane manufacturers are working with them and inevitably have a close relationship due to the specializations of their product demands. Although they may have to pay up for certain things, a number of the components would be designed and produced in house, allowing for the controlling of costs. Given there are only 2 competitors in this industry, there is a low intensity for competition. Ordering a cup of coffee is another thing. Pretty much anyone can brew a pot of joe. Would you trust just anyone to manufacture a plane for you? Again, I am far from an expert on the airline industry, but as an investor, I am fairly comfortable purchasing shares in this company. It seems some of the best and potentially the worst companies (according to Porter's 5 forces) are found in the airline industry. I am not a big fan of purchasing shares in an airline. I am a huge fan of purchasing shares in Boeing, a plane manufacturer - one of two in the large plane segment. Purchasing stock, however, is not just about finding a good vs. bad company, but also about value. What am I getting vs. what am I paying for. Let's take a look. Below you will find a straight up P/E range for the past several years and then the dividend yield and payout ratios. As we can see from the numbers above, the P/E range in any given year is approximately 12 to 20. Given this very reasonable range and year-over-year consistency, the current price of approximately $120 translates to earnings of $10 per share (maximum) to $6 per share (minimum). Obviously, we don't base earnings on the share price, but instead do the opposite. 2015 earnings totaled $7.44, and using Value Line's projections of $9.25 for 2016, I feel comfortable using $8.50 multiplied by 12, leading us to a stock price of $102.0 on the low side and at a 20 times multiple (on the high side), equates to $170. At a current price of approximately $120, this seems like an excellent purchase. The next table breaks out the dividend yield and payout ratios. Although the 2016 payout ratio is looking to be in line with that of 2015, the dividend has increased to $4.36 per share, meaning a current yield of 3.6%. Historically, the payout ratio was around 35% and yield between 3% (at the low share price) to around 2% (at the high share price). Had the 2015 dividend payout ratio been 35% of earnings, the yield would have been 2.25% to 1.65%. Although this would seem like a very low yield, the market has clearly adjusted to the higher payout ratio, accepting the increase in the yield while giving up some capital appreciation. Further, in the past 2 years, the share repurchases have reduced the share count from approximately 747 million shares to 666 million shares as of the end of 2015. This is a huge reduction of float, all the while maintaining the positive yet small amount of shareholders equity. Given this, the ROE multiplier is one of the highest I've ever seen. Currently, the profit margin and asset turnover ratios have been consistent, but the financial leverage has bounced around, showing ROE above 100% in 2011. Although very high leverage is not something that an investor wants to see, it is much easier to accept in the case of Boeing given the commitment made when ordering a plane. For each order, there is a clear plan and timeline. For the solvency to be in question, it would take a greater calamity than we've seen in the past. Special Note: We've seen a lot of calamities in the past 10 years from everything to a financial meltdown to missing planes. Like any other company or industry, there are risks involved. In the case of Boeing, that specifically includes new government regulation among other things. On a risk/reward basis, however, I am very confident in adding Boeing into my portfolio as a core holding. At a forward looking dividend yield of 3.6% and aggressive share buyback, Boeing is an ideal long-term holding for the patient.
