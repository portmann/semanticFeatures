Air Canada Portraying Strength Of Boeing 777 And Redundancy Of Boeing 747-8I At The Same Time - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha The Boeing 777-300ER is a suitable replacement for the Boeing 747. Higher seat counts on the Boeing 777-300ER increase revenue and lower per seat costs. The Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 747-8I has been a slow seller and the reason for this, in my opinion, is not because the Boeing 747-8I is a bad airframe. The real reason is because the Boeing 777-300ER, in typical as well as denser seating configurations, can perfectly replace the Boeing 747-400. This makes the Boeing 747-8I redundant. Air Canada ( OTCPK:ACDVF ) perfectly demonstrates this with their dense seating configuration for the Boeing 777-300ER. In this article I will look at how the Boeing 777-300ER performs relative to the Boeing 747 for Air Canada. For the analysis I will analyze a flight from Vancouver to London, which is a 4105 nautical miles flight. Air Canada operates the Boeing 777-300ER in 3-class configuration, but the premium economy can be seen as a dignified economy class. The Boeing 777-300ERs in service with Air Canada can transport up to 458 passengers. For the Boeing 747-8I no typical 2-class seating configurations are available. Using scaling methods 2 seat counts are obtained an evaluated. Landing fee London Heathrow: For the landing fee a combination of maximum take off weight, noise print as well as NOx emission determines the total landing fee. Since no data for the emission was available, this has been left out of the fee calculation. The following results are obtained for the first configuration: Fuel costs are based on a jet fuel price of $3 per gallon The Boeing 747-8I generated 6% more revenue, but has 16% higher fuel costs and a slightly higher landing fee. This results in a 5% lower profit for the Boeing 777-300ER. The per seat efficiency figures for the Boeing 777-300, however, are superior driven by 10% lower fuel consumption and a slightly higher revenue per seat. It has to be noted that current Boeing 747-8I operators are operating the Boeing 747-8I at fairly low seat counts. Using a more conservative seat count, the advantage shifts entirely towards the Boeing 777-300ER: The revenue is 13.4% higher for the Boeing 777-300ER, combining this with 12% lower fuel costs results in a 17% higher profit. Per seat the revenue is about equal, while fuel consumption is about 22% or $0.62 lower. While the Boeing 747-8I has a higher revenue and profit potential, the airplane has no market. By operating the Boeing 777-300ER with 458 seats, the airline clearly portrays the potential of the airframe in higher density seating. Airlines that need the capacity will buy an Airbus A380, which offers greater flexibility in seating configuration and higher luxury standard (which allows for higher ticket prices) Airlines that need a replacement for the Boeing 747-400, will be more interested in operating the Boeing 777-300ER, which has a similar seat count. Additionally airlines can increase the number of seats, to increase revenue and decrease costs per seat With the Boeing 777X entering service in 5 years, the life for the Boeing 747 as a passenger jet is very limited. The Boeing 747-8 should not give Boeing a bad taste, since the cargo version of the jet should be a success once the market recovers at higher pace again. Additionally the Boeing 747-8I was more of a reckless and bad attempt to compete with Airbus' superjumbo. Although the Boeing 747-8I is a failure, the 747 concept has brought Boeing a lot of orders. The cannibalization of the Boeing 747 by the Boeing 777 will not have a major impact on Boeing's numbers, other than the Boeing 747-8 program profitability hinging on success of the Boeing 747-8F, which is facing a difficult time as well amidst slower than anticipated recovery of the air freight market.
