Boeing: Bullish Run Over? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing 737 family is facing increased competition from Airbus A320. Boeing might have to take a $10bn charge related to the accounting on the 787 and 747 program. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares have lost 12% of their value year-to-date and with bad news compounding and a stock that is not really having any direction for a while, one can ask whether Boeing's bullish run has come to an end after all. Figure 1: Boeing Stock performance per year and normalized (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 1 shows Boeing's annual return since 2010. The total return since January 2010, currently standing at 2.29 (January 2010 is 1), is still appreciable but certainly falls behind expectations. Boeing had a strong run up in 2013, but after that stock performance was weak. Since 2014 up until June 2016 the stock lost 6.35% of its value while the Dow Jones gained 7.5%. So clearly investors are not favoring Boeing at the moment and it can also be concluded that the jet maker is not really benefiting from the positive market sentiment either. One might say that the challenges Boeing is facing are too big for that. In this article I will have a look at the various challenges Boeing is facing. What needs to be noted is that Boeing's challenges are a combination of problems on their Commercial Airplanes segment, which is Boeing's core business, the company's strategy, macro-economic factors and financing challenges. One of the challenges Boeing is facing is on the Boeing 737 family. The aircraft trails its counterpart, the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A320neo, in terms of orders, which is partly caused by Boeing underestimating the A320neo at first and failing to launch a response timely. The figures from Table 1 speak for themselves. Boeing needed 2 generations of the 737 family to compete with the Airbus A320ceo and was able to sell 1.13 planes for every 1 A320 Airbus sold or in other words: Boeing sold 13% more 737NG and 737C aircraft. For a first narrow body aircraft family it is hard to deny that Airbus has severely dented Boeing's strong market position on the narrow body market, in fact the Boeing 737NG which was brought as response to the Airbus A320ceo but did not even outsell the Airbus A320ceo. Airbus pursues an aggressive strategy to win market share by steeply discounting their airframes. Additionally, the jet maker launched the Airbus A320neo to further reduce Boeing's market share. To date Airbus sold 46% neo airframes than Boeing sold MAX aircraft. Even if you take into account the early launch of the A320neo, it seems the Airbus A320neo is eating away market share from Boeing. Looking at the total figures, Airbus sold 4% more narrow body aircraft while Boeing used to outsell the A320ceo by 13%. That is quite a turnaround. What needs to be noticed is that in the end, the shares are about 50%. The Boeing 737NG has an order share of 45% compared to the Airbus A320ceo, while the Boeing 737MAX has a share of 40%. I expect this to rebalance more towards 45% on the longer term. For Boeing, however, it will become increasingly more difficult to effectively compete with Airbus due to the nature of the Boeing 737 Family. The Boeing 737 is based on older aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and Boeing 727, meaning that there are some design constraints. These constraints and re-use of existing concepts push costs down, but make optimizing the fuselage increasingly more difficult. This means that Boeing will have to come up with a new design in order to be able to compete with Airbus on the long term or the jet maker can only come up with a new generation of aircraft every time propulsive and aerodynamic technological development takes a leap. Additionally, Boeing is having difficulties to compete with the Airbus A321ceo and A321neo. Airlines are pushing for bigger aircraft as demand for air travel increases, but the Boeing 737-900ER does not cut it for most airlines. For every Boeing 737-900ER that was sold, Airbus sold more than 3 Airbus A321ceo airframes. The tendency towards bigger narrow body aircraft has continued since both jet makers launched their next generation aircraft, but Boeing was unable to make the Boeing 737 MAX9 better fit for the job. Another threat for Boeing, but also to Airbus, might be Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ). Currently Bombardier does not really mix in the competition between Boeing and Airbus on the narrow body market, but this could change once the CSeries has gained traction and Bombardier will start looking at a CS500 which would put the aircraft directly in a gap in Boeing's 737 product line up. Airbus' aggressive strategy aims to rapidly win market share and in order to win share they first of all come up with a good product, but also put an attractive pricing on it. Boeing's rhetoric has been that they are not interested in winning market share and thus are not forced to heavily discount their airframes. Since demand for commercial aircraft is cyclic, Boeing should care about market share. More aircraft in operation means that Boeing could earn more money from service programs which can keep earnings high, even when demand for aircraft spirals down. The Boeing 787 is Boeing's newest aircraft family that aims to push down fuel burn by as much as 20% compared to its predecessor. The aircraft has been plagued by delays and now, years after service entry, a SEC probe has been launched to investigate the accounting practice and feasibility of Boeing's financial targets and projections for the program. It is widely believed that Boeing will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the current accounting block, meaning that the jet maker will either have to increase the accounting block or take a charge. Charges for the Boeing 787 and 747 combined could reach $9.7bn. Currently Boeing is facing a production gap for the Boeing 777 Classic. Boeing is actively trying to reduce this gap, it has done so by discounting the airframe but also lowered output in 2017. The long term prospect looks good for the 777X, but currently Boeing is having difficulties with selling the Boeing 777 Classic due to low oil prices, relative late market success for the aircraft and slow recovery on the cargo market. The slow recovery on the cargo market brings us to the next challenge: The Boeing 747-8. The Boeing 747-8 was launched as an alternative to the Airbus A380, but never appealed to customers. This meant that success of the Boeing 747 hinged on its freighter variant. Order inflow for the freighters depends on recovery of the cargo market, which so far has not been robust enough. Simultaneously Boeing has almost run out of backlog and was forced to bring production to a minimum. If recovery does not pick up pace shutting down the Boeing 747 program will be inevitable. So far Boeing has taken $2.6bn in charges for the Boeing 747-8. Shutting down the program means that Boeing loses an aircraft with unique carrying capability on the cargo market. The Boeing 747-8F is a pain that could turn into a gain as recovery on the cargo market materializes. One thing that is more of a concern of investors rather than a challenge for Boeing is flattening order inflow. In 2015 Boeing saw a decline in order inflow of 50% compared to the previous year, this sparked concerns about the order cycles coming to an end. With backlogs at record highs, I view lower order inflow as being natural since it does not make sense for airlines to commit to orders that will be delivered years from now. In the end a book-to-bill ratio of 1 is key to Boeing's long term production planning. Boeing's production and testing of the US Air Force is not going smooth at all and the company went from being confident in meeting deadlines to delaying deliveries in a matter of weeks. The US Air Force will seek compensation for the delays, meaning that Boeing is likely to take a charge on the program in its next earnings report. One thing that is currently affecting Boeing and might eventually give the company a competitive disadvantage is the fact that Ex-Im Bank is currently not granting loans in excess of $10 million. This gives some problems in finalizing orders, especially for airlines that do not have the cash but are seeing higher demand for air travel in coming years. One cause for concern is the company's stock policy. In recent years Boeing has returned billions of dollars to investors by the means of dividends and stock repurchases. One can question the company's strategy, since returning almost all of your free cash flow might not be the wisest thing to do in a cash-intensive industry. While moderate returns to shareholders are good, the company could be better off using the money on the development of a new narrow body family. In this article I had a look at the challenges Boeing is facing and what can be concluded is that currently there is a lot of downward pressure on Boeing. At least for the coming 2 years I do not see a lot of reasons for Boeing share prices to skyrocket once again. Any positive news on the SEC probe will of course set Boeing shares higher, negative news will cause lower stock prices. What is important to note is that the Boeing 737 and Boeing 747 challenges could affect Boeing's long term competitiveness, while I view the Boeing 777 program as a program that is experiencing a bumpy transition but without major long term implications. The bullish run is over for now, this is not a bad thing. What is important is that Boeing returns focus on long term success by improving its ability to keep developments in control and come up with new aircraft where Boeing's position is being threatened. For the moment I expect share prices to move sideways with very little reason to move either higher or lower.
