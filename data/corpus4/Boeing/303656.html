Fed Hurt The Markets Again - Cramer's Mad Money (1/27/16) | Seeking Alpha "The Fed does it again. Their wishy-washy statement on interest rates today left stocks sinking back into oblivion after a nice rally on Tuesday," said Cramer. They did not rule out a rate hike possibility in March, which means that investors will have to wait and watch as the stocks get crushed. Cramer went back to his checklist which lists the issues that need to be resolved before the market can find a bottom. The checklist still has most boxes unchecked, which is a bad sign. Fed has not ruled out a March rate hike, political uncertainty has not gotten better, China still shows a slowdown with Shanghai Index below key 3,000 level, commodities have not stopped their free fall, strong dollar continues to weigh on bottom line of companies, no sizable merger and acquisition activity, or leadership from tech stocks apart from FANG stocks. With so many issues looming, investors should be cautious and wait on the sidelines with cash. "Just when we thought the Fed could do the job, they let us down again. We are back into a world of hurt until we can start checking off these darned boxes," said Cramer. CEO interview - Core Labs (NYSE: CLB ) Core Labs is a high-tech oil services company which is also known as the scientist of the oil patch. It uses its technology to analyze rock fluids on oil reservoirs to maximize oil output for drillers. The company's stock has fallen 60% from its highs in the last 2 years but is still profitable. It reported in-line earnings and better than expected revenues with lowered guidance. Cramer interviewed CEO David Demshur to know his views on the price of crude and the company's prospects. "Our mission is to help our clients produce more oil and gas every day. But more importantly, to produce more oil and gas from the assets they have," said Demshur. He also expects demand and supply for oil will balance towards the second half of 2016. The depletion rate of wells is 2.6M barrels a day which means that much new capacity needs to come up to maintain capacity. The demand for oil is expected to rise by 1.2M barrels a day, which means that oversupply will dry up soon. The current oil glut is nothing like 1986 since there was spare capacity of 10-12M barrels a day then compared to about 1M a day currently. Apple reported on Tuesday, and the question "how to value Apple" is on Cramer's mind. "That is the conundrum facing Apple, the greatest wealth creator of our generation," said Cramer. Analysts are just adjusting numbers of phones, price targets, inventory every quarter which puts Apple in the basket of other hardware companies like HP (NYSE: HPQ ), EMC (NYSE: EMC ) or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). All this brings the conclusion that Apple owns the cellphone market which is saturated as it reported its first down year. The fact that Apple sold approx. 74.8M iPhones, which is an all-time high, serves as a peak in sales and not good news. Analysts can't find something else to make up for peak iPhone sales as iPad and iWatch are not selling as much as they were earlier and Macs have reached a peak too. Analysts have no cover and they don't want to downgrade the stock because it's too cheap on earnings, even if those earnings are going down. They almost have $40 cash per share which is a lot to be downgraded. Hence analysts just keep adjusting their price targets. Analysts are traditionalists who see peak everywhere. "I am a generalist, not a technology analyst, and I can't view Apple just like another hardware company," said Cramer. All hardware companies reported a lower average price and forex issues in the last few quarters but Apple didn't. This is due to brand loyalty as Apple's products are loved by all and it's hard to put a price-earnings multiple on it. One metric that was astounding and shows the brand loyalty was the service revenue, which is the money paid for iTunes, music, app store licensing, service parts, iCloud and Apple Pay, that grew 23% Y/Y to $31.2B in 2015. "That is the number we need to key in on, not how many devices they sell," said Cramer. Analysts will soon realize that the revenue streams will make the stock worth owning and it is a bargain at $93. "Own Apple, don't trade it." CEO interview - PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG ) PPG Industries has been affected by the strong dollar. The company's sales came in below expectations due to the strong dollar, although it grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Cramer spoke to CEO Michael McGarry to know about the impact of the economy and falling oil prices on the company's bottom line. "Honestly, falling oil is both a positive and a negative. We are a supplier into the marine business; we are a supplier in the oil business. So, I'd rather be talking to our suppliers about innovation because innovation is what drives us," said McGarry. He sees more room to grow in the autos and China has more upside left. Brazil will be down for the whole year. He was disappointed with the aerospace build rates but expects growth to return in Q1. Overall, he expects Mexico and Europe business to grow. As Boeing (NYSE: BA ) cut its forecasts, does it mean that the aerospace has peaked? "That doesn't mean the companies involved in the space are necessarily dead," said Cramer. United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) reported a strong aircraft engine business which was attributed to the new geared turbo fan. Weak forecasts from Boeing means companies do not need as many planes as thought earlier. This could be due to low purchasing power or even Chinese rethinking demand. The problem is more with Boeing than with aerospace. Customers first need to buy US dollars to buy aircraft from Boeing so they'd rather buy from Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), which has lot of orders from Iran and has taken leadership from Boeing. "I think we need to lend some credence to the idea that we might have to factor in a possible aerospace peak," said Cramer. Tupperware (NYSE: TUP ): They had a poor last quarter and there needs to be a good explanation for it. Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL ): Wait for ugly days so that the stock goes down before one can buy. Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD ): They are one of the best in show and their dividends are safe. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ): Since we are in a bear market, stocks like Fitbit are crushed. In an up-market, it will command value. Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.
