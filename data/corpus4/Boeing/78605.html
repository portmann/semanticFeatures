The forecast suggests that 160M additional passengers will fly this year, equating to a need  for 900 new aircraft, not counting replacements, marketing VP Randy Tinseth says; Boeing and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) combined expect to deliver more than 1,300 new aircraft this year. Tinseth says Boeing is on plan to book firm orders for at least 750 new airplanes in 2015, even though it has booked only 136 net orders so far. The company expects cargo traffic to rise ~5%, which Tinseth says should help it sell more of its 747-8  freighters.
