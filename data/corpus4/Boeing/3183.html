ETF Hub Mar 13 2015, 18:18 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) CEO Jim McNerney’s total compensation last year jumped 24% Y/Y to nearly $28.9M, including more than $14M in bonuses, according to an SEC filing . Boeing says it exceeded the internal financial targets used to set executive incentives, even though its share price fell nearly 5% last year. The bulk of McNerney’s increased compensation was in the form of a higher pension value, with stock and option awards broadly flat compared with 2013. Separately, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) discloses that CEO Marillyn Hewson’s total compensation rose 34% to $33.7M following her second year in charge of the company. Shame on BA & LMT for paying those outrages amounts to the CEOs. It's a slap to the face for the long hold investors! They could've given a portion of all those millions as a small thank you Christmas bonus to it's dedicated investors. Yes absurb. What's worse is he is firing very competent highly paid engineers in California and back filling with low paid unskilled engineers. The world of wall street owning us all is becoming sickening. We have far fewer oportunities today in the work place compared with ten years ago. These mega corporations are like working for a communist entity. We are all just widgets of equal value because this mediocre management would not know the difference between a great engineer and a low life lazy bee. At Boeing both employees are paid the same and have the same perceived value, because they are just a widget engineer. We are also outraged that more than $0.04 of our $151.00 stock (Boeing) went toward CEO compensation for managing a complex organization even if most of that was performance based incentives. -argues with waitress about tip on $8.00 bill guy - mostly invests in load mutual funds guy. As a result of this wall st mentality, BA stock becomes a trading stock, not a buy and hold. Price gain today, gone tomorrow.
