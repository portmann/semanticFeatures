Who Is Buying The Boeing 777X? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Order book for Boeing 777X primarily consists of Gulf carriers. Order inflow collapsed after oil prices crashed. In one of my previous articles I had a look at Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) plans for the Boeing 777X test program and test aircraft. In this article I will have a look at the order inflow and customers for the Boeing 777X. The Boeing 777X is the next generation family of the Boeing 777 and consists of 2 types. The Boeing 777-8 is an ultra-long range aircraft that is placed between the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing 777-300ER in terms of range and capacity. The Boeing 777-9 has range characteristics comparable to the Boeing 777-300ER, but is optimized for a capacity of 400-425 seats. The Boeing 777X was launched at the Dubai Airshow in November 2013. Boeing managed to gather 259 orders and commitments for the 777X, marking it the most successful launch in the history of commercial aviation in terms of value. The orders at commitments are valued at $95bn. Despite the launch being a success it is interesting to look how many orders Boeing won for the Boeing 777X post-launch and who the customers are. Figure 1: Order inflow per year for the Boeing 777X ( Source ) The order inflow per year shows that Boeing finalized 66 orders in 2013, 220 in 2014 and 20 in 2015. In 2016 Boeing has secured no orders for the Boeing 777X and I do not expect this to change either, unless a deal between Boeing and Iran includes the Boeing 777X. The order inflow in 2014 was exceptionally high due to the order of 150 units from Emirates was finalized. It is noteworthy that Boeing managed to secure just 47 post-launch, this is likely caused by a focus on selling the Boeing 777-300ER and lower oil prices. As oil prices collapsed in 2014, so did order inflow for the Boeing 777X. Boeing secured 286 orders during times of high oil prices and was able to sell only 20 after oil prices started dropping. Figure 2: Division orders Boeing 777X (Source: AeroAnalysis.net) What can be seen is that the Boeing 777-9 is the more popular aircraft. This is to be expected since the Boeing 777-9 is the aircraft with higher revenue potential, while the Boeing 777-8 is the optimized for the thinner ultra-long range market. The Boeing 777-9 captured over 80% of all Boeing 777X orders, leaving the remaining 20% for the Boeing 777-8. As a reference: The Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 777-200LR sold over 850 units combined with a share of 93% for the Boeing 777-300ER. Figure 2: Division orders Boeing 777X by customer (Source: AeroAnalysis.net) Looking at the order division by customer it can be seen that Emirates accounts for almost half of the total order inflow, followed by Qatar Airways with a share of 20%. The other airlines all have a share in the 777X order book smaller than 10%. Sorting the order inflow by region it can be observed that over 75% of the orders comes from the Middle East, followed by 13.5% from East Asia, 6.5% from Europe and 3% belongs to an undisclosed customer. While many said the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A380 program was carried by order inflow from Gulf carriers, this holds for an even broader extent for the Boeing 777X. Currently order inflow for the Boeing 777X is weak, with list prices between $370 million and $400 million (putting it in the price range of the Boeing 747-8) I do not expect order inflow to increase significantly until the first airframes are being delivered. This partly has to do with the fact that Boeing, at the moment, is more concerned about selling the Boeing 777 Classic rather than the Boeing 777X. On the other hand it also has to do with low oil prices not justifying the purchase of an expensive airframe that was brought on the market to push fuel costs. While fleet planning is a long term planning process the current low oil prices are not pushing airlines to secure slots for the Boeing 777X. Since oil prices are likely to head higher again, I do expect order inflow for the Boeing 777X to pick up pace after 2020.
