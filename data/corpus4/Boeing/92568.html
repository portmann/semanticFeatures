Boeing: Discussion About MoM Aircraft Intensifies As Airlines Cherish The Airbus A321 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Order backlog of Airbus A321 shows demand for 'MoM' aircraft. MoM aircraft would give Boeing a strong member to occupy middle of the market. As Boeing does not want to build any 'moonshot' aircraft, a MoM aircraft should return value to the company and its investors. Day 4 of the Paris Air Show was not the one to remember in terms of orders. A single order for the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A321neo coming from a European low-cost carrier Wizz Air was the only event. The order included a commitment for 110 Airbus A321neo aircraft valued at $13.6 bn, and additionally Wizz Air holds options for another 90 aircraft. If the options are fully exercised, the total value will be almost $25 bn, although after discounts, probably only $13 bn has to be paid. The order was the biggest order for the Airbus A321 so far During the Paris Air Show, Airbus secured almost 150 orders for its A321 aircraft (neo and ceo combined) while Boeing (NYSE: BA ) received only 3 orders for its Boeing 737 MAX9 (of which one is a Boeing Business Jet). So far, Airbus received over 800 orders for the Airbus A321neo, outselling Boeing with a 4:1 ratio. With the Airbus A321neo and the launch of the Airbus A321LR, which has an additional range of 350 nmi due to the addition of extra fuel tanks, Airbus is effectively targeting the airlines that need to replace their older Boeing 757 aircraft. With the high order inflow for the A321neo, a suitable competitive answer from Boeing in the form of a "MoM" aircraft seems to be necessary. Although there hasn't been any big announcement about this MoM aircraft during the Paris Air Show, sooner or later, the aircraft concept should be presented to the board for approval. Figure 1: Market division in the payload-range diagram (Source: Wikipedia.com, altered by Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) With the Airbus A321LR, Airbus is sitting right on the spot where the Boeing 757-200 currently is. This market segment currently is not being addressed by Boeing since the Boeing 757 was taken out of production years ago and the Boeing 767-200/300 is not on offer either. So this leaves a market segment for which there is demand to Airbus. What makes this market segment a difficult spot for Boeing is that the Boeing 737-MAX9 probably cannot be stretched even further without needing bigger wings and bigger engines, which is a major engineering task and almost the same as building a new aircraft. This segment is also not addressable for Boeing with the Dreamliner. The Dreamliner does have the required capacity for the MoM, but is built for long-range operations. This means that it is overweight for operation in the MoM. So the MoM is the segment between the single aisle aircraft and the widebody aircraft. Airbus is able to somewhat address this segment with its Airbus A321, Boeing on the other hand does not have that possibility. For airlines a middle-of-market aircraft is interesting as it can be used on routes for which it is uneconomical to use widebody aircraft. So the only thing Boeing can do in order to not give up this market segment to Airbus is coming up with a new aircraft that specifically addresses this segment. Although it will take years, probably even a decade, before this aircraft rolls out of the factory, a few things became clear already during the Paris Air Show. Boeing's CEO, Jim McNerney, said the following about the MoM aircraft: I know there is a requirement. We are trying to define that with our customers. I am convinced there is an unmet requirement there that we will have to address. This shows that the board of Boeing actually is aware of the need for a new aircraft to address the middle of the market. What bodes well for investors is that McNerney previously stated Boeing should not pursue doing any "moonshots" in the development of new aircraft. According to Mike Sinnett, VP of Boeing Product Development, the new MoM aircraft would seat about 220 passengers and has a range of 4,500 nm David Joyce from GE (NYSE: GE ) Aviation stated that Boeing would need a new engine with a thrust rating of 40,000-50,000 pounds for its new aircraft. The fact that a new engine is required means that it will take year to develop the airplane and components and that Boeing should make haste to approve a new aircraft that can profit from the huge demand for air travel in the coming years. There is a strong demand for a 757-like aircraft A decision regarding the MoM aircraft can be made soon It will take years before service entry If Boeing approves the MoM concept, it can address a segment of the market that it previously could not serve very well For investors, the MoM aircraft is good news, as it means that Boeing expands its product line, but is not going to do a "moonshot" like it did with the Boeing 787 Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
