A 2019 Or 2020 EIS For The Boeing 777X? It Does Not Matter - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha A service entry in 2019 has been rumored a year ago already. Rumors of earlier service entry could indicate robust progress. A few days ago Flightglobal reported that Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is looking to pull forward the service entry of the Boeing 777X. Although this is a good sign I question whether this really is 'big news', in this article I will explain why. Figure 1: Timeline Boeing 777X (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) The Boeing 777X is Boeing's newest development and will be replacing the Boeing 777-200LR, fill up the gap between the current Boeing 777 and the Boeing 747-8I and compete with the Airbus A350. The Boeing 777X basically is a stretched and improved version of the current Boeing 777 family. Rumors for the launch of the Boeing 777X had been present for a long time. In 2011 Boeing disclosed some preliminary design details. In the years after, airlines pressured Boeing to officially launch the Boeing 777X. In May 2013 the board approved for Boeing's Commercial Airplanes department to start offering the aircraft to customers. In September 2013 Lufthansa gave permission to order the Boeing 777X. In November 2013, during the Dubai Air Show, Boeing officially launched the Boeing 777X and accumulated over 250 orders and commitments. The only thing missing in the timeline is the entry into service or EIS . A few days ago Flightglobal reported that Boeing might be advancing the 777X service entry. A source said Boeing was looking to advance the service entry to December 2019, adding that the GE9X program is also supporting an entry in December 2019. Having covered the 777X in my articles a couple of times, to me this is not new. In a previous piece that I wrote in December 2014, covering the production gap the Boeing 777 is facing I already pointed out that the general aim was Q2 2020, but made my calculations using a service entry in January 2020. In the same article I also pointed out that Boeing was aiming for a service entry in late 2019. Boeing refused to specify a possible service entry date in 2020 for the Boeing 777X, but also refused to confirm a service entry in 2019. One of the most important things to note is that the rumors of a service entry in 2019 are anything but new. Boeing probably has an internal target for a service entry in December 2019, but is allowing itself some space by targeting 2020 (without specifying a specific month or quarter). Additionally, it has to be noted that by missing the December 2019 target a service entry could slip into 2020. The same thing happened to Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), which was forced to delay the delivery of the first Airbus A320neo. Boeing, quite familiar with delivery delays on the Dreamliner and Boeing 747-8 program, has learned its lesson and is not too eager to publicly admit to a 'best case scenario' service entry target. For Boeing there is more at stake: With major cost overruns on their latest projects the jet maker has to show its ability to deliver a strong product within a specified time frame. There is more to win for Boeing by delivering on time, rather than setting an ambitious goal for itself. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
