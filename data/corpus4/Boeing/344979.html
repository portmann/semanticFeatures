Boeing likely to miss delivery date for refueling tankers - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Mar 22 2016, 09:21 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Boeing ( BA +1.4%) is likely to miss the first major requirement of its $51B tanker program for the U.S. Air Force: delivering the initial 18 aerial refueling planes by August 2017, according to the Defense Contract Management Agency. Instead, the Pentagon now projects the 18 KC-46 aircraft will be delivered by March 2018, or about seven months late, and that schedule may slip further. That explains the mass exodus of talented engineers, machinists and other staff via voluntary lay off programs.  Rumor has it over 8,000 thus far have requested and been approved and more are participating daily.  I do not understand how they can deliver committed airplanes or design new ones when their intellectual capital is leaving in droves. Defense program is poorly staffed and missing milestones. Nuthin' new at the Lazy B Ranch. This is a Will versus Skill scenario. Defense and Space Division should be stripped from Boeing ownership, re-listed,  and placed in USG temporary custodianship ala GM and the white-collar Engineers Union banned. Keep the Machinist Unions.
