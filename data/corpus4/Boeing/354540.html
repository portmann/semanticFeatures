How many job cuts at Boeing? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Mar 31 2016, 04:29 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Yesterday, the planemaker acknowledged plans for 4,000 layoffs at its commercial airplanes division by mid-year, but sources say the company's broad goal is to slash jobs by 10% at the unit, which has about 80K employees. Although the reductions are part of a broad cost-cutting drive to keep the firm competitive, Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) stock posted the biggest decline in the Dow Jones on Wednesday, falling 1.8% to $128.57. The ultimate goal is to, not just cut costs to raise earnings, but to cuts costs in order to pass the savings onto the consumers by lowering the price of their commercial airplanes. Boeing's single-aisle planes are currently much too expensive compared to the competing A320 family. The value of the American dollar isn't helping international sales either.
