SpaceX's Threat To Lockheed Martin And Boeing's ULA - Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) | Seeking Alpha Through their joint venture the ULA, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have held a virtual monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launches. SpaceX represents a huge threat to the ULA in the form of a much more competitive space launch alternative for the U.S. Air Force. Lockheed Martin and Boeing stand to lose billions in revenue if their monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launches is broken. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) have long held a monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launch contracts, which are worth billions of dollars every year. Lockheed Martin and The Boeing Company , who have partnered up to form a 50-50 joint venture called The United Launch Alliance (ULA), have enjoyed the comfortable benefits of its exclusive relationship with the U.S. Air Force. Unfortunately, for Lockheed Martin and Boeing, this comfortable monopoly is successfully being challenged by Elon Musk run SpaceX. SpaceX's rapid encroachment into the U.S. Air Force space launch program could cause Lockheed Martin and Boeing to lose billions in annual revenue. If SpaceX is successful in breaking the monopoly, which looks to be increasingly likely, Lockheed Martin and Boeing will have to compete with the ultra-innovative SpaceX for future contracts. This, of course, is terrible news for Lockheed Martin and Boeing. In fact, the U.S. Air Force recently confirmed that it should have SpaceX certified to compete for launches in just a short few months. Naturally, this comfortable monopoly enjoyed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing has significantly dulled their innovativeness and motivation to reduce space launch costs. This innovation divide between Lockheed Martin/Boeing and SpaceX should have an enormous negative impact on Lockheed Martin/Boeing's businesses, especially considering the fact that a considerable amount of these companies' revenues come from their space related ventures. SpaceX has survived and thrived due to the sheer will and innovative genius of Elon Musk and the SpaceX team. The company successfully broke into the space launch industry after what has to have been one of the most brutal company beginnings ever. Originally funded almost completely by Elon Musk's own wealth, SpaceX is a true example of survival of the fittest. Given that SpaceX no longer has to worry about survival, the company's innovative edge is clearly starting to show in cost-comparisons between its launch vehicles and that of the ULA's. The price differential of launch/vehicle costs between Lockheed Martin/Boeing and SpaceX is startling to say the least. SpaceX's costs are not cheaper in the single digit percentages, or even double digit percentages, but magnitudes cheaper. According to last year's Senate hearing involving both SpaceX and the ULA, SpaceX's average launches cost under $90M, while the ULA's average launches cost approximately $400M. While this cost-gap is certainly astonishing, it is not entirely unexpected given the combination of SpaceX's innovativeness, and the ULA's lack of competition. While the introduction of competition will almost certainly cause the average launch cost of ULA vehicles to plummet, it is still questionable whether its vehicles will be able to compete with those of SpaceX's. In fact, SpaceX is incredibly close to developing reusable rockets, which could be devastating for Lockheed Martin/Boeing, as no amount of innovation and cost-reductions will enable these companies to compete with SpaceX. The only way for the ULA to compete with SpaceX would be for the ULA to develop its own reusable rocket technology, which is exceedingly unlikely in the near-mid term. SpaceX's reusable rocket technology could be devastating for Lockheed Martin and Boeing's ULA. Here is a picture of SpaceX's reusable rocket technology in play. Financial Impact For Lockheed Martin/Boeing On a purely competitive basis, it is basically a foregone conclusion that SpaceX would absolutely crush Lockheed Martin/Boeing in terms of pure economics. The only real barrier protecting Lockheed Martin/Boeing from this influx of competition has been its sole-source contracts with the U.S. Air Force. Unfortunately, for Lockheed Martin/Boeing, this barrier is crumbling due to the barrage of negative press/attention aimed at the U.S. Air Force's monopoly relationship with the ULA. SpaceX has already made significant headway into breaking this monopoly relationship between the ULA and the U.S. Air Force, which could translate into billions of lost revenue for both Lockheed Martin and Boeing. In fact, the U.S. Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EEVL) contracts would cost the Pentagon approximately $70B over the next 15 years with ULA as the sole launch provider. If SpaceX were to break into this monopoly and take away a significant amount of business, this could easily translate into tens of billions in lost revenue for Lockheed Martin and Boeing. While the space launch business does not represent the majority of either Lockheed Martin or Boeing's business, the financial impact of SpaceX's disruptive influence is significant nonetheless. SpaceX's disruptive influence will likely show up both in terms of immediate and future lost revenues. If we were to assume that SpaceX will out-innovate Lockheed Martin and Boeing moving forward, which is more than likely given the company's amazing track record, then the ULA will almost certainly be crushed in a purely competitive environment. So far, ULA only has a financial edge over SpaceX, although even this is rapidly changing as SpaceX's business is growing exponentially. Just recently, for instance, SpaceX won a $2.6B contract with NASA to develop space taxis for astronauts, although Boeing admittedly won its own $4.2B contract. While Boeing also shared in the spoils, SpaceX's NASA contract nonetheless showcases SpaceX's growing business, and subsequently its balance sheet. While Lockheed Martin still has upside due to the promise of its other businesses, investors have to be mindful of SpaceX's potential disruptive impact. Lockheed Martin, in particular, is still an attractive investment due to rising geopolitical threats (think Wahhabist terrorism, the rise of China, Russia's instability, etc.) and the increasing technological nature of war (for instance, Lockheed Martin's revolutionary laser ), both of which benefit Lockheed Martin immensely. On the other hand, the attractiveness of Boeing as an investment is less clear given the company's recent stock price run-up, and its relatively higher proportion of space related businesses (of which SpaceX could easily encroach into). With that being said, SpaceX's potentially disruptive impact should have a negative impact on both Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which is something investors need to be wary about moving forward.
