VietJet's Choice For Boeing Could Be A Blow To Airbus - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha VietJet order is the biggest commercial aircraft purchase in Vietnam. Boeing set to gain share in an Airbus-only fleet. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has recently won an order for 100 Boeing 737MAX aircraft from VietJet. In this article I will explain why it is not only the size of the order that makes this order so important for Boeing. VietJet Air is a low cost carrier that commenced operations in 2011 and currently has destinations in Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Myanmar and South Korea. Despite being a fairly young airline, the airline has ambitious expansion plans. VietJet Air expects to triple its fleet within 5 years and is likely to have a fleet of 200 aircraft in the years after that. The rapid expansion plans fit the growth profile of a young low cost carrier in a one of the fastest growing aviation markets. VietJet ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX 200 aircraft, valued at $11.3bn. After discounts the deal can likely be valued closer to $5bn. The Boeing 737 MAX 200, basically is a high density version of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 sporting an extra emergency exit and has been offered by Boeing for low cost carriers. The Boeing 737 MAX 200 aids low cost carriers to increase revenue potential, while keeping costs more or less constant. After Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY ), VietJet Air is the second customer for the Boeing 737 MAX 200. Up until April 2016 Boeing has accumulated 3090 orders for the Boeing 737 MAX. The order for 100 MAX 200 aircraft adds 3% to the backlog. The VietJet order means the 8 th order for Boeing with 100 ordered units or more. The total orders for the MAX 200 now stands at 200, half of which are ordered by Ryanair and the other half is ordered by VietJet. Currently VietJet has a fleet of 35 aircraft and has orders for another 284 airplanes and 96 options. The order for the Boeing 737 MAX can be seen as a win for Boeing, since VietJet so far had an Airbus-only fleet and only had Airbus aircraft on order. The order for Boeing aircraft, gives Boeing an entry point in a fast growing airline that operates in a fast growing market. Figure 1: Infographic fleet development VietJet ( Source ) The infographic shows that Boeing will go from having no share in the VietJet Air fleet to having a share of 31%. VietJet currently has 104 Airbus A320ceos on order and 80 Airbus A320neo aircraft. With this single order, Boeing will be accounting for 35% of the total aircraft VietJet has on order. At the same time this order could mean that options for almost 100 Airbus aircraft will not be exercised by VietJet Air. For Boeing the order is a win, not only due to size but more due to the fact that it will be getting a share in the fleet of an airlines that used to be an Airbus-only fleet. Additionally, VietJet has ambitious expansion plans in a growing market, which could bode well for Boeing.
