He liked International Paper (NYSE: IP ) for the longer term as well as it yields 4%. Harris (NYSE: HRS ): This defensive stock is inexpensive. L Brands (NYSE: LB ): Buy some before and the rest after earnings. The company pre-announced that its business is good. Boeing (NYSE: BA ): "I just want you to hold. I think Boeing is a great long-term hold. I am a dreamer and a believer that there is going to be aerospace traffic." Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ): Buy it and put it away for a year as the last quarter's earnings had an overreaction. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR ): Wait till Home Depot's (NYSE: HD ) conference call tomorrow to make a judgement on this stock. Apollo Commercial Real Estate (NYSE: ARI ): Cramer gets nervous looking at stock yields this high, especially when he doesn't know what they own.
