Boeing completes detailed design for longest Dreamliner | Reuters Boeing Co (BA.N) said it completed detailed design for its newest and longest of three 787 jet models, the 787-10 Dreamliner, two weeks ahead of schedule. The milestone would mean the planemaker can release information needed to build parts and tools for procurement. Major assembly of the 787-10 will begin in 2016, followed by first flight in 2017 and first delivery in 2018, Boeing said. The 787-10 has so far received 164 orders from nine customers, accounting for 14 percent of all 787 orders, the company said on Wednesday. The 787-10 is eagerly awaited by airlines seeking its increased seating. The plane will carry 323 passengers, 33 percent more than the 787-8 and 15 percent more than 787-9, with significantly lower fuel consumption than current-generation jets of similar size.
