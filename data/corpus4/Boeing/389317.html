Qatar Airways in talks with Boeing over substitute aircraft - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Apr 25 2016, 13:15 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Qatar Airways says it is discussing with Boeing ( BA -0.3%) the possibility of securing substitute aircraft after more technical problems were discovered with the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) A320neo aircraft. Qatar Airways' CEO says the airline could cancel orders for 4-6 aircraft that have yet to be delivered following problems related to the hydraulic systems and particularly an increased noise created by a hydraulic pump when taxiing on one engine. The CEO says Qatar could turn to the Boeing 737NG as a replacement, noting the U.S. company is "trying to oblige and give us the aircraft that we require."
