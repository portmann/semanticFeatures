ETF Hub Apr 30 2015, 19:15 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Federal regulators will order operators of Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787 Dreamliners to shut down the plane's electrical power periodically  after the company discovered a software error that could result in a total  loss of power. The FAA says Boeing found  during laboratory testing that the plane's power control units could  shut down power generators if they were powered without interruption for  248 days, or about eight months. Boeing has so far delivered 264 787s to carriers including Japan  Airlines, Air India and Ethiopian Airlines, and reportedly alerted operators about  the potential problem two weeks ago. Boeing says it is working on a software update that should be ready by Q4 this year. Chance of power shut down is like winning the powerball!! Why is this even news??? They have to perform maintenance on the plane anyways. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
