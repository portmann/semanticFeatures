Emirates Putting Pressure On Boeing For Possible 787-10 Order - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha According to Mr. Clark, Boeing 787-10 does not have the required take off thrust performance for take off in Dubai. Emirates probably is looking for an engine with a higher thrust rating. Airbus has the A350-900 on offer; an order of 50 airframes of this type was canceled by Emirates last year. Tim Clark, CEO of Emirates, recently commented on a possible order for the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787-10 or the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF / OTCPK:EADSY ) A350-900. The possible order is being eyeballed heavily as it can be seen as a huge win for either manufacturer. Prior to launching a campaign to evaluate the Boeing 787-10 and the Airbus A350-900, Emirates canceled its order for 70 Airbus A350 aircraft in June 2014. The cancellation marked the biggest order loss in the history of Airbus. Emirates ordered the airframes in November 2007; at that time the Boeing 787-10 was not yet launched. The reason for the order cancellation was that Emirates reviewed its fleet requirement and the Airbus A350 as it is now was not what Emirates had signed up for years ago. The cancellation opened a door for rival Boeing, which had not yet sold any Dreamliners to Emirates. Although one of the reasons for the cancellation seems to have been the size of the Airbus A350, Emirates is now reviewing the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787-10 again. Chances are slim that Emirates will order the Airbus A350-1000, as the company has ordered 150 Boeing 777X aircraft and has an additional 50 purchase rights. This leaves the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-10 as candidates. The Airbus A350-900 is still a suitable candidate, but has a range capability that Emirates does not need. The Airbus A350-900 can transport 314 passengers over a distance of 7,750 nm. The Boeing 787-10 has a range close to 7,000 nm and can transport up to 323 passengers. Due to the bigger range for the Airbus A350-900, the airframe is a bit heavier than Boeing's 787. So in terms of efficiency, the Boeing 787-10 might have the advantage and Tim Clark also recognizes this: "but is it as fuel efficient as the [Boeing 787]-10? Probably not." The major drawback for the Boeing 787-10 is the required thrust. The Airbus A350 is designed for long haul operations and therefore has more powerful engines to get the heavier Airbus A350 into the air. The Boeing 787-10 basically is a double stretch of the Boeing 787-8 and has engines more powerful than those on the Boeing 787-8. In any other airport outside the Gulf region, the take off thrust of 76,100 - 78,900 lbf or 338.5-351 kN for the Boeing 787-10 would be sufficient. However, the Dubai International Airport is a bit different, the take off thrust settings are calculated using a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius or 86 Fahrenheit. At the Dubai Airport, temperatures can easily rise to 45 degrees Celsius. Due to the high temperature, the air will be thinner and this results in lower thrust coming from the engines and a higher required take off velocity. The thrust will be lower due to the engine computers limiting the thrust setting to prevent damage to the engine. One solution would be to lower the carried payload, but obviously this is not beneficial for Emirates as it will result in a lower revenue and profit. Another solution would be to let the engine computer bypass the temperature limits within the engine, but this would result in wear of the engine, which subsequently leads to lower performance of the engine, shorter engine life cycle, higher engine maintenance costs and lower (dispatch) reliability. Clark also told Flight Global that thrust bumps are not a way to solve this problem: "They're talking about thrust bumps and I don't do thrust bumps." Reading the above, one could get the idea that Boeing is not positioned very well to win the order from Emirates. The table shows that the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-10 with Trent engines have about the same thrust/MTOW ratio, while the Boeing 787-10 with GE (NYSE: GE ) engines has a slightly lower ratio. This ratio indicates how much thrust is available per unit weight. Assuming that Emirates wants to use GE engines on their Boeing 787-10, it seems that Mr. Clark has a valid point. However, the difference is marginal, and although I am not very knowledgeable on the subject of take off performance, I do think that Mr. Clark is also trying to intensify the competition between Boeing and Airbus that should get Emirates the best for its buck. From Boeing, he probably wants higher discounts and a GE engine with a higher thrust rating. Using the thrust ratio from the Airbus A350, which according to Mr. Clark has 'bags of thrust', the required thrust would be about 79,000-80,000 lbf. The GEnx-1B78 is a model of the GEnx engine that never went into production but has been certified at a thrust rating of 80,400 lbf. So I think that Mr. Clark would prefer a Boeing 787-10 with these engines. Airbus, on the other hand, has nothing but high discounts to offer as their airframe seems to be having the desired thrust requirement. I don't think things look that bad for Boeing, but it is in Emirates' interest to not give a clue about who might win the order and put some pressure on the manufacturer of whom is expected the most. Currently, Emirates is expecting a high thrust engine from Boeing, so the airline is putting pressure on Boeing. As a result, Boeing wants to deliver and not get defeated by Airbus. Additionally, Airbus should feel some pressure as well, so Tim Clark told Leeham News and Comment: "We're working with Boeing on that…" With these words, pressure is on Boeing and Airbus. Eventually, the one clear winner will be Emirates, which one will be the other winner still has to be determined.
