WestJet starts talks with Boeing, Airbus over fleet replacement - WestJet Airlines Ltd. (OTCMKTS:WJAVF) | Seeking Alpha Feb 29 2016, 20:09 ET | About: WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJAVF) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Canada's WestJet Airlines ( OTC:WJAVF , OTC:WJAFF ) has launched talks with Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and competitor Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY +3.2%) over replacing its fleet of 767-300s. The extended-range planes are set to serve Europe starting in May, and WestJet is looking to replace them eventually with next-gen widebody craft. Talks are centering on new planes that would enter WestJet's fleet in 2019 or 2020. WestJet is also looking for more 767s as it builds out in Europe. The 11-hour range of the planes could allow WestJet to expand further -- reaching from Canada to cities in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America -- though CEO Gregg Saretsky told Reuters the carrier doesn't have specific plans to expand into other markets.
