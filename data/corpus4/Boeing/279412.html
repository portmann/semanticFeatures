Boeing's New Products Should Drive Margins Higher - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long BA. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. BA continues to see operating margins move up as SG&A leverage grows. The companyâ€™s gross margins are relatively weak right now but I believe new products will drive them higher. Any gross margin growth will flow directly to operating margins as SG&A remains in check, setting Boeing up very well for the future. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is a stock I've been very bullish on in the recent past as I've thought the company's market leader position as well as a cheap stock with huge capital returns was a great setup. So far, the stock hasn't done much other than bounce around but BA continues to get cheaper in my view as the company's fundamentals continue to improve despite the fact that the price of the stock hasn't reflected that. Specifically, the company's operating margins have shown some growth in recent years and it is that movement that has allowed BA to produce rapidly rising profits and return lots of money to shareholders. In this article, I'll take a look at how Boeing has achieved this success and if it can continue into the future. We'll begin with a look at the company's spread between its gross margins and its SG&A costs. These two numbers contain both the entire pool of money available for profit (gross margins) and the single biggest line item of costs outside of cost of goods sold (SG&A). By taking the spread of these two numbers we get a raw, unfiltered view of operating margins free from accounting gimmicks or earnings management. Boeing's data for the past ten years and TTM is below. We can see a couple of things on this chart that I think are of importance to this discussion. First, BA's operating margins have moved up over time. While there has certainly been some bouncing around, BA's operating margins - in general - have moved up over the past decade. This has helped BA see EPS rise at a rate in excess of the company's revenue growth and has boosted FCF, affording BA the opportunity to make the tremendous capital distributions it has in the past few years. Second, we can see that BA's operating margins are very volatile and have moved around significantly in the past few years. This is a little unusual for a company with the scale of Boeing but it is actually for a valid reason; let's take a look at the components of the company's operating margin to see the way BA has derived its operating margins in the past decade or so. This chart shows the same data as above but instead of netting the two numbers, I've shown them both here. The reason is because by breaking down the components of operating margins and assessing each individually, we can get a sense of the direction of BA's longer term margins. We can see here that BA's gross margins are all over the place, varying wildly from one year to the next for much of this period. But the reason is because Boeing - like most any other industrial - is highly subject to where it is in the economic cycle and its own product cycles. Things like launching new commercial aircraft - for instance - means it takes lots of time to recoup costs and get to a point where gross margins are positive, let alone contributing to margin growth. The 787 launch obviously did not go as planned and that kind of thing eats into pricing power, demand, and ultimately gross margins. The good news is that these things tend to go in cycles and this chart shows that Boeing may be near the bottom of its current cycle; if that's true, BA should be setup for some gross margin growth in the coming years as it monetizes new products. Time will tell and this is not a slam dunk but BA is setup for success here. The other very interesting note from this chart is that BA's SG&A costs continue to fall fairly rapidly as a percentage of revenue. BA has always been a lean operator and in recent years, it has done an amazing job of doing more with less as the SG&A cost line in the chart continues to go from upper left to bottom right. This discipline has been the sole source of any operating margin growth in recent years as gross margins have been flat for much of the last decade. BA's focus on cost controls has paid off in a big way as SG&A now accounts for just 4% of revenue, an extraordinary achievement to be sure. Looking ahead, BA is certainly set up well for significant operating margin growth in the coming years. SG&A costs continue to fall as BA sees higher revenue producing leverage on its cost base. That is a very favorable condition to have and BA is the poster child for keeping SG&A under control. In addition, it seems BA has seen the bottom of this gross margin cycle as new products and higher volumes should contribute higher gross margins in the future. But to be fair, Boeing doesn't need higher gross margins to see higher operating margins because its cost discipline is so extraordinary. Any growth in gross margins will flow right to operating margins and that should be very exciting to shareholders. BA is setup well with new products and great cost discipline to see materially higher operating margins in the future. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Industrial Goods
