Boeing Just Keeps On Delivering - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha BA has sold off sharply since the middle of April, but has rebounded in recent days. The company continues to see excitement from the analyst community, which keeps upgrading its EPS growth forecast. I think BA will continue to see higher EPS and that its 15 times forward earnings multiple is far too low. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has been on a wild ride in the past few months. Since the year began the stock has risen from below $130 to more than $157, and has since sold off to trade for $146 as I write this. The erratic action is something shareholders have certainly lamented, but the fact remains that BA remains solidly higher after breaking out from its rather tight range formed in 2014. Based on the conflicting signals from the chart - a strong breakout but a robust selloff - I'll take a look at BA's fundamentals and valuation to see if the stock is still cheap. To do this, I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs, including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! ; dividends, which I've estimated to grow at 12% annually; and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6.5%. The estimated fair value of BA's shares given the model's inputs is about $165, or $19 higher than where the shares trade today. That's a very wide margin so let's take a look at the company a bit more closely to see if that is a reasonable target. Last time I visited Boeing , the stock was trading for $132, within the incredibly tight range BA formed during 2014. At the time, I quoted strength in orders and BA's cheap valuation as reasons to be long. That call worked out as BA shot up to $157 early in 2015, but since that time, BA has experienced a pretty nasty selloff. What's interesting is that since that time EPS estimates have shot up for BA and caused the present value of its future earnings stream to inflate. BA's medium-term growth rate for EPS is now expected to be about 12.4%, up from just over 10% back in December. At the time, I mentioned EPS estimates had been moving up and that trend has continued strongly for the past six months. BA's fundamental strength has been exciting analysts and that is part of the reason why the stock had such a strong start to the year. BA reported earnings a few weeks ago and it was greeted by investors with a resounding thud. The stock began selling off from the day of earnings and hasn't looked back. Revenue was light of the target by ~1.5%, but EPS came in with a very strong beat. It's true that margins slipped for some lines of business but revenue generation was strong throughout the company. Boosting revenue by 8% is terrific and should be applauded despite the margins. While I wouldn't call it a great quarter, it was fine and it seems the selloff that has resulted is a little harsh. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance so management must believe the business will pick up momentum as we move throughout the rest of the year. I always trust management guidance until I have a strong reason not to, because one of the biggest mistakes a management team can make is to put targets out there for themselves and then miss them. I have to think that the reaffirmed guidance is a strong sign that management is confident. One thing I'll also mention is that RBC's analyst said Boeing's cash generation for the quarter is very disconcerting and a reason for the stock to selloff. I don't buy that argument because of the reaffirmed cash flow guidance that I just mentioned and because cash flows are notoriously lumpy. The theory is that BA pulled some positive FCF into Q4 but even if it did, who cares? Who cares how FCF is distributed throughout the year? The only thing that matters is that BA is producing cash, and while I agree that management needs to deliver FCF in Q2, it's not a reason to dump the stock. Apart from all of the noise surrounding Q1, BA is still a terrific dividend growth story. The company has nearly doubled its payout in just the last two years, the product of two massive consecutive raises on an already decent payout. BA has made capital returns a priority at this point and given that it is still paying out a very low percentage of its FCF, it could continue to make double digit raises for a long time. That in itself is a very nice reason to own the stock, irrespective of the messy quarter. In addition to that, I really like the way the chart is setting up for a long position. I mentioned BA was in a tight trading range in 2014 with the top at $135; after BA broke over that line, it shot straight up to $157. That powerful move reset the stock's former range as a support, so now I think it would take a lot to see BA dip below $135. That's just a few dollars lower from here, so I feel like the margin of safety is great right now for a long position. And at only 15.2 times forward earnings with 12%+ predicted EPS growth annually, there are few stocks in the market today that are cheaper. BA has a very nice blend of fundamental strength, a favorable chart setup, a large and growing yield, and a cheap valuation. In fact, there really isn't much I don't like right now for BA. Q2 will be very interesting to see if the RBC analyst was right or not, but for now, I trust management will right the ship. After all, with the current order backlog at five years' worth of revenue, how bad can things really be?
