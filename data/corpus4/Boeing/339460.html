While the facilities are cleaned between flights, some germs or dirt might remain. In a bid to ensure restrooms meet passenger standards, Boeing has created a self-cleaning lavatory.Â  Boeing recently applied for aÂ patent for the self-cleaning bathroom, which uses Far UV light to disinfect surfaces, Business Insider reports. The airplane manufacturer claims that the system, which is activated when the lavatory is unoccupied between uses, is able to kill 99.99% of germs and eliminate orders in just three seconds. That means you won’t have to wait too long for a cleaner bathroom if you’re lined up in the rear of the plane. “We’re trying to alleviate the anxiety we all face when using a restroom that gets a workout during a flight,” Boeing’s director of environmental performance Jeanne Yu tells Business Insider. In addition to the self-cleaning aspect, the new bathroom prototype incorporates a hands-free faucet, soap dispenser, trash flap, toilet lid and seat, and a hand dryer, the Associated Press reports. “Some of the touchless features are already in use on some Boeing airplanes today,” Yu tells BI. “But combining that with the new UV sanitizing will give passengers even more protection from germs and make for an even better flying experience.” Of course, you shouldn’t expect to see the self-cleaning bathroom on planes anytime soon. The concept needs further study, Boeing says, noting that once it is offered it could take years for carriers to update their aircraft fleet to include the lavatories.
