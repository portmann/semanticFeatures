Boeing Vs. Lockheed Martin: Which Is The Better Long-Term Buy Right Now - Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) | Seeking Alpha In this article, I will review Boeing and Lockheed Martin to determine which stock is currently the best long-term buy. I will examine each stock's value as a stable, growth, value, and defensive investment based on a wide number of metrics. The results of the analysis lead me to believe that Lockheed Martin is the strongest buy for investors looking for stability, growth, or stronger defensive attributes. In this article, I will be taking a look at both Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) to help determine which is the better long term investment for specific types of investors based on a variety of metrics. In doing so, I will be reviewing each stock based on the following characteristics: Since all investors are not the same, I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks. In my review, I will be comparing the two stocks on individual metrics, and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category. The purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position, possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value. Lockheed Martin has the advantage in terms of ROA with a value of 9.43% compared to a 5.49% value for Boeing. Lockheed Martin maintains the advantage when it comes to ROIC as well with a value of 33.26% versus 27.23% for Boeing. Over the past year, the earnings yield of these two companies have held fairly close to one another, with Boeing currently having a very slight advantage. Over the past five years, Boeing has increased its book value by over 50%, while Lockheed Martin's book value per share decreased significantly. Both companies have done a good job at lowering their outstanding share count over the past five years, with Lockheed Martin seeing the larger decrease. In the stability section, I feel that Lockheed Martin is the winner. With stronger returns on assets and invested capital, I think it is the more stable of the two stocks. The decline in book value is a concern, but since 2014, it has actually been Boeing that has seen the larger drop in book value. The purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future. Both companies have seen revenue growth over the past ten years, but Boeing's growth has been far more significant, especially in the past few years. While Boeing has seen the greater revenue growth over the past ten years, it is Lockheed Martin that has seen the highest earnings growth during the same stretch of time. While both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past ten years, Lockheed Martin has seen significantly higher returns. I believe that Lockheed Martin wins this category as well. While Boeing has seen the largest revenue growth over the past ten years, Lockheed Martin has outperformed in each of the other four metrics. The purpose of this category is to judge each stock's current value to determine which one is more attractively priced. The trailing PE ratios of these two companies are nearly identical at 17.70x (for Lockheed Martin) and 17.04x (for Boeing). Boeing is slightly more attractive based on its forward PE ratio of 15.76x compared to 17.66x for Lockheed Martin. Boeing has the lower price to book value compared to Lockheed Martin and has consistently done so over the past few years. This value has been sporadic for both stocks recently with each company taking turns at who has the lower value. Currently, it is Boeing that is more attractive based on price to free cash flow. Boeing is clearly the more attractively priced stock at this point based on trailing/forward PE and PEG ratios along with price to book, and price to cash flow values. The purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession. I will be looking at both dividends and past performance to score this. Both stocks pay dividends with similar yields: 2.93% for Lockheed Martin and 2.76% for Boeing. Price Returns During Prior Recessions During the 2007-09 recession, both stocks significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with Boeing seeing the worst decline in its stock price. I don't feel that either stock is a great defensive investment option, but if I had to pick one it would be Lockheed Martin. It has the stronger dividend with a higher yield and higher growth over the past five years. It also has performed better during the past two most recent recessions. Out of the two stocks, I feel that Lockheed Martin is the better long term option right now for most investors. I believe it has stronger fundamental financials along with a stronger history of earnings growth and stock price appreciation. The company has had most good news recently with a new $1.5B missile deal , Marine Corps approval of its F-35B fighter aircraft , and strong recent quarterly results. The company did miss out on the Humvee replacement contract, but its strong quarterly results and the company's increase in full year earnings forecast lead me to believe that Lockheed Martin will continue to perform well moving forward. Boeing has also had some good recent news, with a $1.5B Navy jet deal , but has also had to deal with the recent class action 401k lawsuit and plans to cut several hundred jobs in its satellite unit after a large contract from ABS was cancelled. Unlike Lockheed Martin, Boeing actually lowered forward earnings estimates and appears to have some cash flow concerns. In the near term, I think Lockheed Martin will clearly be the winner, but Boeing remains a strong long term play at its current price for investors looking for a value stock.
