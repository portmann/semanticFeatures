Astronics: Indiscriminate Sell-Off Creates ~38% Upside Opportunity - Astronics Corporation (NASDAQ:ATRO) | Seeking Alpha Astronics appear to have been indiscriminately sold off due to macro fears in China, low oil prices, and overall increased uncertainty. China concerns are overblown despite the y/y drop in bookings, Boeing production cuts, and revised guidance. However, treating bookings and guidance as holy grail could lead to misguided conclusions â€“ which is exactly the case here, in my view. Additionally, low oil is actually a boon. Despite some timing missteps in the supply chain, this does not portend a fall in demand in the near-term, which the market seems to think it does. At ~13x forward earnings, shares of Astronics are undervalued relative to the Company's earnings growth profile. Assuming a conservative 18x earnings multiple suggests ~38% upside from current levels. In recent months, the market has become more jittery than usual, and for good reason. Macro concerns, led by China's expected deterioration in its growth profile, have been on top of investors' minds. Astronics (NASDAQ: ATRO ) ("Astronics", "ATRO", or the "Company") appears to have been unfairly caught in the crossfire, resulting in an indiscriminate ~50% sell-off since last August. Judging by the timing of the sell-off, I believe that market participants are focused on the Company's exposure to China, which is over-exaggerated, in my view. Regardless, Astronics' subsequent poor bookings number and revision in its 2016 guidance appear to have confirmed investors' fears as it suggests a drawdown in bookings which typically foreshadows near-term trouble. However, these fears seem overblown. The essence of my argument can be boiled down to the following: the market seems to think that 1) China/Asia is a problem, 2) contract delays, lower bookings, and revised guidance is a red flag, and 3) low oil is a negative. The market is over-exaggerating on all three counts, in my view. Astronics currently trades at ~13x forward earnings, which is a pronounced discount to its fair value, as its earnings growth profile supports a much higher valuation multiple, in my view. Conservatively assuming a 18x earnings multiple, shares of Astronics see ~38% upside from current levels. Notably, only four analysts from boutiques shops currently cover the company, which may explain some of the valuation multiple discrepancy vis-a-vis other more well-known industry players. As a quick reminder, Astronics' product offerings comprises of distribution & motion systems, lighting & safety systems, avionics products, aircraft structures, automated test systems, amongst other things. The Company sells these products mainly to the aerospace industries, and to a lesser extent, the defense, electronics, and semiconductor industries. Management is currently focused on increasing product content on next-gen aircraft in order to solidify its foothold on numerous new platforms (e.g. 777X). High-potential platforms include the 777, 737, 787, 747, and 777X. Product content is currently ~$235k, ~$100k, ~$45k, and ~$30k respectively (777X is still being negotiated), and these numbers continue to grow as R&D churns out incremental products. The Company has also recently highlighted that it is not opposed to growing inorganically, and is willing to lever its balance sheet to do so. Their M&A strategy would likely revolve around acquiring adjacent products to increase per-aircraft product content - the Armstrong acquisition in 2013 is a good example. Given the Company expects to derive ~85% of its 2016 sales from aerospace, this report will only focus on ATRO's aerospace segment. This report will also only focus on the OEM channel and the order environment for aircraft, given that Astronics is already largely past the phase of getting its products approved on an aircraft model; aerospace is quite analogous to pharma/biotech where after your product gets approved, the discussion largely turns to channel checks and demand environment. Shares of Astronics begun selling off last August, which coincided with the China scare where analysts and investors became hugely concerned that a pronounced slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global GDP growth. Astronics' sales to Asia (a large portion of which is probably to China) accounted for ~17% of sales in 2015. Against such a backdrop, China-related fears seem well-founded. They seem exceptionally well-founded when one considers that Boeing estimates that ~38% of new aircraft deliveries will be sold to Asia. Moreover, Astronics sells to Boeing, who then sells to Asian airlines, suggesting significant indirect exposure to China on Astronics' part (i.e. Astronics' U.S. sales to Boeing are then sold by the OEM to Asia). In addition, Astronics also sells to other customers (e.g. Panasonic Avionics, which is ~21% of ATRO's sales) who themselves sell to Boeing which turns around and sells to Asia. Stated simply, the ~17% figure actually materially understates Astronics' China/Asia exposure. However, we can begin to refute this leg of the bear case when one considers that GDP growth is not the main driver of increases in air travel, at least for Asia. This is primarily due to the fact that the Asian air travel market is not as saturated as the developed markets such as US and Europe. In saturated markets such as those in the developed countries, air travel more closely tracks GDP growth. In contrast, this is not the case for emerging markets such as China given that the low market penetration - at least in China - allows demand to be driven largely by saturating the market and less by GDP growth, making Astronics less economically-sensitive to the country. As proof, here are Boeing's comments on the issue (emphasis mine): We also continued to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%, a steady trend we have seen for the past five years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market as currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft." Source: Boeing's 4Q 2015 Earnings Call Transcript The important takeaway from Boeing's management comments is as follows - China is not a particularly saturated market, evident from Boeing seeing the country being currently underserved by 1,000 aircraft, with the number amounting to 6,300 over the next two decades. The Company's In-Seat Power Supply ("ISPS") demonstrate the existence of strong market penetration trends. Current market penetration is ~800k seats - ~225k net seats were added in 2014 (~$180m in sales, assuming mid-point ASPs), out of an addressable market of 2.5m seats. These seats are sold at ASPs ranging from $750 to $850 per management, as seen below. Source: Astronics Investor Presentation Given the rapid rates of adoption, this suggests that ATRO's ISPS products are very well-received by the market. Market penetration for its ISPS products should continue to grow given that OEMs do not like using many suppliers for a single component as it complicates the supply chain and requires significant due diligence on their part - which is time-consuming - to determine whether to approve another supplier, notwithstanding the required FAA certification, which tends to be equally if not more time-consuming. As evidence, most components of an aircraft is sole-sourced regardless of their size (Transdigm is largely sole-source of low-dollar components, Rolls Royce and GE is sole-source for jet engines). While this does work against ATRO's efforts to increase product content, their history of increasing per-plane content suggests that the Company is coping with this dynamic quite well. Competition is not a huge issue given that the larger players (GE and Rolls Royce, for example) are focused on developing high-dollar content such as jet engines; ATRO's markets are simply too small to move the needle for these giants. Smaller players tend to be family-owned businesses specializing in niche areas that Astronics does not compete in. Moreover, ATRO is not opposed to increase product content by growing inorganically, as discussed above, which somewhat nullifies this disadvantage. Finally, extrapolating a decrease in GDP growth in the country to conclude that air travel demand would suffer neglects to consider the fact that China - and much of Asia, for that matter - is transitioning into a consumption-based economy. In Boeing's 2015 market outlook , the OEM notes that travel and transport tends to be the first discretionary items that are added to a consumer's budget when a developing market economy transitions into a consumer-driven economy, as quoted: Emerging markets throughout the world have shown that air travel is one of the first discretionary expenditures to be added as consumers join the global middle class." Source: Boeing 2015 Market Outlook, page 22 Therefore, slowing GDP growth in China might not necessarily spell doom for air travel demand, and might even suggest acceleration - China's resilient double-digit growth in RPM last year certainly supports this theory. Year-over-year drop in bookings and revised guidance does not portend a drop in aircraft demand Bookings fell ~14% y/y from ~$675m in 2014 to ~$585m in 2015. Despite ~$585m in 2015 bookings, management is guiding to ~$665m-$725m in 2016 sales, suggesting a drawdown on bookings. Note that the revenue guidance has been reduced from ~$690m-$750m, which could have confirmed investors' fears that aircraft demand is experiencing a slowdown. As a result, bears are likely skeptical of whether the Company could hit its 2016 sales guidance. A drawdown on bookings is typically an ominous sign - for example, it may foreshadow lower demand in the near-term, but in this case it does not, in my view. The reason for this is simple - a major order has been delayed by a couple months, and has still not been booked, and therefore is not included in the 2015 bookings number. Per management (emphasis mine): That demand that was anticipated by the customer in September, October declined and we have spent the time since then renegotiating a smaller demand for 2016, which we believe is done at this point, the negotiations, but the order has not yet been received. So we are kind of in the same spot now in terms of having what we believe is the pretty clear line of sight so what demand is going to be and yet we don't have the order. So the schedule is such that we would expect an order to be coming in the next, say, four to eight weeks." Source: Astronics 4Q 2015 Earnings Call Transcript Interestingly, an analyst raised the question on the 4Q call asking whether management should take that delayed order out of its 2016 sales guidance, suggesting that Wall Street is likely concerned about a similar matter. Clearly, if Astronics gets that order, the bookings number will be more in-line with the guidance number. However, a simple timing problem is highly unlikely to be missed by the market. After all, in the context of aerospace supply chains, order delays are frequent and investors are likely sophisticated enough to adjust for these delays. Notably, management identified the order delay coming from a customer that comprised of ~13% of the Company's sales in 2015. Checking this against the 10-K , it is pretty clear that customer is Boeing. The order is likely a 777X order as per slide 11 of the recent investor presentation , which classifies the 777X as a "recent award being negotiated". I will be focusing a lot of Boeing in subsequent paragraphs. The reason for my extreme emphasis on Boeing despite the ~13% sales exposure is because this exposure is significantly understated, in my view. Astronics' largest customer is Panasonic Avionics at ~21% of sales. Panasonic Avionics sells to Boeing as well, which means that Astronics' has indirect exposure to Boeing through its relationship with Panasonic Avionics. This dynamic is likely present with smaller customers of Astronics as well. This situation is unsurprising given that Boeing and Airbus split the aircraft market in halves between them; if you're selling anything aerospace-related, you're likely to derive a significant portion of your sales from one of these giants - they are the penultimate customer (second to the airlines/lessors that order from them). Put simply, the ~13% sales exposure severely understates the Company's actual exposure to Boeing. The larger concern (and a major leg of the bear case) here is whether the delay portends a drop in demand, in my view. Couple this delay with macro-related concerns, and it is not difficult to envision investors attributing timing issues to a worsening macro picture (perhaps exacerbated by low oil prices), and expecting more delays in the future. However, it appears that the timing delay is a production issue specific to Boeing. Per Boeing's management (emphasis mine): Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below seven per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view with a timeline for shifting to a 777 production rate of seven per month starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X." Source: 4Q 2015 Boeing Earnings Call Transcript Essentially, Boeing experienced some production issues related to the ramp-up of the 777X and appears to be in the process of ironing out these issues, which will allow the production rate on the 777X to recover to prior levels. The takeaway from Boeing's comments is important to note - timing delays were not a result of a fall off in demand (as the bear case seems to suggest), but simply due to OEM issues. I am well aware that delays might lead to further delays and then the situation just snowballs from there. However, such a scenario only occurs when the fundamentals isn't there to support the demand (i.e. airlines are unprofitable). This is certainly not the case given record airline profitability and high passenger load factors - see infra. The demand is there, evident from increasing backlogs at OEMs (see Boeing's commentary in subsequent sections) and rising order placement levels at aircraft lessors such as AerCap on a forward-looking basis, as seen below. Source: AerCap Bondholder Presentation, February 26, 2016 Per Boeing's comments, it seems that the delayed order for Astronics is highly likely to come through within the 2016 fiscal year, given that Boeing intends to transition to a rate of seven 777X starting in 2017. Stated simply, 2016 guidance is very achievable, in my view. Another leg of the bear argument seems to be predicated on this demand falling off as low oil prices persist (as older planes become more economically viable - which is true, but not the whole story), but channel checks by Boeing and data from AerCap suggest that this is not the case (emphasis mine): Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one, and we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions. In a period such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines buy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules." Source: AerCap Bondholder Presentation, February 26, 2016 Instead, it is clear that the bear argument regarding oil is misguided as airlines are capitalizing on low oil prices in order to grow their fleet. The acceleration is also unlikely to lose steam given that passenger load factors are currently approaching ~80%, a level that is far greater as compared to a decade ago, suggesting that the demand for air travel continues to be very strong. Even a 2008-style crisis would barely make a dent in demand for air travel, as seen below. Note: The above chart does not include 2015 data. 2015 RPK growth was ~7%, in-line with expectations. Elevated passenger load factors are a huge incentive for airlines to continue spending in order to grow their fleet. Airlines are flushed with cash primarily due to benefit provided by low oil prices, and 2016 should be a very profitable year - which reinforces my belief that the drop in bookings was a production issue specific to Boeing, not a demand issue, per Boeing management (emphasis mine): While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to IATA, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand, and airline efficiencies." Source: 4Q 2015 Boeing Earnings Call Transcript Big picture, in Boeing's annual market outlook for 2014, the OEM estimated that 36,770 new aircraft would be needed over the next two decades. In 2015, this number was upped to ~38,000, signaling an increase in demand despite the oil price depression which started in 2014 and continues to this day. OEM backlogs have been on the increasing side, despite a sustained ramp-up in production. Lessors such as AerCap have also reported growing order placements for next-gen aircraft, as noted above. Furthermore, it appears that the investors are so myopically focused on the delay of the Astronics' 777X order (unsurprisingly, given that the delay was the primary reason for the y/y drop in bookings) as a leading indicator of falling demand that they have missed out on other numerous positives. Per Astronics' investor presentation, the 777 has the largest content per plane at ~$235k, followed by the 737 at ~$100k, and 787 at ~$45k. Per Boeing's management, the OEM plans to ramp up the production rates on these models very significantly in the near-term (emphasis mine): Turning to individual BCA programs, given the 737's robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month. As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018... ...On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last two years. And earlier this month, we booked orders for another six from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft... ...On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide body airplane. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 Dash 9s..." Source: 4Q 2015 Boeing Earnings Call Transcript Notably, these planned production rate increases suggest that all is well with aircraft demand and reinforces my belief that there will not be a drop in demand in the near-term. Although management has historically lamented their stock trading at a discount to fair value, they have done little to support their views. However, their stance has drastically changed for the better as one analyst from an investment firm (presumably a shareholder) on the 4Q call called out management for its lack of action in order to maximize shareholder value: It's actually more of a comment and it's in support of the earlier caller who and shareholder who referenced the need or the desire to have the company stand up and do something with its balance sheet to help shareholders. It seems for several quarters you've talked about how really positive you are in the business outlook and it would be appropriate for you guys, I know you like to invest long term but the simple fact is, Astronics is trading like it's a little basic metal bender right here on multiple basis and its anything but that and to not take advantage of that opportunity for your long-term shareholders and your current investors to me seems to be almost negligent and it's very frustrating I think for shareholders to hear management say we don't understand why the stock is down but then to do nothing other than throw words at it instead of doing what you should do which is throw capital at it to take advantage because you and I think, I think we both know that strategically Astronics is worth a multiple and not probably just two or a two and half or three times what the stock is currently trading at if someone were to want to acquire it or if they were want to recreate it. And I think that doing something in the short run to step up and help shareholders and to take out those who don't want to play in this stock and let us who want to play in it have a greater confidence and quite honestly not have to spent as much time explaining why we owe it to our clients would be very helpful." It appears that the message has been heard loud and clear. The earnings call was held on February 17. Within one week, management announced a $50m share repurchase program . In my view, this is a testament that management is willing to listen to outside criticism and adjust their methods to ensure that shareholder value is maximized. In the press release, the CEO reiterated that he believes that shares are compelling at current levels - and it appears that he has put his (as he is also quite a large shareholder) money where his mouth is. I find it hard to imagine that the Company would not follow through with its share buyback program given management's explicit comments, a substantial cash balance, a mostly-unlevered balance sheet, and no major near-term expenditure requirements. Additionally, the above-linked March investor presentation also included some interesting information. On slide 25, management mentions that it is "willing to flex up" to take debt up to 2x-3x, suggesting that a levered share repurchase program might be in the works. Assuming that the 2x-3x figure refers to net debt/EBITDA, raising debt in order to reach said figures would imply incremental cash of ~$87m (from current ~1.3x to 2x, assuming ~$120m in EBITDA) to ~$211m (from current 1.3x to 3x) which would substantially boost earnings growth if allocated to share repurchases. Regardless, a $50m share repurchase would add ~5.4% to earnings growth, assuming a starting share count of ~25.6m. Valuation is compelling at current prices, 18x earnings multiple suggests ~38% upside - with undemanding assumptions Assuming management hits the mid-point of its own sales guidance (i.e. $695m) - which appears to be undemanding given my commentary in prior sections, shares of Astronics trade at a ~13x forward earnings (10% net margins implying ~$70m in net income, in-line with historicals). 10% net margins are likely conservative given incremental net margins approaching ~35% primarily due to opex leverage (~$11m in incremental net income / ~$31m in incremental net sales in 2015) - which should continue given that much of the development has been done and now it is just a process of ramping up production. Management guides ~$90m in engineering & development expense in 2016, down from ~$100m in 2015 as its programs continue to ramp-up resulting in programs costs declining on a per-unit basis. ~$70m in net income translates to ~4.4% earnings growth. Supplement this figure with the benefit from the announced share repurchase program, earnings growth would approach 10% pretty easily. Additionally, note that 2016 earnings growth is likely subdued given that OEMs - in particular, Boeing, as discussed - are still in the process of ramping up their production rates, suggesting that earnings growth beyond 2016 could feasibly be closer to the mid-teens, driven by higher sales and greater gross margin/opex leverage. In the medium-term, a ~10% earnings growth profile which is likely to ramp up to the mid-teens in the next 2-3 years very comfortably supports a 18x forward earnings multiple - possibly closer to 20x as OEMs steps up on production - especially when one considers that a high-teens earnings multiple for Astronics is not exactly an heroic assumption, given that the multiple has averaged in the low-twenties for the Company, according to data provided by YCharts . Such a high-teens multiple suggests ~38% upside from current levels. Shares of Astronics are attractive due to - an undemanding low-teens forward earnings multiple largely thanks to the market's apparent overreaction to China-related fears, y/y drop in bookings due to Boeing-specific production issues, and low oil prices. Stated simply, should the price/value disparity close, shares of Astronics see ~38% upside from current levels - possibly more.
