Should Investors Be Worried About Boeing's Fourth 747 Production Rate Cut? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing announced its fourth production rate cut in 2 years for 747 jumbo jet. From March 2016 onward, Boeing will manufacture one 747 a month, down from current rate of 1.5 a month. Analysts and industry experts are apprehensive as all this may impact Boeing’s profitability. Boeing management is however confident about the company’s future prospects. American aero major The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) recently came out with a rate cut announcement for its iconic jumbo jet 747 to 1 jet a month , down from its current production of 1.5 jets a month. While the news of a production rate decrease for the wide-body commercial jet has become quite common in recent times, its relevance has not been compromised. Industry experts and analysts are apprehensive about the drop in the digit as they believe this may take a toll on the overall performance of the company. However, Boeing executives beg to differ. Here's the lowdown on what's going on and how that might impact the company. Boeing's latest announcement adds to the recent series of similar announcements for the Queen of the Skies -- this is the fourth rate cut in 2 years. For some time now the Chicago-based air-framer has been facing difficulties in attracting customers for its jumbo jet, and on the back of weak demand the company was forced to reduce its production from 2 jets a month to 1.75 in April 2013 . This was the first reduction in the production rate. Since then the phenomenon has become more common. After April, Boeing announced the second rate cut to 1.5 jets a month in the same year. That's so much for the previous rate cuts. Now, this year from September onward, the aero major is going to manufacture 1.3 747s a month, and this is further slated to go down to 1 jet a month from March 2016, as per the latest announcement. However, with these changes in effect, Boeing feels the future of 747 looks much more stable. The move comes from Boeing as an attempt to sustain the 747 program until the air cargo space recovers and new orders start flowing in. The lull in the air cargo segment and the weak demand from passenger aviation have cornered the humped-up model. With technological advancements, relatively smaller twin-engine jets, such as Boeing's own 777, have become capable of pulling off long distance flights at much lower costs, and thus have eaten into the demand for the jumbo jet. Earlier airlines needed to use a four-engine fuel-guzzler to make transoceanic voyages, but gone are those days. Airlines today prefer to go with the new age fuel-sipping jets. But this doesn't mean the 747 is not good anymore. Even today, if airlines can get a full booking, using a 747 will become meaningful. However, not many passengers fly those large distances in one go. All this has resulted in hopes for a brighter future for the 747 being tied to the freighter market. Cargo demand has always played a significant role in the overall demand of the model as cargo carriers account for the major chunk of 747-8's order book. However, since the slump of 2008, the cargo market has been slow to recover. Instead of using the 747 for transporting cargo, airlines are using the cargo space available in 777 and similar sized jets. On the back of lower cargo shipments, these jet models have turned out to be sufficient to cater to freight needs. Analysts and industry experts may be apprehensive about the slowdown in production, but Boeing is not. Absent the production rate cut, Boeing would have met its backlog for the 747 sooner and that would have resulted in a production gap -- something that's definitely not desired by the jet maker and its component suppliers. Boeing had to pull down the production rate so that it can keep the production line running until demand again kicks in. Earlier when the Chicago-based company announced a rate cut to 1.5 jets a month, several component suppliers had objected , mentioning that's the bare minimum that Boeing needs to produce monthly so that the component suppliers can maintain healthy operations. However, the current production rate may result in further unrest. But, Boeing believes this should not pose as an issue for the suppliers. The aero major has streamlined the manufacturing process and undertaken cost-cutting measures which will help in smooth functioning even at this rate. Rather, Boeing believes this new production rate will add the much needed stability to the manufacturing process. The demand for the wide-body 747 has been plunging so far. But Boeing believes this trend is going to change in years to come. The company is confident about the upswing in commercial aviation demand and believes once aviation mega-cities get developed, the demand for 747 will also shoot up. Even the forecast for cargo demand is optimistic. Boeing expects over the next 20 years an average 29.5 planes will have to be produced annually to meet the cargo market demand. Hopes attached to the jet got revived when Russia-based Volga Dneper placed a tentative order for 20 747-Fs during the recently held Paris Air Show. This order alone can stretch the production line by more than one and half years, buying Boeing time before actual demand again kicks in. Thus, while the current market stats may suggest otherwise, expectations for the jet in the future don't look too bleak. As the economy improves and more and more passengers start opting for flying as a mode of transport, and as demand for cargo picks up, orders should start flocking in.
