Boeing: Free Cash Flow Machine - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,569 clicks) Boeing is poised to generate substantial free cash flows over the next couple of years. The order book remains strong due to a massive backlog that will cause new orders to scale back. Investors should use the decline in the stock to buy alongside the massive stock buyback afforded by the large cash flows. Like most industrials and the market in general, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is trading down due to weakness in China. The stock peaked in February and is down $28 from those highs. Oddly though, Boeing is seeing plenty of orders from the likes of China and India questioning why the stock is even down at all. Along with a strong backlog, investors should consider owning this airplane manufacturer despite the market woes and weakness in China economic data. The biggest news is that Boeing got a deal for over 300 aircraft from China. The airplane manufacturer though has to build a plant in China for some of the functions to complete the airplanes. Naturally, this brings up concerns that China will use this deal as an attempt to gain more internal knowledge to manufacturer airplanes itself. The deal includes three Chinese firms that will split the order. Remember that Boeing estimates that China will need 6,330 planes over the next 20 years so this order is only a drop in that bucket. The biggest long-term issue being whether Boeing splits those orders with European competitor Airbus or if China uses these inroads into manufacturing its own airplanes. As well, the company got a $2.5 billion order from India to purchase Apache and Chinook helicopters. Sure the 2015 orders numbers aren't keeping up with the levels from previous years, but the backlog is so enormous that it impacts the ability to fulfill new orders in a timely manner. At the end of Q2 , the backlog sat at 5,700 commercial airplane orders for $489 billion. Despite record deliveries, Boeing only delivered 197 commercial airplanes for Q2. At that rate, the company will take 28.9 quarters, or roughly 7 years, to fulfill the current backlog without adding any new orders. Based on the delivery schedule and the enormous backlog, investors shouldn't expect orders to outpace deliveries in the coming years. Airlines needing planes are going to find other options than purchasing a plane that won't be delivered until 2023. According to internal Boeing order numbers , the airline manufacturer only had 449 orders this year through September 22. The company though only delivered 503 planes through August of the year suggesting Boeing will reach 560 to 575 deliveries at this point in time. The China orders won't place Boeing on a pace to match the 1,500 order levels of the last couple of years, but the market should already know that the only goal at this point is growing the production and delivery pace. Considering it is clear Boeing has no order issue, the question with the stock is a matter of valuation. With the stock trading at $131, the valuation is now down to $89 billion. According to analysts at Sterne Agee, Boeing is forecast to generate free cash flow of $6.6 billion, $7.2 billion, $8.6 billion, and $8.9 billion during the 2015 to 2018 time period. The total amounts to $31.3 billion in the four year period. The estimates seem solid considering the company generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion during Q2 alone. The company turned around and spent $2.0 billion on stock buybacks and $0.6 billion on dividends. After capital expenditures, cash and debt levels were similar to the Q1 levels. In essence, the $2.6 billion returned to shareholders during Q2 is virtually repeatable each quarter. With a market cap of only $88.7 billion, Boeing can reduce the quarterly buybacks and still keep a net payout yield (dividend yield plus net buyback yield) above 10%. At that level, Boeing compares very favorably to other industrials including Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ). The stock probably has lower risk than Caterpillar that faces headwinds from China while the growth of service economy in China likely provides a tailwind for the likes of Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Boeing remains a perfect example of investors focusing on the wrong metrics. At a backlog over seven years long, investors need to shift focus to free cash flows. The recent decline in the stock provides an ideal time to own the stock with yields soaring and the outlook unchanged. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
