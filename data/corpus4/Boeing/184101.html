Boeing: Why China's Order Might Be A Big Disappointment - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Chinese order will be a mix of 737, 777 and 787. Addition to the order book will be less than the announced 300 orders. On his visit to the United States, Chinese President Xi brought Boeing (NYSE: BA ) an order for 300 airframes. In this article I will have a look at what is currently known about the order and explain why I am not particularly impressed with the order. Figure 2: Infographic Order China (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Rumors of a big order during Xi's visit to the US already arose months before the visit, but over the last few days more and more information became available. Boeing received 300 orders valued at $38 bn, according to the jet maker . 250 or 83% of the ordered airframes are orders for narrow body airframes, while the remaining 50 orders are for Boeing's wide body products. No further details have been disclosed yet, but it can be assumed that the narrow body order will be a mix of current generation 737-800 airframes and Boeing's upcoming MAX8 airframe. The order probably will also consist of the discounted Boeing 777s and the Boeing 787. So far Chinese airlines ordered 179 777 airframes and 41 of the new Boeing 787. Discounts for the current Boeing 777 probably are as high as 60%, while discounts for the Boeing 787 are close to 50%. Given the popularity of the 777 among Chinese carriers and the discounts on the airframe, it can be expected that the Boeing 777 will be part of the order mix. So far Chinese airlines ordered 41 Boeing 787 airframes. Given the expected growth on the Chinese aircraft market, order inflow for the Boeing 787 is most certain. Despite the size and value of the order, the order itself might be a bit of a disappointment. The main reason for that is that the order will not add as much to the backlog as is believed by many. Currently, Boeing has 5710 unfilled orders, the addition of 300 airframes would imply a 5% addition to the backlog. However, it has to be noted that some orders were already listed in Boeing's order book as 'Unidentified Customers'. This is common practice among jet makers, but does skew the image of Boeing receiving 300 orders. Currently unidentified customers ordered 91 737s, 17 777s and 36 787s. This means that some of those 300 orders were already in Boeing's order book; it yet remains to be seen how big that portion is. What is certain is that Boeing will be adding less than 300 orders to its order book. Although the order is quite big, for Boeing this is not the order that will add a big chuck of market share. In June, Airbus (OTCPK: EADSF ) received a Chinese commitment for the purchase of 45 A330s and on the South East Asian market Airbus' A320neo is still leading with a 70% market share. Looking at the orders for Boeing and Airbus, it can be concluded that the order is nothing more but the duopoly being utilized by Chinese customers, where both jet makers will have an about equal share on the market. What can be concluded is that despite the order being announced as an order for 300 jets valued at $38 bn, the addition to the order book will be considerably less. On the other hand, there are still a lot more orders to be won on the Chinese market in the coming years, meaning that the long term picture still looks bright for Boeing. Combining that with the fact that Boeing shares dipped on concerns about cash flow and a lower full year guidance , I think Boeing shares are valued nicely for long-term investors to buy.
