ETF Hub Oct 13 2015, 12:31 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing’s ( BA -0.4%) KC-46A completed the first test of the refueling systems on its new KC-46A Pegasus tanker last week, according to a report from Defense News. In an Oct. 8 test, Boeing's test aircraft successfully extended the "drogue" refueling baskets, and the next day the test plane extended its rigid, telescoping boom; the KC-46A is expected to be able to refuel from both the boom and the drogues on a single flight without having to land to be reconfigured. The U.S. Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46A tankers to recapitalize its aging tanker fleet, and Boeing is committed to deliver the first 18 tankers by August 2017.
