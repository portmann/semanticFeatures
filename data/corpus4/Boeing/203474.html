Boeing: Bright Future On Sale - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha J Mintzmyer , Value Investor's Edge (183 clicks) Boeing (BA) is well positioned for future growth in commercial airlines, Air Force renewal projects, and future space exploration initiatives. Despite BA's strong performance, the recent market chaos has knocked over 13% off the share price despite long-term catalysts remaining intact. BA pays a 2.7% dividend with impressive growth history. BA has free cash flow capacity to continue to substantially boost dividend payments over the next 5 years. I believe a fair price range for BA, based on free cash flow multiples, is $113 to $158, representing fair value upside of over 20%. Challenges to BA include reliance on government spending, the potential for a China-led global slowdown, and a lack of success in cyber-security and UAV platforms. In the latest edition of my value series, I am highlighting a quality firm trading at a reasonable price. Although I am an active investor and trader, who commonly scours for market disconnects as part of my Value Investor's Edge research service , I keep approximately 70-80% of my assets in indexes and blue chips. My focus for this portion of my portfolio is quality companies at a reasonable price- over the past 3 months I have highlighted a dozen firms that I find attractive based on the current market pricing. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is a strong aerospace and defense firm that continues to post impressive free cash flow and faces a bright future in all of its business lines. Boeing's free cash flow has room to grow and deserves a slightly higher multiple in my opinion. BA is currently trading for just over 15x its 2014 free cash flow, with substantial growth potential remaining. I believe BA is fairly priced between $113 and $158 based on a multiple to 3-year average free cash flow. With shares trading around $129, the recent market panic is offering a very attractive entry point for a long-term focused investor with current upside of over 20% to a fair valuation level. Strong Trending Dividend, but Cyclical Dependent BA has impressively grown their dividend over the past 10 years, but they do not shy away from flat payouts during challenging years. Despite the 4 year slump of unimpressive growth, BA's 10-y and 5-y growth rates are still very impressive, at 13.8% and 16.7% respectively. The current (2015 projected) payout of $3.64 is easily covered by free cash flow, with a 40% payout for the 3-y average and only a 38% payout of 2014 free cash flow. Even if growth slows down, there is still financial room for several years of double digit growth. BA has reduced their share count by 15% over the past 10.5 years, which is a positive metric, but nowhere near as impressive as the dividend growth. Ultimately Boeing is what I refer to as a "fair weather" repurchaser. The firm buys back stock when firing on all cylinders and the pricing is naturally higher. When times are tough, the company gets defense and commits the cardinal sin of issuing equity at basement levels. Note the huge jump in 2009 at average prices of $44-$60. The stock is $145 today. That type of nonsense speaks to poor confidence and discipline at the board level, especially as BA has plowed $10B into repurchases over the last 18 months alone! That capital in 2009 would have reduced the share count by over 25% alone, now it's only good for an 8% reduction. BA's actions speak to a firm that is likely to overpay for their shares and lack the confidence to invest during down-cycles. I am especially harsh here in part to balance out my appreciation for everything else about the business. Unlike most other analysts who focus heavily on dividend growth metrics, I admire a firm that keeps the dividend flat during hard times. Throwing away precious cash when the stock is dirt cheap is an abysmal management decision, and BA earns my appreciation for their fantastic dividend control. Over the past 10 years, BA has spent $16.47B (net) to reduce the share count by approximately 96M, or approximately $171.59 per share. This horrendous figure represents the effect of a timid fair-weather repurchase policy. While I certainly agree with BA repurchasing shares over the past 18 months, considering the tremendous growth prospects, I hope they will be more aggressive during the next downturn. Unlike most other defense-related firms, Boeing has a thriving commercial segment that comprises the majority of its revenues and a large portion of corporate profits. Boeing has published a convincing long-term market overview , which was recently updated to reflect additional projected demand from China for a total of $950B in aircraft over the next twenty years. India is also a huge player in rising global demand, and BA estimates $240B worth of orders over the next two decades. Whether or not China is slowing down, the demand growth is huge, and many international airlines are flying outdated fleets. Although the US airline fleet has undergone tremendous renewal following the Great Recession and subsequent mergers and recaps, US carriers overall have lots of improvement and expansion capacity left to go. The following snapshot from Bloomberg shows that US carriers have 5 of the 6 oldest fleets. Note that all 4 "Majors" are represented in the 'top 6.' The US Air Force operates a clearly aging inventory , and Boeing recently won (after over a decade of struggling and controversy) a tanker renewal contract worth up to $80B total. Boeing is a major competitor in the next-gen stealth bomber contract. Boeing might also be eligible to compete for future fighter expansion projects or a new transport initiative to replace aging C-5s or C-130s. The Air Force also needs to replace its T-38 trainer aircraft and is soliciting contracts for a 2017-award timeframe. With 350 "T-X" models projected, this contract could easily exceed $10B. Space exploration and general re-supply are rapidly shifting towards privatization. Boeing is among a small group of firms that have the potential to develop these advanced platforms, especially if government funding is not guaranteed. Boeing has a strong history of development and innovation in this field, and if future Administrations decide to re-energize NASA, I would anticipate BA as a strong competitor for the majority of the top-dollar contracts. The US Air Force is rapidly expanding their Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or "drone" platforms and is building up new pilots and expanding training programs in anticipation of further expanding mission flow. Boeing has missed out on most of the major platforms to-date, including the Reaper and Global Hawk platforms, each with a total pricetag of over $10B. BA is well behind the curve, but in the long-term, 10-20 year time horizon, Boeing has the capacity to win substantial contracts. UAVs are far more economical to operate and they have proven to be effective combat support platforms for all Services. Although Boeing's long-term revenue is stabilized by a substantial backlog, secured with significant prepayments, the growth of the commercial airline industry, which comprises the majority of BA's revenue and profit, is clearly tied to global economic growth. The primary thesis behind Boeing's rosy forecasts is a sharp increase in Asian air travel as an inevitable result of economic growth. Boeing has recently boosted their forecast for Chinese airplane orders despite recent speculation that the Chinese market is rapidly slowing. If China plunges into a recession, or even a period of Japan-style stagnation, these forecasts could fail to fully develop and Boeing's growth will obviously suffer. Although Boeing makes the lion's share of its revenue, and substantial profits, from its commercial segments, the Department of Defense is a major customer and has partnered with Boeing on several lucrative contracts in the past. Boeing was the ultimate winner of the KC-X tanker project (KC-46 Pegasus), and is a major competitor for the next-generation stealth bomber . However, Boeing has been struggling to deliver the KC-46 on schedule and budget, and although the potential program size is up to 400 airplanes at $80B total, the Air Force has only 'locked in' 179, and I'm doubtful that even that amount is enforceable. Boeing is struggling to gain global acceptance of the latest tanker model, placing them at the behest of the Defense budget. The US Air Force flies a massive fleet of old airplanes, including the B-52 Stratofortress and the C-5 Galaxy , not to mention the shockingly outdated tankers. Despite the clearly aging inventory , the current budget is very tight and any hint of an economic pullback could further nix any major fleet renewal plans. Boeing is likely to be a serious competitor for nearly all of the Air Force contracts, so any budget impacts will likely impact BA's future profits. On an additional bearish note, BA's cybersecurity business, which has seen strong government traction, recently sold off its commercial projects. BA continues to focus on government projects , but I am not optimistic regarding their growth potential here. The Air Force has been steadily upgrading and enhancing its unmanned platforms (UAVs), and Boeing has largely been left in the dust. Both the surveillance-focused RQ-4 Global Hawk and the strike-equipped MQ-9 Reaper represent massive programs, at over $10B each. General Atomics and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ) have been the major players and Boeing has only produced conceptual platforms. Boeing had multiple impressive prototypes dating back to 2005, but they haven't produced significant Defense contracts. There is some promise if Boeing can secure a meaningful contract in some type of "UAV-conversion" project similar to the recent F-16 conversion . With the Air Force looking to retire a significant amount of F-16s and F-15s over the next two decades, there is significant testing and combat application potential in this pipeline. Regardless, Boeing is behind the curve in terms of major projects, and I would expect to see an uphill battle for the next mainline strike and reconnaissance platforms. As previously discussed, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow (NYSE: FCF ) ratio in determining valuation targets. My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield). With a company like BA with an impressive product pipeline and a bright future in both the commercial and defense sectors, I am comfortable with average multiples of 12.5-17.5x (5.7-8% yield). The average FCF figures are shown in the chart below. The three-year figures are considerably higher due to steadily improving performance since a weak performances in 2010 and 2011 caused by both temporary aviation hiccups and defense budget cuts. Applying a 12.5-17.5x multiple to the 3-year average results in a 'fair' market capitalization of $77B to $107B. With 679.5M shares outstanding as of 15 July 2015, the fair price range for BA is $113 to $158. I believe this range is fair, perhaps even slightly conservative, as BA arguably deserves a premium due to its fantastic performance and strong product pipeline potential. I recently read an outstanding report on Boeing from Valuentum, which I wanted to offer to my readers as an additional quality report . Their report derived a valuation range of $113 to $169 based on a customized discounted cash flow model. My model is a simpler approach based on not adjusting for cost of equity or debt and assigning a "quality factor" discount instead of a weighted-cost metric. No approach is perfect, and a smart investor will consider multiple angles before committing. BA has surged over the past 5 years, but the next 10-20 years have even more potential as the global aerospace industry continues to surge, space exploration is rapidly shifting towards privatization, the US Air Force has multiple fleet renewal projects, and Boeing has established a strong foothold in the defense cyber services sector. The recent market panic and pullback have allowed investors to acquire a stake in Boeing for an attractive price. I believe shares of BA have compelling upside until they reach their "fully valued" mark. Boeing is clearly correlated to the global economy, but its product pipelines offer strong general portfolio diversification, making them an attractive component of a diversified blue chip portfolio. I do not currently own any BA shares, but will heavily consider acquiring equity at this level when cash becomes available. They are currently #1 on my 'blue chip buying list.'
