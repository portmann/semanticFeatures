The FedEx Order: More Than Just Another Mega-Order For Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing 767F is the main workhorse on the cargo market. Order from FedEx gives Boeing work for another 5-8 years. On the 21st of July FedEx Express, a fully owned subsidiary of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX ), ordered 50 Boeing 767-300F aircraft. Two years ago I wrote an article in which I looked at the fleet renewal for cargo airlines. In the article I marked Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and FedEx Express as the winners: Boeing has a lot to offer on the cargo market, while FedEx already started renewing their fleet prior to demand for air cargo increasing again. In the article I also stated that FedEx would likely order the Boeing 757 or Boeing 767 and Boeing 777. Eventually FedEx preferred the capacity and fuel efficiency of the Boeing 767 over the Boeing 757, despite the Boeing 757 being a cheaper alternative. From 2013 until the 21st of July 2015 FedEx ordered only 7 767F airframes, leaving Boeing waiting for an almost certain mega order. Figure 1: Boeing 767-300F Render (Source: boeing.com ) The first rumors about a mega order from FedEx arose at the beginning of July. The initial rumor was that FedEx might also order up to 10 Boeing 777F aircraft next to ordering 50 Boeing 767-300F. This deal would have a catalogue value of $13.1 bn. In the days after another rumor arose, namely that it would order at least 25 Boeing 767-300F aircraft with a value of $5 bn. Eventually Boeing received an order for 50 Boeing 767-300Fs with purchase rights for another 50. If the purchase rights will be fully exercised the order is worth over $20 bn at list prices and approximately $10 bn after discounts. Besides the value of the order, Boeing will be particularly pleased with the order for the following reasons: The order shows customer preference for the Boeing 767-300F The Boeing 767-300F is helping Boeing in expanding market share on the air cargo market. The Boeing 767-300F is being used as replacement for older Airbus (OTCPK: EADSF ) freighters, while the Airbus A330-200F was being outsold at a 3:1 ratio before the FedEx order and now is being outsold at a 4.5:1 ratio. The Boeing 767-300F is beating today's competition and replacing yesterday's aircraft. None of the top 3 freighter airlines operate the Airbus A330-200F Including orders and replacement I estimated that Boeing's share will rise to 70% and market share for the Boeing 767F will rise to 23%. Additionally it has to be noted that FedEx Express might need another 40 orders to replace all of the older aircraft. So it is very likely that FedEx will use its purchase rights for another 50 aircraft. The Boeing 767 backlog started shrinking prior to the FedEx order, with just 2 years of production left. Adding the 50 orders placed by FedEx to the 35 orders in backlog, Boeing now has the production line filled for almost 5 years at a production rate of 1.5 aircraft per month. If FedEx exercises the purchase rights for an additional 50 airframes Boeing has its production slots filled up all the way until Q2 2022. The Boeing 767F is replacing older Airbus and McDonnell Douglas aircraft The Boeing 767F is outselling the Airbus A330F at a 4.5:1 ratio Boeing potentially has its production line for the Boeing 767 filled up until 2022 The order placed by FedEx is merely to replace old fleet members, additional orders can be expected to grow fleets to cope with increasing demand The Boeing 767F is aiding Boeing in expanding its market share on the freighter market With the Boeing 767F, Boeing is positioned very well on the cargo market Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
