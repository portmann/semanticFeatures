Norwegian Air says no share issue needed to pay for Boeing order | Reuters Related: Stocks, Bonds, Markets, Airlines OSLO Oct 22 Budget carrier Norwegian Air  will use a mix of commercial loans and U.S. export credits to pay for its new order of 19 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, and does not need to issue new shares, the company told Reuters on Thursday. The order for 19 planes, which according to Boeing  have a combined list price of $5 billion, will be owned by Norwegian's subsidiary Arctic Aviation Assets Limited (AAA). "We will prefer to use the commercial (loan) market," Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss said. "We do not need to issue shares."

Boeing said the order was the largest any European firm had made for Dreamliners.
