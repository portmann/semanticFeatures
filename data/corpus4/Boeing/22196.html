Boeing Commercial Orders And Deliveries Q1 2015 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is almost on track to meet its annual delivery target. EPS guidance for Q1 2015 probably is conservative. On Wednesday, Sterne Agee said they expected Boeing to deliver 177 airframes, down 3 units from their previous estimate. Based on the lower expected deliveries the firm cut its EPS for Q1 2015 from $1.90 to $1.80. On Friday, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) disclosed its Q1 2015 deliveries and they are above the estimates that Sterne Agee provided. Year-over-year deliveries rose by 14% (23 units) due to higher deliveries on the 737, 767 and 787. According to current production rate of 42 aircraft per month Boeing should have produced/delivered 126 units, 5 units more than it delivered during the first quarter. The production rate for the Boeing 747 currently is 1.5 units per month, the 4 deliveries are in line with that. The Boeing 767 deliveries are up by 5 units and merely depend on the delivery schedule of airlines. The delivery for the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 are in line with the current production rates. According to the production rates Boeing had to produce 187 units. Instead Boeing delivered 184 units, which is caused by lower deliveries on the Boeing 737 and partly compensated for by higher deliveries for the Boeing 767. Figure 1: Quarterly deliveries Boeing Commercial Airplanes (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) In 2014 Boeing deliveries gradually rose during the year due to higher Dreamliner, 737 and 747 deliveries. The low Q1 2014 can be attributed to 737 production of 38 airframes per month. In 2014 this rate increased by 10.5% to 42 per month. Boeing expects to deliver 750-755 units this year, with the current production rates Boeing will deliver 748 units, excluding some early built Dreamliners. In Q1 2015 Boeing delivered 184 units, which is equivalent to almost 25% of its target. During previous years Boeing delivered about 21%-22% of its annual orders in the first quarter. Boeing will produce 2 747 airframes less this year, but other than that there will not be any other rate cuts or hikes. This means that Boeing is well on track on meetings its target, but there is little room for failure. Additionally Boeing should deliver about 5 airframes more in the coming 3 quarters. I think that Boeing will compensate for the lower 737 deliveries during Q1 in the second quarter. If the company is able to deliver 3-4 early built Dreamliners it will indeed end up in the range of 750-755 deliveries as it specified for the 2015 guidance. With the deliveries exceeding Sterne Agee's estimates, I also think the EPS guidance of $1.80 they provided is very conservative, but still above Boeing's estimate. Boeing expects that EPS for Q1 will be 20% of the full year EPS. This means that the company expects Q1 EPS between $1.64-$1.68. Last year Boeing crushed analyst estimates by 13%. The current consensus for Q1 is an EPS of $1.88, which is 15% higher than the guidance Boeing provided. Given that Boeing has a history of crushing its own full year estimates as well as analyst estimates I think the $1.88 consensus is conservative. During Boeing Q1 2015 order inflow was 160 units lower due to lower order inflow for the Boeing 737, but order inflow for the wide body airframes, on which Boeing can book larger profits, was higher. Boeing is almost on track to meets its annual delivery target. EPS guidance for Q1 2015 probably is conservative. Order inflow for narrow body aircraft was low.
