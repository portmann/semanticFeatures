Day 3 At FIA 2016: Narrowbody Dominates, Airbus Cracks On A380 | Seeking Alpha P2F (Passenger to Freighter) programs programs get boost on Day 3. Qatar Airways in talks with Boeing to acquire Boeing 737 and/or Boeing 777. The bi-annual Farnborough International Airshow has started and traditionally the Paris Air Show, Farnborough International Airshow and Dubai Airshow are used as a stage to announce big orders. In this article I will have a look at the order inflow on Day 3 of the air show and notable news items. In the coming days I will be covering news and orders for Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), COMAC, Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ) and Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ). On day 3 order inflow for Boeing was damped quite a bit. Positive, however, was the order inflow for Boeing converted freighters [BCF]. The value of these orders are unknown, but do show confidence and demand for the conversion programs. An unidentified customer ordered 4 conversions of the Boeing 767 Ruili Airlines ordered 6 Boeing 787-9 aircraft. During the Paris Airshow last year, Ruili committed to 60 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. By now half of those are in Boeing's order book Air Europa ordered 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft The firm orders have a catalog value of $3.1B, the market value will be closer to $1.5B. There were no letters of intent or memoranda of understanding. In terms of units Day 3 was a better day for Boeing, but the orders from Day 2 had a higher order value due to the Boeing 747 being part of the order inflow. The orders from EgyptAir and Air Europa already were accounted for in Boeing's order book, classified as 'Unidentified Customers'. This means that Boeing reported 35 orders on Day 3, but the backlog will only grow by 6 units. Day 3 of the air show could have been just another 'day at the office' for Boeing. On Day 2, Airbus announced it will be slashing production rates on the Airbus A380. On Day 3 there was very little Airbus news, DHL will be taking delivery of A330 converted freighters. Synergy Aerospace, the biggest share holder of Avianca Holdings (NYSE: AVH ), ordered 62 Airbus A320neos. The order follows a year after Synergy Aerospace announced a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of the Airbus A320neo The firm orders have a catalog value of $6.7B, the market value will be closer to $3.26B. There were no letter of intents or memorandum of understandings. In terms of units Day 3 was a better day, but the orders from Day 2 had a higher order value due to the Boeing 747 being part of the order inflow. Figure 1: Order overview day 3 Farnborough International Airshow for Boeing and Airbus (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) It is widely known in the industry that Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, is rightful picky on performance and jet maker commitments. Earlier this year the airline refused to function as launch customer for the Airbus A320neo and has canceled some airframes that were past due. Last month I wrote an article about this, in which I said there is a chance for Boeing but I would not be surprised if Qatar Airways sticks with Airbus after all. The past couple of days Boeing and Qatar have been talking for the purchase of up to 30 Boeing 737 airframes. Although I am still not convinced of an actual order for the Boeing 737 the sign to Airbus is clearer than ever. Additionally, Airbus is missing deadlines on the delivery of the Airbus A350 due to issues in the supply chain. With 73 undelivered A350s, Qatar Airways is experiencing some difficulties due to the delays. Qatar Airways is now looking into the purchase of the Boeing 777-300ER to make up for the shortfall in fleet growth. Whereas I view a switch to the Boeing 737 a bit odd due to the absence of early delivery slots (unless Qatar Airways is the airline that will be occupying the slots once destined for Southwest ), I think a Boeing 777-300ER order is not far-fetched. The airline has 34 of the 777-300ER in service, knows the value of the airframe to its network and operations and Boeing is eager to sell the aircraft to fill up its production gap . If both parties are truly interested it should not be hard to strike a deal. On day 3 Embraer, COMAC and Bombardier did not make a single announcement leaving the stage for order announcements for bigger aircraft completely to Boeing and Airbus. Both manufacturers did not impress either announcing just 97 orders. Customer of the day is Synergy Group, which ordered 62 Airbus A320neos. This mega order started out as a Memorandum of Understanding on the Paris Air Show last year and was finalized today. Compared to yesterday total order, commitments and options were down roughly 75%. On day 3 orders were down roughly 50 percent compared to previous years. Boeing started the air show with an 80 units lead over Airbus, but it is very likely that this lead will be completely gone by the end of the air show. Additionally, there is something to be said about this air show in comparison to the previous ones. During previous air shows the share of LoIs (Letter of Intent) and MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding) was relatively high. These order intentions are being firmed up now. This somewhat skews the picture a bit. Last year Volga intended to order the Boeing 747-8F and Synergy Group intended to order the Airbus A320neo, those are almost 80 airframes that were booked as order intentions last year but were firmed up during this year's air show. What we currently are facing is not a weakness in demand, we are facing the piled up order intentions being firmed up and airlines are waiting for aircraft to show in-fleet performance before committing to more. With one day remaining an important thing to look at is the change of commitment and firm orders year-over-year. Total orders and commitments fell by roughly 40%. Firm orders, so far, are down by roughly 30% while commitments are down 50%. Current low oil prices give airlines some flexibility to keep existing fleet members in service, which obviously has an impact on options being taken and firmed up. On the other side, with backlogs stretching multiple years into the future the attractiveness of ordering and even taking options fades somewhat. This is in line with my view that the order books are not bubbles but should decline at some point.
