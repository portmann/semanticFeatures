Facebook: A Note Of Caution - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook actually generates a fairly healthy operating yield and has some wonderful growth ahead of it. Unfortunately, that isn't news and the shares are already priced for perfection. That's always a dangerous sign. We conduct a comparative analysis between Facebook and the seven other businesses you could buy for its market capitalization. Facebook costs more and offers less than other freely available investments. We consider it axiomatic that at the wrong price, even a wonderful company can be a terrible investment. At some point, no matter what the growth characteristics of the underlying business, the stock that supposedly represents the fortunes of that business will be guaranteed to lose money. We want to examine shares of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) with these principles in mind. We'll try to work out whether it has more upside than downside from these levels. We'll do that by looking at the financials of the company. We'll talk briefly about the optimism surrounding the name and we'll conclude with a "what else could you buy?" analysis. The first thing we want to do with any business is review its operating history. We want to work out how much profit the company is making after tax, relative to the amount of capital invested to generate that profit. Working this out provides us an earnings yield, which we can then compare to the earnings yields of other businesses. Facebook has generated a relatively healthy earnings yield of just shy of 11% over the most recent four quarters, which we consider impressive in light of the capital invested here. Now obviously this is a backward looking analysis. The point isn't to offer a history lesson about the recent performance of this company. The point of these sorts of analyses is to perform a gap analysis. Presumably an investor knows for themselves what sort of operational yield they require. They (should) know how much money a business should spin off before they consider investing in it. In our case, we require a 15% operating yield on a business with these risks, assuming the risk free rate is about 2.3% . The value of this "backward looking" exercise for us is to see by how much a given company must grow before it's investment worthy. Since the operating yield at Facebook is below that hurdle (though still quite respectable), we have to say the company's not quite there yet. In addition to the underlying business, we need to review the behavior of the surrogate for the business (the stock). Specifically, we concern ourselves a great deal with the optimism surrounding a name because optimistic forecasts can be terrible for investors. The reason for this is that they set up the conditions for limited upside and massive downside. If the market is overly optimistic about a name, great expectations are already "baked in" to the price. If those expectations are met (i.e. if Facebook executes near perfectly), then the shares may not move much higher, as expectations would simply have been met. If, as is more likely, the company stumbles at some point (as all companies do...they're run by humans and therefore not perfect), many investors will switch polarity and start to question their optimistic worldview. This typically leads to predictable results for the share price. No one can know if Facebook will execute perfectly (and we're amused by people who make bold statements about what will transpire). We can, however, spot when others are pricing shares for perfection. This is one of those times. Specifically, at the moment, the PE at Facebook is 94.5 and the forward PE is a (still expensive) 38 . Holding all else equal, then, the market is forecasting Facebook to grow its earnings at a CAGR of ~149%. This is a very optimistic forecast for two reasons. First, the optimism may not be warranted in light of the continued popularity of Youtube as a video platform. As video content creators ourselves (with a decent sized subscriber base), we can personally attest to the fact that we aren't making plans to build content for Facebook anytime soon. Second, the optimism seems misplaced in light of the most recent trends in Facebook's revenue and earnings. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to a seasoned stockbroker who shared a relative value presentation with us in the Spring of 2000. It was a single powerpoint slide divided in two. On one side were three companies: AOL.COM, Yahoo, and Ebay. On the other side were Kodak, Sears, CAT, Kmart, Nike, American Airlines, Boeing, Aetna, Barnes and Noble, Alcoa and Marriott. You could buy the technology high fliers for $200 billion, or you could buy the more traditional businesses (many of which have been lackluster since, but many of which have done very well) for $183 billion. The point was that relative valuation matters. We sold our expensive stuff that day and have never really looked back. As we've said many times on this forum (and elsewhere, to the detriment of our social lives), investing is at heart a relativistic process. Investors need to decide whether to buy a government bond or a REIT. Or whether they should buy a retail outlet or a high flying growth company. The opportunity costs are always present. If we buy X, we forego Y. It's with this in mind that we want to do a comparative analysis between Facebook and other companies. We're going to pick an industry that we believe has high growth prospects and exceedingly high barriers to entry: railroads and the Bank of Montreal. We chose railroads because they have excellent growth characteristics also. Over the past 10 years, the average rail has grown earnings at a CAGR of just shy of 15%. With continued demographic improvements in the United States, some double digit rate of growth is expected to continue. Thus, we believe a comparison between Facebook and Class I rail is more of an "apples to apples" comparison (really a "growth to growth" comparison) than they might at first appear. At the moment, the market capitalization of Facebook is ~$276 billion. For comparative purposes, the chart below outlines the market caps of the six publicly traded Class I railroads and the Bank of Montreal. Source: Gurufocus, Company financials When we compare what investors are getting for their Facebook market capitalization to what else they could do with that money, we see some interesting disconnects. For example: The average PE (excluding Facebook) is ~18% of that of Facebook. The average yield is 2.18%, as opposed to Facebook's zero. Average return on equity is about 74% greater with the rails and the bank than at Facebook. The debt levels at the rails and the bank are much higher than Facebook's, highlighting that the one relatively bright spot at Facebook is its capital structure. Earnings growth at Facebook is about twice that of the average growth rate of the "old world" companies over the past year. The question lingers about how much longer this growth can be sustained. If an investor buys Facebook, they receive $2.94 billion of net income. If they buy the other companies, they received ~$17.4 billion of net income (~6 times greater). If an investor buys Facebook, they receive about $3.6 billion of free cash flow. If they buy the basked of other businesses, they receive about $12.835 billion of free cash flow. This is startling to us in light of the high capital expenditures needed in railroads. Thus, the group of rails (for which there are insurmountable barriers to entry) and for which there are attractive growth prospects, trade for a lower multiple and have much higher net income returns. Given the relativistic nature of investing, someone who wants to maximize their returns (the ultimate source of sustainable shareholder wealth) and minimize their risks should sell Facebook and buy every Class I railroad. Facebook is actually generating a fairly decent operating yield. The underlying business is sound and is going to continue on some robust growth path (with occasional, inevitable missteps). The problem is that this isn't news and this growth has already been baked into the price. Thus, if the company executes well, the upside may very well be muted. If the company makes an understandable slip up, shares will react predictably and negatively. Also, when reviewing other growth investments, it's obvious that much more could be had for much less. The shares may continue to rise in price, but this should in no way suggest that the investment has gotten any better, or any less likely to disappoint over a longer time horizon. If you own Facebook, we recommend selling at these levels and buying higher returning, less expensive names. If you were considering buying Facebook, we recommend avoiding it.
