Amazon Taking Longer To Ship To Non-Prime Customers â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. After all these years of Amazon Prime being around, most of us know that a major perk of the subscription service is free, expedited shipping. But it looks like Amazon’s focus on getting packages to Prime customers has resulted in slower deliveries for shoppers who didn’t ante up $99/year for Prime. This is according to online retail analysts at StellaService, who recently told Forbes that Amazon’s regular shipping is starting to slip. â€œThere are 40 companies on our list, and Amazon has always been in the top 10,” explains Kevon Hills, VP of research for StellaService. “This year, weâ€™ve seen them fall outside of the top 10, which is the first time weâ€™ve seen that happen.” Since Prime customers are not only paying for the guaranteed delivery dates, but also tend to be more regular and loyal customers of Amazon, it would seem to make sense that the company is going to great lengths to keep those shoppers happy. But is it happening at the expense of the millions of casual Amazon customers? “I think the focus, for them, has shifted from standard shipping to being fast and making sure they deliver on that promise for Prime,â€? Hills tells Forbes, who notes that a number of other online retailers have made significant improvements to their shipping — another reason Amazon has dropped down the list. “The industry is getting faster, and weâ€™ve seen Amazon fall off a little bit.” Amazon Expands One-Hour Delivery Service To Baltimore, Miami Amazon Introduces Free Shipping On Some Small Items For All Customers Their standard shipping has gotten a bit slow, generally when you order an item, it takes at least 2-3 business days before it leaves the warehouse, and then another 2-3 days for the delivery company to get it to you. In he past, items used to get a tracking number within a day, along with an initial scan. I think it may be due to their order system. To better visualize it, imagine a grocery store with 2 checkout lanes, but only 1 cashier. Lane 1 is for premium customers, and Lane 2 is for the non premium customers. If both lanes have people waiting, then the cashier will ignore lane 2 until lane 1 is empty, and then go back to servicing lane 2; stopping whenever a premium customer joins lane 1. In my case, I ordered a pack of 8 eneloop rechargeable batteries on a Monday, got a tracking number really early in the morning on Thursday, and got them in the mail on the following Monday. At the same time, I ordered a 24V AC adapter from china,and the ems shipping service provided a tracking number, and it arrived on the same day (USPS). While I understand that amazon needs to offer fast service to justify the prime cost, they also need to ensure that standard shipments do not suffer too many delays. e.g., if the item has not left the warehouse within 36 hours of the order, then drop it into the amazon prime priority status to ensure that standard orders can at least get a sub 48 hour processing time. Iâ€™m not all that impressed with their Prime shipping lately. I typically order something from Amazon every week â€” and nary a month goes by when at least one “prime” order isnâ€™t a day (or more) late. The products they ship via USPS, or via FedEx or UPS but hand off to the postoffice for final delivery, seem to be most likely to arrive late. Itâ€™s frankly amazing to me that they pretend this convoluted process is worthy of the phrase â€œguaranteed to arrive byâ€¦.â€? or appropriate for customers paying an extra $99 a year. A major issue is that Amazon provides no means by which the customer can choose which delivery service they prefer, even if they are willing to pay extra. You have no idea which carrier they will use until after youâ€™ve placed your order, and receive an email that your order has been shipped. So if you know UPS (or another carrier) has been unreliable in serving your house or your neighborhood, itâ€™s a crap shoot as to whether youâ€™ll be stuck with that carrier. Contrast Amazonâ€™s policy with that of other online merchants such as BHPhoto, which often gives you 7 or 8 different delivery choices from different carriers.
