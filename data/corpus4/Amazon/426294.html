Those seeking to have a bite of food delivered can do so by using Amazon’s Prime Now app, where they can view participating restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and track the status of their delivery. With the service Amazon says it provides customers with free one-hour delivery with no menu markups, guaranteeing that customers pay the same price as they do at the restaurant or Amazon will refund the price of the item. That last bit of information comes just a week after Postmates, another food delivery company, came under fire from users who say their estimated bills jumped up significantly when their food was actually delivered. While in some cases, customers noticed the significant price jump included not only service and delivery fees, others found no evidence of where the additional costs were coming from.
