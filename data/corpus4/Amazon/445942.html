Here's some ads for your phone amazon deals phones moto g Blu subsidized ADS lock screen Prime members In the market for a new phone, but donâ€™t want to pay retail? Amazon is offering $50 off unlocked Android smartphones, but that discount comes with a slightly big catch: the e-commerce giant gets to pre-load the device with its own apps and send ads to the lock screen anytime it wants. Amazon announced the deal on Wednesday, noting that it would be offered to members of its $99/year (or $10/month) Prime subscription service who purchase the Motorola Moto G and the BLU R1 HD Android phones. Amazon has long sold discounted, ad-subsidized versions of its own Kindle and Kindle Fire e-readers and tablets, but this is the first time the e-tailer has used ads to subsidize the cost of a device made by a third party. In addition to coming loaded with all of Googleâ€™s traditional Android-based apps, Amazon will showcase its own shopping, video streaming, and music apps on the devices. With the discount, customers will pay about $49 for the Blu phone, and $149 for the Moto G. Still, that doesnâ€™t include the price of a Prime membership. Though Amazon is offering this deal now, it will still be a few weeks until buyers get their new phones, as they aren’t being released until July 12.
