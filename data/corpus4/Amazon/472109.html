WSJ: Apple negotiating itself out of TV deals - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 28 2016, 15:41 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor In negotiations with The Walt Disney Company early last year, Apple ( AAPL +1%) demanded an extended invariable monthly per-viewer rate to license Disney's channels. Other negotiations with 21st Century Fox and CBS Corporation ( CBS ) reportedly hit similar walls. The separation of terms between Apple and major cable networks signals Apple's demands as too aggressive or programming too expensive ( Google has this issue as well). Networks fear a specialized deal with Apple may reduce the amount of money they can generate from traditional cable distributors. Apple's style of negotiation has also reportedly not aided its efforts. Senior vice president of Internet Software Services Eddy Cue has let media executives know that Apple has time to wait and will eventually get its way. While looking for new areas to grow , Apple has so far not significantly innovated or disrupted in a TV industry it could stand to gain mightily from. Though it is making some effort , other companies ( Netflix , Amazon ) are taking it upon themselves to set the bar. IMHO: Its too late. The networks have their own distribution now and unless Apple disrupts their ability to distribute their own apps and tools there is just no reason to leverage the iTunes network for content unless its original. Hulu, network specific streaming, netflix etc. The entire industry has over-the-topped not just the network but also legacy providers like Apple. Netflix will be hitting that same wall over the next decade.
