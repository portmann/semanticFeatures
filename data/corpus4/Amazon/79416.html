Amazon's Dirty Little Secret, Free Same Day Delivery Isn't Free - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Items shipped via same day Prime can cost more than items fulfilled by the standard Prime shipping. Amazon seems to be targeting affluent areas that are less cost focused. It's no surprise that Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) customers are embracing last week's free same-day shipping announcement. Who wouldn't want to spend more time with their family rather than run errands? Time is a valuable commodity and many people are willing to pay a little extra for convenience which is good, because the cost of free shipping may be embedded in the price of the items. It's not apparent though so consumers will likely spend more for products at the same time that Amazon builds brand loyalty. Over the years Amazon has been accused of ignoring profitability to gain market share but in this case, it looks like there will be little if any hit to margins. Last week, Amazon began offering free same-day shipping to Prime subscribers in 14 major metropolitan areas, delivering products by 9PM if ordered by noon. The areas receiving service seem to be focused on an income demographic more than geographic region. For example, the New York City is covered but not all of the boroughs, why Brooklyn ( home of Norah Jones and Anne Hathaway ) but not the Bronx ? If it was due to geographic issues, why include Hoboken New Jersey? In my humble opinion, it's because trendy places populated by young, affluent people are less price sensitive and more willing to pay up for convenience. So let's run a test on cost. The item I lose most when traveling, hands down, is my Bluetooth headset. I've donated several to the Metro North lost and found over the years not to mention airlines. Comparing the cost of a Plantronics Voyager Edge headset by buying through different parties on the Amazon platform reveals a wide variety of prices. Through a third party (including shipping) the cost is $102.99 while it is $123.99 for Prime delivery but it jumps to $127.99 for Prime same day delivery. The difference between fulfilled by Prime and fulfilled by same-day Prime are $4.00 or 3%. Not a lot of difference to a consumer but when you consider that Amazon's Free Cash Flow yield is only 2% ($1949/$88988) it matters very much to the company. Ensuring that products fulfilled through prime same-day delivery embed the cost of shipping means that if this service is rolled out in a larger scale, margins will not degrade. This isn't the first time that Amazon padded pricing to offset shipping costs. In February 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against Amazon for encouraging third parties to inflate the price of their items to cover shipping costs. The logic was that since Amazon charged for Prime membership, the cost of shipping was embedded in the membership price and by encouraging price inflation, Amazon was violating its own agreement that shipping would be free. The case went into arbitration in December 2014 which is considerably better than the judge finding in favor of the plaintiffs. If the financial claim had been substantial, offering "free shipping" could have opened the door to lawsuits but since it will be settled in arbitration, it should be considered a win for Amazon. As this service becomes more widely rolled out, it would be nice to see price parity between Prime and same day Prime fulfilled items. However, investors can feel confident that this new service is not likely to degrade margins.
