At $800 Per Share, Would Amazon be Undervalued? - Modest Money Itâ€™s that time of year when every other parcel that drops through your door is emblazoned with the cheekily-grinning Amazon logo. The â€˜everything storeâ€™ is clearly still at the heart of many consumersâ€™ holiday shopping plans and, consequently, their stock continues to rise at rocket-like speeds. According to analyst firm Pacific Crest Securities, the rise of the retail giant – and indeed ecommerce itself – looks set to continue with experts predicting that ecommerce will likely make up 20% of the total retail industry within the next five years . Retail isnâ€™t the only area in which Amazon (AMZN) is heading for the stratosphere, though. Although Jeff Bezosâ€™ company doesnâ€™t break out its cloud revenue figures, the web services division of Amazon achieved $5 billion in revenue in 2014 , finally proving that theyâ€™re not just about iPhone cases and cheap laptops. Amazon has an impressive history of growth. In fact, once it had hit the $1 billion mark, it continued to grow faster from that point than Microsoft,Â  Oracle and Salesforce.com. The only firm to beat them was – you guessed it – Google. Pacific Crest now estimate Amazonâ€™s individual share price at $800, an increase of 20% from current prices. CEO and founder Bezos is himself enjoying a similar rise to meteoric valuation with his net worth now estimated at something approaching $35 billion. That perhaps explains why he now shuns talk of retail, instead spending most of his time tweeting about his latest endeavour, the Blue Origin private spaceflight firm (and what heâ€™d like to do to presidential candidate Donald Trump). The majority of Bezosâ€™ wealth is held in Amazon shares, the value of which for many years was questionable; the retailer had, after all, endured year-after-year of sizeable losses. However, their shares have now increased by more than 100% following two consecutive quarters of new income. The tides are clearly turning and both Bezosâ€™ and his companyâ€™s wealth is looking far more assured. Although Amazonâ€™s cloud computing division is performing as strongly as ever, ecommerce is where Amazon still scores big time. Pacific Crestâ€™s analysts note that online shopping is expected to grow to total sales of 30% in the next five years – an increase of 7%. You need only look to this yearâ€™s stellar Black Friday event, during which Amazon enjoyed a humungous 36% of all online shopping spending . Compare that to Best Buyâ€™s 8.23% and Walmartâ€™s 3.35%, and it is clear that Jeff and co. dominated the USâ€™ busiest of shopping days. If Black Friday continues itâ€™s foray into other markets (the UK, for example, have taken to the super sales day with gusto), Amazonâ€™s cross-continent penetration will benefit the companyâ€™s stock price even further. But letâ€™s get back to that estimated $800 share price. Is it fair? Or is it in fact undervaluing a company which simply isnâ€™t â€˜justâ€™ an online retailer any more? Indeed, the most-visible part of their business accounts for 90% of their top line, but investors are more interested in the bottom line and Amazonâ€™s Web Services division is the one to watch. It isnâ€™t consumer-facing, but it is a powerhouse in the land of cloud computing and is responsible for much of their recent ascent into profitability. Does that make them a cloud hosting business rather than a retailer? Certainly, looking in from the outside, it seems not, but the figures tell a different story.
