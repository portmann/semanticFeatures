Download Free App, Get Free $10 Amazon Credit â€” My Money Blog August 1, 2016 By Jonathan Ping 19 Comments Seems easy enough.  If you have an Android device including Amazon Fire Tablets, download the Hay Day app for free and get $10 Amazon appstore credit.   I have no idea what the game is about, but if the credit is indeed only for apps then I can buy an educational app for my preschooler.   (We like the Endless series by Originator , and Endless Alphabet is free with Amazon Underground.) For a limited time, customers who download Hay Day from Amazon Appstore between August 1, 2016 and August 31, 2016 will receive a $10 credit toward purchase of digital content in Amazon Appstore. Only customers who have not previously downloaded Hay Day from Amazon Appstore are eligible for this offer. Update: This is showing up for me as a $10 Amazon credit towards anything shipped and sold by Amazon.   Just add any items over $10 that is shipped and sold by Amazon to your cart, and you should see this.   I just added some enzymatic dental chews for my dogs for $12.08 and saw this: Other people are seeing this too.   As of 8/3, they added the following sentence to the terms and conditions: “Please note, it may take up to 48 hours for you to receive an e-mail confirming that the $10 Amazon credit has been applied to your account.” I would wait a day or so and try the checkout method about to see if the credit shows up.   If I didn’t need the dog chews, I’d have used my free $10 towards Harry Potter and the Cursed Child . Hay Day is actually kind of fun – was one of the first apps I downloaded on my iPad – and I still play it, 3+ years later. So how do I verify I have received the credit? The app is downloaded, installed, and run once. But no email confirmation, no change in the balance listed at my MP3 / GC check page. Try this: Add anything to your Amazon cart now, and it should show a $10 off promo credit!   I just bought some enzymatic dental treats for my dogs. I have updated the original post: For me it showed up as a $10 promo credit on my next purchase of anything shipped and sold by Amazon. I’m not getting a $10 promo credit, at least not on normal things from shipped/sold by amazon. It shows my promo from prime day, but not this one. Are you sure you didn’t have another credit left in your account? They just added a note about waiting 48 hours to their terms and conditions.  No, I had just ordered something right before I saw this and had used up all my other credits. Me either, credit didnt show up. Im going to give it a day or two and ill see if it shows up if not ill be contacting amazons customer service lol I actually emailed Amazon after I downloaded the game and asked them where I would find the credit. They said they would make sure my credit was issued. ok so i just read on the amazon store page that it may take up to 48hrs to receive an email confirming the app download and the $10 credit. Worked for me. To see if it worked, I added toilet paper  :~) and a $10 credit showed up right away. Thanks, Jonathan! I bought the app, downloaded, installed and played it.   NO sign of any credit.    Tried putting something in my cart and going to checkout, nothing.   Checked my digital credit balance and its not there either. However the full details of the promotion say: “For a limited time, customers who download Hay Day from Amazon Appstore between August 1, 2016 and August 31, 2016 will receive a $10 credit toward purchase of digital content in Amazon Appstore. Only customers who have not previously downloaded Hay Day from Amazon Appstore are eligible for this offer. Please note, it may take up to 48 hours for you to receive an e-mail confirming that the $10 Amazon credit has been applied to your account. Download Hay Day on one of your compatible devices to receive your $10 Amazon Appstore credit by clicking below.” So this can take 2 days to get the email.   I’m assuming then that it can take 2 days to get the credit. Yes, the 48 hour bit was added recently, it wasn’t there when I first posted about this.   I never got any $10 e-mail, but I did get the credit and used it already, so I’d recommend trying the shopping cart method after waiting 48 hours. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
