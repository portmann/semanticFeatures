Advantage Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The cloud giants are on an acquisition binge. When price sold cloud, it sold Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) cloud. So the also-rans are seeking proprietary advantage, buying or aligning with They're coming after cloud software guys at a good time. The innovators know they need cloud to run their software. It makes sense for them to sell their software and then go to write new software. Wash, rinse, repeat, profit. While the big cloud companies play the "Great Game" of buying what works, the innovators look to what's next. This happened in social with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) (which lost the game), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) (which also lost) and the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) formerly known as Google buying social startups a few years ago. Before that it was Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) buying database applications to control data centers. Before that, Microsoft buying its application vendors. Nothing changes except the playing field. But notice the pattern. The player who enters this phase of the game with a lead tends to keep it. The specific deals being done reveal the markets today's cloud players think are most important, and thus the customers they are going to target. Microsoft, for instance, is as desperate for mobile as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) was a decade ago. Thus, Xamarin. The idea behind the deal is that enterprises serving both iPhones and Androids will use Xamarin to build their cloud-based interfaces, and this will lead the enterprises to favor Microsoft Azure over Amazon. Or, as Steve Ballmer said, "Developers, developers, developers." Amazon's response is NICE , the Italian company that lets mobile workforces standardize on a single cloud, and let the renter of that capacity manage it more easily. Amazon will target companies with mature, global mobile workforces, while Microsoft will target more defensive-minded enterprises that need to catch up. Oracle still needs to get its enterprise customers, and their huge databases, across to cloud platforms so they can turn off older, inefficient corporate data centers. Thus, Ravello. Ravello software lets companies use public clouds as an extension of the data center. Nesting a virtualized application, putting that into a public cloud, then using the central system for coordination, makes sense to these customers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) hasn't exactly bought VMware (NYSE: VMW ), but its new alliance allows the company to back away from the cloud being built by parent EMC (NYSE: EMC ) and continue to serve its customers as they move to public cloud. What all this leads to, in the end, is lock-in, and that's what you look for when you're losing a price war. As everyone is, to Amazon. You claim flexibility, you claim portability, but at the same time you build proprietary features through relationships and acquisitions to assure you of enterprise cash flow. This lets you compensate for economic deficiencies in the underlying infrastructure. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
