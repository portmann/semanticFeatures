Netflix Earnings And Why Growth Oriented Investors Should Own It - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix earnings blew past expectations on earnings, and memberships. The stock is driven by the whimsical nature of the market, sometimes that can work against the bulls (which is arguably the biggest risk factor to owning the stock). The core business is well positioned in the SVOD space, and will likely retain its moat even with added domestic competition. The added scale from international streaming will give Netflix a large enough of a content budget to further differentiate itself away from domestic competitors like HBO GO, Amazon, and Hulu. Also, revenue acceleration and profit margin expansion are highly likely, as Netflix has the ability to increase pricing via a tiered pricing structure. I'm fairly confident that the blowout in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) quarterly earnings will alert Netflix bears of what could be a potential bubble in the making. However, the high valuation is mostly driven by the outward growth potential in Netflix's business model, which has the ability to both scale, and drive pricing power in future quarters. I also think the downside risks to owning Netflix have been overhyped as the company is very careful in its management of cash flow. Admittedly, the timing of content obligations and sales isn't going to be all that great for the foreseeable future, as management has indicated on the live video conference that international streaming contribution margin is expected to decline and stay in the negative. Netflix plans to invest aggressively into international content, so cash burn will last for FY 2015, and perhaps early FY 2016 in the international segment. This is mostly driven by original content, which produces higher levels of engagement in comparison to licensed content from various channels like AMC, and Disney. My view on Netflix is perhaps rose colored, but not without rational reasons. Typically in the technology space, success is extremely binary, and various valuation methods aren't all that effective. Whether Netflix traded at a 800 P/E multiple, or a 50 P/E multiple the business is only going to merit that kind of valuation at some future point based on its business model/process, which requires outward looking assumptions on the core business. In cases like this, a venture capital investment model is more effective. And in the case of Netflix, where profitability is secondary, and growth is a bigger priority, the rational for bidding up the stock is primarily attributed to top line improvements that exceed prior expectations. Netflix's core streaming business in the United surprised earlier forecasts made by Netflix's management, especially in terms of contribution margin, as various content costs are being absorbed into the cost structure of international titles. This indicates that the company's target of2020 contribution margin of 40% is well on track. Admittedly, I'm not exactly certain on how that translates to the net margin, so I'll be updating my long-term analysis with more relevant commentary in a future article. That being the case, international is the most important business segment over at Netflix. This offsets the domestic competitive argument, and creates degrees of differentiation for Netflix, as it relies on an international subscriber base to fund in-house productions. Furthermore, various titles from Walt Disney are expected to be released in the 2016 timeframe, which will give Netflix subscribers' access to various Lucas Films, which gets me extremely excited from more of a product standpoint. Needless to say, Netflix plans to split its content costs down the middle, with 50% dedicated to content licenses, and the other 50% dedicated to in-house content. This allows Netflix to further differentiate itself, as its content spend will be internationally diversified, making Netflix a truly international platform for both film, and TV shows. Here's what I stated earlier in the year: Netflix's SVOD (subscription video on demand) service is attracting significant interest globally. In fact, emerging market subscriber growth should be robust going into FY 2015. Survey data indicates that the number of people interested in subscribing to a SVOD service greatly outweighs those who are already subscribed to one (with the exception of the United States). With Netflix one of the few SVOD services available globally, the growth potential is rather robust. Furthermore, saturation of international broadband households may happen at a much faster rate than what analysts or management's outlook indicates. Subscriber additions came in at 2.6 million versus the 2.25 million that was originally anticipated. Accelerating growth should not be at all surprising, as domestic content is extremely appealing in international markets. I think there's reasonable suspicion that if costs are expected to trend higher, both sales and subscriber additions have room to surprise in future quarters. After all, both the overhead costs and content licensing are going to trend higher as various licenses will cost the company a significant sum of money on a per market basis. Admittedly piracy remains a huge problem in international markets, which puts a bit of a ceiling on pricing. For now, Netflix addresses the issue with a pricing tier for SD, HD, and UHD content. The UHD rollout has been successful for the most part, as various bits of content from licensors will be digitally remastered into the higher quality format, over the foreseeable future. As is, Netflix is currently the largest distributor of UHD content, and that trend will most likely continue. The UHD tier will result in higher ARPU figures over time, as the adoption rate of 4K TVs will continue to trend higher. The average selling price of UHD TVs is expected to trend lower, which indicates quick movement through the adoption curve. After all, if we operate under the assumption that else equal, pricing drops increases demand, UHD TV is going to go main stream over the foreseeable 3 to 5 year time frame, which will result in higher demand for Netflix's UHD subscription service. The two are compliments, and demand for one will drive demand for the other. Usually, I like to compare reported results with the analyst consensus figure, but in the case of Netflix, most of the investor sentiment is based around what management had guided to in the prior quarter in comparison to what will happen in the future quarter. The Q1 2015 revenue forecast was set at $1.398 billion; the actual result was $1.4 billion (so a slight beat). However, the net subscriber figure was above earlier estimates by several hundred thousand members. Admittedly, the impact on revenue wasn't as pronounced, because Netflix provides a trial, and in that trial phase Netflix is completely free. So, the impact on sales will be felt in the next quarter rather than the current quarter. In the case of EPS, I'm willing to make the comparison to consensus estimates, as management doesn't really provide outlook on net income. The consensus analyst estimates for Q1 FY 2015 EPS was $.69. Netflix reported Q1 FY 2015 EPS of $.79. That's basically a $.10 beat on EPS, which is pretty solid considering analysts were anticipating content costs to ramp at a higher rate. Overall, Netflix produced a really solid quarter, which is reflected in the after hours trading activity. The company is extremely well positioned in the SVOD space, despite competition from HBO and Amazon. Furthermore, further room to increase pricing via a pricing tier was well received by subscribers, which gives ample justification for investors to anticipate ARPU figures to trend even higher. Therefore, revenue growth will continue to accelerate, as both pricing increases and international roll out drive top line expansion. Admittedly, not everyone should be chasing Netflix stock. Growth stocks are inherently more volatile, as the stock price is tied to future expectation, making the stock vulnerable to quarterly earnings misses. That didn't happen in the most recent quarter, but we've seen cases where investors dove for the exits, crashing the value of the stock. Overall, I'm really impressed with both management, and the business model. I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation on Netflix.
