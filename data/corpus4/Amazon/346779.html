However, the capabilities available through the service werenâ€™t as robust as those found in the Echo â€” until now.Â  Amazon announced this week that it has made several â€œarchitectural improvementsâ€? to the Alexa Voice Services (AVS) tool to enable users to adjust the volume, control the playback of media, set times, and manage alarms. The update also included a revamp of the Alexa app, allowing app users to also control the volume, playback, and other features. Amazon says the updates will allow device makers to add many of Alexaâ€™s most used capabilities to their own products. Tech Crunch reports that Scout, one of AVSâ€™ first partners, can integrate the improvements into its home security system, allowing users to control the volume of alarms. By allowing developers to tap into Alexaâ€™s capabilities, Tech Crunch suggests, Amazon is working on building an even larger Echo ecosystem that would include connected home appliances, wireless systems, and even some connected car systems, outside of the e-commerce giantâ€™s own products.
