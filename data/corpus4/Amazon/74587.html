Amazon Introduces Free Shipping On Some Small Items For All Customers â€“ Consumerist While we’ve gotten used to Amazon rolling out new features for its customers, often local delivery or free shipping is only extended to Prime subscribers who pay a yearly fee for such things. But Amazon says everyone can get free shipping on some small items, Prime member or no — with no minimum order required. Thousands of products like makeup, mobile phone accessories, cords, earplugs and the like will ship for free from Amazon’s Web store, reports Bloomberg . To be included in the new program, dubbed “Fulfillment by Amazon Small and Light,” items must weigh eight ounces or less and will usually cost no more than $10. Just because it’s free delivery doesn’t mean it’ll be that fast, however, with orders taking about four to eight businesses days to ship from an Amazon hub in Kentucky stocked especially for the new program. Amazon has been testing the plan for the last 13 weeks, introducing it yesterday after the company saw items targeted for free shipping without a minimum order threshhold selling more quickly than before. â€œCustomers love that even if itâ€™s a $5 item, shipping is free for everybody, Prime member or not,â€? a senior manager at Amazon told Bloomberg. â€œCustomers love it and sellers love it.â€? « North Pole Rejects Proposed Ban On Marijuana Sales Report: TSA Agents Failed 67 Out Of 70 Undercover Tests Sears Shareholders Sue, Claim CEO Is Stripping Company For Parts Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
