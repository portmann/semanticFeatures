Amazon.com Inc said customers placed 60 percent more orders worldwide on "Prime Day" on Tuesday, compared with a year earlier when it started the shopping event. Amazon's shares were slightly higher at $753.40 in morning trading on Wednesday. The online retailer said it reported the largest daily sales for Amazon devices on Tuesday, helped by heavy discounts. The Fire TV Stick was its best-selling device. Amazon did not provide any details on total sales. The one-day sale for members of Amazon's $99-per-year Prime subscription service was expected to generate up to $1 billion in sales, more than double the $400 million in extra sales made during last year's inaugural Prime Day, according to Citi analysts. The estimated $1 billion in sales still pales in comparison with the more than $14 billion of total value of goods transacted during Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Singles' Day shopping festival in China in November. "Prime Day", billed as Amazon's largest ever, experienced some issues with customers unable to add discounted items to their shopping carts.
