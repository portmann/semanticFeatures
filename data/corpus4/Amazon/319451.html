Click to print (Opens in new window) Amazon’s Subscribe & Save feature is useful when there’s something that you want to buy online and know that you’ll need regular shipments of, like electric toothbrush heads or bags of freeze-dried marshmallows. There’s a catch, though: if you have Amazon Prime and want free two-day shipping on those mailing labels or novelty emery boards, selecting the Subscribe & Save option from the item page doesn’t get you two-day shipping by default. How can you fix this? Amazon’s shipping department probably won’t be very pleased with you, but it’s possible to get around this by only adding Subscribe & Save later on. A Lifehacker reader discovered this workaround . All you have to do is add the item to your cart as if you’re only buying it only one time. Only put this one item in your cart. Then head to the checkout page, where you’ll have a new option available on Subscribe & Save items that allow it: Subscription discounts and two-day shipping! Hurray! There’s a catch, though: the seller has to offer it as an option. For example, this seller uses Amazon to ship their items, but they don’t participate. No Prime and Subscribe & Save for you, even though Subscribe & Save is available for the item.
