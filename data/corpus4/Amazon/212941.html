UPDATE 2-Amazon posts profit on higher North America sales, shares climb | Reuters Related: Stocks, Markets, Earnings, Cyclical Consumer Goods (Adds analyst comments, updates share price) Oct 22 (Reuters) - E-commerce company Amazon.com Inc  recorded a surprise profit for the second consecutive quarter, propelled by higher sales in North America and growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud business, and its shares rose 11 percent. Sales in North America, its biggest market, rose 28.3 percent to $15.01 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, helped by robust Prime Day sales and demand for electronics and general merchandise. "It's a great quarter," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis, citing the $521 million operating income from Amazon Web Services. "It's driving the entire train." Net sales from Amazon Web Services, which has more than 1 million active customers in 190 countries, rose more than 78 percent in the quarter to $2.09 billion. "There are questions about what's the sustainable margin for this? Are we seeing just a hyper growth phase now? But for right now, AWS is driving the train, and it's going to for the near future," Gillis said. In July Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, said customers had ordered 34.4 million items worldwide during the one-day sale for members of its $99 per year Prime subscription service. Amazon has consistently recorded strong revenue growth but has put most of it into investments to expand its distribution network, add original media content to Prime, and develop devices such as the Fire smartphone. The company forecast net sales growth of 14 percent to 25 percent, to a range of $33.50 billion and $36.75 billion, for the holiday shopping quarter. Analysts, on average, had been expecting revenue of $35.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amazon reported a profit of $79 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of $437 million, or 95 cents per share, a year ago. Total net sales rose 23.2 percent to $25.36 billion.  Analysts, on average, had expected a loss of 13 cents per share on revenue of $24.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amazon's shares rose to $625 in after-market trading after closing at $563.91 on Thursday.
