And you will totally believe who he roped in to do it with him: Wells Fargo Education Financial Services, the nationâ€™s largest private student lender amongst U.S. commercial banks, and Amazon.com, today announced a new interest rate discount for Amazon Prime Student customers who apply for any of Wells Fargoâ€™s private student loan products. That’s right, AmazonPrime membership now offers maybe the one thing that almost no one really wanted it to ever consider selling. The 0.50 percent interest rate discount being offered by Wells Fargo to Amazon Prime Student customers can also be added to a 0.25 percent interest rate reduction for enrolling in an automatic monthly loan repayment plan from Wells Fargo and any interest rate discount tied to a Wells Fargo global promotion. Okay fine, a locked-in low rate private student loan is cool (and not at all a modernist ploy to grow deposits and loan revenue) but these are proto-Millennials you’re dealing with here, Bezos and Stumpf, what else you got? Amazon Prime Student gives college students unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on more than 30 million items, and special offers and promotions created just for students. Students can sign up for a six-month, sponsored trial of Amazon Prime Student to access these benefits, plus unlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV shows with Prime Video and free unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos.Â  Quantedge Capital Laughs At Your Measly Little Risk Profiles Donald Trump Jr. Really Should Have Read His Dad’s Platform Before Speaking Last Night If Spending $13 Million In Stolen 1MDB Funds Over A Period Of Three Days In Vegas Is Wrong, The Prime Minister Of Malaysia’s Stepson Doesn’t Wanna Be Right How Can You Abandon Bill Ackman In His Time Of Greatest Need?
