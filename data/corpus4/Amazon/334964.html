Ask the Readers: What Was Your Most Recent Splurge? Frugal people don't like to overspend on things they can get more cheaply, but sometimes...sometimes, it's worth it! A higher-priced purchase can translate to better value or more enjoyment, or maybe you just need that once-in-a-blue-moon treat to keep you motivated. What was your most recent splurge? What was your reasoning for splurging on this purchase as opposed to something else? How do you usually decide if something is worth spending extra on?
