Amazon’s Stupid Shipping Gang Nestles Roll Of Bubble Wrap In Craft Paper â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Look, Amazon doesn’t know what Alexis wanted a roll of bubble wrap for. Maybe she just wants it to wrap up breakable items before placing them in a box to move, store, or mail. Or maybe she’s a collector of rare and precious bubble wraps, and needs to keep the rolls in mint condition with no risk of damage and not a single bubble popped. That’s probably why they secured her roll of bubble wrap with a generous helping of brown craft paper. It’s also possible that they did so out of habit, or they could have been sending her some handy free packing material along with the packing material she purchased. The paper may not be as versatile as the air pillows that another box of bubble wrap that we featured a few years ago was packed in , but at least it arrived safely and in mint condition.
