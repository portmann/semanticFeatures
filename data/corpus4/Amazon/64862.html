Wal-Mart Shares Are Attractive - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart shares are cheap, with a forward PE of 14.8 versus the S&P 500â€™s forward PE of 18. Warren Buffett owns over 60 million shares of Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) became a $485 billion a year company because of technology. Because it had better supply chain technology than its competitors, Wal-Mart could charge lower prices. Wal-Mart's lower prices attracted more customers, which gave Wal-Mart more bargaining power from suppliers. Because it had more bargaining power, Wal-Mart could ask for lower prices from suppliers and pass the savings back to the customer in the form of lower prices, which again attracted more customers. That cycle continued for five decades until Wal-Mart became the company it is today. Today, Wal-Mart is no longer the most advanced technology company in retail. Former book seller and now do-anything store Amazon.com is growing quickly, with revenues increasing 15-20% year over year. Amazon operates with Wal-Mart's same principles of putting the customer first and charging low prices all the time. Like Wal-Mart, Amazon also has a hyper efficient distribution system and significant bargaining power with suppliers. Because of Amazon's growth in e-commerce, Amazon's market capitalization is in the same ball park as Wal-Mart's, even though Amazon was founded three decades after Wal-Mart. Amazon's rise has negatively impacted Wal-Mart's earnings. For its first quarter, Wal-Mart missed analyst expectations, reporting earnings of $1.03 per share versus expectations of $1.05 per share and revenue of $114.8 billion versus expectations of $116.3 billion. While a big reason for the Q1 miss was the stronger dollar, part of the miss was due to competition with Amazon. The competition with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) will increase. Because of programs such as Amazon Prime, more customers are shopping at Amazon rather than Wal-Mart. Because Amazon is growing quickly, Amazon will have more bargaining power with suppliers. With disruptive technology such as cheap drone delivery perhaps just a decade away, the difference between Wal-Mart and Amazon will become less and less. Wal-Mart is fighting back. The company plans to invest $1.2-$1.5 billion in fiscal 2016 to grow its $12 billion a year e-commerce business, which is currently growing 17% year over year. Wal-Mart also recently introduced its own version of Amazon Prime, a $50 a year unlimited shipping service that delivers online products to Wal-Mart customers within 3 business days. Given that Wal-Mart has thousands of brick-and-mortar stores, Wal-Mart has an advantage over Amazon in that its customers can pick up ordered products from stores within a few hours. While Wal-Mart stock has not done well recently, with shares falling 10.5% year to date, Wal-Mart is still attractive. The company has a wide moat, with 260 million loyal customers visiting Wal-Mart each week. Wal-Mart shares are cheap, with a forward PE of 14.8 versus the S&P 500's forward PE of 18, and a dividend yield of 2.58% versus the 10 year's yield of just 2.25%. Many prestigious investors and hedge fund managers also own stakes in Wal-Mart.
