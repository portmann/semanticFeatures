Why It's Not Too Late To Go Long Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha We initiate coverage on Amazon with a Buy rating and a target price of $780 per share. The key assumptions underlying our target price include continuous top line growth and expansion in profitability. We find Amazon's AWS business, its Prime Now service, and its expansion into emerging markets to be the core drivers of growth for the company going forward. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has gone up about 57% in value over the past six months, as stronger-than-expected results have lifted investor sentiment. Although the stock is currently trading at high valuation with a forward Enterprise Value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of 28x, we see further upside potential in the company's stock price. We initiate our coverage of Amazon with a Buy rating and target price of $780 per share, suggesting 18% upside to the current stock price. The key assumptions underlying our target price include one-year average forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 19.5x; growth in the company's Media segment in 2016 and onwards following weakness in 2015, continued double-digit growth in revenues from the Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) business despite a slight fall in the annual growth rate to 19% by 2017; consistently high growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), with annual growth of about 50% in 2017; and a continuous expansion in Amazon's EBITDA margin, with a major improvement to 11.7% in 2017. These assumptions are discussed in detail below, along with their rationale. The slowdown in Media shouldn't concern investors Amazon's Media business remains to be one of the key drivers of revenues for the company, as the segment contributes to roughly 21% of its total revenues. The recent slowdown in revenues from the business has been a source of concern for the investors, as the Media segment posted a year-over-year (YoY) fall in revenues during the first two quarters of the current fiscal year. However, we believe that this shouldn't concern investors, as the importance of this business will continue to decline for Amazon going forward. This is because the proportion of revenues generated from the Media business will continue to decline considering that its growth is significantly lower compared to other businesses. This is also evident from the past trends. Amazon's revenues from the Media business increased at an annual rate of 8.2% over the past three years, falling far below the 29.9% annual growth in other segments during the same period. This led to a fall in the proportion of total revenues generated from the media, from 37% in 2011 to 25% in 2014. The consistent fall in proportion of revenues from the Media business will also result in better annual growth in the company's overall revenues. Furthermore, we expect a recovery in Media revenues going forward as the foreign exchange pressures ease out going forward. The fall in revenues from the segment during the first half of current fiscal year was primarily a result of fall in international Media revenues due to forex pressures, while the segment revenues from North America continued to grow, increasing 5% and 7% YoY in 1QFY15 and 2QFY15 respectively. Media revenues from international markets increased on a currency-neutral basis during the first half of 2015, growing 2% and 3% in 1QFY15 and 2QFY15 respectively. As forex pressures ease out going forward with the recovery in emerging markets, growth in Media revenues will be boosted. This trend can already be observed with an improvement in segment revenues, from a YoY fall of 3.3% in 1QFY15 to an increase of 0.7% in 4QFY15. Apart from this, we expect healthy revenues from the Media segment owing to Amazon's investments into content, including original content. Investments into shows such as Man in the High Castle and Transparent reflect management's increased focus on original content, which looks to be a strong driver for Media revenues in the future. Based on the factors discussed above, we expect an improvement in YoY Media revenue growth from about -1.2% in 2015 to 3% in 2017. The outlook for Amazon's EGM business, which comprise roughly 70% of the company's total revenues, remains strong with the success of Prime Now and expansion into emerging markets. E-commerce started to take share of brick-and-mortar retail stores, due to not only increasing the ease of shopping for consumers, but also saving their time in this fast-moving world where consumers are fighting a battle with time every day. As more and more retailers are moving towards e-commerce, the uniqueness of e-commerce retail is reducing, and for retailers to now outpace others, further differentiation strategies such as quickness of delivery are required. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the online retailer which is able to save a customer's time most by delivering the product in the shortest time possible will be able to take up the share of other retailers, in the same way as e-commerce took up the share of brick-and-mortar stores. Not only that, but such a retailer will even able to charge a higher price from the customers, as time is becoming money in this age. Amazon looks set to capitalize on these trends by focusing on quick delivery options such as Prime Now. Considering that this core driver of Amazon's EGM revenues is only operating in about 17 cities around the world so far, there looks to be huge untapped potential for the company. As Prime Now and other similar services expand into other cities, EGM revenues will show further strength. Amazon's international expansion, particularly its expansion into emerging markets such as India, look to be a core driver of growth for the company's EGM. This is evident from the fact that Amazon's active customer accounts in India increased 230% YoY during the last quarter, with its sales being about three times higher compared to the same period in the previous year. Not only that, but the suppliers side remains strong as well. The number of sellers in India increased roughly 250% YoY during the last quarter, with 90% of sellers using Amazon's logistics and warehouse services. The company's continuous investments into the country, with the introduction of 40,000 products per day, will continue to drive up its EGM revenues. Based on factors such as the expansion of Prime Now into other cities around the world as well as its investments into emerging markets, we expect Amazon's EGM revenues to sustain double-digit growth going forward. Expected improvement in profitability Amazon's EBITDA margin has continued to improve since 2010, increasing from about 4.3% in 2011 to 5.4% in 2014. We expect the improvement to continue and even pace up going forward owing to the increasing share of AWS in Amazon's total revenues, compression in shipping loss margin, and economies of scale due to an increase in the size of the business. High growth in Amazon's AWS business (78% YoY in 3QFY15) compared to other businesses (consolidated 23.2% YoY in 3QFY15) will lead to a consistent increase in proportion of revenues generated by AWS. Considering AWS to be a higher-margin segment, with operating margins of about 20.6% compared to -0.3% for international segment and 4.2% for North America, the increase in proportion of revenues generated from AWS will lead to an expansion in Amazon's overall margins. Furthermore, AWS' operating margin is itself expected to improve with an increase in the size of business and improvement in fixed cost leverage, thus adding to the company's overall profitability. This is also evident from the significant increase in AWS' trailing-twelve month (TTM) operating margins from 14.2% in 4QFY14 to 20.6% in 3QFY15. Furthermore, we believe that Amazon will continue to focus on setting up its fulfillment centers (FCS) near the areas where sales are concentrated. This will continue helping the company switch from costly air shipping to cheaper ground shipping, thus reducing shipping costs. In addition, the increase in size of business with growth in revenues will improve Amazon's operational leverage, thus expanding its EBITDA margin. Based on these reasons, we expect an expansion in EBITDA margin from an estimated 7.4% in 2015 to 11.7% in 2017. AWS remains to be Amazon's star business, with significant growth and higher margins compared to other businesses. Although the segment is quite small as of now, with roughly $2 billion in quarterly sales, it should be noted that the business' proportion in Amazon's total revenues has significantly increased, from 5.3% in 1QFY14 to 8.2% in 3QFY15. The company's strategy to scale up the AWS business by introducing newer and cost-effective options, such as Amazon Aurora and QuickSight, will help it reach a broader customer base by suiting the needs of diverse customer groups. This, along with the increasing demand for cloud computing, will continue driving growth for Amazon's AWS business, thus supporting the company's top line and bottom line. We believe that AWS' contribution to Amazon's total revenues will increase further to 12.7% by 2017, owing to high growth of the business, thus having a significant impact on the company's top line and profitability in 2017 and onwards. Over the past one year, Amazon has traded at an average forward EV / EBITDA multiple of 19.5x, while it is currently trading at significantly higher EV/EBITDA multiple of 28.4x, having uplifted investor sentiment with stronger-than-expected results. The graph below shows the historical valuation of the company. If Amazon trades at its one-year average forward EV / EBITDA of 19.5x, its enterprise value will be $346 billion, assuming an EBITDA of $17.7 billion for 2017. This enterprise value translates into a stock price of $780 per share, suggesting 18% upside potential from the current price. The valuation metrics used to arrive at this price are shown in the table below. Our forecast of $17.7 for Amazon's 2017 EBITDA is based on the assumptions discussed in this article. Furthermore, the snapshot from our financial model provided below reflects our forecasts for Amazon's financials.
