Then a spat between the two companies led to Amazon products vanishing from Target shelves and its website. Looks like the two have kissed and made up, with Amazon items making their return after four years away. Bloomberg reports that Target began selling the devices online Thursday, and will bring them toÂ actualÂ stores starting in October. â€œTarget continually evaluates our assortment to deliver quality products at a great value,â€? the company said in a statement. â€œWe know our guests love the many aspects of shopping at Target, and believe they will appreciate the convenience and savings of finding these items in our stores and on Target.com.â€? Back in 2012, Target was one of the first big box retailers to ban the sale of Amazon devices in its stores. Walmart soon followed suit. The devices, which often make it easier to shop the e-commerce site, were seen as a means of taking customers away from the retailer, Bloomberg reports. But times â€” and attitudes â€” have apparently changed with Target now believing that adding the devices to its shelves will drive traffic to stores. Bloomberg reports that Target â€” which hired a new CEO during its Amazon-device break â€” has refocused on other areas of retail, introduced its own exclusive brands, and revamped it online strategy, giving it room to add the devices once again.
