Amazon considering paying people to deliver packages - WSJ | Reuters Related: Stocks, Markets, Cyclical Consumer Goods, Industrials June 16 Amazon Inc is developing a mobile application that would pay ordinary people, rather than courier companies, to deliver packages en route to other destinations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Amazon would enlist brick-and-mortar retailers in urban areas to store the packages, likely renting space from them or paying a per-package fee, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. ( on.wsj.com/1ekxF3h ) The service could give Amazon more control over the shopping experience and help limit shipping costs, the report added. Shipping costs at the Seattle-based e-commerce giant rose 31 percent in 2014, outpacing sales growth of 19.5 percent.
