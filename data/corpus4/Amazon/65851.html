Amazon plans to launch Etsy rival - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha May 22 2015, 19:22 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is prepping Handmade , a marketplace for handcrafted goods that takes direct aim at market leader ETSY . The WSJ reports Etsy sellers have received invites offering a sneak peek at Handmade, and directing them to a questionnaire regarding which products they offer. Amazon's huge customer base and fulfillment infrastructure could quickly make it a thorn in Etsy's side. At the same time, Etsy's cult following and large network effect of craft/vintage goods buyers and sellers arguably make it tough to dislodge. Also (as noted by the WSJ), Etsy's 3.5% cut and $0.20 listing fee might make it cheaper than Handmade - Amazon currently takes up to a 15% cut on marketplace sales. Amazon is two months removed from launching a home services site that competes against Angie's List. The company has also recently launched a restaurant takeout/delivery service that competes against GrubHub. ETSY -1.2% AH to $16.96. Shares plunged on Wednesday thanks to the company's Q1 numbers , briefly dipping below April's $16 IPO price.
