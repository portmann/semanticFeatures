Amazon Officially Launches Program Connecting Customers To Local Service Providers â€“ Consumerist Amazon’s quest to touch every aspect of consumers’ lives continued today as the company rebranded and officially launched aÂ  program connecting customers with local service providers for repairs, installations or other jobs around the house. Referred to as Local Services when it quietly launched in November , the online retailer announced today it has renamed its program Amazon Home Services and made the option available for much of the country. However, the high-coverage areas continue to be in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Amazon Home Services aims to connect customers to local services tied to the purchases they make through Amazon. That means if you’re buying a TV from the online retailer, you can also schedule to have someone mount it on the wall when it arrives. Although you won’t be charged for the service until it’s completed. The Home Services page allow customers to browse and purchase directly from the site more than 700 “handpicked pros” offering services from installing a new garbage disposal to home cleaning. Prices are pre-packaged and come with upfront fees. A spokesperson for Amazon tells Reuters that the foray into showcasing physical services came after the company found customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on actual products. The new offering is also a way for Amazon to capture additional revenue from customers making purchases on the sites. The company estimates that over 85 million customers buy products off the website that require professional services or installations. All services offered through the new marketplace are backed by Amazon’s guarantee, which is currently used to endorse products on the site sold by third-party companies. “If customers are not satisfied at the end of the service, Amazon will work with customers and the pro to ensure the job gets done right or provide a refund,” the company says. The new service will be direct competition for consumer review sites such as Yelp and Angieâ€™s List, as well as traditional retailers Home Depot and Loweâ€™s, both of which have worked to link consumers with local service providers in the past.
