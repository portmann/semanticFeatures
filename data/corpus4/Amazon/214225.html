Amazon Q3 Results Surprise On Many Fronts - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has grossly beaten expectations. Although net earnings are still negligible, the improvement of the cash flow, both operational and FCF is again impressive. Growth rates accelerated in each main category and it's quite extraordinary how smoothly Amazon’s business model could absorb 39,300 new employees during the quarter. The slowdown of shipping costs experienced in the first two quarters stalled as Amazon gave priority to more generous shipping conditions under Prime. In Q4 it will be hard for Amazon to avoid significant earnings to show up at the income statement’s bottom line. Reading Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) quarterly earnings reports always is a rather daunting exercise, crammed as they are with many facts related to recently-released products and other developments during the quarter which have already been communicated extensively in earlier news releases. Unless we missed something during the quarter, we can usually ignore this stuff - kind of advertising material actually - and instead concentrate on the mere figures. These too, however, follow a rather awkward reporting scheme. It takes quite a while before the reader is a bit accustomed to the eccentric style. To make life a bit easier for me and the visitors of SA, I use an earnings model which summarizes the essential quantitative information in a hopefully more user friendly way. The tables below are parts of this larger analytical model which I use to comment on what I see as the most import elements of this year's Q3 results: the smooth development of the various operating cost items in relation to total sales, the surprisingly positive development of the cash flow in the three flavors that Amazon serve and finally the shipping costs, which have my special attention as I expect them to eventually switch from a cost into a net revenue category. In the table below, the favorable figures almost speak for themselves. Amazon has grossly beaten expectations on many fronts. Both net product sales (+15%) and net services sales (+51%), which includes fulfillment fees paid by third parties who have their e-commerce fulfilled by Amazon (FBA), were stronger than expected. As we have now three quarters behind us, and taking into account Amazon's seasonal features, which mainly boil down to the fact that one-third of annual sales is usually realized in the fourth quarter, I have filled in the results for Q4 to arrive at the FY outcome as I expect them in the table below: The operating costs and earnings margins in Q3 were well in line with former quarters. No spectacular shifts were seen here, implying that the business model, while accommodating unabatedly strong growth, develops smoothly at constant operational conditions (gross margins, fulfillment, marketing). Amazing as Amazon's staff rose with 39,300 employees to 224,000, +21% from Q2. Technology and content spending will remain at elevated levels, rising each quarter this year and reaching altogether 11.7% over the year from 10.4% in 2015. Yet as Q4 will be again the usual seasonal bumper quarter. Technology and content costs as a percentage of total sales are expected to fall back temporarily to 10% in Q4. This, together with some decrease of the fulfillment cost rate for the same reason and an overall gross margin this year of 10,4%, basically in line with that of 2014, will have a marked positive effect on earnings in the fourth quarter. I estimate these at $ 2.15 (fully diluted) bringing the EPS for the whole of 2015 to $2.40. As long as earnings are not relevant - even the EPS of $2.18 that I expect the company to make in the final quarter of this year doesn't really amount to much yet, although it will be a another strong positive for the sentiment surrounding the stock - cash flows remain the metric to focus on for the time being. As I explained in more depth in " Amazon's financial reporting, a bit opaque but not misleading ," Amazon releases three versions of the free cash flow: 1) the conventional one which is operating cash flow minus purchases "out of cash" of PP&E (Property, Plant & Equipment); 2) The same but including repayments on finance capital leases, which includes all the repayments of leases, an instrument Amazon mainly uses for the financing of its large capital spending at AWS, data centers and servers; and 3) the operating cash flow minus all PP&E spending including the part acquired under leases. At each of these levels, Amazon saw a significant improvement in Q3. The FFC-1 improved 265% y/y and the trailing twelve months (TTM) which is the total of FFC-1 of the last four quarters quadrupled to $5.4 billion. I think that the conventional free cash flow, the FFC-1, is still the most relevant as I have argued more profoundly in the article mentioned above. But the other two also have a story to tell and the three should really be observed together. Quite amazingly, the FCF-2 improved spectacularly from $8 million to $738 million, while on a TTM basis it went from minus $172 million to plus $ 3.2 billion. The third version of the FCF, which includes all capex on AWS irrespective of how being financed, also is improving and seems to stabilize for the third consecutive quarter at an outflow of $1.5 billion. As I wrote in my preview of last Wednesday , this was one of the items that I would look for with above average curiosity. I expected the capex at AWS to start to abate a bit, thus from Q3 onward positively impacting the cash flow. As it turned out, this did not materialize yet. Amazon continued to spend heavily in AWS, in fact doubled its spending here from $1.1 billion to $2.2 billion. But another development, which also is becoming more of a trend now, is that "right out of cash" capital spending, which is related to Amazon's core online retail business, was down again, for the third consecutive quarter, and this time by 13% y/y to $1.2 billion. This may hint at increasing productivity in Amazon's warehouses where more turnover can be handled, perhaps as a consequence of intensive use of Amazon's order gathering robots exclusively made for them by the full subsidiary Kiva, which was acquired in 2012. Another point I was particularly focused on was to see how shipping cost would have developed in Q3. Based on the 3% increase, 2% by which the net shipping cost had increased in Q1 and Q2, respectively, the hypothesis was Amazon would be on a path that it would be increasingly able to charge gross shipping cost to its FBA partners. Although it turns out that shipping revenue (+43%) rose more steeply than the 35% increase in shipping costs, the resulting rate difference was less outspoken than in the first two quarters of this year. It seems that Amazon has decided to sacrifice, at least a part of the benefit, to offering more generous free shipping conditions under Prime. This is an opportunistic strategy I can appreciate while longer term my idea that shipping revenue will converge with shipping cost, and eventually will even exceed these, is still intact. With regard to the gradually growing part of third parties in total transactions, the third quarter showed again an increase of one percentage point to reach 46% in Q3. I had hoped there to see some acceleration but that was apparently too greedy. Third-party sales are not included in sales. As the average transaction amount of vendors is higher than Amazon's own transactions that run though their ledger, total nominal sales of vendors is already larger than those of Amazon. But here too, I expect in the long run, vendor sales to continue to grow consistently faster which will strongly benefit the overall operating margin. Amazon will turn more into a merchandise enabler and cloud service provider than an e-mail retail company Amazon has presented another amazing quarter in which the strong growth that the company has shown from its early start is still fully intact. Nothing yet points at a weakening of that growth while an enormous potential (think India, Mexico, Brazil) is still untapped. That's the main explanation why investors are prepared to discount profits that will eventual come about far into the future, even as these have been almost negligible so far. But 2015 may mark a first year after which consistent earnings growth will become much more visible than in the recent past.
