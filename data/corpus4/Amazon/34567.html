What Will It Take To End Wal-Mart's Slide? - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Investors might forgive Wal-Mart's revenue challenges, but cash flow is also taking a hit. So far 2015 hasn't been kind to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) shareholders. Since January, the stock is down more than 10% while the S&P 500 is up slightly for the year. The company's last earnings report seems to be weighing on the stock as growth didn't live up to investors' expectations. However, there are two reasons to believe in Wal-Mart's future growth, and with a 2.5% yield investors are being paid to wait. Wal-Mart competes on multiple fronts with companies from Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to Target (NYSE: TGT ). In addition, discount retailers come into play when customers choose to check places like The TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ), TJ Maxx or Marshalls before going to Wal-Mart. Whether it's goods for the home, clothing, toys or electronics, Wal-Mart plays in all of these fields. The problem is when you try to be all things to all people, investors have high expectations. That being said, as the largest retailer in the world, investors know that Wal-Mart won't grow revenue at a high double-digit rate. However, they do expect the company to somewhat keep pace with its peers. Amazon is of course, a difficult comparison as Wal-Mart's sales still exceed its online competitor by almost 50%. However, this gap is closing, and Amazon still managed to post 18% revenue growth on a year-over-year basis last quarter. On the other hand, TJX Companies generates much smaller total revenue at less than 10% of Wal-Mart's revenue. That being said, TJX managed revenue growth of 6%. Wal-Mart's size certainly has something to do with its growth rate. However, with the company's top-line growth coming in at just 3.5% on a year-over-year basis , investors may have expected more. Many investors are willing to accept slower top-line growth if the company generates better cash flow growth. Unfortunately, Wal-Mart is suffering on both ends of the equation. If we look at core operating cash flow growth on a year-over-year basis, the world's largest retailer is at a disadvantage. Of the three companies we've looked at, it's not surprising that Amazon posted the fastest operating cash flow growth at better than 30% annually. That being said, TJX even bested Wal-Mart with a nearly 4% annual growth in operating cash flow . With Wal-Mart showing cash flow growth of less than 3%, investors are getting even less bottom line growth than they are from the top line. One of the reasons to believe in Wal-Mart's future growth comes from a place that many would have questioned just a few years ago. Amazon is well known as an e-commerce titan, yet the company's size is beginning to catch up to its lofty growth intentions. In Amazon's last quarter, the company's annual revenue growth, excluding currency, came in at 18%. In the prior year, the company reported a 20% increase, and just a few quarters ago the increase was closer to 25%. Looking at TJX Companies, e-commerce sales are essentially non-existent. In one way this is expected as the company's two main chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls both deal in closeout merchandise. These retailers change their inventory often as deals are presented, and it would be difficult to offer these items on a web site. That being said, Wal-Mart actually outperformed both of its peers in the e-commerce space. The company has increased its online sales by 22% annually in the current quarter. If this were just one quarter, investors could ignore this performance. However, over the last few quarters as Amazon's overall sales growth has slowed, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales have picked up. Ironically, Wal-Mart seems to have the greater e-commerce opportunity. At this point, Wal-Mart's online sales represent just a fraction of its overall revenue. These small stores could make a big impact The second reason to believe in Wal-Mart's future prospects lies with the performance of its Neighborhood Market concept. One of the concerns about Wal-Mart has been the company's ability to find good locations for its large format stores. The company's large format also may turn away some customers who want to avoid long lines and crowded aisles. In response to this issue, Wal-Mart came up with the Neighborhood Market idea. These much smaller format stores carry the essentials and allow customers to get in and out without the normal hassle of a traditional Wal-Mart store. In the current quarter, the company's Neighborhood Market increased its comps by 7.7%, compared to the just 1.5% increase at Wal-Mart U.S.'s overall comps. Given that TJX's comps came in at 4%, Wal-Mart can use help in closing the gap on its competition. Given that Wal-Mart plans to be aggressive in opening these Market stores, its future comps should improve as they become a larger part of the whole. The bottom line is Wal-Mart is facing challenges today, but has two significant growth opportunities. Between its strong online sales momentum and potentially improved comps from the growth of the Neighborhood Market concept, Wal-Mart's slide in stock price may soon be over.
