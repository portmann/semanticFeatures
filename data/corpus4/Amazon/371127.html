Zuckerberg's Revenue Line-Up: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp And Masquerade - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Where does the Instagram acquisition fit in to Facebook's revenue scheme for the future? Why are Facebook's acquisitions centered around specific areas like chat, photos and video? In my last article on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) - WhatsApp: Facebook's Next Platinum Mine? - I spoke at length about how their monetization plan for the messaging app is key to the company's growth into the next decade. If you look at the numbers, it's obvious that Facebook and WhatsApp are neck and neck in terms of active users - with the latter edging past the parent company on the mobile front. WhatsApp is a mobile application, after all, and that was one of the things that made the acquisition an attractive one for Facebook. It can now leverage this enlarged mobile user base for future monetization. But that's only part of the story. We still haven't discussed what part the other adopted sibling Instagram plays in Facebook's future. Facebook proposed to buy the photo-sharing application company for $1 billion on April 2012 - although they ended up only paying $715 million for the purchase. The 13-member startup had 30 million users at the time of buyout. The company's latest round of fundraising before the acquisition valued the company at around $500 million, so why was Facebook ready to pay a 50% premium to buy the company? In a Forbes article by J.J. Colao back in 2012, he applauds Facebook's move to buy Instagram, but essentially tags it a futile effort by a Top 50 global company to quell an uprising that it saw as a threat to its own capability. While I agree that the threat to photo-sharing that Instagram posed to Facebook might have been a real one, I think the real reason the acquisition went through at a premium was because Facebook wanted to control that specific market. Every company does it. Why did Google ( GOOG ; GOOGL ) buy YouTube in 2006, for example? Was it because the then-67-employee-strong company was a "threat" to its own capability of serving videos to search engine users? Hardly! The $1.65 billion acquisition was a move to dominate the user-generated video market - and YouTube was the fastest growing player at the time. Looking at the Instagram acquisition in light of the Whatsapp one, it's clear - at least to me - that Facebook is interested in two things: To own the largest online user base in the world for both desktops and mobile devices. To monetise that user base by leveraging the skill that they've already exhibited in that area. A third area that is of interest to Facebook is to be on the top of the trending list, and Instagram certainly made that happen for them. For all these reasons, I believe Instagram is the best deal they have made to date. Whether WhatsApp will be their next platinum mine remains to be seen, but there's definitely a lot of "gold in them thar hills" where Instagram is concerned. When looked at from the perspective of Facebook's future revenues with Whatsapp, I think Instagram will actually take them closer to their monetization goals in a shorter period of time. At this size, Instagram has already raced past one tired bird (NYSE: TWTR ), which has been flapping its wings hard since early last year but still hasn't managed to gain altitude on stock price. Twitter's decline is a unique story because management still doesn't think that external threats that are the root cause of the company's slide. Interim CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Anthony Noto saw some stock gains after topping revenue expectations at the Q2 earnings call last year, for example, but rapidly lost ground after Noto iterated that "meaningful" user growth would not come for a "considerable" time. Since then, Twitter stock has dropped like a rock - from around $35 at the time of the Q2 call to $17.66 at the time of this writing. I know personally that Twitter is trying everything to increase its revenues and user engagement because I was a regular user of Twitter Ads until about three months ago. When a company starts giving money away for free, you know they're trying a bit too hard on the customer winback, retention and acquisition fronts. Case in point is what Google is trying to do to make up lost time in its race against Microsoft's Office 365, which is already the top 'office suite on the cloud' offering in the world . "If you're worried about switching to Docs because you still have an enterprise agreement (NASDAQ: EA ) with another provider, we'll cover the fees of Google Apps until your contract runs out. " - Googleforwork.Blog Instagram, on the other hand, is strong on user base as well as revenues. The year after Facebook bought the company, it started including advertising as part of the network's regular feed. If WhatsApp is money in the bank for Facebook, Instagram is money in its wallet. Right now, Facebook doesn't break out the numbers, but the day is not too far away when Instagram will be reporting standalone revenues. According to eMarketer, Net Mobile Ad Revenues for Instagram worldwide were estimated at $600 million for 2015 and expected to more than double to $1.48 billion this year; other sources put 2015 revenue projection at $700 million. The 2017 estimate is over $2.8 billion, and 2020 is expected to bring in an eye-popping $5.8 billion . With a growth estimate of between 30 and 50% year-over-year, you can see why I think Facebook will soon start breaking out Instagram's revenues as a separate line item. This is the potential Facebook about to enjoy over the next few years, but they're not stopping with just creating a separate ad network. About a week or so ago, Instagram's blog post announced that the company has brought 200,000 advertisers on board over the past year. What's making that number even more interesting is the fact that 75% of them are from outside United States. This is a segment that Facebook has been trying to crack for a long time because 80% of the ad revenues on its own network comes from North America and Europe. I covered this in detail in my article Facebook Has A Problem . With this new announcement from Instagram, you can bet that Facebook is going to leverage this in any way it can; and it already has - as I'll show. Facebook proudly announced recently that it has over 3 million active advertisers (people who have advertised in the last 28 days.) That's a growth of 50% over last year's 2 million. Some say it's not sustainable at that rate, but I see something else. Instagram has 75% of its advertisers outside the United States. The latest data shows that 70% of Facebook's advertisers are also located outside the United States. That means the online advertising space is expanding to include more and more people from developing markets. Granted, the ARPU (average revenue per user) for these markets is still one-ninth of what it is in North America, but with a growth and penetration potential far greater than NA can boast, I think it will mean significant additions to Facebook's top line over the next few years. Investor-speak: Instagram's Potential To say that Facebook will leverage Instagram's ad network aggressively is a given. Adding 200,000 advertisers to the existing 3 million may not seem like a big contribution at this point, but with Facebook's ad revenue already beyond the $5.6 billion mark and Instagram expected to hit that in the next 4 years, the combined pool of advertisers, ad revenue and user base by that time will be mind-boggling. And that's not even considering WhatsApp's contribution when they do start monetization there, which I think they will before the year is out. Facebook is already giving its 3 million advertisers a convenient way to reach Instagrammers. Their self-service ad offering now extends to the photo-sharing network as well, as you can see below. "Instagram and Facebook let you reach customers where they spend their time. And that's on mobile. In fact, one in five mobile minutes are spent on Instagram and Facebook together-more than the next 10 mobile platforms combined. So what does that mean to advertisers? By advertising across both platforms, you have more opportunity to reach your customers. When you select Instagram and Facebook for the same ad campaign, we'll optimize delivery across their combined audience-which can make reaching your customers more efficient. Even more, running ads across both platforms together provides comparable or better performance for website clicks, website conversions, video views and mobile app installs compared to running ads on Instagram or Facebook mobile News Feed separately." - blog.business.instagram So this is the moat that Facebook is now expanding around itself by adding more companies into its fold. They will continue to monetize existing acquisitions and keep actively looking to buy even more start-ups and relatively more established companies that have proven their effectiveness. An important point to note here is that social media is now trending towards user-generated video sharing - and I don't mean just another YouTube phenomenon. There is a flood of video content on the internet today, and Facebook recognized the need for more tools that promote visual content. That's the real motivation behind acquiring Instagram, and I believe that's the motive behind their new acquisition - Belarus-based Masquerade ; it's their answer to SnapChat's acquisition of Looksery. This is the age of video selfie content, and Mark Zuckerberg wants in on it. As Instagram and Facebook keep the revenues coming in from text-and-image-based content, WhatsApp will follow with chat penetration, and Masquerade may well be their video gold mine over the next two years. 2016 and 2017 are going to offer some nail-biting quarters for Facebook. In my older article, I argued why I thought the company's valuation was too high for my taste, and I still think that's the case. They have a long way to go before they can justify such a high valuation. They're making all the right moves and they're bringing in the numbers, but I'm not confident that the valuation will hold water beyond a reasonable level despite the successes I've described above. As to what is a more realistic P/S ratio - the next four quarters will tell. FB PS Ratio (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts Thank you for reading my work.
