Why I'm Buying Amazon Right Now - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Concerns over valuation and cash flow growth are over-blown, as this company should be evaluated from a growth perspective. The growth catalysts are showing Amazon's push towards a fourth major revenue stream, which could seriously put this company out of reach for competitors. I'm not one to pick up big-name equities as I believed they get wrecked by the market in aggregate compared to less-known names. That being said, I'm looking to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to change my mind. We're just a few months away from the biggest e-commerce season of the year and I'm asking the bold question, how will Amazon hold up versus expectations in the holiday season? In my opinion, we have to evaluate Amazon from a growth perspective and I fully believe that this stock is going to continue to drive top-line growth and end up beating expectations in Q4. YTD Amazon's stock has performed exceptionally well, with only the recent spike in volatility causing havoc in its price. The substantial runs outside of earnings seasons completely outpace major market indexes. After observing this trend for quite some time, I've noticed that any substantial changes in the RSI prove to be rather short-lived and that it actually tends to be relatively stable compared to what I've seen from Amazon's peers. Below, you can see said trend: This performance is backed by strong financials, but they could be even better and I believe are on track to do so. Revenue is up nearly $4 billion YOY to $23.19 billion. The 5Q revenue trend, absent of the holiday season Q4, shows nothing but consistent growth. What's notable about their top-line is that Q4 is historically the strongest. This should come as no surprise to any investor as it's the holiday shopping season. Q4 last year reported total revenue of $29.33 billion, up from $20.58 billion, in just three months. This is their best quarter to date and now that we're factoring the company posting positive earnings for the first time, we have to wonder what Q4 is going to look like. Backing up a bit, I'd reasonably expect for revenue for Q3 to be in the high $23 billion to low $24 billion range, and if Q4 revenue this year doesn't top $30.5 billion, I'd be honestly surprised. Naturally, I'd expect a bearish sentiment to take over the stock; yet, I don't believe that this scenario is likely to take place based upon their growth catalysts, which I'll mention shortly. It's also worth noting that this top line was damaged by FX losses (they recorded a YOY revenue increase of 27% before FX considerations). Major currency pairs under consideration for Amazon (i.e. EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD) have all been relatively flat during Q3 operations and should not have a largely negative effect on earnings. Now, who knows what's in store for Q4 FX headwinds/tailwinds, but keep in mind that this is a potentially major factor affecting Q4 ER. I've been hearing buzz about this company that it's matured. This company has maintained that their focus is growth and that if it takes on more debt to do so, then so be it. I don't believe that this company has matured in the slightest and think their search for a fourth major revenue stream is what keeps them highly relevant and innovative. A very new catalyst is Flex - currently just available in Seattle, it allows anyone over 21 with an Android phone to deliver packages that were ordered via Prime Now. On a human standpoint, this gives the workforce a boost, but for Amazon - the potential is incredibly high. If they could expand their reach of drivers to any shipping speed and if other smartphones are incorporated, then the attraction certainly grows. On the same sort of wavelength, the Prime Now shipping has begun to extend its reach internationally and this may potentially be a huge catalyst moving forward. Full disclosure, I personally do not use the service as I have patience, but I understand the value-added component Amazon Web Services (AWS) has now been around for nine years and is showing the fastest growth rate in terms of segments; in Q2 it did $1.82 billion in revenue, with the YTD total coming in at $3.39 billion. This is pretty substantial considering Q2 2014 revenue was only $1 billion. More features and a growing renewable energy power source are going to be key to this segment's LT development What's also notable about AWS is that its geographic reach is expanding. Now in 11 locations, AWS is expanding to India starting next year; sidebar, we have seen a few crashes here and there on the EC2, and any further breaches of data are going to have a negative effect on the equity Marketplace remains arguably their most important segment and is seeing a significant growth rate, however it is lagging behind AWS; since this provides the majority of Amazon's total revenue, this needs to see a pickup sometime soon Paying $99 a year for Prime is a bargain because you get free shipping and a large amount of free video, music, and e-book content. Additionally, Prime user growth is really the key in evaluating this segment, and it's up 15% in just two years Expansion into Japan is a great step in the international rollout in the form of Amazon Instant Video and Fire TV; Prime members will also be able to pay an annual fee to access Japanese content Twitch has plans to expand into the VR market, which is presenting itself as a multi-billion dollar revenue stream many years down the line. I'd expect initial revenue from the VR market to hit Amazon sometime around Q3 or Q4 2016 Continued expansion in North America is vital; OI is up 113% YOY right now and net sales are up 26% YOY - both trends are showing staggering growth but can continue to outpace competitors. The Amazon Fire TV Gaming Edition really has a lot going for it in terms of being able to garner sales; it directly competes with Apple TV 4, and even has a controller and SD card bundled up for $140. I fully expect this to help them boost their streaming market share, in the wake of increasing competition from Hulu I keep hearing concerns about Amazon in terms of valuation and, relatively speaking, whether or not I can justify it for a certain time horizon. Since I'm mostly looking at trades that'll take me through Q1 2016, I'm on a short-term track. However, Amazon is much larger than many of the companies I trade and I'll see if I can't justify it from a more technical perspective. I chose a bit different comparable universe, one that was focused more perhaps on Amazon's core business: OCF: $15.6 billion in Q2, FCF: $13.55 billion in Q2 Even when I invest on a short-term basis, I am looking for a company's ability to generate long time horizon sustainable cash flows, because I use this as a benefit of the doubt. I have my doubts about the sustainability of both Ebay and Alibaba to provide stable cash flows, and as a caveat, I understand that Amazon's high rate of spending is going to affect its future cash flows, yet I know the revenue base is far more predictable. Apple is the only one out of the above comparable universe that pays a dividend, and while Amazon shouldn't pay a dividend until FCF passes $1 billion consistently, I believe it's in a better position to pay out than Alibaba and Ebay. Speculating, however, it'd be in Amazon's best interest to compete with these players on a financial front by providing a kickback to shareholders and enticing more entries. What is this company going to look like when it stops spending so much? That's a question that we all want answered, of course. Right now, the company has a debt to equity of 70.11, a quick of 0.79 and a current of 1.10. While these metrics are pretty in line with the industry, we all want Amazon to reduce its future debt burden. LT debt stands at over $15 billion and has grown nearly $9 billion in five quarters. Looking at expenses in light of R&D on a yearly basis, we see that the 5Y trend has been quite steep. Since 2010, R&D has increased nearly $7 billion to a 2014 total of $8.72 billion. So far, the company has spent $5.77 billion in R&D this year and if that pace continues, R&D will be up 32.3% versus 2014. OCF doesn't come close to covering this, and that presents a serious problem in and of itself. However, at some point, R&D is going to level off, most likely when Amazon finds that "fourth space" to operate in. That's the catalyst that we have to bet on. Also, I'm not worried about the maturities stacking against them, however, because they only have $1.75 billion worth of LT debt maturing in the next 2.5 years, and current cash flows will be able to cover that just fine. Furthermore, TTM FCF is at $4.37 billion for Q2, which has quadrupled YOY. Amazon is the trade you make today and five years from now laugh at your younger self for not getting in sooner. Do you remember 1997 when this stock debuted at $18/share? I don't (granted, I was 2 years old - I hope you have a better excuse). That's the time you should've bought in. Would'ves, could'ves, should'ves, but the fact remains that historical performance so far has done nothing to dissuade investors. For example, the top line has increased $54 billion in just five years. I'm not going to bet against Amazon unless significant headwinds develop and right now I feel the growth catalysts are too good to pass up.
