I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Amazon and Netflix went into Sundance a year after being spurned and made a big splash. No matter how strong the streaming networks have become, the traditional route is still seen as the preferred method to ensure awards consideration. While the traditional studios are still in control overall, the streamers are laying the groundwork to make it a closer race. When it comes to Sundance, traditionally traditional studios dominate, but this year marked a stark change in the dichotomy as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) made their presence felt. Keep in mind, this was not a gradual takeover, but was a sudden and calculated approach designed to show they weren't backing down - and it worked. For all the success the streamers have had, the company's executives haven't been able to make all the deals they've wanted. Simply put, it was because they weren't taken seriously at the bargaining table, and executives knew that needed to change. This year, the pair went in, and with tactical skill, achieved all their goals... well, almost all their goals. Netflix pounced on six pictures, including, in a strategic move, buying up a bunch before the festival even opened. That haul included films starring Ellen Page (Tallulah), Paul Rudd (The Fundamentals of Caring) and an ensemble-based foreign cast (Under The Shadow) that has earned rave reviews. The total cost for the three is well north of $12 million. The network has said it expects to spend upwards of $6 billion on content in 2016 - basically its way of saying that money wasn't a problem. What is a problem for Netflix, though , is "the widowing effect." Netflix is adamant its films go day-and-date with its streaming service, meaning there is no window between theatrical and SVOD release. Theaters hate that. As a result, the big theaters boycott those films aside from the more independent ones that usually thrive on more arthouse releases. For Netflix, that doesn't make a difference, because as long as the films screen in one theater in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for awards season, its mission is accomplished. It's also important to note that Netflix mainly went after the streaming rights for these new acquisitions, meaning sales agents could attempt to sell theatrical rights down the road. Of course, the problem is that no studio is going to spend massive amounts of money on a film they know will be turned away by larger chains because a streamer aired it first. Now contrast that with Amazon. The company is looking to spend $3 billion this year, and it too made a big splash with six acquisitions , including drama Manchester By The Sea. Sea stars Casey Affleck, and is produced by Matt Damon. The cost to Amazon was $10 million and represents its largest-ever deal at the festival. Amazon is different, though, as its executives are willing to work with the theaters to create a window for theaters to get its films before hitting their service. While this is obviously more appealing for theaters, the fact remains the ultimate goal is for the film to stream for free after a small set period. While that sounds similar to how traditional films work, the difference is the windows for those studio releases are much larger, with various carve-outs and caveats attached. Amazon's first film released under its partial window model, Chi-Raq, ended up running into the same problems as Netflix. Theaters were not receptive to any sort of smaller exclusivity window. The company will, of course, keep trying and tweaking its model (as it should), having purchased both the theatrical and streaming rights to its purchased films. It will look for a strategic partner to try and find a balance with theater owners, especially with regard to Manchester. It is important to remember (whether you want to admit it or not) that the traditional model, while facing steep competition, is still in control of Hollywood. Producers want to make a film, profit off that film, and then, if applicable, see it run the awards table. So far, those options aren't available at the same level if you pick a streaming partner. Both Netflix and Amazon share the same end goal... and that's to win an Oscar. These companies have successfully invaded the Emmys, and now they have their sight set on the Oscars. The difference is that the Oscars have proven to be a harder nut to crack. That brings us to the traditional studios, which also made news with a few key pickups, none more so than Fox ( FOX , FOXA ). That leads to a company like Fox ironically becoming the disruptor to the disruptor. Last year, Amazon famously tried to buy the rights to Brooklyn, but was rebuffed. Producers opted to go to Fox's specialty division, Fox Searchlight, because they wanted a chance for the film to get more exposure through a theatrical run and be taken more seriously during awards season. Brooklyn was produced for $11 million, and has since earned over $30 million. It also snagged nominations from many top award groups and guilds, including three high-profile ones at the Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Screenplay). As for the Oscars, yes, it's not likely to win, but it is still in contention, which is a win in itself. In fact, it is the only Sundance-sold film from last year's festival to score nominations in a top category. Fox used that success to swoop in and buy this year's "it" film Birth Of A Nation, even though its team didn't present the highest bid. That designation went to Netflix, which bid $20 million ($2.5 million more than Fox), but was turned down because the filmmaker, Nate Parker, wanted the film exposed more to the masses. Parker recognized that with Birth... having a life in theaters, it had a better shot at being seen as an awards contender. Birth... was the one film that got away - the one target neither studio could acquire. Now, let me be clear, I don't want to imply the men and women behind Netflix and Amazon's film teams are not capable of successfully challenging the traditional model, because that's simply nowhere near the truth. These are experienced and talented individuals who know how to play the awards game, but they need more time to succeed, and this showing at Sundance will certainly help them. Right now, we are stuck between two competing trains of thought, with the question being: Which film will be the one that changes the balance? This year's Sundance proved a tipping point is coming, but the exact time frame remains hazy. Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.
