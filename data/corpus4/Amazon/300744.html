From the Slope of Hope: It's time for me to travel to the place I always prefer: way out on a limb. My Apple credentials are sound. I bought my first Macintosh in early 1984. I worked at Apple headquarters for several years in the late 1980s. When did I buy my first iPhone? The day it came out. First iPad? The day it came out. I even wrote a few books about the Macintosh. And some of you know the videos I've done about that Silicon Valley deity, Mr. Steven Paul Jobs. So I don't have any anti-Apple ax to grind. Having said all that, I think Apple's best days are behind it. The fat and happy executive staff, led by the charisma-free Tim Cook, is sitting on top of the most valuable company on the planet. Subtly and slowly, though, Apple has already lost one-quarter of its entire market cap. Tuesday, of course, is when Apple reports their earnings, after the close. I have no clue about Apple's fundamentals, but I've seen a chart or two in my life, and this long-term chart of Apple looks jumping-up-and-down bearish. Looking a bit closer, there is a massive topping pattern which I've helpfully shaded in green for you. The strength we had late last week pushed up right back toward all that overhead supply, and early on Monday, I shorted the stock at what I hope is a price I'll be pleased with. Now here's the going-out-on-a-limb part: I suspect that Apple is more likely to be down on Wednesday than up. I further think that, in the months ahead, Apple is going to find itself at a place no one dare imagine: in the 70s. I have tinted in area below which shows a suggested target, which just so happens to also close a gap beautifully set before a massive roar higher in the price a couple of years ago. I had some lunatic things to say about oil late in 2014, although I held my tongue about some price projections since they seemed so preposterous. I'm not going to offer Apple this courtesy. I think the 25% drop they've seen is going to blossom into a nearly 50% drop. I suspect ol' Cookie is going to be checking out his ridiculous Apple Watch sooner or later to see when it's time for him to finally leave and enjoy the vast personal fortune he acquired from Jobs' genius.

We will see if Apple goes into the direction forecast by me, or goes in the direction forecast by Tim Knight.  (I wonder if he gave me a down vote).  Oh, I would't be surprised if Apple slides in price in the short term. Mon, 01/25/2016 - 23:58 | 7096294 Heterodox economics Well, I have money on the line.  I brought Apple Stock around three weeks ago at 99.70.  I'm down a little--its current price is 99.40.  Interestingly enough, just a few days ago I was up about 2 percent on Apple. It fulfills three investment criteria that has worked well for me: 1. Its a S&P500 stock.  2. Its within 10 percent of its 52 week low. 3.  I use the company's products.   Tue, 01/26/2016 - 00:46 | 7096365 hal10000 As much as I like Apple, they and others in the "real economy" have allowd the bankster class to destroy their customer base and now the situation is at a point where they deserve everything they have coming to them. "Destroying the purchasing power of our customers and saddling them with debt?!  What could possibly go wrong?!  That will never affect us..."

I mention this to many who think I am crazy and say they can buy any co in the world w all their money and everything will be just fine Tue, 01/26/2016 - 00:09 | 7096316 Heterodox economics When I was following his blog Slope of Hope, I didnt make money.  I probably missed investment opportunities by being influenced by his blog.  When I stopped following his blog, my investments grew. Mon, 01/25/2016 - 22:37 | 7096095 pitz A good rule of thumb is that when firms that ordinarily operate in high-margin areas of the economy start chasing low margin businesses -- that the firm is well past its prime. In the case of Apple, its their efforts at developing a car.  A very low margin business that suffers significant global overcapacity.  Sure, the Apple car might be nice, but it is very unlikely they'll be able to derive enough of a premium to make it worthwhile. Tue, 01/26/2016 - 00:02 | 7096305 Heterodox economics Not really a good rule of thumb.  One counter-example is Amazon.  It is well known that their margins are thin.  Amazon has had thin margins since its beginning.  Yet its been a highly successful company. Tue, 01/26/2016 - 04:11 | 7096558 pitz Going 20+ years without meaningful GAAP-compliant profit is not a hallmark of a 'highly successful company'.  I'll just leave it at that. Tue, 01/26/2016 - 02:35 | 7096476 TeaClipper Only because of its tax avoidance schemes it deploys around the world, which are coming to an end as governments scrabble for any available income Tue, 01/26/2016 - 04:13 | 7096561 pitz Amazon would need profit to have a need of avoiding tax.  Amazon fails on the simple issue of viability; their business model is not sustainable as it costs just as much to fulfill sales as they take in as revenue from sales. Tue, 01/26/2016 - 02:32 | 7096470 PlayMoney and is way overpriced. I love amazon and use it....but am also short amazon. Looking back 6 years or so their growth rate is just over 3%. Over 100 times free cash flow...insane. I wouldn't go long any stock now other than a very short "bounce" trade. I look at it as sort of a generational thing - it was just about 20 years ago they were at $9 and speculation swirled that Apple might be finished, pecked clean by Microsoft, etc.    From that low point it's been a Great ride, and now maybe time for the pause that refreshes.   Or doesn't.
