Amazon has trillion dollar potential - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha May  4 2016, 13:15 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Speaking at Ira Sohn, Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya says Amazon ( AMZN -0.4%) is the one U.S. company with the potential to reach a $1T valuation. The main driver will be Amazon Prime. Though the company doesn't disclose membership, estimates put it at 80M globally, and that's just the beginning, says Palihapitiya. As for IT, Amazon will do for it what it did for retail. Amazon Web Services is a "tax on the internet, a tax on innovation ... that’s owned by a for profit company that we can all own.” Amazon, he says, will be a $3T company by 2025, with retail worth $1T, AWS worth $1.5T, and other operations and cash of $500B. Yep. Remember that! I remember taking substantial profits in December 1999 when I heard that. I should have taken more. I can also predict numbers out in 2025. It's not like anyone will remember if I get them wrong. Not that I will get them wrong. I always nail the numbers 10 to 20 years out in the future. If you invite me to a conference I'll tell you. Contact me for fees. Soon no. By 2025. And I'm laughing at anyone making predictions with 10 years timeframe because they are literally impossible to make. Only hit by pure chance. Just go back 10 years and check how many predictions became accurate on any given industry. Don't take it personal on Amazon. It's not like we are hurting its feelings go back 10 years ? no, only one year. at the beginning of last year, 12 economists surveyed made prediction of the economy last year, 100 % were wrong as of year end. To quote the late Senator Dirksen from Illinois: I remember this kind of talk was associated with Apple a few months back. Maybe after Q4 it might be time to get out if you have a position. I'm not sure whether this guy believes that their market cap will be 3T by then or not, but the last I looked the US market cap right now is below 25T, so he is predicting that Amazon will be a huge share of US market cap, even accounting for over all growth. Good luck with that! He's spinning a yarn. - $4.4 billion longterm debt/capital lease principal repayments -â€”â€”â€”-â€”â€”â€”-â€”â€”â€”-â€”â€”â€”-â€”â€”â€” So AMZN's FCF is negative now and has been declining from positive over the past several years. In particular, debt and capital lease principal repayments are growing massively. E-commerce and AWS don't generate sufficient FCF on their own to fund cloud data centers, so AMZN must resort to debt and capital lease financing to fund and maintain its AWS cloud infrastructure.  Amazon will be cash flow-negative in perpetuity.  AWS's reported "profits" are an illusion. When ongoing capex for AWS and ongoing debt/capital lease principal repayments are deducted, AWS is in the red forever. Amazon is making rocket ships. . .thats worth trillions!  Think of how many books they can sell on Mars! And with their rocket ships, they can ship everything to Mars for $99 a year!  Who cares if they only make a $1 billion a year today (and most of that comes from AWS) they are making rocket ships people!
