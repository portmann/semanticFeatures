'Handmade' Reveals Amazon's Most Important Moat - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon seems to be looking for top end, prolific handmade sellers. What Handmade at Amazon reveals about the market discovery process of Amazon. With the launch of 'Handmade at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )' the giant retailer continued its insatiable appetite for bringing new products or services to the marketplace. We'll get into the implications of that in a moment concerning Amazon, and how the decision process to enter this market revealed one of the most powerful moats Amazon has. We'll also look at the risk to Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) and if it's to the magnitude some believe. As for the market on the seller's side of it, this is part of an ongoing self-employment, freelancing trend that has been going on for years. That, coupled with more access to consumers because of Internet e-commerce, has been a powerful catalyst continuing to drive this market. From a consumer point of view, they're increasingly looking for unique items outside of mass-manufacturing, including a process they like to follow or measure from beginning to end, to ensure it lines up with their ethics. This isn't something all consumers are concerned with, but in the handmade market, its far more prevalent and important to buyers. Amazon will start off with a modest number of sellers of handmade goods, having launched the service with approximately 5,000 artisans. They represent every state in the U.S. and others from 60 countries. Initially 80,000 items will be offered for sale. A little over 600 items will be made eligible for Amazon Prime. More will be added as the service grows. The categories of products offered at launch will be Home products (Art, Baby Bedding, Bath, Bedding, Furniture, Home Décor, Kitchen & Dining, Lighting, Patio, Lawn & Garden, Storage & Organization), Party Supplies and Stationery, and Jewelry, according to the company's site. Amazon will charge 12 percent for the sales made by sellers on Handmade at Amazon. Sellers will be able to participate in discounted shipping and payment processing as part of doing business with Amazon. Sellers will be charged a $40 monthly fee in the future if they sell over 40 items a month on Handmade at Amazon. In the beginning of the service it has been waived. Since Amazon is charging a lot more to sellers per item sold, it suggests to me it's a screening device to keep certain types of sellers away. The future $40 monthly fee is probably another screening device, used to weed out the less serious sellers. The monthly fee won't be activated until August 2016. The company has positioned itself as an alternative to Etsy by not allowing any mass-manufactured items to be sold in its marketplace. That is in contrast to Etsy's decision to allow some mass-manufactured goods to be sold on its platform. That has proven unpopular with many of Etsy's sellers. The easily anticipated conclusion that this is going to kill Etsy has already been made by some analysts, led by a research note from Wedbush, saying almost 90 percent of Etsy's sellers are planning to, or are considering selling products on Handmade at Amazon. One problem with that assertion is it was based on a sampling of only 30 current Etsy sellers. Wedbush believes this means Etsy sellers aren't loyal to the company, which implies they may leave en masse and join Amazon. In a recent S-1 filing by Etsy , it said almost a third of its active sellers and 45 percent of its active buyers, since 2011 through 2014, were still active. Also, in 2014, almost 80 percent of Etsy's gross merchandise sales came from repeat business. It's highly unlikely sellers will abandon Etsy in large numbers in light of that type of performance. From the seller's side of it, over 99 percent of gross merchandise sales was repeat business. The point is looking at sellers is only one piece of the data. The other is the buyer side, and it appears they are very loyal to their artisans. Of course that's a risk as well. It's doubtful Etsy is the reason they buy from an artisan. It's the artisan that has built a loyal following. So if they were to pack up and leave Etsy, their customers would certainly follow. That said, many sellers have been at Etsy for years, and to simply abandon the store they have build up there would take more than grumbling about Etsy's policies concerning mass-manufacturing. That may change if Amazon does this right, but in the next year or two, I don't see this being much of an issue for Etsy, other than looking over its shoulder at what may come next from Amazon. As of June 30, Etsy had 21.7 million buyers and 1.5 million sellers. It charges 3.5 percent for sales, and a 20 cent listing fee for each item listed on the platform. What it looks like to me is Amazon is attempting to siphon off its best sellers, which if they see an opportunity to increase sales on the much larger customer base of Amazon, it may result in them using Amazon as their primary sales outlet. In that regard, Etsy could be at risk of retaining only lower-level sellers, while losing its best to its new, giant competitor. It'll take time to see if Etsy is up to the challenge, but in the short term it would be surprising to see if it has significant material impact on the performance of Etsy. There are too many relationships built through the years to see it suddenly crumble. The benefit will be to the sellers at first, who will be given another outlet for their custom-made goods. If Amazon exceeds expectations for the prolific producers and sellers, that is what to look for concerning the depth of impact it may have on Etsy. That'll take time. In its press release vice president for Amazon Marketplace, Peter Faricy, made what appeared to be an offhand comment about the impetus behind Handmade at Amazon. That is what initiated the interest in creating the new platform, and it's one of the powerful moats Amazon has enjoyed for years. Those businesses and entrepreneurs that understood that have used as a marketing research engine themselves. Amazon has at its disposal extraordinary data which is generated from sales and customer searches on its site. All it has to do is find patterns within the data to see if a specific market has a lot of potential, and if consumers are looking to Amazon to serve it. That's the embryo of many of Amazon's businesses, and why it has such an advantage over many of its competitors. A lot of people don't understand that Amazon is one of the top, if not the top, search engines in the world today. Those millions of searches creates a treasure-trove of data that can be accessed for invaluable hints as to what consumers are looking for, and what the company can do to provide a selling platform to meet that demand. Internal search data is a giant moat of Amazon, that very few competitors can match. I'm not sure any can within the market it competes in. Amazon has more immediate and open access to its own data, and if other businesses find it extremely valuable, it's even more so for Amazon, which has it all visibly at its fingertips. The challenge for Amazon is to make sense out of the gigantic amount of data it has to sift through. Handmade at Amazon targets a very robust market, one which has been growing for years, and caters a number of trends that have converged to create the market for handmade goods. It should do very well, and provide another revenue stream for Amazon. The question now is if it's going to increase the size of the overall market because of its participation, or if it'll have to steal market share from Etsy and smaller competitors in order to grow. If it does have to do that, its own growth will be modest, and Etsy will struggle to maintain market share, even as it struggles to grow. The major value in this initiative, in my view, is it reveals the powerful data machine behind this new business for Amazon. Having access to this enormous amount of material will be something its competitors never will have at the level it does, and that's why new projects like this will continually emerge from its pipeline, creating a variety of retail revenue streams in the years ahead.
