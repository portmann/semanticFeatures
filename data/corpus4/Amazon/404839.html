Insidious Office Store Monopoly Averted - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Stocks spiked higher Tuesday; biggest S&P gain in two months. Stocks soared on Tuesday. It was a huge day, with just about everything bright green. The Dow (NYSEARCA: DIA ) spiked more than 220 points. All three major indices were up precisely 1.25%. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had its largest gain in two months. It was a uniformly successful day for the US equity markets. The only losers of note on the day were some retailers. And even that was due to the overwhelming surge in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which soared more than 3% to put in its first-ever close above $700. If you were short just about anything on the day, you got run over. It's been a demoralizing couple of months for anyone that's been fighting the run higher in stocks. I'm still skeptical of the rally and the market's ability to make new highs. That said, days like yesterday wear on a market skeptic's resolve. For those going long volatility (NYSEARCA: VXX ) (NYSEARCA: UVXY ), it's been a rough time lately. VXX dropped 5% and UVXY 10% on the day, both to new all-time lows. UVXY is now 85% off its 52-week high. As I frequently note, there are better options for betting against the market than volatility. The US FTC has stepped in and successfully halted the proposed Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS ) and Office Depot (NASDAQ: ODP ) merger. In a theoretical world where Amazon and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) didn't exist, these two firms would potentially have an extraordinarily large portion of the market for paper, ink cartridges and binders. I'm toned down my libertarian political instincts over the years, regardless, this is the sort of absurd overreach of government power that makes it easy to mock the nanny state. Prior to the ruling and the collapse in Office Depot's shares after-hours, the companies had a combined market cap of a measly $11 billion. A behemoth this was not. Remember when the FTC ended up basically letting Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) off without any meaningful consequence despite allegedly colluding against other browsers such as Netscape? Well, we're not in that era anymore. The pendulum has swung. Office Depot is, at present, hardly even profitable. Another idea behind dangerous monopolies are that they make "excess" profits. Office Depot closed the day at a greater than 400 P/E ratio based on its sparkling $9 million of net income last year. Put another way, neither Staples nor Office Depot is a reasonable threat of monopolizing anyone. Remember when there were talks that Borders and Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS ) might merge? That would - theoretically - have created a book-selling monopoly in retail stores. But it wouldn't have caused any harm to consumers; in fact, in the long run, it probably would have helped them by keeping one stronger book-selling competitor to Amazon in place. Similarly, Office Depot and Staples really needed merger synergies to retain a viable competitive position going forward against Amazon and the cheap mass-retailers including Wal-Mart and Costco (NASDAQ: COST ). There's a good chance the FTC's action ends up causing Office Depot to go bankrupt eventually, which will do nothing to save consumers money, protect jobs, or make the economy more efficient. In all, this is a horrendous ruling from the FTC. And for investors considering other retail mergers, consider that there's now a lot more risk in play. Office Depot shares ended the after-hours session down 30%, with Staples also off 10%. Continuing with the "Amazon crushing everything" theme, apparel retailers got smoked on Tuesday. It's always fascinating to see what makes new 52-week lows on days where the market is up strongly (and vice versa). The leaders to the downside were clothing retailers. Gap (NYSE: GPS ) fell 12% on a bad earnings result to a new 52-week low: L Brands (NYSE: LB ) continued its post-earnings slide, hitting new 52-week lows on the session. The Buckle (NYSE: BKE ) also joined the new lows party. Others such as Macy's (NYSE: M ) and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) fell on the session and are near 52-week lows as well. So what's wrong with the sector? One theory gaining credence is that millennials don't like mall apparel stores. For example, see this SA news bit : In another sign of the problem that apparel stores are having in driving sales with millennials, the new Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (NASDAQ: MILN ) has a top holding of Amazon and very little representation of apparel chain stock stocks (LULU and LB make the list). Another theory is that these companies are spending too much on share buybacks rather than reinvesting in their businesses. Say what you will about Amazon's lack of significant profitability, the company is innovative and has no trouble finding and exploiting new opportunities. Gap, on the other hand, has bought back 20% of outstanding shares over the past four years, almost all of them way above today's market price. Not only has that taken capital away from the business, it's also provided lousy shareholder returns. As Jeff Macke has theorized , the Street is now starting to give a pass to companies such as Dick's (NYSE: DKS ) with hit or miss results that invest heavily in their business. Unlike many of the other struggling retailers, Dick's isn't just sending capital back to shareholders while allowing Amazon to take control of the future. Finally, one shouldn't rule out the simplest explanation. The apparel retailers are selling off because 2016 has begun with a set of dismal retail sales figures generally. The consumer is showing strain, and this category of retail is hard-hit by economic slowdowns. I get the sense that the ills of the apparel industry go beyond simple economic slowdown, but it likely plays a role. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
