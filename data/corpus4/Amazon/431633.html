The FAA said Monday that the company improperly sent a caustic chemical that leaked from its packaging, coming into contact with nine workers at a UPS facility. According to the agency, a shipment of corrosive drain cleaner wasnâ€™t packaged correctly, declared, and labeled. Amazon also failed to include emergency directions on the package, and didnâ€™t train employees on how to handle hazardous materials, the FAA said. â€œAmazon has a history of violating the hazardous materials regulations,â€? the FAA said in the release. â€œFrom February 2013 to September 2015 alone, Amazon was found to have violated the hazardous materials regulations 24 other times.â€? In the meantime, Amazon has been working on building its own delivery system , leasing a fleet of planes for its delivery fleet and buying a 10% stake in an air cargo partner recently.
