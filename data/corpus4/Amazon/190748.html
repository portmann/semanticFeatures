25 Awesome Tools and Sites to Save You Money Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! Since it’s the weekend and I assume many people are out shopping, why not share some tools to help you save some of that hard earned cash? Â Seriously people, why not save when you are shopping? Â Well, in the good ol’ weekendÂ spirit, I brought together 25 tools and sites you can use to save money. Â It really is that easy. There are many more that I could come up with, but I thought 25 would be more than enough. Â These include some places you have probably seen or used, but maybe some others you haven’t. Â I hope this will become a quality resource for thoselooking to save money. Â I know I am always looking for a new way to save cold, hard cash! Ahh! Â Why is Walmart on here? Â Though I am not a huge fan of shopping at Walmart, I still think they offer great deals. Â It is not the prices that irritate me, it is the customer service and many of the patrons. Â Either way, Walmart just introduced their Savings Catcher . This is really a simple money saving tool. You either go to their website and enter your Walmart receipt number or you download the Walmart app and scan your receipt. Â When you do this, they will search the products you bought and if they find a lower advertised price from their local competitors, they will give you the difference as a e-gift card. Â Now, how freaking easy is that? There is no mystery that I love shopping on Amazon.com . Â I am a Prime member and enjoy super fast shipping and awesome customer service. Â Amazon makes my shopping life easy. Â Either way, I have known for years that Amazon fluctuates their pricing on a regular basis. Â I have seen some products switch multiple times per day. Â Unfortunately, I don’t have time to watch the prices, so I get help from CamelCamelCamel . Â You just have to enter the URL of the Amazon product you want to buy. Â You can also search by keywords. Â CamelCamelCamel tracks Amazon prices and will notify you when prices drop on a specified item. You can also view the price history of a given product. Â This tool is awesome! I have used this service for about a week on a few things I have been looking to buy on Amazon . Â Savings.com’s PriceJump is a feature that allows you to compare Amazon prices to others. Â You put in an Amazon URL or ASIN number and PriceJump will scan some of the bigger Amazon competitors. Â It will tell you if they find a better price of if you are better to purchase it from Amazon. Â This tool is relatively new, so they are working on adding shipping costs into the mix, as that is a decision maker for many. I encourage you to check it out. Here is a list of the best ways to save money before you checkout on Amazon.com . There are so many ways to save money on Amazon , you should check it out! I am an online coupon junkie. Â I will always look for a coupon before I go through the checkout process. Â One of the biggest coupon sites is RetailMeNot . Â I will check this site, along with my coupons page , to see if there are any good coupons. Â By using this source, I have never paid full price for anything online. Â Hail online coupons! You might not have heard of this site and I don’t blame you. It is relatively new. Â I think the name is unique. It is another online coupon code site. Â They are slowly growing the stores they cover, but they do have some unique coupons, especially for some sites that are popular in other countries. Â I like to test out smaller sites in hopes they grow big. Â It is nice to get in on the ground floor! Â Let’s see where ChameleonJohn goes. Who doesn’t love a fat wallet? Â Seriously? Â  FatWallet is an awesome site that encompasses online coupons, deals, sales, and even cash back offers. Â I have had a FatWallet account for some time and it is awesome. Â I highly recommend them if you are looking for some killer deals. Â Their forums are very active with deal finders and you would be amazed at what you can score. Ah, cash back! Â What a great way to earn some money back when you are shopping. Â Cash back is a big thing these days. Why not earn some money back when you are doing your regular shopping? Â Do you not like money? Â  Ebates is one of the most popular cash back sites around. You can earn up to 20% back at some stores and they have a huge database of stores. Â You just hit up your Ebates account, go to the store you want to buy from and watch the cash come rolling back into your wallet. Â You can check out my full Ebates review as well. Upromise offers a little twist on cash back shopping. Â While you can score a nice check right to your bank account, their main offering is to use your cash back to fund a child’s educational savings account . I have my son’s account hooked up to my Upromise account . I just got a nice deposit of over $200 in the 529. Â Now, that money will start earning some great interest and help me get closer to funding my son’s college education in full. Â Upromise is free to use and I have used it for years. Â You can read my Upromise review if you are feeling compelled. Mr. Rebates is similar to Ebates and other cash back stores. Â They have over 2,000 stores for you to choose from. You go shopping and then get cash back into your Mr. Rebates account . It really is simple. Â While you might not need to check different cash back sites, I have found that many of them offer unique cash back percentages for different stores. Â I like to check each one to see where I will get the best bang for my buck. This sites bills itself as “USA’s most generous cash back site!” Â That is quite the claim. While I cannot confirm this is true, they do provide some quality cash back offerings. Â As they compete with the others, it is a good idea to check out Â  Top Cash Back and see if they have a better cash back offering for a specific store. Â It is simple and free just as the others! I love Big Crumbs. Another cash back site, but this one does it a little differently. Â While you earn cash back on your purchases, they also give you CrumbShares. Now, what in the H E double hockey sticks are CrumbShares? Â When you get cash back, they give you the same amount back in Crumbshares. Â If/when the company gets acquired or bought out, they will then provide half of the compensation they receive back to their members. Â The number of Crumbshares will correspond to how much of that compensation you receive. Â  Big Crumbs is a free site to join . I have written about Amazon Warehouse Deals in the past. Â It is one of the little unknown secrets of Amazon shopping. Â This little section provides deep discounts on products that were either returned or have some shipping box damage. Â  Amazon verifies and checks each individual product and gives them a grade. You can really score some awesome deals and I have saved a lot of money doing so. Â Check out Amazon’s warehouse deals ! I was a huge fan of Manilla for their bill management. Â It not only saved me time, but also saved me money. I never worried about being late on my bills. Â When Manilla shut down, I was a little lost. Luckily, I found Finovera . They offer a similar service to Manilla and it is free. Â You can manage your bills and check over your statements all in one place. Super simple and easy! Who doesn’t want to save money on filling up their tanks? Â I know I always look for the best deal in the area I need to fill up. Â Gas Prices vary from station to station, so it is a great idea to check prices. Luckily, GasBuddy has a website and a smartphone app to help you. Â You don’t even need an account. Just look up the area you are going to be in on their website and they list all of the current prices for gas. Â Do the same on your smartphone and then you save easily. Â This is one of my go-to apps on my phone. I am almost certain you have heard of Groupon . Â While this is not revolutionary, you can score some sweet deals from the site. Â It is not mystery. Â While I don’t like signing up for their emails, since I hate daily deal emails, I do check out the site from time to time. They also have a Groupon Goods section where you can get awesome deals on products. Â Groupon is still on my money saving list! The competitor of Groupon is another great place to check for some awesome deals. They also have goods, services, and getaways. Â As I mentioned, I don’t like putting in my email address to these things. Â Unfortunately, they force you to put in an email address. This is how they make their money. Â Either way, LivingSocial is still a good service to check out. OK, I couldn’t write a saving money post without putting Craigslist on here. I mean, come on! Â You can get some many things on Craigslist. Â I have bought and sold a plethora of items on this site and I highly recommend it. Â If you know what you are looking for, chances are you might find it here. Â You don’t have to worry about fees and you don’t even need an account. I have even sold a few cars on Craigslist with ease! Honey is a Chrome browser extension that allows you to easily save money with little to no work. You install the extension, then when you’re on a site shopping and ready to check out, that’s when Honey works for you. It will search their database to see if the site you’re on matches with a coupon. If you’re on Walmart.com and you are checking out, it will check to see if there is a good and applicable coupon for you to use. It’s literally that easy. Just browse normally, go to checkout and enjoy the savings! When we go shopping for cars, we never want to overpay. It can be hard with how salespeople work and even harder with the numbers dealerships use. Â Negotiating a good price for a car can be a freaking hassle. Â Admit it! Â Well, TrueCar is dedicated to helping you realize what a good price for a car should be. Â They give you information about what others in your area paid for the same vehicle. They will also give you a printout of a best price and you can take it to one of their many approved TrueCar dealerships. Â I have checked it out once and it did give me a nice price and a hefty amount of bargaining power. Hate banking fees? Â Yep, me too! Â Luckily for you, a new service has come out looking to help you out with ever increasing bank fees. MagnifyMoney compares a long list of financial products to help you save money. Â You can check your checking account to see if there is a better option. Their search tool is awesome and I highly recommend trying this service out in order to keep money in your checking account ! This is one I just ran across and I am not hooked! Â I have a monthly prescription, plus some for my son when he gets sick. Â Since he is in daycare, that happens more often than not. Anyway, GoodRx allows you to search for any FDA-approved drug in America and compare the prices from a multitude of pharmacies in your area. Â You can do it from their website or their app . Â What a way to do it. Â They can even beat prices based on your insurance, depending on the drug. Â I recommend this site! This site is my go-to for managing my money. They focus on your investments and can tell you if you are paying too much for your portfolio. When I signed up for Personal Capital , the site was perfect for my needs. It still is! Â You can get a free account and when you add in your bank accounts, credit cards, debts, and investment accounts, you can get a full picture of your financial health. This is a Mint.com alternative and it focuses on investments. Â I was able to save some good money by switching a few funds that were charging too much to manage. I am going on my investment kick now! Â Either way, I started investing when I was right out of college. I wish I would have done it sooner, but didn’t know much. I found Betterment as a great alternative to many of the managed investment accounts that cost too much money. Â You can start investing with only $250 and their fee structure is low, which saves you money. My Roth IRA is setting in Betterment now and it has been killing it! Now, this is a cool investing site. Â It is my newest addition to my investment project. Â I found Motif Investing when I was looking around for some alternatives to the traditional online brokerages like Scottrade and E*trade . Â  Motif Investing offers buckets (called Motifs) of stocks. Â Instead of charging you a fee for each individual trade, they only charge you one fee to buy their Motif. Â They can have up to 30 stocks and they revolve around a common theme, like energy, dividends, healthcare, and many more. Â I Â have signed up and I have loved it since. They are great with customer service! I am a stickler for finding the best auto insurance policy and price that I can. I just switched a few months ago to a new service once my old provider wouldn’t drop their price. I had been with them for 14 years and they had been the best. Unfortunately, when we bought a new house, they were the highest price. Many others provided lower prices. Â Boo! Â Anyway, I like to shop around occasionally. Â Luckily for me and you, now you can use CoverHound . Â This easy to use site allows you to put in the coverages you need and then gets you quotes from multiple agencies. Â Simple, easy, and the savings can be awesome! Alright, it is your turn. What is a tool/site you love to use to save money? Â Remember, my list is not exhaustive, but just ones I enjoy and have just found. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a blog management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar , which is a great blog that I co-own. I was lucky that the Atlanta area was part of the BETA market for SavingsCathcher. Since May I’ve gotten back over $40. Personally I don’t care about the service if I can save money on the same products. I frequent Walmart, Kroger and Costco and find using all 3 is the best bang for my money. I save enough from my methods to be able to buy my meat products from a local butcher with great service, high quality and FRESH products. Also buy it in bulk to get better prices than any of those big stores! I notice the Savingscatcher compares to other stores that are not that close by or that I never would go to! Thank you for the feedback on the savings catcher. I used it here and it worked pretty well.  Unfortunately, for me, I don’t get too much savings from the oil I buy at Walmart. It already is the lowest price. Great list. You don’t love the clientele at Walmart? That’s why I go, dude! People wear the most awesome clothes at Walmart…..(or “the Walmart”). Well, I will leave my Walmart afflictions to the people of Walmart website.  So, since I can get my fix there, I have no other need! I’ve been a fan of FatWallet. I get great offers in cheap prices. Highly recommendable for those on tight budget. These are great.  The site that gives to a 529 account is so unique, but that’s awesome!  Thanks for such a great list! I really enjoy Upromise. It is really unique and I have one that I use to fund my son’s 529. This is a great list of tools and websites. I will be sure to pass on a few of these to some of my friends. I’ve been staying on top of my finances recently, but I know many of my friends have issues from time to time. Awesome! List of tools are really good. The internet not only allows you the opportunity to compare different prices, often there are online comparison calculators. Impulse shoppers spend more than what was budgeted. Make a list and stick to it in order to control your account. Limit credit cards and online cash advances to emergencies while you work at strengthening your finances. Have you gone through it? http://blog.cashinasnap.com/9-money-saving-tips-on-a-tight-budget/ September 14, 2014 at 9:27 pm — Reply The Ibotta app has saved me a bunch of money in the month and a half I’ve been using it. Just click on the type of store you are shopping (grocery, restaurant, baby and kids, etc) and check out the items offering a rebate. Sometimes you can get a quarter back from any random gallon of milk, $1.25 to $2.00 back on a tube of sun screen you needed anyway, etc. Best part is the money sits in your account immediately upon receipt acceptance, and once you get to $5, you can deposit it immediately to your PayPal or Venmo (have not tried out Venmo yet) account. Free money! Ibotta is great. It’s fast $ straight to PayPal, too. If you have an iPhone and you buy groceries, etc., you’re robbing yourself if you don’t use it. ReceiptHog is another cool app that gives you points to redeem for PayPal dollars (mere $1 minimum qualifies for payout!) just for taking pictures of most major store receipts. Doesn’t even matter what you buy (mostly)! Thanks for visiting Debt Roundup. I built this site to share the journey I took to get out of nearly $75,000 in debt.
