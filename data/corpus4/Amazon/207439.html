Retail heavyweights gear up for long-term battle against Amazon - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Oct 17 2015, 15:05 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) ripped the band-aid off this week to reset expectations for three years worth of earnings in one decisive action. Though the Wal-Mart bombshell rocked a large number of retail stocks initially, many recovered during the week or pared their losses. Two notable exceptions were Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) which ended the week sharply lower due in some part to their similar track of heavy investments in e-commerce. While investment firms analysts turned defensive this week on Wal-Mart ( SA summary, BI summary ), Target ( TGT ), and Best Buy ( BBY ) - some retail insiders see a different dynamic playing out. They note  that, unlike Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), the brick-and-mortar retail giants have decades in building out strategic infrastructure, supplier networks, and delivery systems. At a larger scale, and on a longer time frame, those advantages could lead to higher margins for the trio than Amazon as tech investments pay off. In the world of chess this is called a discovered attack. The the move is felt only after it is too late. Too little, too late.  The Walmarts of the world will have to work very hard to hold on to what shrunken share they have left.
