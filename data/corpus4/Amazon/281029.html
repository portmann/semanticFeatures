My New Year's Resolution is to eat healthy every day and get rid of the processed sugar in my diet. My resolution is to try at least one new and different thing each month. I want to push myself out of the ordinary and humdrum this year. Even better is finding things to try that do not involve money. I'm allocating all of my bonus money to payoff my student loans, and we're saving to fund our 2017 wedding!
