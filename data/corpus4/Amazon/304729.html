Amazon Plunges After Missing Q4 Revenue, Earnings As Concerns Emerge About Future Profitability | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! For years, shorts would tear their hair out quarter after quarter, when AMZN would continue to bleed cash with relentless abandon, only to see the stock soar after earnings. Now, in what may be a perfect poetic symmetry, following the quarter in which Amazon's free cash flow soared to the highest in years, printing at $7.3 billion, or more than triple the year ago period... It wasn't just that: one reason for the 13% plunge may be that in the holiday season in which many had expected that AMZN would take away market share from an imploding retail sector, revenue of $35.7 billion, a 22% increase, actually missed expectations of $35.9 billion, something AMZN has rarely done in the blockbuster for retail spending fourth quarter. Another reason is that Wall Street finally got ahead of itself. By a lot: it was expecting AMZN to generate $1.55 in EPS. Instead, AMZN missed this by a whopping 30%, with a final Q4 EPS of $1.00 (more than doubling the year ago net income), on operating income of $1.1 billion (a nearly 100% increase from a year ago) which also missed expectations of a $1.24 billion number. On the spending side, operating expenses increased 21% to $34.6 billion, making some question if the company's core business profits will not be swept by Bezos' many business growth ideas. The CEO's biggest challenge is balancing Wall Streetâ€™s thirst for profits against his own ambitions of using new technology - such as unmanned drones and intelligent household gadgets. Bezos is also eager to replicate his U.S. success abroad, including challenging Flipkart Online Services Pvt. for Indiaâ€™s fast-growing e-commerce industry. According to Bloomberg , "the result was a surprise for investors who have become accustomed to Amazonâ€™s ability to fuel sales by spending heavily on delivery infrastructure and new products. The key question is whether the Seattle-based company can readjust its investments in the face of weaker than anticipated sales. Still, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos appears determined to show that Amazon can keep bringing in more profit and sales - he pulled back on spending last year to deliver a surprise jump in earnings and will be showing Amazonâ€™s first Super Bowl commercial next week. "Amazon reached this new level of profitability in 2015 that we hadnâ€™t seen previously," said Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co. LLC. "If they donâ€™t keep that trend going in the right direction, the stock goes down." For now Amazon is not suffering too much in that regard: Prime memberships rose a whopping 51%, offsetting fears that Amazon's annuity cash flow stream may be throttled. Curiously, not even the silver lining was enough to save AMZN: the company's cloud service, Amazon Web Services, generated sales of $2.41 billion, beating expectations of $2.37 billion, up 69% from the $1.42 billion a year ago, and generating income of $687, an impressive 28% margin, modestly shy of the $1 billion in $1.1 billion in retail profits across all of the company's other profit lines. Finally, not even AMZN's guidance was all that bad: Net sales are expected to be between $26.5 billion and $29.0 billion, or to grow between 17% and 28% compared with first quarter 2015. This compares with consensus expectations of $27.6 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. Wall Street expects $658 million So yes, a good quarter, but not good enough, and one in which now that AMZN has entered profitability mode, suddenly expectations exist that this profit growth can sustain, and - judging by the crash in AMZN's price - that they won't. Meanwhile, AMZN continues to grow and grow and grow, perhaps too much for its own good: as the chart below shows, while worldwide growth once again took a leg down, the number of employees at AMZN has now grown to an epic 230,800 up from "only" 154,100 a year ago.

The stock was up $80 in one week on the back of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! The past $300 has been total bullshit. But nobody cares. Nobody investigates the accounting, nobody audits the books. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:15 | 7111107 arby63 And it really doesn't matter because when he speaks the Feds listen. He is essentially a Fed because these "miracle" companies don't just have money thrown at them without some type of pretense. In the case of Amazon, I am sure that Bezos' time as a Wall Street IT guy was rather helpful. He was also a hedge fund guy. Only point here being is that we have seen a series of these "miracles" over the last 20 years and they all have many common threads: easy money from close-knit investors and relations. I suppose that's nothing new but the near-merging of government and private business is getting awfully questionable. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:41 | 7110532 L Bean Amazon is soviet in nature, much like Wal-Mart. There outta be an index, for all it reflects on the real state of The Folks.  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:42 | 7110534 VW Nerd Amazon is suddenly unable to shrug off earnings??  Until now, funds were willing to throw money at this company with a P/E in excess of 200 without batting an eye.  Now it matters??  Crazy....

Trump Some folks got Amazoned today.  I'm tired of hearing those phrases but it seemed appropriate.  The fuckers announced a music service to spike the share price right before announcing their quarter cause they knew it would tank it.

Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:49 | 7110563 NoWayJose Amazon had a chance to be profitable using massive warehouses, a well thought out web site to display products and get customers to buy things they don't need, and an efficient mailing system.  Instead, they expand into one hour delivery with high overhead.  Walmart is closing these smaller close-to-the-customer stores because of low profits and high costs.  Amazon is attempting a similar thing - but is ADDING the overhead for delivery!  The model is doomed.

They actually invested in the business and are trying for longer-term growth. This simply shows how bullshit wall street and being public is. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:56 | 7110579 brada1013567 How do you tell people your the guy who bought it up $52 at the close. That's kinda like saying hey I am insane.

Just because they turned a minuscule profit during a few quarters in the past 20 years doesn't mean the company is profitable or will ever be. Hello LA LA LAND, I'd like a ticket to enter please because I'm sick and tired of living in reality. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:23 | 7110694 RopeADope Stop thinking about Amazon like you would an old-school American company. Don't feel bad, I fell into the same trap you did, until I realized Amazon was not an American idea. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:59 | 7110610 gatorengineer MSFT is almost a bigger shit show right now.  PE to 35 on huge revenue drop, no new products on the horizon... Wow...

I thought that because everyone is buying I will get rich by the end of the year. Now, more people need to buy. P.S. Don't forget that the economy is b00ming to the bottom.  Chicago PMI: 42.9 & Durable Goods Orders: -.5.1%. Nope, everything is still fine! Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:08 | 7110632 DeepFriedLizards People like I who live in rural Alaska love Amazon.  I just received 6 XL dog cages for $46 a pop (a very good deal) with free delivery.  Just the shipping alone would have cost me $60 a cage from the same manufacturer.  I hope they're in business forever.  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:15 | 7110655 moonmac Clothing sizes are now made to fit little gay wad meth heads. Iâ€™d have to return 90% of my pants and shirts if I shopped online. Amazon canâ€™t compete with brick and mortar. In this day and age it's very easy to offer something for sale online, package and ship it, so why does Amazon need to be the middleman?  They have massive employee base that tinkers around improving their website, but who needs that when information is so readily available online anyway?  Think about it, Amazon spends a ton of money on things that don't add value for the consumer, plain and simple. Gee look their website offers "reviews" BFD.   It's only a matter of time before this gets sorted out in the free market.  In the meantime Amazon, in my opinion, is working nonstop to prevent small merchants from being in business, with all kinds of dirty tricks.  Fedex, UPS and USPS executives can likely tell some stories. Another issue -- Most people have no idea that overseas there are counterfeits, does Amazon want to curb their suppliers from shipping fake goods?  Doubt it.   I've personally received counterfeit products via Amazon. Order anything from Amazon and who knows it's authenticity.  Check how easy it is to be a seller on Amazon, so who knows who those people are? Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:53 | 7110806 Magnum Einstein. Let me explain it this way.  Imagine you want to buy a set of "Sony Model XYZ Headphones".  They have "great reviews".   You get the headphones and they are counterfeit and fulfilled by Amazon.  Does that mean everyone else who ordered those got a counterfeit, Einstein?  I heard Rolex makes great watches Einstein. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:36 | 7110945 847328_3527 I find their stuff authentic. Never had a problem and it's usuallyu much cheaper then driving around sorting thru flooded aisles and finding the right style, size, etc...not to mention the dangers of parking lots these days even if you are not in SomaliLand (Mpls). The attack occurred Sunday evening in an apartment complex in the cityâ€™s  Cedar Riverside neighborhood, also known as â€œLittle Mogadishuâ€? for its  high concentration of Somali refugees imported from United Nations  refugee camps in Africa. Abdi allegedly followed the girl out of an elevator. He asked for her  name and offered his hand to her. She shook his hand and Abdi refused  to let go. Police said he proceeded to rape the girl in the hallway of  the apartment building. Authorities used video surveillance footage to help track down the  suspect, who was arrested about 24 hours later on Monday in St. Paul. The U.S. government has resettled more than 110,000 Somali refugees since the early 1990s and shipped in another 8,858 during the most  recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, according to U.S. State  Department data. â€œLucky taxpayers,â€? Corcoran continued. â€œWe paid for his resettlement,  surely his welfare and now we will get to pay for his long  imprisonment.â€? Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:37 | 7110960 Magnum Probably over 90% of their products are authentic, but it's become a big flea market with what appears to be any Tom Dick or Harry able to sell at Amazon as a "merchant".  Those merchants pay fees. Online shopping is great but one can almost always find a better deal for the same item sold at Amazon, from other merchants who don't have the overhead.   Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 01-28 20:57: PBoC gauges demand for 14-day and 28-day repo demand and 91-day bill... 01-28 20:57: PREVIEW: Bank of Japan decision is scheduled later in which the BoJ... 01-28 20:24: PRE-MARKET CHINESE STOCK NEWS: Highlights include; PBoC is to conduct... 01-28 20:24: Major FX Option expiries of note for today's 10am NY cut (... 01-28 20:24: PBoC to inject CNY 80bln via 28-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 7... 01-28 19:51: PRE-MARKET TAIWANESE AND SINGAPORE STOCK NEWS: Highlights include;... 01-28 17:36: Unisys sees FY16 revenue $2.775B-$2.875B, consensus $2.98B 01-28 17:36: WestRock reports Q1 adjusted EPS 59c vs. 88c a year ago 01-28 17:36: WestRock reports Q1 adjusted EPS 59c vs. 88c a year ago 01-28 19:21: Merck Receives FDA Approval of Hep C Drug ZEPATIER; To Cost $54,600/Patient for 12-Week Course 01-28 18:13: Lipper Says US-Based Energy Sector Stock Funds Saw $420M Of Inflows Last Week, Say $83M Of Outflows In Week Prior 01-28 18:13: Pinnacle Financial Partner Agrees To Merge With Avenue Financial, Avenue Shareholder s To Receive 0.36 Shares Of Pinnacle and $2/Share Cash 01-28 18:13: ImmuCell Reports Sees FY15 Rev. $10.2M, EPS $0.34-$0.41 01-28 18:13: FS Bancorp Reports Q4 EPS $0.66 vs. Prior Year Quarter $0.52 01-28 17:42: Boeing Awarded $2.5B Contract for 20 P-8A Maritime Surveillance Planes for U.S. Navy, Australia -Reuters 01-28 17:42: Boeing Awarded $2.5B Contract for 20 P-8A Maritime Surveillance Planes for U.S. Navy, Australia -Reuters Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 161,330 - Refugee Murders 22-Year-Old Swedish Woman In Knife Attack 119,104 - Silver Market In Disarray After Benchmark Price Fix Manipulation 97,336 - This $250,000 Caterpillar Bulldozer Can Be Yours For The Low, Low Price Of $55 75,718 - "The Level Of Alarm Is Extremely High" As Zika "Spreading Explosively" WHO Warns 57,115 - Ammon Bundy Admits Defeat, Calls On Remaining Oregon Occupiers To "Stand Down, Go Home" 49,912 - 17-Year-Old Girl Fined For Pepper Spraying "Rapefugee" In "World's Best Country For Women" Make sure to read our " How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters] " Guide It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .
