Amazon Now Selling Clothing Under Its Own In-House Brands â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. By Mary Beth Quirk February 23, 2016 In yet another effort to completely and totally dominate the shopping world, Amazon has apparently started a few private label clothing brands and has been quietly shilling apparel and accessories under those trademarked names with nary a press release to let anyone know. WWD cites KeyBanc Capital analyst Ed Yruma, who said the company has introduced at least seven private label fashion brands recently: Franklin & Freeman, Franklin Tailored, James & Erin, Lark & Ro, North Eleven, Scout + Ro and Society New York. Thereâ€™s a range of items for sale from the brands: menâ€™s dress shoes, suits, and other clothing; womenâ€™s clothing and accessories; and childrenâ€™s apparel. The brand with the most items for sale focuses on womenâ€™s dress and handbags, called Society New York. The prices seem to fall in the middle of the road, with dresses for $66.60 on Lark & Ro and tops for $31.41. A Franklin Tailored man’s suit costs $247.97, with ties for around $25. Because apparel is such a large, fragmented category, this could be a good move for Amazon, Yruma said in a research note, adding that apparel is one of Amazon’s fastest-growing categories. At the same time, there’s work it has to do for the business to really hit it out of the park. “We expect the challenges the company has faced in courting the fashion community to remain, but we think Amazon will continue to evolve its strategy,” Yruma writes. “We believe greater brand cooperation with third-party seller restrictions and an owned brand approach (development of niche brands and private label) will be necessary to penetrate the apparel market in a more meaningful way.â€?
