Amazon: Compelling Risk/Reward - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The only thing debatable about Amazon today is its valuation in light of its 98% year-to-date performance and 111x FY16 P/E. We have performed a bull/bear valuation analysis. With 23% upside in a bull case and 4% downside in a bear case, we view the risk/reward on Amazon as compelling. The strength and profitability of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) business model has long been debated. But following three consecutive earnings beats and strong metrics in both North American ops and AWS, we believe the only thing debatable today is the stock's valuation in light of its 98% year-to-date performance and 111x FY16 P/E. Consequently, we have decided to review our DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation. As mentioned in previous articles, valuing companies which deliver high revenue growth but limited short-term earnings is always a difficult task but we believe that a DCF valuation is pretty well suited to this kind of mission as it captures the long-term potential (revenues and margins) of any company. In our DCF, we have made the following assumptions: - Revenue growth stays above 20% until 2017, which is consistent with Amazon's current revenue momentum (+30% at constant FX in Q3), and then gradually moderates. - Over 2015-2025, revenues grow at a 14% CAGR, with Amazon generating $418bn sales (vs. $108bn expected in 2015). For comparison purposes, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) is expected to deliver $488bn revenue in 2015. - AWS grows faster than core retail ops and accounts for 13% of total revenue by 2025 (vs. 7% in 2015). - AWS' non-GAAP operating margin reaches 30%, slightly above current levels thanks to the scalability of the business model. - Retail ops' non-GAAP operating margin gradually moves toward 6% in 2025, in-line with Wal-Mart's margins over the last few years. We believe this is a reasonable assumption considering that Amazon's North American business is already on track to deliver a 4-5% margin next year. - Overall, Amazon's non-GAAP operating margin reaches 9.1%, compared to a 4.5% margin expectation for FY15. - Amazon's FY25 GAAP margin is slightly lower (7.9%) as we include in our model stock-based compensation. Even if stock-based compensation is a non-cash item, we view it as a real cost that reflects the impact of continued share dilution on the P&L. - Growth rate in perpetuity is 2.5%, consistent with world GDP growth across different economic cycles. - We use a discount rate of 8.1% (with a beta of 1.0). We have also performed a bull/bear analysis to better assess the risk/reward. In our bull case, we assume that Amazon will post a higher retail margin than Wal-Mart (7%) thanks to the scalability of the Internet model and the contribution of new high-margin services (such as payment features). That would push the stock price toward $760. In our bear case, we assume that Amazon's retail margin only reaches 5% (well below Wal-Mart's) as profitability of international operations remains disappointing and well below domestic operations due to the lack of critical size in several international markets. We also retain a more conservative margin assumption for AWS (25%, in-line with the current margin), considering that increased competition and price pressures in the cloud infrastructure market could weigh on Amazon. In conclusion, with 23% upside in a bull case and 4% downside in a bear case, we view the risk/reward on Amazon as compelling. That said, Amazon's new ventures will have to be monitored carefully. Even if the company has been investor-friendly in the last few quarters through the disclosure of AWS metrics and reduced spending (enabling retail margins to pop), Amazon has a long history of spending heavily on new projects for an extended period of time. That could delay or even derail the margin improvement story. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
