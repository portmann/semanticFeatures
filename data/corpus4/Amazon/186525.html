Click to print (Opens in new window) Amazon’s latest attempt to quickly and cheaply deliver packages got underway in Seattle on Tuesday with the launch of the company’s consumer-turned-courier program, Amazon Flex.Â  The program, which was first speculated aboutÂ in June , allows any regular olâ€™ Joe to earn $18-$25 per hour by delivering Amazon Prime Now packages out of their own cars while out-and-about. According to the Amazon Flex site, delivery drivers must own their own cars, have valid drivers’ licenses, be over the age of 21, pass a background check, and own an Android smartphone. Once drivers are approved, they will be given access to Amazon’s proprietary delivery app, which can be used to choose delivery shiftsÂ any day of the week. The shifts can be as short as two hours or as long as 12 hours, but must be in two-hour increments. A driver’s delivery roster and area of coverage is then determined by the length of their shift.Â Deliveries can be picked up at an Amazon location nearest to the driver. Back in August, “Flex” signs were spotted at the company’s recently opened Kirkland, WA, facility. Signs inside the new location describe the Flex method as much like waiting in line at the deli counter: consumers take a numbered ticket, watch for their number to be displayed on the wall and pick up their packages once their number is shown. While it was unclear at the time whether the service was for customers to pick up their own packages, it appears the lines are for the new delivery drivers.
