Amazon Prime Day 7/15 : One-Day Sale for Prime Members â€” My Money Blog July 15, 2015 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment Updated, sales are live, one-day only! Amazon is holding something called “ Amazon Prime Day ” for their Prime members on July 15, 2015.   Non-Prime members can sign up for a free 30-day trial to be eligible to participate.   Here are the deals that caught my eye: Buy $45 in Amazon gift cards, get $10 in promotional credit. Use promo code PRIMEGCS.  Scroll down to find the $45 gift cards.  Promotion credit works for any items sold and shipped by Amazon.com, and is valid through and expires on August 29, 2015.   That’s like free money to me. Kindle Fire HD 7? WiFi for $79 ($60 off) Kindle Fire HD 7? WiFi Kids Edition for $129 ($60 off) – Comes with 2-year full replacement guarantee, no questions asked. 35% Off One Qualifying Food or Beverage Item – Use promo code GROCERY35.  Buy once, or stack with Subscribe and Save (you can always cancel later). 60% off Amazon Elements Baby Wipes – Use promo code ELEMENTS60.  That’s six packs of wipes for less than $5, or nine packs of wipes for less than $7 after savings.  Buy once, or stack with Subscribe and Save (you can always cancel later). Also check out Walmart.com , as they announced that they will also compete with Amazon today with a bunch of deals.  They also have Wal-Mart Dare to Compare Deals , where supposedly everything on the page is cheaper than Amazon (shipping may vary).
