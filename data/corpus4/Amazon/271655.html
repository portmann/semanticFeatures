Not Too Late To Board The Netflix Bull Train - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Bandwidth concern is being addressed. If you followed the recommendation of my article from early September titled " Buy the Netflix Dip ," then cheers to you. The stock has generated substantial alpha since then, bumping the article up in status to be a premium article. In that article I addressed the fact that competition from other content streaming providers was being given too much credit, and predicted that Netflix's expansion into different countries will be better than expected. The stronger than forecasted numbers from Australia and New Zealand (where Netflix launched on March 24th, 2015) proved this analysis to be correct, and was a great positive catalyst for the stock last month. There are still many bears that believe Netflix will not be as successful in other markets, so every time they get proved wrong, the stock will climb. Netflix just entered the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish markets in October, and will launch in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in early 2016. News about subscriber growth in these areas will continue to serve as a great short term catalysts. The ultimate question and concern that came up in my previous article was the valuation of Netflix. How can you value this growth stock that has a current P/E ratio of 312.64 at $118.02/share? Is it really a company that should have a $50 billion market cap? How long will it take them to grow into that valuation? I will look at this closer after evaluating another concern that deserves more attention: Netflix's bandwidth problem. Many are fearful that the amount of internet traffic Netflix is creating is too high, and that the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) will look to increase the price of Netflix's Internet usage due to its high bandwidth requirements for streaming. According to Sandvine, a broadband networking company that releases data on Internet usage, Netflix now accounts for 36.48% of downstream traffic on fixed networks, up from 34.9% in the second half of 2014 . In addition, the study?found that HBO is also experiencing growth, mostly due to the launch of its new streaming service HBO NOW and its?"Game of Thrones" program, which has been such a huge hit, it is worthy of mention and certainly responsible for much of this growth. (Side note: the increased success of these two companies proves a point that I displayed in my previous article: the market size and the number of subscribing streamers is increasing, so it is ok if more competition enters this market because it has not taken away market share from Netflix. The likely explanation for this is that people are more likely to subscribe to other services in addition to Netflix, rather than cancel their Netflix subscription and then subscribe to something else like Amazon Prime). Additionally, this percentage will increase even more as 4K continues to become more popular, and LTE and fiber Internet continue to improve. Netflix does not own any of the internet bandwidth. They have deals for the short-term with the ISPs, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where Netflix can continue to ride on this platform with increasing bandwidth usage without having their costs increase. Netflix acknowledges this risk, and has already taken steps to innovate its way out of this problem. According to Variety, Netflix is re-encoding all of it's content with more granulated bitrates. In order to understand what this means, you just need to know that all shows are different in the bitrate they require. A cartoon with a limited amount of colors and camera movements doesn't demand the same bitrate as an action movie like World War Z. They are hoping that this will produce about 20% in bandwidth savings. In addition to the decreased cost of bandwidth, ISP networks won't get as much traffic, thus customers like you and I will use less data, allowing us to save on data costs/usage. These algorithms that were created will scan every episode and movie in the Netflix library to determine how complex it is and what type of bitrate it requires. This encoding technology is especially great news for those overseas that have slower bandwidth speeds. Take a look at the chart below which examines internet speeds in Mbps (Megabits per second) produced by? Tech 2 First Post Report , citing the Akamai 1Q15 State of Internet Report: This new encoding technology that allows for Netflix to deliver high-quality videos with lower bandwidth usage will help launch a successful expansion into places like India in the future, and southeast Asia in early 2016. Netflix is a growth stock and is not valued based on profitability and ability to generate free cash flow in the short term. However it seems to be valued based on it's potential future earnings and it's subscription growth, which will continue to remain at a healthy growth rate for a long time. Netflix is profitable in the US and expects to be close to breaking even in international markets in 2016. This will be a big positive catalyst that can be expected sometime in the last half of 2016. Most important and what will drive Netflix's growth in subscribers is it's incredibly positive reputation with consumers. This affects their ability to retain as well as attract new customers. This positive reputation is mostly due to Netflix's original content, which has an incredible amount of die-hard fans. Netflix set a record this year as the first online streaming service provider to garner the most Golden Globe nominations, at eight. This is also the first time since the year 2000 that HBO isn't leading the nominations in the television categories. Our world is only going to become increasingly personalized and "internetized," especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where most of Netflix's long term growth is going to come from. All FANG stocks are going to benefit from this long term trend, especially Netflix since it is still barely penetrating most international markets. Of it's about 70 million subscribers, about 44 million are in the United States. Netflix's seemingly lofty valuation of $50 billion in market cap doesn't seem so lofty when you consider all of the potential it has due to having so many loyal customers. I believe the majority of subscribers would tolerate Netflix increasing prices $2-$3/month domestically for it's streaming subscription, providing a huge boost to their bottom line. Netflix raised the price of this service $1/month back in October to $9.99, and the market reacted very positively, shares of Netflix closed up 6.3% on the day of the announcement. There are many other long term growth options to consider when trying to value Netflix, which is why it's such a hard stock to value and why there has been a lot of short term volatility with it's share price. Think about what would happen to the stock price if they began streaming live sports? Or if they began placing ads on the side of their library to start bringing in ad revenue, like websites such as a Facebook have? Netflix is still far from being a mature company, and the market for subscribers will continue to increase at a very healthy rate. Here is a simple chart looking at domestic and international subscribers (in millions). Here I am assuming a slower domestic growth rate in 2016 which will sustain in 2017 and 2018, then the market will become saturated domestically and subscriber growth will drop to 3 million per year in 2019 and 2020. For forecasting international growth I modestly put in a 9 million per year subscriber growth rate for the next five years, which would still nearly double the amount of subscribers that Netflix has now. With 70 million subscribers and about $7 billion in revenue this year, that means that Netflix is trading at 7 times it's revenue. Assuming in the year 2020 that Netflix is charging $9 per subscribing member of it's streaming service (which is conservative in my opinion) and have no other sources of revenue, they will bring in about $14.3 billion in revenue. Which means that if their market cap was still $50 billion, they would only be trading at 3.5 times their revenue, which is more than reasonable given the growth opportunities. It is also helpful to imagine what type of premium a buyer would have to pay for Netflix when trying to determine a proper valuation, since that ultimately is what a company is worth, what someone is willing to pay for it. For a mediocre comparison; Snapchat was valued at $16 billion in it's last funding series in May 2015, and what do you think there revenue is going to be in 2015? Enough said. In summary, there are a plethora of growth options and positive upsides in the future that make it hard to value this growth stock. However, you have to be short-sighted to not see Netflix justify an even higher market cap in the upcoming years.
