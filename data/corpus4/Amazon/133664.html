Expedia: Orbitz Acquisition Could Add $12 Per Share - Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) | Seeking Alpha Expedia, Inc. is nearing an acquisition of fellow online travel booking site Orbitz. The online travel industry is in a period of high growth and is projected to continue. On May 27th , Orbitz (NYSE: OWW ) shareholders approved a $1.3 billion takeover by Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ). The proposed merger between the two companies would combine two of the largest players in the online travel industry. The online travel industry is in a period of high growth . In 2013, online travel sales were estimated to be growing 12% annually. Many expect double-digit growth to continue, as online travel sales are estimated to only make up 13% of the global travel industry. It is estimated that Expedia and main competitor Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ) have about 30% of the global online travel agency each, with Orbitz behind at 8%. After these companies, the online travel booking market is highly fragmented and competitive. The online travel market is essentially turning into a battle of acquisitions between Expedia and Priceline. Over the past three years alone, Expedia has acquired majority stakes or full control of Trivago, Auto Escape, Wotif, and Travelocity. Including the impending acquisition of Orbitz, Expedia has chosen to expand their business by building an ecosystem of valuable brands through acquisitions. Priceline has also aggressively pursued acquisitions, including Kayak.com, OpenTable, and Booking.com. There is a key strategic difference between the two companies. Expedia's acquisitions are related mostly to booking services, while Priceline's acquisitions target more peripheral travel services, such as meta-search (Kayak) and restaurant reservation booking (OpenTable). Essentially, Expedia is trying to capture the booking market while Priceline is trying to grow in the peripheries of the travel industry. In the near term, both strategies are valid as the online travel agent industry continues to mature. While Expedia is currently competing with Priceline, other major players are looking to enter into the online travel industry. Earlier this year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) launched Amazon Destinations . However, we expect it to take time for Amazon to establish significant market share. That being said, Amazon does have some competitive advantages over Expedia. Most notably is the size of the Amazon ecosystem, which consists of 285 million active users. Assuming Amazon is able to build a functional product, Amazon Destinations could pull active Amazon users who use Expedia back to their own ecosystem for travel related purchases. Another advantage for Amazon is its commission structure. Reportedly, Amazon is charging 15% commission to hotels, compared to the industry standard of 20-25%. This provides a financial incentive for hotels to partner with Amazon as opposed to Expedia or Priceline. Despite the incredibly competitive market, we see upside in Expedia. We believe the merger with Orbitz will add strategic value to the company, and we value a post-acquisition Expedia stock at $119 per share. Our model for EXPE, assuming the acquisition is approved in the back half of this year and effects are realized in FY16, can be seen below. Using our forecasted EPS, a 1% perpetuity rate, and a CAPM discount rate, we arrive at a fair value for EXPE of $119 per share. We thus believe that approval of the Orbtiz acquisition adds roughly $12 per share of value to EXPE.
