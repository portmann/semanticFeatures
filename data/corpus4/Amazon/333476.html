Hedging Donald Trump's Threat Against Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha On Friday, Donald Trump said of Amazon, "If I become president, oh do they have problems. They're going to have such problems." Six months ago, Amazon's shareholders might have ignored such a statement by Trump, as many political pundits expected his candidacy to implode before any votes were counted. Now, however, the votes have been counted in four states, and Trump has won the last three by wide margins. And he just picked up two governors' endorsements. For Amazon longs looking to add some downside protection in light of this, we show a couple of ways to hedge the stock over the next several months. In a recent post ( Time To Consider Trump Insurance ?), we speculated on some companies that might be affected positively or negatively by the rise of Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. One company we didn't mention was Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), but Trump mentioned it on Friday, and not in a positive way, as this tweet from CNBC shows (screen captured below). That quote was preceded by Trump claiming that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had purchased the Washington Post to buy influence to help Amazon. It would be one thing if Trump's prospects of becoming President were slim, but, as the text at the bottom of that tweet shows, he got a major endorsement Friday by his former opponent Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey. And Trump was also endorsed by the governor of Maine the same day. Amazon didn't move much on this news, but if you're long the stock and concerned it might take a hit as Trump gets closer to winning the GOP nomination, we'll show a couple of ways of hedging it below. If you'd like a refresher on options terms first, you may want to click over to our previous article on hedging Realty Income (NYSE: O ), and read the section titled, "Refresher on Hedging Terms." Of course, these hedges aren't just Trump insurance - they'll limit your downside risk regardless of what causes the stock to drop. We'll use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge AMZN below, but you don't need the app to do this. You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to take the time and do the work. Whether you do it yourself using the process we outlined or use the app, an additional piece of information you'll need to supply (along with the number of shares you're looking to hedge) when scanning for an optimal put is your "threshold", which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 15%. If you are more risk-averse, you could use a smaller threshold. And if you are less risk-averse, you could use a larger one. All else equal, though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge. Here are the optimal puts as of Friday's close to hedge 400 shares of AMZN against a greater-than-15% drop by mid-July. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $11,000, or 4.95% of position value. A couple of points about this cost: To be conservative, the cost was based on the ask price of the put. In practice, you can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and ask). The 15% threshold includes this cost, i.e., in the worst-case scenario, your AMZN position would be down 10.05%, not including the hedging cost. When scanning for an optimal collar, you'll need one more figure in addition to your threshold, your "cap", which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge. For example, if you're hedging over a seven-month period, and you think a security won't appreciate more than 5% over that time frame, then it might make sense to use 5% as a cap; you don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that. We checked Portfolio Armor's website to get an estimate of Amazon's potential return over the next several months. Every trading day, the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the U.S., and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return. Potential return, in the site's terminology, is a high-end estimate of how a security will perform over the next several months, and the site calculated a potential return of 10% for Amazon, so we'll use that as its cap. As of Friday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 400 shares of AMZN against a greater-than-15% drop by mid-July, while not capping an investor's upside at less than 10%. As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $7,640, or 3.44%, as a percentage of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly more, $10,380, or 4.67% of position value. So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative, meaning an investor would have collected $2,740 more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts, an amount equal to 1.23% of his position value. Two notes on this collar hedge: To be conservative, the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls; in practice, an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask). So, in reality, an investor would likely have collected more than $2,740 when opening this collar. Although the threshold on this collar is 15%, and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs, they don't take into account negative hedging costs. So, the worst-case scenario in this case, when taking into account the negative hedging cost, would be a decline of less than 15%: assuming, conservatively, a negative cost of 1.23%, the maximum drawdown here would be 15% - 1.23% = 13.77%. Similarly, the best case scenario wouldn't be 10%, the level at which this collar is capped, but 10% + 1.23% = 11.23%.
