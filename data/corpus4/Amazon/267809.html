Amazon: Expensing R&D Hides The Economic Earnings - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon increases R&D to zero out GAAP profit. R&D should be capitalized to see Amazon's economic earnings. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) always incites much discussion about its profitability and future growth. This led to the creation of the moniker the "FAN" companies, which many say are significantly overvalued due to low current earnings and many others believe are the future. This future growth would eventually lead to a massively profitable business and a share price far above the current share price. Bezos, to the delight of some and ire of others, pledges to keep GAAP earnings near-zero through ever-increasing "investment" into the business. Therefore, to value Amazon, we shouldn't look to GAAP earnings which would show a distorted picture of the underlying business. Some analysts instead look to operating cash flow as the true indicator of profitability for Amazon, however this ignores many real costs of doing business such as share issuance, capital expenditures and amortization/depreciation. Instead, I decided to look to the source of the GAAP issues in valuing Amazon: R&D. R&D seems to be Bezos' method to vex the US taxman and spin the tale of zero GAAP profits while growing an ever-increasing empire. R&D as a percentage of revenue has varied from 7.3% to 13.0% for the last two years in no appreciable pattern, other than serving to keep net income between -1% and 1% of revenue. Data for the following table and all the others are pulled from Edgar. Outside of one mistake when Amazon spent too much in Q3 2014, Bezos successfully budgeted R&D to essentially zero out net income. To GAAP, this R&D is an expense like shipping that hits the quarter it's performed. However, to the rest of us, R&D is an investment in the company's future. To treat it as an expense distorts the underlying nature of the cash being spent. To get a truer picture of Amazon's earnings, I went back five years and began capitalizing a portion of the R&D expense. Carrying this through to last quarter gives you an amortizing R&D asset and a significantly lower R&D expense in any given period. This is the model which corresponds to amortizing the R&D asset over four years. For example, in Q4 2014, Amazon spent $2.636 billion on R&D. However in my model, only 1/16th of that gets expensed in the same quarter. Due to the amortization of the prior quarter's R&D, 1/16th of Q3 2014 also gets expensed, as does 1/16th of Q2 2014, and so on. As you can see, when you deal with R&D in a more nuanced way than simply immediately expensing, the profitability of Amazon emerges. The question then becomes, how long is the useful life of Amazon's R&D? The tech industry moves extremely quickly. If you aren't spending money to move forward, you are falling behind. To see the effect of choosing a length of time to amortize the R&D asset, a table of the net income of the last four quarters at three-, four- and five-year R&D capitalization length follows: As you can see, Amazon's profitability depends on how long you think their R&D is useful. As a final note, this investment in R&D is neither bad nor good in a vacuum. It depends on how much you trust the company and management. The R&D led to Amazon's huge lead in AWS, but also burned billions on the Fire phone. I worry that Bezos cares too much about hitting that -1% to 1% net income range and less about the potential returns on the R&D projects. As Amazon continues to expand, management may be tempted to spend money on projects that should have been avoided to return money to shareholders. That said, due to the misunderstanding of zero GAAP net income, there's value here. Many investors screening for stocks with any kind of earnings-based metric may skip over a company that could, in actuality, suit their needs.
