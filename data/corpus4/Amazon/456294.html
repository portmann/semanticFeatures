As such, a whole bunch of retailers are pulling out specials designed to lure shoppers today, while carefully avoiding any mention of “Prime Day” Many of these retailers are pointing out that their sales are for “absolutely everyone,” a not-so-subtle dig at the fact that Prime Day is only available to Prime members who pay $99 a year for the service (and then still have trouble getting any actual Prime Day deals on Prime Day ). Walmart : As we reported yesterday , Walmart is offering free shipping with no minimum purchase required, throughout this week. The retailer has also announced a bunch of “rollback” deals valid throughout this week (and longer in some cases), including video game consoles and bundles, HDTVs, and deals on smartphones. Best Buy : The retailer has a bunch of online deals available through today including some big ticket items like TVs, drones, headphones, and more, The Verge notes. Newegg : Newegg is hosting its big â€œFantasTechâ€? sale that started with some deals on Monday, and will continue throughout today. This is the second year the company has timed its sale to coincide with Prime Day. JCPenney : â€œPenny Paloozaâ€? is in effect today with an extra 25% off the lowest prices listed for your entire purchase, or youâ€™ll get 30% off if you use your JCPenney credit card. Youâ€™ll need to use the code NEWLOOK6 to get the extra discount at checkout. eBay : The online auction site is offering “up to 70% off,” reminding folks that anyone can shop there with the words, â€œExclusively For Everyone â€” Always Free Shipping. No membership required,â€? splashed right up front on the homepage today. Kohlâ€™s : The department store chain has different â€œBeat the Heatâ€? buys every day through July 14, with 50% off, 60% off, and some larger discounts on clothes, home furnishings, and other items. For example: on Tuesday, July 12, the code QUICKQUICK will get shoppers an extra 20% off. Sears : Sears is offering up to 60% off clothing and accessories and 25% off all bikes, among other things. Toys “R” Us : All day on July 12, shoppers on Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” us sites will get 15% off regular-priced items, with more than 50,000 toys and baby products on sale as well. Again, “Everybody saves today!” the toy company promises.
