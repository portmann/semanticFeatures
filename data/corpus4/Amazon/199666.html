ETF Hub Oct 13 2015, 09:48 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Worried about competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and arguing the Dell/EMC deal does little to alleviate concerns, JMP's Patrick Walravens has downgraded VMware (NYSE: VMW ) to Market Perform, The downgrade comes a day after VMware pre-announced above-consensus Q3 sales and EPS and lighter-than-expected billings, and a week after Amazon rolled out several new offerings meant to make it easier for enterprises to migrate on-premise workloads to AWS, which was on a $7.3B/year run rate at the end of Q2. Amazon also announced GE plans to gradually move 60% of its workloads to AWS. AWS Snowball was a game changer and will continue to carve away at VMWare's viability. Add this to technologies like Openstack, KVM, Cloudforms, etc and it is easy to see VMWare is losing value add on almost a weekly basis.
