Oversized Box From Sears Has Enough Room To Stash Preteen Daughter â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Amazon was once notorious for shipping items in comically oversized boxes, an e-commerce phenomenon that we blame on mysterious employees called the Stupid Shipping Gang . We don’t hear about over-packaging from Amazon that much anymore, perhaps because the Stupid Shipping Gang has all moved on to jobs packaging e-commerce orders at Sears. “The box was big enough that my daughter got in with them and they still had room for all the packing material,” Corey writes. His daughter is 12 years old, if you were wondering. A former shipping manager contacted us a few years ago to explain how this happens . “Having as few different sized boxes as possible is the name of the game,” the former gangster explained: using fewer box sizes means storing fewer box sizes and saving money by ordering larger quantities of the boxes you use most often. Also, while it might seem counter-intuitive to regular people, in a commercial shipping operation, it might be cheaper to ship a larger box than a small one. How does that work? “While you can fit more smaller boxes than larger boxes into a finite space,” our source explained, “sometimes a lot of those smaller boxes end up creating blank space through their odd dimensions, which makes it harder to fit in larger boxes.” Amazon’s Stupid Shipping Gang Ensures That Your Tea Arrives Safely Our Growing E-Commerce Addiction Means Mountains Of Cardboard Stupid Shipping Gang Sends Three Tiny SIMs In Three Separate Giant Boxes Previous Court Says NYC’s Salt Warning Labels Can Go Into Effect As Planned Amazonâ€™s stupid shipping gang appears to have gone the other direction, shipping items in flimsy, inadequate packaging likely to result in products arriving damaged. I donâ€™t order books or blu-rays from Amazon any more unless they are the only viable source â€” too many books have arrived with bent, creased or mangled covers or pages, blu-ray cases with dents or other issues. Amazon now stuffs books and blu-rays into flimsy envelopes instead of boxes. And I never order anything heavier than 50 pounds, since odds are it wonâ€™t be packed securely enough to avoid mishandling by FedEx, UPS or some other shipper. Latest example: a $500, 145-pound Nordic Track exercise bike that arrived with major pieces broken. Previous example: a broken bathroom vanity, or rather, two of them â€” Amazon shipped a replacement that also arrived broken, but in a different way. I long for the days when small items purchased from Amazon arrived in big boxes, since at least they were less likely to arrive in pieces.
