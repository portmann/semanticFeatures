Why Netflix Investors Need To Keep An Eye On CinemaCon - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha This week marks the annual gathering of theater owners in Las Vegas for CinemaCon where The Screening Room proposal that has split Hollywood will be a hot topic. Studios and theaters each see pros and cons to the situation, but both come in somewhat wary of the service because of the Netflix effect. The streaming giant has carved a nice niche for itself in the Hollywood realm at the expense of the traditional model and that has caused a ripple effect. A rift is beginning to grow between the studios and theaters and it all stems from the rise of new media. The film industry has its own Civil War brewing beyond the new Captain America film and it's about to be featured center stage. This week, thousands of theater owners from across the country will head to Las Vegas, and Hollywood is ready and waiting. The event is CinemaCon, the yearly confab where the film industry speaks directly to the exhibitors that screen its wares. Now don't for a second think Tinseltown isn't aware how valuable those opinions are in the grand scheme... and why those bonds need to hold strong even in a changing landscape. The growing fear in Hollywood is that with the rise of streaming media, the role of the theaters is shrinking. Yes, that's true, but personally I don't see Cineplexes going the way of the dodo anytime soon. I do see a situation though where Hollywood is going to need that alliance even with the possibility of continued diminishing returns from the theaters. While the prospect of The Screening Room looms large, the bigger problem facing theaters is actually Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Yes, The Screening Room could pose a threat right now. For those of you not entirely familiar with The Screening Room concept, it's a proposed new service where customers at home buy a $150 box that allows them to rent new release movies day-and-date for $50 for a 48-hour viewing window. Hollywood is torn on it. Half the big A-listers love the idea citing it opens the door to more customers and the other half hate it because they believe it takes away from the "cinema" experience. Remember The Screening Room has only gotten to this point because its pricing model allows studios and theaters to get a piece of the profits, but that does little to assuage exhibitors' fears their brick-and-mortar venues could become obsolete. Screening Room executives have tried to calm fears by giving customers two tickets to their local theater to go see the same they streamed (and thus pay for concessions) but may have taken issues with the overall business model. Whether it's targeting the wrong group or over-estimating how many people will spend a sunk cost of $150 on start-up equipment, there are some hurdles. Paul Higginson, EVP of 20th Century EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), recently told Deadline.com: "I think the whole discussion around the dark widow of flexibility or The Screening Room concept or putting cinema online…it's extremely sensitive for exhibition. I mean, you look at it, and you think, there's only risk for us. You have to be honest, it's the fear of the unknown." As Higginson said, it is that fear of the unknown and that is a big theme in the industry at present. The problem of doing nothing is only going to buy theaters and studios more time. It won't solve the issue , so as much cause a small delay. Compare that back to Netflix which has the luxury of not having to deal with the studios or even be concerned with their fears. The company knew going in, the barrier to entry was high, and it came up with its own solution… curate its own content. Of course, Netflix doesn't need the theaters either as it has the infrastructure in place to stream its projects. Now, keep in mind, it's not that Netflix doesn't want its content in theaters, it is just that big theaters don't want anything to do with it and the fight isn't a priority. The only thing Netflix really needs is one or two independent theaters to do an awards qualifying screening, which it will easily obtain. It's because it isn't dependent on the theaters that it is more of a threat. In fact, where Netflix is most dangerous is that while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime and Screening Room are actively trying to work with the theaters, Netflix is coming in with a "our way or the highway" approach. The streaming leader isn't backing down from its "day-and-date" approach, which means the theaters get no exclusivity period and films stream online at the same time. This goes against the "windowing" agreement that has keep theaters in the driver's seat all these years. Netflix's approach, which for the lack of a better word has been forceful and unyielding, has really scared the industry. It's created this domino effect that has led to the studios and theaters becoming even more intertwined. The exhibitors are worried about their livelihoods, and it is understandable, but it shouldn't prevent them from at least entertaining the idea of embracing technology beyond what's in the theaters. The Screening Room is the closest we are getting to that conversation started, and while its creators are attending the Con, they enter with a target on their backs. Here's where that bond I mentioned earlier is vital. While the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) has said it will leave it to its individual members, it will not as a group advocate for the service. Yet, cracks are beginning to form in this tight alliance, which is another reason why events like CinemaCon and all of its "A-list" guest appearances and tentpole screenings are important. The more defections, the more the traditional model is impacted. Right now, the theaters are very loyal to the traditional Hollywood studios and have chosen to stay with them over the streamers. Yet, AMC Theaters (NYSE: AMC ) for example is close to teaming with The Screening Room and that's going to cause a rift. Of course, this works in reverse. You may remember last year Paramount (owned by Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB )) made news when it said it would give a shorter window to theaters for two of its October films in order to give the films a earlier SVOD launch (where it's found them to be more profitable). The move created a similar rift and even with Paramount offering theaters a cut of the SVOD profits most of the larger chains still boycotted the movies. Again, it is that fear of the unknown and the Paramount situation was one where some of the theaters even had a safety net and still wouldn't take the chance. Shareholders are going to have decide soon which side they want to support, because right now each side is beginning to show signs of a break. Do investors show allegiance to the studios that make the content, the theaters that show it or neither and opt for a Netflix-like company which preaches a new path? While that was never a real debate before it's becoming a larger one with every day. In the end, it's going to come down to where investors believe consumers will spend their money. While personally I could get over the $50 price point of Screening Room, it's the $150 set top box that I couldn't justify (and I'm willing to bet I'm not alone). A year of Netflix (even with the $2 monthly increase) is still $30 less and that's without the add-ons. Customers recognize that appeal and it's a proven model. Conversely, the theaters are finding new ways to win back crowds as they've added in reserve seating, reclining options and just overall plusher theaters. The chains are trying to wage a bigger battle, but is it too little, too late? At the center of this is Netflix, which has shown there are other models that work. And to be clear, while Netflix may have pushed its agenda rather forcefully, it also has had to scratch and claw its way into a power position, and now that it's there, it has earned the right to play the game however it wants. While the bulk of this year's CinemaCon will be spent on the immediate future, the real conversation should be about further down the road. With Silicon Valley's many think-tanks and innovations, there has to be a solution in which both sides can profit... if only the sides would be more open to listen.
