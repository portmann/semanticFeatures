Amazon & DHL Testing Delivery To Customers’ Car Trunks â€“ Consumerist Amazon will begin testing a new delivery method that allows couriers to place packages to the trunk of customers’ cars. It’s not uncommon for consumers to shuttle around packages and shopping bags in the trunks of their cars. While most people but those items there themselves, Amazon wants to take that task off the hands of a very exclusive group of Prime members. The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon will begin testing a new delivery method next month that allows consumers to receive packages to the trunk of their car, whether they’reÂ present or not. In order to participate in the experimentÂ consumers must meet fairly strict requirements: live in Munich, Germany, be a Prime member and own an internet-connected Audi vehicle. Delivery â€“ which is a partnership between the online retailer, Audi and shipping company DHL â€“ occurs when a Prime member agrees to give couriers temporary electronic access to the trunk of their vehicles. While completing their Amazon transaction, consumers choosing the new delivery option must provide an approximate location of their vehicle and a window of time in which the package can be delivered. Amazon says that while the testing is only taking place in Munich, it hopes to roll out the new service internationally in the future.
