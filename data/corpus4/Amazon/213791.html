Make $5 in Less Than a Minute - Eyes on the Dollar Posted by: Kim Parr in Making Money October 23, 2015 1 Comment I did a review of the cashback website, Giving Assistant , a couple of weeks ago. One thing I like about the site is the choice of cash back on web purchases or the ability to donate rewards to a charity of your choice. Now Giving Assistant is offering everyone the chance to make $5 by signing up through this link . It take less than a minute and you don’t have to buy anything.Â  Iâ€™ve been using the Giving Assistant portal before making all of my recent Amazon purchases. Lots of things are cheaper on Amazon Prime than at Wal Mart or other big box stores, plus I really hate to shop at those stores. Being able to have home delivery for everyday items is fantastic. Itâ€™s even better now that Giving Assistant offers 5% cash back on items ordered from Amazon. They also give cash back for purchases through tons of other websites, but Amazon is the one I use most. I kind of thought it was too good to be true, and my fears were confirmed from an email I got this week stating that the 5% cash back from Amazon would end on October 31st. That means Iâ€™ll be buying holiday gifts, dog food, and as many health and beauty products as Iâ€™ll need for the next few months before the end of this month. 10% Off With Giving Assistant and Chase Freedom or Discover It If you have a Chase Freedom or Discover It credit card, they are also offering 5% cash back on Amazon purchases until the end of the year. Using one of these cards combined with the pay back from Giving Assistant means 10% off. Giving Assistant pays out once a $5 threshold is met, either by Paypal, auto deposit into a checking account that has a US debit card, or by check. If you select the auto payment option, youâ€™ll get paid daily once your account has $5 or more. Paypal is once per month. Checks are quarterly. If you donâ€™t have cash to pay for purchases, then please donâ€™t buy a bunch of stuff on credit to get 5% back. If you do have extra money set aside for stockpiling non-perishables or need to buy holiday gifts from Amazon, consider doing it before October 31st. Even if you donâ€™t want to shop, go ahead and sign up for an account to get $5 in less than a minute. Thatâ€™s pretty good pay for your time!

You know it’s funny because I’ve yet to take advantage of any cash back portals because I shop so infrequently that I forget. I need some new face lotion though so I’ll have to see if a coupon is cheaper at my local store, or cash back.
