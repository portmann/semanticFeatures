Amazon Prime and Prime Day - Mighty Bargain Hunter I admit I was wondering whyÂ Amazon was hyping up Prime Day, which is today, July 12th 2016. We’ve had our Amazon Prime subscription for years (at least back to 2008!) Â We’ve come to love the all-you-can-eat two-day shipping that’s the cornerstone of the Prime membership. Â Amazon didn’t need to sell us on it anymore. Then I saw the notification in my emailÂ wishing me a Happy Prime Day. Well, right now there are nearly 10,000 Prime Day deals that are either active, or are going to be active today, across the breadth of categories of products that Amazon offers. It’s basically like Black Friday in July. Try Prime for free for thirty days, and if you like it just keep enjoying it for $99/year. Â If you don’t, cancel … but you still get to take part in all of the deals today. Unlimited streaming with Prime Video (tens of thousands of TV programs and movies) Ad-free music with Prime Music (1,000,000+ songs!) Unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos (safeguard your memories, access anywhere) Try Amazon Prime without any risk whatsoever for a month. Â We started our Prime membership when it was $79/year. Â It’s $99/year now but it’sÂ still well worth it. Â  Check it out!
