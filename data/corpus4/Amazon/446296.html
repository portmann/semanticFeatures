Amazon gets into private-label foods - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Jun 29 2016, 15:38 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Beginning this week, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) quietly began offering for sale whole-bean and ground coffee under its new Happy Belly label - putting it in competition with the likes of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The WSJ one month ago reported Amazon as planning four brands of private-label foods, diapers, and cleaning supplies to be sold exclusively to Amazon Prime members. For the moment, Amazon is not necessarily positioning these items as the low-cost offering. Bags of Happy Belly cost $9.99 each - about $2 more than Starbucks' breakfast blend, but $3 less than Starbucks' French roast. In-house brands like these potentially carry higher profit margins, partly thanks to savings on brand development and marketing. Amazon may also be able to design the packaging to reduce shipping costs. I wish this annoyance would give some clarity...Like start paying a dividend or something. I don't know whether to invest or not. Right now it just looks like a gelatinous ponzi scheme financed on expensive shares and hopium. And rockets. To be kind, the Washington Post is engaging, the service fairly easy to use. Prime video is sucking in regard to selection. Amazon won't be paying a dividend any time soon and the very happy shareholders like it that way.  If you are looking for dividends, go elsewhere. That said, look at a long-term chart of Amazon.  You would be happy with your investment from just about any time in the past.  Of course, who knows what the future holds. Amazon has been doing more and more of their own shipping.  They even leased 20 Boeing 767s earlier this year with an option to buy part of the leasing company.  Not saying that UPS isn't safe, but Amazon will squeeze costs anywhere it can, including from UPS and other shippers. Neat! I'm a big fan of private-label foodstuffs - my favorite grocery store was F&E (RIP :(), now my favorite grocery store is TJ's, both heavily invested in their own quality private-label foodstuffs. Also a big fan of Costco and their Kirkland brand stuff. So I'm looking forward to seeing what Amazon does with this. Sadly, I don't care at all about coffee, though, nor do I have babies (thank goodness), so hopefully they'll come out with something I'll actually want to buy soon.
