A Great Company Propped Up By Wall Street's Latest Hype - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha There is no doubt Amazon is a great company. For a very long time those who doubted its growth prospects have been proven wrong. However, the company's share price has benefitted greatly from the move from active to passive. On the long side I prefer to know why a stock is undervalued. I do not always succeed with coming up with a reason why it could be mispriced but I try. We all know the argument Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is overvalued. All the metrics everyone knows point to it: 75x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 39x, P/B of 23x etc. But that's not a very convincing case for overvaluation is it? If everyone knows all these metrics why is Amazon still at $750+. The buyers aren't stupid. They make a rational decision to buy based on their assessment of future cash flows as well. I'm sure everyone who buys Amazon stock directly understands the company extremely well. Many of you have foreseen the terrific future ahead of the company correctly and have been rewarded. Please note that to date all my articles on Amazon have been positive: the earliest one dating back to when Amazon was at $312. I love the company and the way it's being run. I just happened to stumble into a chilling observation while researching something else. The migration of actively managed funds towards passively managed funds (especially ETF's). 40% of U.S. fund assets are allocated towards passive ETFs but actually the situation is worse. ETF sponsors construct ETFs by backtesting performance on risk/reward and as a result there is a virtuous cycle going where assets get allocated to low volatile stocks that are trending up and assets are departing funds of active managers who seek out fundamental value. We are in the longest period of growth stock dominance since WW II. Imagine you are adding an ETF to your portfolio. Perhaps after selling out of some mutual funds or hedge funds where even your rockstar management like Bruce Berkowitz or David Einhorn isn't delivering the returns you expected. You know value as a strategy works but momentum works as well. The value managers you had your money with didn't do so great lately so maybe it is wise to diversify between two investment styles that are both proven to work. You add the: PowerShares S&P 500 Momentum Portfolio ETF A little bit of alternatives will go a long way to decrease the market risk, let alone single stock risk in your portfolio right? Well it turns out you have just been buying big blocks of Amazon stock. The above have allocated 7.4%, 5.48% and 4.41% of their assets to Amazon. I picked those three on purpose because I don't think anyone would have guessed Amazon would even be in there with the exception of the momentum portfolio. In total there are 83 ETF's that have Amazon as a top 10 holding. These are the top 25: Some of them make a lot of sense. Amazon should be in a retail or consumer ETF. Its presence with a ~10% allocation in a Consumer Services ETF is a little bit iffy but that's not a big deal. However, Amazon back tests so well on risk/reward, it's apparently irresistible to include it in a strategy to build an ETF. It is in both value, momentum and growth strategy ETF's, it's in alternative strategies, it is in covered-call ETF's, it is in innovation ETF's and in Core Equity ETF's, it's in the S&P 500 ex-technology ETF (NYSEARCA: SPXT ) and it's in the iShares North American Tech ETF , It's in the S&P 500 Fossil Free ETF ( SPYX ) and in the S&P 500 Catholic Value ETF (NASDAQ: CATH ). I think the answer is yes. I've written positively on Amazon four times on Seeking Alpha but today I'd rather short it than buy into this great company while it's value is pushed up tremendously by the flow into passive investments. For now I will patiently await better times to buy. A clear catalyst would be the reversal of flows active to passive.
