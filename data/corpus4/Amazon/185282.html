InvenSense Sweeps Apple Designs, But Amazon Win Is More Interesting - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha InvenSense has been batting 100% in Apple hardware lately. Yet another design win at Amazon (AMZN) is more interesting in its implications for the long term. As predicted , two tear downs have just identified the InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) MP67B in the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6S. InvenSense has been making a pretty clean sweep of Apple hardware lately. This article will run through those design wins and look at another, more interesting win at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and what it implies for the long term. Market dynamics and valuation are also updated. The iPhone 6S is a major, if expected, win for InvenSense. 12-13 million devices are expected to be sold in the first weekend alone, and 80-85 million by year end. Apple will be able to claim the best opening weekend ever by ignoring the fact that last year's iteration had a delayed launch in China. As a result, analysts have price targets up to $172, and some have even suggested that an increase in shored AAPL float will result in a squeeze. I see no evidence of that in the rebate rate of just 0.12%, and think that the shorted float figures are just the result of institutional range trading. Of course, my projection for AAPL is different. I've been half right already, and it will be very easy to tell if the more important part of my Apple predictions are correct in a matter of months. Early anecdotal sales impressions support my viewpoint. Furthermore, in my coverage of the release event , I noted that Apple's cool factor seems to be slowly fading. Another tear-down also confirmed InvenSense in the smart remote for Apple's TV product, which has been project to sell ~48 million units this year. As discussed here, Apple and many other providers, such as Roku are now emphasizing voice search for programs, which means the opportunity extends to microphones as well as gesture recognition. I think the market may be underestimating the potential of this product category as there are around 200 million televisions sold each year. InvenSense's smart remote reference platform should wind up putting the company enviable position of not caring which TV offerings succeed or fail. With this summer's iPod Touch , that makes 3 straight Apple design wins for InvenSense, since its surprising exclusion from the Apple Watch, which I attribute to a longer design cycle. Next up will be the new, larger iPads. Many think this version may revive sales, and the stylus accessory for that device represents a bonus opportunity. I'm not getting too excited about this particular prospect, though; now that AMOLED screens are becoming available for non-Samsung devices, I think they represent a much better option for the tablet form factor. However, the most interesting of InvenSense's design wins was actually probably done to work around Apple. The Dash Button from Amazon includes an InvenSense microphone. The buttons allow instant ordering of a specified item from any WiFi enabled location and, like so many other custom Amazon products , it seems to be a loss-leader to drive retail sales. It's good to see a microphone win, but what's interesting is that the Dash Button has no audio component in normal usage; so why include a microphone? Then I thought about how developers I know are constantly complaining about Apple's two-tier system, which is so restrictive with what third-party apps can actually do. It turns out that configuration of the button from Android uses WiFi, but from iOS config is done with (sort of) ultrasound. It seems the microphone is included as an alternate means of communicating with the device from the smart phone in order to work around Apple's limitation with WiFi access in the setup phase! This is an excellent example of how innovation in IoT will open up all sorts of unexpected opportunities for InvenSense. The options overhangs that I identified previously are finally passing, with the only significant remaining concentrations being out of the money calls, particularly towards year end. These have no ability to pressure the stock price further and can only help in the event of a rebound. With a forward/trailing hybrid PE of about ~15, the market is clearly ignoring assets on the balance sheet, and not yet recognizing that the current business is humming along just fine, even in a difficult market. That's right, even after three major acquisitions , InvenSense now has higher profit, and more assets than a year ago, when it was valued at nearly 3 times the price. Even ignoring that average analyst estimates are likely to be revised upward based on the now-confirmed business, this represents a current INVN fair value of $12.07, or a 34% gain. That said, there's more to look at than just the current business. The InvenSense developer conference is coming up in less than two months, and it will allow third-party developers to showcase their applications. As per the Amazon example above, seeing what some of these 27,000 programmers have to show may be even more interesting than the innovations coming from InvenSense employees. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that foldable mobile devices may be coming as soon as January, which is at least a year earlier than I had originally envisioned. That would be a huge boon for InvenSense, as is the transition of InvenSense from MEMs supplier to SoC designer with its Firefly product line set to enter new devices next quarter. It's no surprise that INVN trading has been dominated by short term trading for the past year. The market is currently worried about entering a multi-year down-trend but, while volatility is likely to continue, I think the need for yield will win out and an extended bear market will be avoided. In any case, I've long found sentiment to be antithetical to successful investing and there is safety in value. Now the conclusion of that article has played out, almost to the penny, and management is building for a time when the company will step beyond simply being a parts provider for the mobile market. Instead, the company will seek to start doing distributed processing of the raw data from its sensors and will provide services that flow naturally from that information. Successful implementation of this strategy will almost certainly require time and partners. Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) through the evolution of its Android ecosystem from pure software to fully integrated vertical service is specifically mentioned. Although there is always execution risk, the S-8 and cross-licensing agreements that were brought up in prior articles are hints that such arrangements are well underway. I continue to expect one or more significant transactions in the months to come. In the meantime, recent developments in the business fundamentals, in combination with market dynamics and valuation, make this finally look like a good time for investors to adopt a long-term outlook as well.
