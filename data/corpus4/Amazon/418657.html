Amazon Soars: Still A Buy - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha An increasing number of people are purchasing online, driving Amazon's profits, while sales of brick-and-mortar retailers have fallen. Amazon's strength has buoyed ETFs that have good exposure to the stock. The company beat all expectations for its first-quarter earnings. Exchange-traded funds that are focused on consumer discretionary spending are demonstrating the strength Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has in the market. While many ETFs are down this year, those funds that own Amazon are doing well. The company's strength reflects the change in consumer shopping habits, with an increasing number of consumers making online purchases. Amazon's value has increased by 29 percent annualized in the past five years. ETFs such as the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLY ) are benefiting from Amazon. SPDR is up by almost 2 percent, while the rest of the market has fallen by about an equal amount. At the same time, the biggest retail ETF, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: XRT ), is down by about 18 percent. It assigns equal weight to a variety of different retail stocks, including Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD ), Dillard's (NYSE: DDS ), Macy's (NYSE: M ) and others. Many of those traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are down by around 50 percent this year, pulling the ETF down with them. Since February 9, shares of Amazon have risen by 42 percent , and the stock appears poised to go even higher. Some analysts are still saying that the stock is undervalued, even as it is trading above $700. Amazon's first-quarter results , released in April, helped to buoy the stock. The company beat analysts' expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. Amazon Web Services has done especially well, increasing in value by 64 percent over the first quarter of 2015. As of the close of trading on May 27, 2016, AMZN was trading at $712.24. As previously noted, Amazon's brick-and-mortar competitors have fallen significantly this year, with some like Sears Holdings down by 50 percent. Amazon has a market cap of $332,261 million. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), a competitor with a similar approach that primarily operates in Asia, has a market cap of $200,366. Unlike Amazon, however, Alibaba has been rocked with issues regarding counterfeit goods being sold on its platform. On May 25, 2016, the company revealed it has been the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into how it reported data from its sales on Singles Day, an annual sales event created by the company. After the investigation was revealed, Alibaba stock had slumped by 3.9 percent by midday trading on May 25. Other retailers, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), have attempted to branch out more into online sales, but have not found as much success with the format as Amazon. Amazon has continued to demonstrate substantial strength over the past several years as more and more people are purchasing items online. It appears the stock will still go higher. We suggest investors continue to buy AMZN at this time. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
