Are We Approaching Peak Facebook? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook stock is priced based on assumptions of high growth and margins. Both are slowing, and Facebook is facing increased political pushback. For most analysts the choice among Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has been easy. Ever since the Facebook IPO, analysts who went for Facebook have been the big winners, the shares being up over 100% in that time, and opening for trade Monday at a little over $79. But since the start of 2015, it's a different story. All three companies have gone basically nowhere, with Facebook up just 1.5%, against a gain of .9% for Microsoft and 2.5% for Google. Facebook's big gains, especially in 2014, were driven by a growing realization that the company is dominating monetization of the mobile web. That success is now "baked into" the stock's price. The market cap on its $222 billion valuation is practically Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )-like, and not in a good way. While Facebook has enormous margins, having brought nearly $3 billion of its $12.5 billion in 2014 to the net income line, you're talking about paying nearly 20 times revenue for this company, the highest figure by far among the big cap tech stocks. Some investors have been asking lately, why should we when profitability is going down? Those impressive margins have been cut in half this year, with Facebook earning "only" $512 million in net income for the March quarter, on $3.54 billion in revenue. That top line was up "only" about 40% from the previous March quarter. To justify its stock price, then, Facebook has to knock it out of the park every quarter. There seem to be possibilities for doing that, in Whatsupp and the growing interest in mobile games. However as model Kate Upton says in one of her Game of War ads, "but you must not delay." Facebook is increasingly being bound by political forces beyond its control. Whether we're talking about national governments seeking control of their local Internets , dumb apps having to be pulled down , legal cases that could dissuade people from using social networks or pushback against its Internet.org efforts , Facebook is now facing opposition that won't yield easily to technical tweaks. What we are seeing here is evidence of a saturated market. Most people now have smartphones, even "old" people, most people understand the risks and rewards of social networking, and most governments now see both threats and benefits in increased Internet access. Hiring a former FCC chairman from a deregulatory regime may not provide a solution. The future points to slower growth, on both the top and bottom lines, unless the company can pull a rabbit out of its hat. To me that means smaller gains for Facebook shareholders.
