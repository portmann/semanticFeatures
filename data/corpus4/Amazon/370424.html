Yes, I'm Going To Compare Amazon And IBM - International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) | Seeking Alpha AMZN and IBM recently showed up on a list of over and underweighted stocks. The two appeal to different types of investors. Bloomberg recently published an article that highlighted the most "loved" and "hated" stocks. Technology juggernauts Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) fell on different sides of the list. Which makes it interesting to see what investors are paying for each. A comparison between IBM and Amazon isn't perfect. One is a massive online retailer that has other important technology businesses, like providing cloud computing, thrown in the mix. The other is a technology giant that helps business customers solve their technology problems. However, that involves things like cloud computing and could easily involve working with retailers. In fact, when Seeking Alpha readers comment on IBM, Amazon's services often come up as a reference point. Which is why stepping back and putting this pair up against each other is so interesting. If you were to buy these companies today, here's what you'd be paying... IBM's price to earnings ratio is around 10. Amazon's P/E is over 450. To be fair, IBM is in the midst of a big business transformation and its revenues have been declining as it sells off assets so it can refocus on higher margin businesses. That has investors concerned about the future and they have understandably pushed the shares lower. If you buy into IBM, you need to believe that the turnaround will work out. Amazon, meanwhile, is investing for growth and has been pretty much from day one. It's done a good job growing the top line, with revenues expanding at an annualized rate of 28% over the last decade. IBM's revenues have fallen at an annualized rate of around 1% over the same span, with more recent periods showing a quicker decline. The thing is, revenues are not earnings. Amazon's growth spending has often pushed its bottom line into the red. And while it earned $1.25 a share last year, the current share price, based on the price-to-earnings ratio, appears to be pricing in a huge amount of bottom line growth. That's true of the price to sales ratio, too. Amazon's P/S ratio is around 2.6 compared to IBM's 1.7 or so. On this score, Amazon looks more reasonably valued, but IBM is still the cheaper option. And sales are great, but only if they fall to the bottom line - something that isn't happening at Amazon nearly as well as it's happening at IBM. For example, Amazon's operating margin has historically been in the low single digits. IBM's are routinely around 20%. Another interesting metric to examine is price to cash flow. While earnings are an important metric of how a company is doing, it's cash flow that pays the bills. On that score, Amazon is trading at 23 times cash flow and IBM at a far more modest 8 times. That's interesting considering that IBM is much better at turning sales into cash flow. For example, IBM's free cash flow as a percentage of sales has historically been in the low to mid teens. Amazon has historically been in the low single digits, though it did pop up into the low teens last year. Once again, Amazon's growth story is getting the benefit of the doubt while IBM's turnaround story, despite strong cash flow generation, is weighing on investor perception. The point isn't to suggest that IBM or Amazon is the better investment as much as it is to point out the valuation discrepancy. Institutional level investors have been clamoring for Amazon shares, according to Bloomberg, and the price reflects high expectations that have yet to show up in the numbers. This is the type of stock a growth minded investor might love, since future results are really what you are buying. IBM, meanwhile, is relatively unloved by big investors. That's largely because of its slow moving turnaround. And with the top line falling during the effort, you can understand the concern that has driven IBM's stock price lower. That's true even though it's still putting up solid results underneath that number. Which is why, if you believe that the turnaround will work out, recent prices could be a compelling entry point. But only if you have a value bent. That's my preference, but it might not be yours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
