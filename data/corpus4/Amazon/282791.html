Amazon's shipping expenses have been rising, and with the company's quest for faster delivery, this variable cost is likely to rise even further. Online shopping's rising popularity has resulted in a massive proliferation of packages being shipped to online shoppers. This adds stress to an already congested and ageing transport network. Drones could potentially introduce a solution in the longer term. Early cost estimates look positive, which suggests drones might have the potential to positively impact shipping expenses - the Achilles' heel of online retailers. Please take note that this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or non-attractiveness of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as an investment, and should not be used independent of other factors. (This piece merely explores the business side of Amazon's core business of online retailing.) Amazon accounted for nearly 40% of online spending during the holiday season from November 1st to December 6th, according to research conducted by Slice Intelligence . The company's share increased by 140 basis points this year compared to last year, when the online retailer captured nearly 38% of American's online spend during the holiday season. Amazon's market share is larger than the web sales of the next 21 retailers combined , including Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), Target (NYSE: TGT ), Best Buy Co. (NYSE: BBY ), Macy's Inc. (NYSE: M ), Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD ), Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN ) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST ). Amazon, the largest e-retailer in the United States, will account for nearly one-quarter of total U.S. retail sales growth this year and over half of e-commerce growth, according to Macquarie Research analysts . This trend is expected to continue going forward. Forrester Research projects U.S. online retail sales to increase to 11% of total retail sales in 2018 , helped by increased spending from digitally savvy Millennials who move into their prime spending years. These factors suggest a changing landscape in retailing, somewhat akin to the retail disruptions that took place in the United States decades ago. Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) profited during the last century's retail revolution - mail order - by offering a wide selection to customers who had no prior access to it. With the rise of the automobile, Wal-Mart capitalized from consumers' increasing mobility by pioneering massive "supercenters" offering a wide selection to customers under one roof. Today, with mobile and internet technology, Amazon is offering consumers an unprecedented selection of products. However, as with any evolving industry, change gives rise to new challenges, and one of them is shipping, i.e., delivery of goods in a timely and cost-effective manner. This is particularly the case with last mile delivery, which is the last stage of the delivery chain, where small individual packages are delivered to customers' homes. Amazon currently relies on third-party delivery companies, such as United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) and USPS, to deliver orders to customers. Delivery delays during the peak holiday season is only one challenge. ShipMatrix reported that on-time rates for FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) and UPS were behind compared to a year ago. More important, however, are Amazon's net shipping costs. Unlike brick-and-mortar stores like Wal-Mart, shipping cost is a variable cost for online retailers such as Amazon. And this variable cost is a crucial determinant to completing a transaction. A survey conducted by Purolator International found that 63% of Americans and 76% of Canadians consider the price of shipping to be extremely important when completing a purchase online. A separate survey found that 63% of consumers would cancel an order because of high shipping costs. A study by ComScore and United Parcel Service echoed this notion, stating that the No. 1 reason consumers abort an online purchase is when a shipping charge gets added to the total during checkout. Inflation and fuel costs are only part of the reason for increased shipping costs, and are not necessarily caused by rising fuel prices; diesel prices have not risen since 2011 . The cost increases largely stem from the development of a new kind of shipping inefficiency caused by consumers buying what they want when they want; the convenience of making random purchases has resulted in a profusion of smaller, lighter packages, sometimes being delivered in separate shipments from different warehouses. Consequently, handling costs, packaging costs (cardboard and plastic wraps) and last mile delivery costs increase, which contributes to increased shipping expenses. In response to this, delivery companies UPS and FedEx implemented dimensional weight pricing on air shipments and large ground shipments, which contributed to an increase in revenue. In January last year , the two delivery firms implemented dimensional weight pricing on all ground shipments, which further increases shipping costs for Amazon and all other online retailers. Not only are shipping costs increasing for the aforementioned reasons, but Amazon's ambition to reduce delivery speeds adds additional upward pressure on shipping expenses. Fast shipping, already costly on its own , only adds to this rising cost. One of the most powerful advantages of brick-and-mortar stores is instant gratification, where customers have instant ownership to the goods after the purchase. Reducing this disadvantage in online shopping should increase customers' propensity to shop online. The problem is cost. The majority of customers are not willing to pay for the extra cost of fast shipping. Forrester research analysts estimate that Amazon loses between $1 billion to $2 billion a year on US Prime shipments, which promises free two-day shipping (and for qualifying orders, free same-day shipping) to Prime members. The majority of Amazon Prime members joined the program for the free two-day shipping. As a result of consumers' unwillingness to pay for the full cost of shipping, Amazon was forced to absorb some of the costs. Over the past few years, customers paid about half of the actual shipping cost, with the balance absorbed by the company. In 2014, Amazon's shipping costs were $8.7 billion, with $4.5 billion paid by customers, leaving a $4.3 billion net shipping loss on the company's books. The Wall Street Journal notes that shipping costs is one of Amazon's fastest-growing expenses (a by-product of rapidly increasing online sales of general merchandise). The economics of drones for "last mile" delivery There's been much public discussion about drones, with some believing it is a possibility, while others are skeptical, calling the idea a publicity stunt. Americans currently are divided with regard to using drones for delivery purposes. Nevertheless, a fair number of companies are actively exploring the possibilities, including Amazon, Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Wal-Mart, Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ), DHL, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Matternet, to name a few notable companies. Matternet partnered with Swiss World Cargo and Swiss Post to launch a pilot program in July , in which autonomous Matternet drones will deliver parcels in multiple areas in Switzerland. Venture capitalists have invested in drones, and funding for venture-backed drone companies in the U.S., China, Europe and Israel hit a record in 2015 . The economics of "last mile" delivery depends on two factors: route density and drop size. Route density refers to the number of packages that are delivered on a given route - the more packages per route, the lower the cost per delivery. Drop size is the number of packages that are delivered at a certain location. The more parcels at a certain location, the lower the cost per parcel. Drones appear to be an uneconomical solution to the "last mile" problem in both aspects; in Amazon's case, the route density and drop size are currently about one, which means they carry just one package per delivery, per location and then return to have their batteries recharged, collect and then deliver another package. However, drones could introduce a solution to the new shipping inefficiency explained previously: the exploding number of small, lighter packages being shipped as a result of consumers shopping online for items at their convenience. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Transportation , over the next three decades, America's population is expected to increase by 70 million to 390 million. With online sales increasing its share of total retail sales, it is expected to contribute to increase freight volume by 45% to 29 billion tons a year and add further stress to an already congested and ageing U.S. transport system . Truck congestion wastes US$27 billion in time and fuel annually, and this could increase going forward. Drones offer a potential solution - not in the near future, but maybe in the longer term - and if not as an independent delivery vehicle, then as part of a hybrid solution, as detailed in this article here . According to this article on Wired, the fuel cost of running a diesel-powered truck is a little over 50 cents per mile, whereas the energy cost to power a drone over that distance is about 2 cents. Combining the two vehicles holds the potential to substantially reduce the cost inefficiencies associated with "last mile" delivery. For Amazon, the drones have the benefit of introducing a solution for the company's quest for cheaper and faster delivery, and the drones fit quite neatly into Amazon's delivery needs. The drones could deliver packages in 30 minutes or less , and can carry packages weighing up to five pounds (2.3kg), which make up 86% of the packages Amazon delivers. Early calculations on the economics of drone delivery are positive so far. Professor of robotics and autonomous vehicles, Raffaelo D'Andrea, co-founder of Kiva Systems, which was acquired by Amazon, thinks the economics of drone delivery for small packages are feasible. D'Andrea's calculation, as detailed in this article here , arrives at a total cost of approximately 20 cents per package - which is far less than what Amazon is paying today, estimated to be about US$2-8 per package , with the cheapest option being USPS and the most expensive being UPS or FedEx. D'Andrea's calculation assumes the package weighs no more than 2kg and a range of 10km, with headwinds of up to 30 km per hour. A separate study by ARK Invest suggests Prime Air could cost the company around 88 cents, assuming the packages weigh less than five pounds and the delivery distance does not exceed ten miles of Amazon's facilities. ARK Invest assumes 10-12 drones per operator. Drones are expected to have "pilots," and are not expected to eliminate human labor in the early stages. Fully autonomous drones are not expected to be a reality in the near future. Other analysis, which assumes the need for more pilots, arrives at a much higher figure of around $10-17 per delivery. It is speculative to say whether drones will ever be deployed for commercial use; however, the trend appears to be moving in that direction. If drones are put to commercial use, it is unlikely to happen in the near future. It could take well over three to four years to be deployed, but the prospects are promising , and this development is likely to have a long-term positive impact on shipping expenses - the Achilles' heel of online retailers, which suggests bright prospects for Amazon, America's largest e-retailer.
