Scott Fitzgerald, author of "The Great Gatsby". Another, "One Mississippi", a dark comedy about a woman coping with the loss of her mother, features comedian Louis CK as executive producer and "Juno" scriptwriter Diablo Cody as co-writer. Other pilots include "Edge", a western drama based on George G. Gilman's book series; "Good Girls Revolt"; political thriller "Patriot" and the comedy "Highston", which has Sacha Baron Cohen as an executive producer.
