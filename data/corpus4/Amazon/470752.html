Jim Adkins, Vice President of Amazon, said in a statement. The company says the addition of Kickstarter is the next step in its Launchpad platform, which seeks to connect shoppers with innovators they may not otherwise learn about. â€œKickstarter helps independent creators find the resources, courage, and community they need to bring their creative projects to life,â€? Yancey Strickler, CEO and Co-Founder of Kickstarter, said in a statement. â€œWeâ€™re thrilled to collaborate with Amazon Launchpad on creating a new path for those projects to be discovered, experienced, and loved.â€? The initial launch will featureÂ products from Piper, Zivix, Print, and MudWatt, among others, with items ranging from $300 headphones to a $25 wooden race car kit. â€œOur goal is to enable them to reach Amazonâ€™s hundreds of millions of customers and to overcome one of the biggest challenges any startup faces â€“ bringing their product to market successfully,â€? Adkins said. Itâ€™s unclear if Amazon will stock the Kickstarter products in its warehouses. Last year, when Launchpad was created, the company said it would manage inventory, fulfill orders using its own distribution network, and provide customer service for some of the startupâ€™s sales.
