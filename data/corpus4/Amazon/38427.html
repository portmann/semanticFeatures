Amazon's Q1 Beat Might Benefit These ETFs | Seeking Alpha  |  Apr. 24, 2015 11:19 AM ET  |  Includes: AMZN , FDN , PNQI , RTH by: Zacks Funds The e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reported Q1 results after the closing bell on Thursday. Though the company's guidance for the second quarter was not too great, Q1 beat on both lines and a surging cloud business cheered investors' mood, sending the shares soaring after hours. Loss per share came in at 12 cents, a penny higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate but lower than the year-ago earnings of 23 cents. However, this represents the second beat in a row for Amazon. Revenues climbed 15% year over year to $22.72 billion and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.54 billion. Amazon Web Services revenues grew over 45% to $1.57 billion in the quarter. The company projects revenue growth of 7-18% to $20.6-$22.8 billion for the second quarter, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.8 billion is at the upper end of the guidance. Amazon also expects an operating loss of $500 million to income of $50 million in the second quarter. Investors should note that the company recorded an operating loss of $15 million in the second quarter of last year. Shares of AMZN advanced 6.8% after hours yesterday. Investors should note that the stock has gained 25.7% so far this year versus the 2.7% gain for S&P 500 index in the same timeframe. As such, the upward price movement might indicate a turnaround for the company and the earnings beat for two successive quarters point to a bright future. Further, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a solid industry rank (in the top 38%) at the time of writing as per the Zacks Industry Rank, suggesting upside potential for the stock in the coming days.
