Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. The popularity of streaming music services like Spotify has others in the business scrambling to hit upon just the right formula for success. Amazon, for one, is reportedly working on a Spotify-killer that is entirely separate from Prime Music. The New York Post cites several sources that say Amazon is preparing its plan to take on Spotify, holding meetings with music bigwigs to talk about licensing music for a subscription service, though the plan is still in the early stage. Though Prime members can access about a million songs as part of their $99 per year membership — in comparison to the 30 million tracks or so tracks offered by Spotify — the new service would come with its own monthly fee, and will feature a more robust music selection than Prime. A $3 to $4 discount could be included if the service is bundled with Echo, sources say. As for when the new service is expected to launch, one source says Amazon is gearing up for a fall debut. Sen.
