Alibaba: Building Up The Media Playbook - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha BABA's recent partnership with DIS and investment in BONA further highlights its media ambition. DIS and BONA content are key differentiators for BABA's ecosystem. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) made two media moves last week that will further enhance the strength of its ecosystem. I remind investors that BABA is not simply an e-commerce platform (that title belongs to eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY )). In fact, BABA is building an ecosystem consisting of media, cloud, payment and O2O that will ultimately drive the growth of its core business. In the case with media, investors can think of BABA's media deals similar to that of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video (see - Amazon: Scaling Up Online Video and Amazon: Prime Ecosystem Expansion ), where media is another value-add service that BABA can add as part of its e-commerce bundle similar to that of Amazon Prime. In my view, BABA has the best assets among its Chinese e-commerce peers and is the only company that can replicate the Amazon Prime strategy in China. Worth highlighting, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ) is also offering a loyalty program by mimicking Amazon Prime, but there are differences in that JD is more focused on e-commerce and lacks the critical ecosystem support to drive user retention (see - JD: Following The Footsteps Of Amazon ). I reiterate my bullish view on BABA and Amazon and cautious view on JD. BABA's deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ) involves an OTT product called DisneyLife, through which the user can access DIS content and plan their trips to the Hong Kong and upcoming Shanghai Disney parks. DisneyLife is featured on BABA's TMall site, priced at $125 (a bit pricey in my view given how Xiaomi or LeTV set-top box cost half the price), and will begin shipping on December 28th. Besides selling the OTT product on TMall, the partnership also includes content distribution given that DIS cannot operate its own channel in China. BABA's presence spans across set-top boxes and smart TV partnerships that can allow users to easily access DIS content and this will be critical for DIS to build a long-term viewer base in China. I note that DIS' new "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" movie will likely see some challenges when it hits the Chinese theaters next year, as most Chinese viewers are not familiar with the Star Wars franchise and do not understand its significance. That said, DIS needs BABA's partnership to build its viewership in China that could potentially be the single most important market for DIS in the next decade. The other media deal involved Bona Films (NASDAQ: BONA ), which will be privatized by a unit of BABA, Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ), private equity investors and management. Although BONA may not be well-known to most investors, the company is actually well-known across China as a movie theater operator and movie production company. Most notably, BONA was behind Matt Damon's "The Martian" and kung-fu hit "The Grandmaster". The company was also known for its "Taking Tiger Mountain" movie which was screened across North America earlier this year. In essence, securing key media assets will differentiate BABA's ecosystem versus that of its rivals and this is a key reason behind BABA's recent moves. I remain bullish on the company's outlook and consider the current valuation of 25x FY2017E earnings to be highly attractive relative to its earnings growth rate.
