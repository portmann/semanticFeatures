Understanding Amazon's Cash Conversion Cycle - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (419 clicks) Amazon's cash conversion cycle is negative, meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory, among other things. A negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers. Amazon's cash cycle has become less negative over the past 5 years, but this trend is driven primarily by DSO growth, not DPO contraction. The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle, even if the businesses don't make money, which they currently don't. We believe the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really isn't nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers. As we stated in our previous article, one of the attractive features of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is its ability to turn net losses to positive cash flow every year. The fuel driving this healthy cash-generation prowess is Amazon's negative cash conversion cycle. The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows, and is defined as DSO (days sales outstanding) plus DIO (days inventory outstanding) less DPO (days payable outstanding). Amazon's cash conversion cycle is negative, meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory, among other things. Think of it simply this way. When you buy something on Amazon, you enter your credit card or PayPal info, and, depending on the transaction, Amazon turns that into cash relatively quickly. Amazon, though, doesn't have to pay its suppliers for a much longer time after it has turned its sales into cash. Because of this set-up, Amazon is generating cash from its sales regardless of whether or not each sale is profitable. The negative cash conversion cycle is indicative of a strong management team headed by Jeff Bezos, and illustrates management's efficient use of working capital. More or less, a negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers. It's quite remarkable, and the key to Amazon continually reporting strong operating cash flow. Several Amazon bears are worried that this model is unsustainable, and that increased supplier pressure will decrease DPO so that the cash conversion cycle becomes positive. There might be some validity to this claim. Amazon's cash conversion cycle has become less negative over the past 5 years, falling from a -40 days range to a -23 days range (on an annual basis), and is now at the least negative cash cycle over the past 10 years. Despite this cash conversion cycle becoming less negative, the stock has continued to rally. Moreover, despite the least negative cash cycle MRFY in the past 10 years, the divergence between operating cash flow and net profit has never been wider, with non-cash adjustments exceeding $7 billion last year. So why is this? And why isn't the lesser negative cash conversion cycle weighing on the stock's valuation? A closer look at DPO, DIO, and DSO reveals that Amazon is actually not feeling an excessive deal of pressure from suppliers. DPO has increased over the past 10 years to 90.6 days MRFY. It is worth noting, however, that MRFY DPO is 4.6% off its high, so it does appear Amazon is feeling some, albeit small, pressure from suppliers. We do not believe this fall from DPO highs is an alarming concern when considering the DPO, DSO, and DIO trends over the past 10 years. When looking at these 10-year trailing trends, we believe Amazon's negative cash conversion cycle is most at risk to growing DSO. DSO has grown 109% over the past 10 years, greatly outpacing DPO and DIO growth, especially over the past 5 years. This DSO growth is the primary driver of the less negative cash cycle over the past 5 years. It is taking longer for Amazon to collect cash on its sales, but this is expected with more Amazon Prime subs and a growing AWS presence. Operating cash flow and net income are as divergent as they have ever been despite a less negative cash conversion cycle due to Prime and AWS. This is because the company amortizes revenue it earns from Prime and AWS over an entire year. A Fool.com piece puts it best: What's key about this line item is that like the negative cash conversion cycle discussed above it can make near term cash flow look stronger than it is. In the last year, Amazon has recorded $3.87 billion in unearned revenue and amortized (or recognized) previously unearned revenue to the tune of $3.18 billion. That means that Amazon recorded a net cash gain of $699 million from services -- or costs -- it hasn't yet performed for customers. In the end, it is all in the negative cash cycle. Amazon gets paid up front in cash for services provided over time, and this inflates near-term cash flow. The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle. While this certainly seems like a bear stance and does pose an appropriate risk to the company's current valuation, we believe the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really isn't nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers. As such, we believe the company should continue to produce operating cash flow in excess of mid-single-digit billions of dollars per year. With the AWS and Prime businesses looking as strong as ever, we think operating cash flow can grow over time as profitability and ROIC in each business grow. While AMZN is certainly not a risk-free investment here as a lot of moving parts must fall in place for the greater Amazon machine to operate fluidly, we do believe that the negative cash conversion cycle is sustainable, AWS will deliver high ROIC, and Prime is growing into a globally dominant business. We believe many of the moving parts are falling into place, and that the greater Amazon machine looks positioned to operate on a full-boar basis some time in the foreseeable future.
