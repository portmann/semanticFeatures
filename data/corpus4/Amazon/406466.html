Why Is This Man Smiling? Amazon's Practically Perfect Week - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The FTC clears the path for Amazon to dominate another market. Are you a retailer other than Amazon? Then there is some bad news. Rangeley Capital portfolio managers Andrew Walker and Chris DeMuth Jr host a fifteen-minute podcast, which you can subscribe to on audioBoom . If you missed the previous podcast episode, then please check out Own Your Own Baseball Team ( BATRK ). Today, we discuss Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Things are looking up for CEO Jeff Bezos - he is now the fourth richest person in the world with a fortune of over $60 billion (and he is younger and thinner than everyone richer). His retail competitors are getting crushed one after another. A merger that would have strengthened a rival - the Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS )-Office Depot (NASDAQ: ODP ) deal - was blocked in court, clearing the way for Amazon's defeat of the broken and hobbled pair. How could it have been any better? Well Bezos' rival is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ) chief Elon Musk who successfully stuck his rocket landing. If it had crashed into the sea, that would have been a perfect week. Disclosure: I am/we are long BHI, M, ODP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
