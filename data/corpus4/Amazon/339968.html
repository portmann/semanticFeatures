Today's Apple Products Are Absurd - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Today’s Apple products do not change the lives of their users, but are mere improvements on existing products. Apple is walking in Microsoft’s footsteps. The bigger a company gets, the dumber and slower it gets. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) started out as two guys in a garage. Today, it contains over 100,000 employees. Am I implying Apple has become dumb and slow? Not necessarily. But large companies stifle creativity and innovation, which were the main catalysts for Apple's original monopoly - something they have recently lost . I am by no means an Apple bear. If anything, the stock is undervalued. Nevertheless, I do have a mission to open investors' eyes to the fact that Apple is no longer a growth stock, but a value stock. Much of the Apple fanbase is finding this concept difficult to cope with. After my last article on the subject, MacDailyNews responded with a rebuttal. Let me deal with the rebuttal before I move forward to my main point: That Apple has become what Peter Thiel calls a "One to Many" company. My response: An American-centric view ignores the innovations of foreign companies, often dismissing them as "strange." I live in Japan, and I chose a Sharp ( OTCPK:SHCAY ) Aquos over an iPhone. It's 100% water-proof, the screen is beautiful and it receives television signals. The phone was made in 2012, and in spite of the new smartphones flooding the market I feel no reason to upgrade. Sharp is truly making innovations to its smartphones, but Americans do not know about these innovations simply because Japanese companies are reluctant to test US waters. Only after Americans proactively show interest in Japanese products are those products shipped overseas. The most innovative smartphone strides are arguably being taken by Sharp, not Apple. Consider Sharp's RoBoHoN : Half-robot, half-phone. If Siri were the radio, RoBoHoN is the television. RoBoHoN personifies the smartphone, leveraging a new type of love Apple originally brought into our lives. The RoBoHoN is a "Zero to One" innovation in the smartphone industry (see below), whereas upgrades to the iPhone are "One to Many" innovations. As for the second point, profit and innovation are not equivalent. This shouldn't need explaining. And this second point is exactly the opposite of what innovative tech companies believe. A drastic change and a significant change differ on an exponential scale. Extended battery life, incrementally faster operating systems and larger screens only incrementally move the world forward. Incremental change was not the goal of Steve Jobs. Nor is it the goal of big-name innovators such as Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. If you believe Apple's current purpose is to improve daily life instead of dramatically change it, you have already implicitly admitted Apple should now be treated as a value stock. One of the main factors that has led to this change is the emergence of a corporate culture reliant on restricting the creativity and capabilities of its employees. In Peter Thiel's book Zero to One , the idea of a startup versus business is deeply explored. Startups attempt to change the world by creating something truly new; businesses make incremental improvements to existing products. Thinking of Apple in this regard shows a shift from "Zero to One" to "One to Many." That is, in the past, Apple created new products out of thin air: The first working smartphone, the first working tablet computer, the first a la carte music store. These are "Zero to One" products. But the Apple of today is in a "One to Many" state of mind. Today's Apple products do not change the lives of their users, but are mere improvements on existing products: A bigger iPhone, a smaller iPad, a lighter MacBook Air. These are no-brainer decisions that could have been made by the management of any other company - take a time machine to the date of Steve Job's death, switch out Apple's managers for those of IBM (NYSE: IBM ) or Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), and you will have likely changed nothing in the grand scheme of things. I know my thoughts mimic those of Apple investors, as a recent Bloomberg poll found that 71% of investors feel Apple has "lost its edge." Many are hopeful Apple's current rut is just that - a rut. But few tech companies have ever broken their ruts. For example, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) still gains over 90% of its revenue from advertising. Other examples abound. Innovations are rare, as no system exists for producing one innovation after another; instead, most tech companies latch onto the product that jettisoned them into profitability in the first place, and that attachment alone can be an impediment to future creative endeavors. Apple is also an example of a one-hit wonder. No products since the iPhone have created an entire industry. Two-thirds of Apple's revenue stems from the iPhone; if Apple were constantly producing innovative products, this would not be so. We cannot begin to critique Apple's innovation without talking about the products themselves. Let's start with the obvious. The newest iPhone versions, 6s and 6s plus, have added nothing noteworthy. What are hailed as innovations are instead incremental improvements. Touch ID, which is an incremental improvement of the fingerprint scanning used by Motorola phones in 2011 and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) phones in 2014, is a convenience at best. Force Touch is another old incremental innovation that can be traced back to Mitsubishi in 2001. The Apple Watch, which was supposed to be the next big thing, was merely a well-done smartwatch - an innovation that dates back to 2013 at the latest. What Apple has done with the Apple Watch might be an improvement over all those that came before it; this is arguable, given that its sales are behind Fitbit's (NYSE: FIT ) and barely more than those of Xiaomi (Private: XI ). But that's exactly the point: It's an improved version of an existing product, not an innovation. The iPad series have varied in size, computing power and weight. The Apple Pencil, essentially a branded stylus pen, steps on Steve Job's grave. Jobs rejected the idea of adding a stylus pen to the iPad series. A company that begins breaking its own rules has likely run out of novel ideas. Apple TV is the very definition of an upsell. Simply put, the Apple TV allows the integration of iTunes and your iPhone with your TV. Google, Roku and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) all have products of equivalent quality and functionality. I have both an Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV in my home, but I don't find myself preferring one over the other. In fact, I find myself using my laptop's HDMI cable more than either of these devices. My television life is no different than it was five years ago. But this is a mere anecdote. Why don't we interview an expert on this subject? I contacted Ryan Downey, The Streaming Advisor, and asked for his thoughts on whether Apple TV brings anything innovative to the table. Please read his thoughts in the supplementary section at the bottom of this article. Overall, most of what Apple is passing off as innovations today are nothing more than incremental improvements on what's already on the market or upsells to integrate Apple into forms of conventional technology. Fans of the Apple brand will support these improvements. However, none of these upgrades have made the impact the iPhone or iPad has on our lives. Startup Culture Versus Corporate Culture Apple's culture of secrecy has drawn complaints from its employees as well as the media. But investors should be complaining as well. While the "unveiling" of a new product can certainly make stock jump, it hurts the actual innovation level of the new products at the same time. Startups employ people with inspirations and obsessions. These people don't merely think of their work at work, they think of their work at home and during family reunions. And where there is thought, there is speech. Steve Jobs didn't start Apple as a secret project. He used every opportunity he could to develop his ideas through conversations with like-minded individuals. The idea of a mad genius toiling throughout the night to complete his world-changing invention is different from the reality of a team tossing ideas and feedback at one another. In Apple, secrecy is not just contained within the company - it's also meant as a creed to prevent coworkers from sharing their work and ideas - just read this first employee review to see the extent to which this secrecy is carried out. The idea behind Apple's inter-coworker secrecy is one of forcing each employee to focus on his own project. But one should wonder whether it was policies like these that brought about an iPhone the size of an iPad and an iPad the size of an iPhone. Perhaps if these two teams had communicated, the end results wouldn't have been so redundant. Another important aspect of the startup culture is the purposeful ignorance of what the public says they want. Large corporations put their faith in focus groups, creating and molding products from the opinions of the public. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) spent over $300M on this type of research only to create a hamburger that failed (remember the Arch Deluxe?) Startups, in contrast, release inventions based on their own ideas and gauge market reaction after the fact. The iPhone was clearly such an invention. But the most recent product releases have been "steps forward" - mere improvements. Apple is known for not using focus groups in their research. However, when you drill down to the details, you find that Apple does indeed survey its customers. Apple's market research is now focused on comparing its products to those of its competitors, asking how customers decide on buying iPhones and iPads instead of Android devices. The fact that Apple engages in such research was made evident in its court proceedings with Samsung. Apple attempted to seal its exposed market research data and continue the facade of being 100% original. But not all Apple investors drink the Kool-Aid. Now that we know Apple obtains ideas from the public, we cannot look at Apple as a grown-up rebel. Instead, Apple is a lawyer who gets an occasional tattoo to convince his friends he's still the same dude who used to play beer pong in college. Unfortunately, high innovation and bureaucracy are mutually exclusive. No innovative products have ever come from a company that manages its employees like robots. When everyone must work in the same way, the motto "Think Different" loses its purpose. Even the client side of Apple is beginning to wake up to the fact that Apple has strayed from its early years. Apple is walking in Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) footsteps. The "Zero to One" idea of creating a visual, interactive version of MS-DOS is now replaced with a perpetual catch-up game. The Microsoft we've seen over the past few years has released new, innovative products such as tablet computers, smartphones and video game consoles. Never mind that these products already had superior versions - created by true innovators - on the market. Microsoft's corporate culture, for some reason or another, felt that they could do it better. They were wrong. Smartphone fanatics don't buy Windows Phones. Tablet fanatics don't buy Surface Pros. And owning an Xbox labels you as a "casual gamer" in the gaming community. When a company attempts to enter an established market, they are no longer innovating. They are incrementing. They are looking to turn one into two instead of zero into one. I don't hate Apple. I'm bullish on Apple. But my bullish thesis is different from most Apple fans. The Apple of the past is gone. Apple is now a bureaucratic corporation that stifles innovation. Apple stock, likewise, is becoming a value stock, not a growth stock. But good things are coming Apple's way. They dominate market share in established industries. They have a large population of faithful shareholders who are willing to pump more money into the stock at a moment's notice. Shareholders will be rewarded by steady dividends and dividend growth. They will also be rewarded by overall growth in the company, just not at the rate we saw when Jobs was alive. A 30% CROIC supports such a bullish thesis: AAPL is becoming MSFT or IBM. This is not a bad thing. Change is not a bad thing. But 2016 AAPL is not 2010 AAPL. Growth investors must get this into their heads. Value investors should also recognize this fact, as it makes AAPL a less risky investment than what value investors would have previously imagined. Apple was only a small player in the dot com craze of 2000. The company only began to take off in the late 2000s. But we can look to MSFT's and IBM's pasts to get a good feel as to whether we are at a relative top in AAPL. Both IBM and MSFT were hit hard by the 1999-2000 pump and dump of dot-com stocks. But MSFT recently recovered to its 2000 high, and IBM is well past its 2000 high. Hitting a peak during your growth phase does not preclude higher peaks during the value phase. The early 2015 peak is likely the highest we will see for a while, based on EBITDA/EV predictions. This ratio has been statistically proven to correlate with stock price movements , and a graph of EBITDA/EV plotted on AAPL's stock price shows AAPL to lag behind this ratio. If this correlation holds for AAPL, we should see a rebound that brings the stock near its previous peak at $134.54: When Apple rebounds, it will emerge as a value stock. Informed investors should begin demanding dividends of Apple. Growth stock investors should begin to lighten their positions on Apple once it hits $120. The question from $120 onward is whether Apple can maintain its market share - and relevance - in an industry that demands innovation. Interview with Ryan Downey, The Streaming Advisor, on Apple TV's Innovations Ryan: No, Roku was the first to enter the market. It was the brainchild of Reed Hastings of Netflix. Netflix always wanted to be a streaming company, but when they first started off, the infrastructure for video streaming could not have supported widespread video streaming. They brought in the guy who runs Roku now, Anthony Wood. He had invented one of the first DVR systems, called "Replay TV," one of the first DVR systems. Wood helped Hastings develop a box for Netflix, but Hastings had an epiphany while working on the box. He realized it would be a mistake to create a branded box. Ryan: I don't think of Apple TV as truly innovative. The current setup is beautiful and is a force in the market. AirPlay and mirroring are the most innovative things about the Apple TV, evidenced by the fact that all of Apple's competitors are copying it. In fact, when Chromecast came out, most of the commentators in the industry talked about its mirroring service as, "just like Apple TV." But these systems weren't in the first Apple TV; they only came out with the second Apple TV, which was created when Steve Jobs was still around. The newer Apple TVs added an app store for streaming apps. This is more than was there before but is not innovative; everybody already had something along these lines. Roku was the first major device to have a streaming app store, so Apple was playing catch-up. But something that I think is really cool about the current Apple TV is the IR feature that allows any TV remote to control the Apple TV . Roku, Amazon, and Android TV don't do this yet. I can't say that this hasn't been done in the past, but Apple TV is the first major box on the market that allows for this.
