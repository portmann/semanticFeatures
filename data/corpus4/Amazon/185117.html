Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. When in the mood for the piping hot, cheesy deliciousness that is pizza, there seems to be endless options to satisfy your needs: calling the store, ordering online or even sending a pizza emoji via text or Twitter . One man has created yet another way to have that circle of love delivered straight from your door, simply by hacking an Amazon Dash button. Engineer Brody Berson details in a blog post on Medium how he was able to hack a Dash to order him a pizza from Domino’s anytime he pushed the little white button. Berson was able to create his own instant-pizza-ordering-button by reprogramming the small device using an API capable of sending payment information to his pizza delivery company of choice â€“â€“ in this case, Domino’s. He programmed a specific order into his Dash button – one that had been disconnected from his Amazon account. In all, he says it took just 10 minutes to complete the reprogramming, and then another 30 for the delivery driver to drop off his pie. “I bet you can wire up a PizzaDash button like I did in about ten minutes with your own custom order,” he says in the blog post. “Thatâ€™s pretty awesome to think about since you were never intended to do that with these little pieces of plastic.” Click to print (Opens in new window) Amazon Dash Buttons Are Finally Available To Everyone Amazon Adds 11 Brands To Dash Button Ordering ID Thieves Use Domino’s Ordering App To Check Stolen Card Numbers 7 Things We Learned About The Shady Past And Problematic Business Practices Of JustFab My VW Was Recalled For Emissions Issues In April, Does That Mean It's Fixed?
