How about just yelling your order at the speaker in your living room? Now you can, at least if that speaker is the Amazon Echo, and you want Domino’s.Â  TechCrunch reports that pizza loving Echo users can now order from Domino’s by connecting their device to an account with the pizza chain. To start the ordering process, customers must first create a “Pizza Profile,” which includes your name, address, and payment information, and your favorite pizza order,Â with Domino’s. You then have to go into the Echo app to link your Domino’s account, so that when you say “Alexa (or whatever you’ve renamed your Echo), open Domino’s and place my Easy Order,” it knows what to do. Echo and Alexa can also track orders once they’ve been place, TechCrunch reports, by directing the speaker to “ask Domino’s to track my order.” Click to print (Opens in new window) Amazon’s Echo Might Be Getting More Useful With SmartThings Integration Domino’s Offering 50% Off All Pizzas Ordered Online Through March 22 Man Hacks Amazon Dash Button To Order Pizza Whenever He Wants « EOS Settles Lip Balm Lawsuit By Promising To Add More Info To Product Labels Stuck-In-The-Mud FedEx Truck Ruins Front Yard, Company Shrugs Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
