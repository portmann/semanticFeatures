5 Little Known Ways to Save Money at Amazon.com One very well known thing is I love shopping at Amazon.com . Â I am a prime member and I shop online regularly. Â That doesn’t mean I think Amazon is the best price all of the time. For instance, I just bought a desk (finally) for my home office. While I searched Amazon for a desk, I found my desk at Staples.com. Â Amazon and Staples both charge sales tax, but Staples was cheaper and the shipping was free. Â Just because you love Amazon, doesn’t mean you always save money. Â For this reason, I figured I would show you Â (there is oneÂ bonuses!) little know ways to save money at Amazon.com or make sure you get the best deal. Â I am always willing to help others save that money cash, so consider this my gift to you! I am only adding this one to my list because people still ask me about it or seem amazed it exists. Â Amazon has a little known section of their site which encompass deals from returns or broken boxes during shipments. They analyze their entire stock and inventory and ones they can’t sell as new goes into their Amazon Warehouse Deals section . Â I have written a whole article on it before, so go ahead and read it . Â Trust me, this is a great place to start looking for items to purchase. Â I found my wife a nice digital camera zoom lens which would have been expensive. Â I got it for 50% off because the box was busted during shipment to Amazon’s warehouse. Â They didn’t want to sell the item as new because of the busted box, but the lens worked perfectly and was in near mint condition. Â Ever since that moment, I always check Amazon warehouse deals . I have to admit this one is a tip many don’t know about, but it isn’t 100% effective. I add it Â here because I have seen it work and have done it myself. Â This tactic is something I like to call “forcing a promotion.” Â Why? Â You are trying to push Amazon to give you a promotion for an item you want to buy. Â Now, they might not like this, but it can work here and there. Â What you do is shop Amazon like you normally would. Â When you are done shopping and have all your items in your cart, leave them there. Â You have to be signed into your Amazon account for this to work. Â Don’t actually buy the items. Â Just leave them in your shopping cart and leave Amazon for a few days. Â I have found times when Amazon will send you an email about finishing your checkout, but then gives you a promotion or discount code for the items in your cart. Â I have saved up to 20% one time when doing this method, but again, this is hit or miss. Â You really can’t hurt yourself trying it, so why not? Â If you need an item quickly, then you shouldn’t try to force a promotion. It can take a few days and Amazon has to believe you are just sitting on the items. On top of Amazon’s warehouse deals, they also have an outlet section . Â You can go there and find deep discounts on new items every day. Â Currently, they have stuff up to 60% off! Amazon’s outletÂ has overstocks, closeouts, markdowns, and last years models. Â If they need to get rid of inventory, they go into the outlet section. Â Those products are all still new and ready for you to purchase and save! You can even pick a category and the amount of savings associated and shop for the products that meet that criteria. Â I like Amazon outlet and have saved good money using it. Â I would hope you can find some good savings at Amazon outlet . Now, what in the hell is a name like that? Â I for one cannot tell you why a company named their site this, but they have a system which works. Â  CamelCamelCamel is one of my g0-to tools when shopping on Amazon.com . Â You enter the Amazon URL you want or search for keywords and CamelCamelCamel analyzes the price history of said product. Â Not only do they analyze the historical prices, but they put those prices into an easy to see chart. Â You can also set up price drop notifications to make sure you are getting the best deal at Amazon.com . Â CamelCamelCamel analyzes Amazon prices on a constant basis. If you want the best price, then head over to CamelCamelCamel and put in your email and get notified when the price drops on Amazon. Amazon has a subscribe and save section for everyday items. Â They have had this program for some time, but many don’t even know about it. Â You can shop Amazon’s Subscribe and Save section to see all of the products they have to offer. Â This program sends out regular shipments of the items you need on a regular basis. Â They offer discounts on said items. Â If you have 5 or moreÂ subscriptions delivered on your monthly delivery day, then Amazon takes off 15%! Â You can setup what you want, then when you want it by each month. Â The discounts are identified on the product pages. Â You don’t have to worry about buying them each month. Amazon just sends them to you at a discount. Â If you don’t like it anymore, you can cancel and the items come with free shipping! One of the most secretive ways to save on Amazon is to run your own little price comparison. Â First, you log into your Amazon account like you normally would do when shopping on Amazon.com. Â Find the product you want to purchase, but don’t add it to your cart. Next, open a new browser (better if it were a completely different browser, like open Amazon originally in your favorite browser, then open up Amazon.com again in a new browser). Â Clear you cookies to make sure you are starting fresh. Â Navigate to the same Amazon product page and check the price. Â The point of this trick is there are times when Amazon will show lower prices to non-Amazon customers because they want them to buy. Â They show slightly higher prices to logged-in Amazon customers because they know you will pay the price for the product. Â This trick can be used on a number of retail e-commerce sites. Â I have seen it work and have done it myself. Â Now, as with the add to cart trick, this is not 100%, but it does work. Â You can even sometimes ask a friend in a different city to check the price and they might have a different one. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a Wordpress management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. These are timely with holiday season approaching. Can you believe it? I just took my kid back to college and I’m talking about the holidays. Shiver….. We’ve used #2 and #5 successfully but I wasn’t aware of the warehouse or the outlet.  Thanks, Grayson!!! So I have been working on a very similar article and I planned to post it this week.  I think I’ll wait!  lol.  What timing.  These are great tips though.  I didn’t even think about adding items to your shopping cart and waiting, even though I have been offered discounts that way before.  That’s a great tip!  It’s not 100% effective, like you said, but it’s worth a shot. This seems to be a common topic lately.  Sorry for taking your thunder, but I am sure the article will still rock. I’ve used the cart trick and it’s worked several times but like you said it’s a hit or miss situation.  But I learned something new about the Camelx3 site (too lazy to copy paste) – thanks for the post Grayson! It definitely doesn’t hurt to try the shopping cart trick.  Glad you found Camelx3 and hopefully it works for you! I’ve heard of CamelCamelCamel but haven’t checked it out yet.  I’ll have to give it a try sometime soon. I’ve never gotten a deal from Amazon and leave things in my cart all the time. You’d think they could show me some love! I had no idea about the outlet, so will check that out. I want to start a website called Zebrazebrazebra. No idea what it would be about, but what a cool name! Really!  That is sad to see. I have used the add to cart trick many times and tend to get discounts. While it doesn’t work all of the time and as you show, it can work. It’s things like this that I’m shocked to learn I didn’t know! I love shopping on Amazon because of the deals and free shipping, but I had no idea that leaving things in my cart would force a promotion. I’ve done it before but never noticed. I am going to try this intentionally now. Thanks! Now, leaving items in your cart won’t always force a promotion.  Sometimes it can take a week or two to get a promotion. It really depends if Amazon needs to get rid of the item or if they are feeling generous. Not necessarily.  While you can find the warehouse deals when you are searching as they are actually located in the Used section when on a product page. If you just want to search warehouse deals, then you can click on that category in the search box and then type in your search term. I never knew about the shopping cart trick, thanks!  We often shop and then wait a few days before pulling the trigger on a purchase so using that tip wouldn’t really impact our timeline.  I’m not sure if my husband uses CamelCamelCamel but he does track prices for large purchases so I’ll mention it to him. It doesn’t work all of the time, but the longer you leave the item in the cart, the better to chance to get it. I do that with almost all sites I go onto. I will put things in the checkout bag and not buy the items for days/weeks. I’ll get promotions and coupon codes for days and this even goes to my tanning salon! When I don’t go back to certain places they will send me things to get me back in their facility. It is a good method to use beyond Amazon for sure. I have used this at bigger stores with much success. I always make sure to have enough items in each shipment to get the max discount. Oh, this is great! We buy most of our stuff either from Amazon or Costco, so I will definitely be checking out the warehouse and outlet. Thanks for sharing! Be careful with warehouse. Many, many items come in terrible condition, even when listed at the top levels of condition. I’ve ordered about 50 items over the past year and maybe 40 of them had some kind of issue, half of them being pretty bad. Lots of people have the same problems. If you only buy “like new” and are willing to deal with some returns/problems then its worth looking. Warehouse items also have no warranty, and many cc’s wont extend the warranty of used/refurbed items. I have purchased close to 100 items through the warehouse and never had any issue with them.  I don’t really care much for the warranty, especially for the items I bought, but you still bring up a good point. This is the game you play with warehouse items though. They were returned, used, or didn’t make the “new” cut, so you have to be careful.  That being said, it is still a great way to save at Amazon. Did I indicate S&S was locked in?  If I did, that was not my intention.  While that would be awesome to have it locked in, I don’t think any business would do that for a subscription plan like this. The best part of camelcamelcamel is the Chrome browser extension.   Whenever you are on an Amazon product page, you can click on the little icon at the top of the browser and see the pricing history for that item.  That’s great info, and can help decide whether the current price is a bargain or not. You are correct.  That browser extension is awesome.  My default, I don’t put any extensions on my browser, but that is because I don’t like it being loaded down.  Nothing against the extension though, it does work. Nice tips, thanks. Additionally, I would surmise that CamelCamelCamel is a play on the “humps” that the website’s graphs create, but that’s pure speculation. Great article! Thanks for the tips. I left something in my cart a few months ago and came back a day or two later to find that it had been marked down. At the time I thought it was a bit too coincidental, but I didn’t realize it was “a thing.” I just can’t help but pass along a couple of grammar tips in return. Please note that “setup” in #4 should be two words, and “everyday” in Bonus #1 should be “every day.” The one-word version of “everyday” is an adjective, for example “These are my everyday shoes.” If the phrase “each day” would also work in the sentence (i.e. “I do this each day”), then it’s “every day” that you want to use. I see this mistake online almost every day. It’s apparently contagious. Thank you for the tip, I will update the article.  There are times when I’m writing quickly and don’t think those two through. September 4, 2014 at 4:40 pm — Reply Thank you! I use many of the aspects you’ve listed. Lately, I’ve noticed many items have a lower price before I click on the item. When the items info page opens, the price is higher. I’m wondering if that has something to do with your bonus #2 info. Which brings me to a question about bonus #2.  if you found an item, by using a second browser, and add it to your cart there, does they discounted price hold once you log into your account to make the purchase? Thanks! September 9, 2014 at 12:03 pm — Reply The price depends on the  merchant selling it. You can see a lower price before you click in, but sometimes Amazon will switch the merchant selling the product.  If you want to look at all prices, make sure to head over to the area on the right side where it shows more merchants. September 6, 2014 at 10:05 am — Reply September 6, 2014 at 10:28 am — Reply You are right, I am using affiliate links and there is a nice disclaimer of my amazon affiliation in the footer on every page.  I get compensated for my time and providing information.  Affiliate links or not, the information is still the same. A while ago I was looking for a new DSLR camera. The price was still too high so I ended up just going to the page almost every single day. Then on Sunday morning after I hadn’t checked it for a while, the price surprisingly went down quite substantially. I thought it was a good deal, since I couldn’t find anything better than this, so I bought it. The next morning, the price went up again. Could it possibly be the time of the week also matter? That’s hard to tell. Timing of sales is entirely up to Amazon and I haven’t seen any definitive answer there. October 10, 2014 at 11:53 pm — Reply As an alternative to PriceJump, try PriceBlink.  It can be installed as an extension in a Chrome browser.  Whenever you find something you like on Amazon, or any website, PriceBlink will list other places where the same product could be purchased cheaper.  It appears as a pop up at the bottom of the browser tool bar.  No need to copy and past URLs, just search for items normally, and PriceBlink alerts you. October 11, 2014 at 12:57 pm — Reply Thanks for the suggestion Chris. I appreciate any tool which helps me save money and I am sure my other readers will as well! Hi Grayson, Such a great post and Thanks for the tips.. when i buy from amazon want to get discount then i normally visit CamelCamelCamel, but sometime i also use one of your tips Subscribe and Save.. November 10, 2014 at 10:24 pm — Reply These are some pretty useful tricks. Actually, I didn’t know any of these. They’ll be pretty handy… so thanks. November 10, 2014 at 10:37 pm — Reply November 11, 2014 at 3:31 am — Reply Wow these are awesome tips! I knew about Camel Camel Camel (nice name? lol) and recently started using so do not have an opinion on that yet. However I did not know about Price Jump and am totally going to check it out! November 12, 2014 at 2:58 pm — Reply I don’t mind you putting your site in the URL section, but when you put a comment out that talks about an Amazon savings widget which is actually built by BeFrugal.com, I have a problem. I am well aware of the widget and can put the same thing on this site. November 12, 2014 at 3:02 pm — Reply I just thought it was a cool little widget and a great way to save (which is why I put it on my site) and thought I would share. I apologize if i offended you. You can remove my comment if you like. November 12, 2014 at 3:53 pm — Reply It is a cool widget, but your comment was more about promoting your site than actually commenting on my article. November 12, 2014 at 3:57 pm — Reply I stumbled across them by accident.  They’re a side branch of amazon like warehouse or outlet that feature discount deals and savings. December 26, 2014 at 9:20 am — Reply Woot is good, but I don’t consider that Amazon. Amazon bought Woot and you can only score deals on very specific items. While it is a good site, it’s not Amazon.com and you can only save on a small, very small subset of products. February 10, 2015 at 5:02 pm — Reply I’ve been using price zombie for both. The browser extensions are where its at. If an item is $90 at Bestbuy, I can see what it costs at Amazon, as well as the historical price ranges at each store. This post is to show how to save on Amazon.com. It’s for those who shop on Amazon for a majority of their products and want to save while shopping there. Wow, thanks so much! I didn’t know about any of these. I’m going to add the thing I want to buy next to my cart right now! =D Good luck with that trick. Out of all of them, that is the least likely to work, but it has worked for me in the past. It just has a lower success rate. I actually used your advice on ways to save money when buying products in Amazon. I found great deals on Amazon Warehouse Deals. I was lucky to have gotten a refurbished laptop! Thanks Gray!
