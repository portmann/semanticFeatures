Target In Great Position Entering Holiday Shopping Season - Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (433 clicks) Target's online prices were 25% more expensive than Wal-Mart's, which were only 1% higher than Amazon's during the BTS season. The creation of a more price-attractive consumer environment should result in increased 24 year old and under shoppers at Target. The company has an opportunity to widen its economic moat via designer collaborations. Target (NYSE: TGT ) unveiled a new price-matching policy today, which includes price-matching both online and in-store. This is part of Target's greater initiative to compete with the convenience and price advantages offered by competitors Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), both of whom are included in Target's new price-matching, which is set to launch on October 1. We believe this price-matching initiative is a necessary move for Target, and a step in the right direction. According to Profitero , Target's online prices were 25% more expensive than Wal-Mart's, which were only 1% higher than Amazon's during the BTS season. So while Wal-Mart and Amazon e-commerce prices are competitive, they are far better than Target's online prices. As opposed to competing on price, Target instead chose to compete on shipping during the BTS season, offering free shipping and returns on all purchases regardless of size during the first two weeks of August. Both Amazon and Target offer free shipping on purchases over $25 . The new price-matching policy will couple these shipping initiatives with price initiatives to aggressively attempt to put Target's prices on par with Amazon and Wal-Mart. We believe this is critically important to influence consumer buying trends and attract more consumers both online and in-store, especially young consumers. We have previously discussed Millennial shopping trends, including that student-debt burdened Millennials in a slow wage-growth US labor economy are price-preferred shoppers. This has made Wal-Mart the most preferred general merchandise retailer among shopped age 24 and younger. Despite being 25% more expensive, Target is still more preferred than Wal-Mart among the 25-34 and 35-44 demographic, and has continued to post impressive comps numbers both online and in-store. The creation of a more price-attractive consumer environment should result in increased 24 years old and under shoppers at Target, and this coupled with already strong growth among older demographics set the stage for a successful Holiday sales season for Target. Target might also be able to benefit from following a Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) type business model, featuring exclusive content and widening its economic moat in hopes of creating sustainable competitive advantages. According to a Motley Fool piece , Target has found much success with its designer partnerships and signature categories. Amazon has made aggressive moves in the fashion space, as it owns Zappos.com and Shopbop, so fighting low Amazon fashion prices should be an initiative for Target. Through offering exclusive products, Target widens its economic moat and could create a more loyal customer base. These designer collaborations are typically consumer designer merchandise offered at a significant discount, so they are generally popular but still offer great margins. These products are also not subject to margin compression from the price-matching policy as there are no comparables from which to price-match. Much like Netflix, the success of Target's gradual shifts to "exclusive content" rely heavily on what the content is and how it resonates with consumers. We do believe, though, that Target does have potential herein to substantially widen its economic moat. On top of all this, the US consumer spending economy is strong despite a stumbling equities market. Real PCE posted a 0.4% M/M gain in August 2015 , while Real DPI posted a 0.3% M/M gain. Real PCE growth has been north of 3% throughout 2015. Consumer confidence came in 7 points above the consensus estimate at 103. Economic indicators hint at immediate strength in consumer spending. The timing of the price-matching policy heading into the Holiday season is ideal, and coupled with competitive shipping prices, creates a price-attractive consumer environment both in-store and online. The US consumer economy is strong and growing, and the company does have an opportunity to widen its economic moat via designer collaborations. We believe there are several signals that indicate Target is perfectly positioned heading into the Holiday season, and we expect strong sales this winter from Target.
