Microsoft: Nothing Special About Christmas - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's current revenue sources and growth are in enterprise, not consumer products, despite many investors' belief that MSFT performs differently during the shopping season. Microsoft's statistical analysis shows no differences around Christmas time. I am often asked how certain stocks will perform during certain times, such as after earnings reports, product releases, or holidays. Recently, I was asked how Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) performs during the Christmas season. And therein lies the first note of interest: MSFT is not a consumer stock. As I've stated before, Windows releases matter not for MSFT . Earnings reports after Windows releases don't move the stock price. It's unlikely that other consumer products - which are the focus of Christmas time - do as well, as you'll later see from the results of my backtest. Many MSFT investors and many more outspoken Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fans like to compare MSFT's consumer products to those of AAPL or Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). I believe this is a bit of a mistake because it wrongly assumes that MSFT finds much of its revenue from the consumer sector, which is simply incorrect. In fact, MSFT generates most of its revenue from enterprise, not Windows or consumer products. This makes companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) better comparisons than AAPL. On the enterprise field, MSFT is competing with these companies in two primary areas: Cloud services/platforms and apps. Let's talk about MSFT's main app first: Office 365. This is a business app that directly competes with Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Apps. Office 365 has already overtaken Google Apps in revenue ($2.821 billion vs. $1.4 billion) and is on the road to overtaking Salesforce. Microsoft's Office 365 has the same security tools of Google Apps and is gaining popularity in companies as the tech departments move their Outlook email to the cloud. Then there's cloud revenue. Amazon is the clear leader with their Amazon Web Services, which is still growing. Microsoft has decided to compete with AWS with a cloud platform under the name of Azure. Azure currently generates $1.58 billion in revenue for MSFT. This is double what IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and ORCL generate from their cloud platforms. Azure can arguably outpace AWS in growth due to it having the Windows operating system on its side. Azure provides many backend services for Windows 10 users, including cloud backup, enterprise monitoring, and statistical data analysis that links with Office 365. As more computers upgrade to Windows 10, Azure will inevitable gain market share over AWS - inevitably because Azure will be the default, much like Windows is the default operating system for most users. MSFT's CEO is predicting $20 billion in cloud revenue in the next two years, which would indicate a growth of nearly 1300%. This would equate to a revenue triple of what AWS is currently earning. Obviously, with this type of growth, the stock will follow. Though MSFT is trading at over $50, investors now are faced with an opportunity to get on the "ground floor" of what virtually constitutes a new company. Right now, Office and Office 365 remain MSFT's largest revenue sources, with Azure quickly gaining. So keep that in mind moving forward. AAPL is not a direct competitor in this respect: So please let's not make the comments section of this article another AAPL vs. MSFT debate. The takeaway here should be that MSFT's stock price is only slightly based on its consumer segment. And I now show that with a study. In response to the reader who asked me to predict MSFT's stock price movements over Christmas, I have little to say. I ran a statistical study and, truthfully, the results of the study are insignificant, meaning that no significant results were found for the recent decade. In short, I ran a statistical analysis on whether the stock price showed significant changes the time around Christmas. Looking one month forward and back from Christmas, I found the price to move no different than the two-month average movement of MSFT. Thus, we must conclude to not reject the null hypothesis that MSFT performs differently around Christmas. To get a visual idea of whether the stock is affected by Christmas seasonality, I ran a backtest that compares a buy-and-hold MSFT portfolio to one that removes MSFT during the Christmas season. While in the far past - the late 1990s to 2008, MSFT performed well during the Christmas season, and dropping MSFT during this time would have hurt your portfolio. Then, briefly in the early 2010s, MSFT underperformed during the Christmas season. But now, MSFT shows a rather flat trend during Christmas. In fact, the above description applies for the general market, as well, meaning that you should not include seasonality in your MSFT buying plan: Sometimes, the stock price might not show seasonality, while the earnings do. I took a look at the quarterly earnings to see if Q4 earnings were especially high. While Q4 earnings tend to do well, they do not consistently outperform the other earnings - which is something Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) does, for example: So, while MSFT seems to do well during the Christmas season in earnings, that's not immediately reflected in the stock price. It could be that MSFT experiences an upward correction when it releases its Q4 earnings report - I have yet to look. But my results overall show that Christmas season is not a special time to buy MSFT. That said, MSFT does currently look to be on the rise, especially in its free cash flow: Just as in my previous article on MSFT, this is one of those stocks that seems to defy seasonality. Though Christmas is certainly not a bad time to buy MSFT stock, do not feel the need to rush out and buy MSFT because of a misconception that they will do especially well with their consumer product line. As previously stated, MSFT's main revenue source is enterprise, not consumer products. Overall, MSFT is a stock that has strong FCF growth, an undervalued price as per the discounted cash flow model, and - most importantly - strong industry prospects, particularly in its cloud platform, AZURE. MSFT is a strong long-term buy-and-hold stock from this perspective. My two studies have shown that MSFT, unlike AAPL ( on which I performed similar studies , showing strong seasonality effects that investors can use to gain more shares at a lower price), is a decent stock to buy at any time. If you're using dollar cost averaging, don't bother trying to time the market - just buy! If you're interested in seeing some tweaks to this strategy, ask me in the comments section or via mail.
