But now, Goldman has realized the errors of its ways and – in a research note entitled “Righting a Wrong” – is telling Microsoft hoping that, Hello, it’s Goldman and asking if after all these years Microsoft would like to meet to go over everything. We downgraded Microsoft to Sell on April 11, 2013, on the premise that Microsoft facedÂ critical secular challenges given the deteriorating PC demand backdrop and our view thatÂ consensus earnings estimates were too high. Since that time, consensus estimates forÂ FY14-16 have compressed 14-20%, but Microsoftâ€™s NTM P/E multiple increased 104%.Â Therefore since our downgrade, shares have increased +84% versus the S&P +29%. They say that transitioning to the cloud is supposed to heal you, and Microsoft has done some healing. Despite out year estimates consistently compressing, we failed to appreciate that the stock would disconnect from downward EPS revisions, and the significant upward rerating of the multiple driven by MSFTâ€™s transition to the cloud (Office 365 and Azure). We were wrong. Goldman analysts must have forgotten how it felt before the world fell at their feet. We are increasing our out year non-GAAP EPS estimates, driven primarilyÂ by faster gross margin expansion in Office 365 and Azure. While we stillÂ believe EPS consensus for FY17 and FY18 are too high, given the ongoingÂ successful transition to the cloud we do not see the multiple coming underÂ pressure. As such, we believe a Neutral rating is more appropriate.Â  So Goldman is calling out from the other side, to tell Microsoft that it’s sorry for breaking its stock. We are raising our 12-month price target from $45 to $57 (equal weightedÂ DCF, P/E, EV/FCF) due to higher out year estimates, better visibility into theÂ cloud businesses and the expectation of continued solid execution. At ~$55,Â MSFT trades at 20x our CY16E EPS of $2.77 (consensus $2.94). But before the guys at 200 West Street ask the folks at Microsoft if they everÂ made it out of that town where nothing ever happened, they should know that Microsoft is still based in Seattle.

Everything has to be manually configured at veriizon by verizon engineers, the thing goes down, and the pricing model is inconsistent. Microsoft's cloud is surprisingly good but…. Amazon's cloud is amazing. We use that for 90% or better of our needs. Pricing is consistent, support is great, thing scales like crazy. No one is going to touch Amazon as they just keep puling away from the pack.
