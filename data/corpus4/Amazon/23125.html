Amazon Web Services May Not Be Profitable - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Since its inception, Amazon Web Services has grown to be the world's largest cloud infrastructure provider. Its aggressive approach to pricing and scaling has driven huge revenue growth. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was one of the earlier entrants in the cloud computing space, which has allowed the company to gain some considerable sway in the industry. In fact, the company was partly responsible for popularizing the term, after introducing the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006, and is by now the world's largest cloud infrastructure provider by a considerable margin. Although like other cloud computing competitors it is growing revenue quickly, the company may not be earning any money off these services, according to Citi estimates, which is problematic for a company struggling to consistently get the bottom line into positive territory. Getting into the cloud computing space was a logical move for Amazon, whose engineers had acquired years of experience in designing flexible, easily scalable online infrastructure and software for its own sprawling e-commerce platform. As demand grew for low-cost, reliable infrastructure among businesses, offering this platform to others became an enticing proposition. Amazon made its entry into the cloud computing space in 2006 with the launch of EC2, an online service that provides easily scalable access to Amazon's computing capacity, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), which provides flexible data storage infrastructure. Both of these were largely geared toward developers and both quickly garnered a sizable following after their introduction. The rapid growth of Amazon Web Services was in part due to its aggressive approach to acquiring market share, according to its originator Chris Pinkham. This involved on the one hand scaling up its offerings very quickly, and on the other hand settling for very low margins as a means of undercutting the competition. Indeed, Amazon's guns-blazing approach to cloud computing paid off in terms of revenue growth and market share. Although judging growth over the last few years is a hazy business due to the fact that Amazon has not yet broken out Web Services in earnings reports, estimates are fairly spectacular. By 2013, AWS is estimated to have hit $3.1 billion in revenue. This figure is expected to have hit around $4.6 billion last year. AWS is now the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure by orders of magnitude. In 2014, AWS hit a worldwide combined IaaS, PaaS, Private and Hybrid market share of 28%, dwarfing runners up like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) which posted 10% and 7%, respectively. It is in fact one of the fastest-growing software services in history. This year, it is expected to hit $6.6 billion revenue, and by 2016 this figure is expected to rise to a whopping $9.2 billion, according to Citi estimates. However, this spectacular growth comes at a price - Amazon Web Services may not yet be profitable. According to Citi's estimates , AWS lost $123 million in 2014 and by 2016 will earn only $69 million. It bases these estimates on the company's prior comments as well as figures from competitors. The strategy of gaining market share at the expense of margins and profit is well-known to Amazon. So familiar, in fact, that the company routinely posts quarterly losses, with two in fiscal 2014 alone. This has not stopped the company's stock from rising as optimistic investors believe that its massive revenue growth and market share make up for its choppy bottom line. Indeed, many believe that AWS is headed on the right path. At some point, however, profits will start to matter. Amazon will break out AWS' results when it reports Q1 2015 toward the end of the month, and many cloud industry watchers will be extremely interested in how much money Web Services is actually making for the sprawling internet company. However, judging by Citi estimates, it is not yet likely that Web Services is the profit cash cow that investors will be hoping for. Amazon Web Services was one of the first major cloud infrastructure providers, and it is currently the biggest by a sizable margin. The company's aggressive approach in garnering market share has led to spectacular revenue growth. However, its slim margins aimed at undercutting the competition mean that AWS may not yet be profitable, at least according to Citi estimates. With the first break-out of AWS results due toward the end of the month, analysts and investors alike will be very curious to see how this cloud giant is actually performing.
