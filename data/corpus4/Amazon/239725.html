The 8 Things That Are Always Cheaper at Target There is no arguing the fact that Target has a very loyal following among many shoppers. While they might not always have the lowest prices, they certainly attract consumers who'll happily pay a little extra to avoid the crowded aisles of other discounters. But there are certain items which are almost always cheaper at Target compared to other retailers. Here are eight such items that'll save you money on your next Target shopping trip. (See also: The Best Store Credit Card: Target REDcard ) Not only has Target led the natural cleaning trend over the past few years, but they often do it at a price lower than the competition. For example, Target sells the 28oz bottle of Method All-Surface Cleaner for† an affordable $2.99 , while Walmart sells the same product† for $5.49 and Amazon sells it† for $8.00 . Another great example is Green Works laundry detergent in the 90oz size; at Target† you'll pay $11.99 , while† you'll pay $23.27 at Walmart, and† $19.21 at Amazon . You'll also find similar savings at Target on other popular natural cleaning brands, like J.R. Watkins, Honest, and Seventh Generation. When buying bedding for your child's room, your wallet will likely benefit greatly from shopping at Target. You'll find steep savings on sheet and comforter sets, throw blankets, and even decorative pillows. This is especially true when buying "character" bedding from Star Wars, Disney, and Sesame Street. For example, you can purchase the popular Star Wars Classic Twin Sheet Set from Target† for $19.79 , while you'll have to pay† $26.07 on Amazon . If you're shopping for a girl, you'll also save at Target, as you can buy the four-piece Disney Frozen bed set† for $31.49 where you'll have to pay† $36.97 at Walmart . When compared to the competition, Target is a great place to shop for picture frames and save money. While they easily beat the price at specialty stores like Michaels and Jo-Ann Fabric, they surprisingly also undercut the likes of Walmart and Amazon. For example, at Target you can buy 8x10 inch frames (set of two† for $13.99 , while you'll have to pay† $19.97 at Walmart and† $18.99 at Amazon . The savings you'll find at Target aren't limited to the popular 8x10 size ó it's seen across all picture frame sizes and designs. Plus, they often have coupons available via their† Cartwheel app on home items and d√©cor that will bring the price down even further. Target is where you'll get the most bang for your buck when buying cosmetics and makeup. While prices are generally better at Target when compared to Amazon, Walmart, and Macy's, the real savings comes in the gift card deals they offer. A current example is a free $5 Target gift card when you buy three L'Oreal products. When the gift card is factored into the price, Target easily beats the competition. Other examples include a free $5 Target gift card with the purchase of three Aveeno items, and buy one, get one for 50% off with all fragrances. Also, be sure to always check for† printable Target coupons before you visit to ensure you get the lowest price on beauty items. Brands like Graco, Britax, and Evenflo are often cheapest at Target. For example, Target currently sells the Graco Pack 'N Play Playard† for $59.99 (color: Pasadena), while the cheapest color currently on† Amazon is $69.97 . The same can be said for the Evenflo High-Back Booster seat; you'll find it† for $33.99 at Target and have to pay† $39.98 at Amazon ,† $35.98 at Walmart , and† $39.99 at Babies R Us . It's always a smart idea to check pricing at Target before buying baby products, as you'll often find the lowest price. Target is a great place to save money on deodorant and anti-perspirant for men. For example, Target sells the two-pack of men's Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant† for $3.97 , while Walmart sells the† same product for $5.97 . Also, you can find a two-pack of Axe Phoenix Anti-Perspirant at† Target for $6.29 , compared to† $7.37 at Walmart . I found similar savings on other popular brands like Gillette, Degree, and Dove Men's Care as well. For whatever reason, women's deodorant is cheaper across the board at Walmart and Amazon. But if you're a guy, or buying for one, purchase from Target and take advantage of the lower prices. This one might seem a bit random, but kitchen trash bags ó the tall variety ó are 25% cheaper at Target compared to Walmart. Specifically, I'm talking about the store brand at each store. At Target, you can get the Up & Up brand in a 110 count box† for $9.99 , while you'll pay $12.52 for a box of only 100 bags of the† Walmart brand . Both bags received strong customer reviews, making the Target brand a solid buy. Because of the† exclusive discounts they offer , wedding registry gifts are simply cheaper at Target. If the wedding couple registered at several stores, and Target is one of them, always choose to shop with them and you'll save. For example, they currently have a discount code (WEDDING20) that is good for 20% off your $100 or more regular-priced wedding registry gift. So if you're buying the couple the KitchenAid Mixer they registered for, you'll only pay $200 instead of $250 ó a price that beats all of the major competition. By the way, having been married for 15 years, I can honestly say that this mixer is the only gift we received that we still use today. It clearly falls under the category of quality items worth the price . By knowing the items at Target that provide the most savings, you can plan your next trip accordingly and save money. Also, it's worth noting that most of the products listed above provide the same savings in-store as they do online. Happy savings.
