Netflix: The Bear Thesis Is A House Of Cards - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Recent articles have been published presenting bearish views on Netflix. I believe the bear thesis has significant holes. A recent Seeking Alpha article laid out a detailed bear case on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), based on technical analysis, increasing competition, a high P/E and issues with the balance sheet. These bear cases have been a recurring theme on Netflix (three other SA articles have been written centered around the same issues in the last two weeks alone - link 1 , link 2 , link 3 ), however I believe they are missing the truth behind this company. While I do not use technical analysis to evaluate stocks, I have looked at the other issues these articles point to as problematic going forward, and have come to a different conclusion on these points. First, using the P/E ratio or free cash flow to evaluate a company like NFLX is misleading. Next, the streaming obligations & long-term debt at NFLX is very manageable, even if subscriber growth begins to slow in the US. Furthermore, the concern that the above articles state about competition entering the space is overblown. Streaming is not a zero-sum game, and consumers will choose multiple streaming options going forward. Thus, viewing Netflix as an "either-or" consumer option is a fallacy, and it is unlikely that Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime, Hulu or Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) Vudu will actually steal subscribers from Netflix. Finally, the concern of bears that subscriber growth will slowd domestically misses two key points. First, the international segment is just beginning to grow. Second, the Netflix brand now has pricing power that can help juice its domestic segment when subscriber growth slows there. The articles linked above make the case that Netflix's PE points toward a company that is significantly overvalued and that deteriorating free cash flow are signs that the company cannot handle its increasing debt load. I disagree with both of these points. While both the trailing and forward PE of Netflix are quite high, using this metric is the wrong way to value NFLX, or any aggressive growth company. Netflix is in a rapid growth phase, and it is better in this phase that the company is using revenue to reinvest in the business. Thus, it should be expected that earnings and free cash flow are weak. This is going to continue well into the future, as NFLX needs to continue expanding internationally and keeping a strong content library available for consumers. Investors need to focus on other metrics to value NFLX. Simply by looking at Yahoo! Finance , you can find some metrics that are more important for evaluating a rapid growth company such as NFLX. First, the PS of NFLX is 4.55. This is a fairly high PS if compared to more mature companies, but compared to high-growth companies in today's market, it is far from an outrageous number. Revenue itself is growing fast, and has consistently grown over 20% annually for a few years. The company also shows an ROE of 16.72%, showing that it is investing their cash effectively. These metrics show that Netflix has revenue and growth to back up its current valuation, and that Netflix is reinvesting potential earnings back into the business effectively. The above articles, and many bear theses, mention the huge debt load and off-balance sheet debt that Netflix has to deal with. These concerns are overblown. Even without subscriber growth, Netflix can handle these obligations with no problem. The following charts are taken from Netflix's most recently filed 10K . The first chart shows the contractual obligations, including both on and off-balance sheet debt, that Netflix currently has. It can be seen as a more accurate way to view Netflix's both short and long-term debt load. The second chart shows the end of year domestic subscriber segment information for Netflix, including all relevant subscriber data. Keep in mind that the "cost of revenue" discussed in the domestic subscriber chart refers mainly to content costs. So, what can we take from these charts? Namely, that the current cash on the balance sheet (reported in the above linked 10K as $1.6 Billion), coupled with the current domestic subscriber revenue of $3.431 Billion, is more than enough to cover all the debt on the balance sheet for 2015. This is disregarding all other source of revenue (international streaming and what's left of the DVD business), and any possible growth in subscribers. Thus, even under the worst-case scenario debt is not going to destroy NFLX. Long term, I believe investors can have faith that the way Netflix is structuring its content and licensing deals is going to continue to ensure that the debt is spread out over a long enough period that the company can handle the payments. The large long-term debt number is unlikely to ever go away, however if investors do their own due diligence and view these numbers in the 10K I believe it will be clear that the company is more than capable of handling its debt load (or, in the future, that they are in fact not capable). Another concern is that streaming costs will continuously rise and destroy Netflix. This discredits the intelligence of the content providers who are selling their content to Netflix and doesn't consider the fact that Netflix has some bargaining power at the table now. Netflix has now become an integral revenue source for content providers, allowing them to monetize content in a new and lucrative way. Furthermore, Netflix's massive and growing subscriber numbers means it has the consumer on its side in negotiations. Providers can try to sell their content to other streaming services, but they are unlikely to get the same amount of money or eyeballs that they can get from Netflix. Content providers need Netflix as much as Netflix needs them, and therefore I believe that the content providers will work together with Netflix to limit the streaming costs as time goes on. Another major point in the above-linked articles is that Netflix will eventually lose market share or be destroyed completely by competition. Indeed, the articles point to HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Vudu and Hulu as potentially damaging to the future of Netflix. This is completely inaccurate because it assumes that consumers will only choose one streaming service, and thus the rest of the companies involved will lose market share. However, streaming is not a zero-sum game. The variety and original content available throughout these services are complimentary to each other for consumers. I personally have and use all of these services on a regular basis. The ever expanding selection of streaming services are really what have the potential to hurt traditional cable and satellite companies, in my opinion. With the rollout of HBO as a standalone service, consumers can now watch new episodes via Hulu, catch up on older seasons or shows via Amazon Prime and Netflix and enjoy great original programming on Netflix, Prime and HBO. Honestly, the only thing that is now exclusive to cable and satellite is sports. However, many sports organizations are already relying on streaming services to generate revenue and viewership. The NBA and NHL are two notable examples of leagues which have integrated stand alone streaming services as options for consumers to watch games. If these trends continue, it will be easier for consumers to cut the cord. The expansion of streaming services is more likely to cause the entire industry to switch to a-la-carte programming, in which consumers pick and choose what channels or services they want to subscribe to, then it is to cause the downfall of NFLX's business. In this scenario, the massive content library and low price of Netflix will make it an easy choice for consumers. Indeed, it is clear that Netflix realizes this, and it views itself as the leader in the internet TV revolution- accompanied by, not competing against, those streaming services that bearish analysts believe could threaten Netflix. Another large facet of the bear case is that eventually subscriber growth will slow down, and force NFLX shares into an extremely large correction. This is likely already happening in the US, however international growth is really just starting to ramp up. International subscriber growth should continue to give NFLX huge increases in subscribers, and thus revenues, for a long time. While the bears point to the fact that NFLX is catching up to HBO domestically, and say that it means further slowdown in subscriber comps is likely, internationally NFLX is nowhere near the number of subscribers HBO has. Thus, using the same bear logic of NFLX's growth trajectory mirroring HBO's, as long as NFLX can execute overseas it will be able to add a significant number of subscribers for years to come. However, even if subscriber growth starts to slow down in any one marketplace, it does not necessarily mean that NFLX is screwed. The bear case does not factor in the inherent pricing power that Netflix now has. Many point to 2011 and view an increase in price as impossible, but it has been a long time since the pricing debacle in 2011. Since then, Netflix has established itself in the minds of consumers and enjoys enormous brand power. It is undoubtedly the leader in the streaming space, by a wide margin, and it is rapidly becoming irreplaceable to consumers. NFLX is far and away the most well-known, highly regarded streaming service available. Many Amazon Prime subscribers don't even know about or use the streaming service. Hulu suffers from problems with using advertising that makes it less appealing to consumers, and it loses value because many shows do not keep older episodes. Netflix also has the best platform between the three, and honestly it's not even close. Netflix has derived a moat by being the best product, with the largest content library, and it is the only service that has become synonymous with streaming. This brand power gives the company pricing power that will eventually help it improve profit margins through price increases in the future. HBO's standalone service is the only competitor that has anywhere near the brand awareness as Netflix, and I think the fact that it is priced at $14.99 speaks to Netflix's pricing power. Netflix is much more engrained in consumers now than it was in 2011. If management can learn from their past mistakes, they will be able to roll out a price increase much more successfully in the future, and this will absolutely crush the bear thesis. Concerns over FCF, Earnings, and all the huge debt issues would almost immediately disappear if NFLX can use their pricing power to parlay a 20-30% price increase into a 20-30% revenue increase almost overnight. Concerns that slowing domestic subscriber growth will slow revenue will be unfounded, and the international expansion would still be continuing. On the flipside, if management can't successfully increase prices, then many of the common issues that bears point to are likely to be seriously magnified, and I would view the long-term investment thesis as broken. At the end of the day, Netflix is a highly volatile growth stock. It is not the place that investors looking for safe returns should be putting money. However, it is sitting on a huge market opportunity and if it continues to grow it could deliver triple digit gains over the next decade. Investors willing to accept short-term risk and volatility will be rewarded with wonderful gains in the long term. Although not personally invested in the company at this moment, I keep it on my watch list and consider it a viable investment so long as it matches your risk profile as an investor. For short sellers, I would not come near this stock. For the reasons I outlined above, much of the bear thesis is flawed. Even if bears are right about this company, it will likely take years to play out and require excellent timing, or the ability to withstand serious pain, to profit. Just as there are more conservative investments available for those who can't handle the volatility or risk profile of an aggressive growth company like Netflix, I believe that there are many better short opportunities than targeting an enormously popular and rapidly expanding brand with strong management at the helm like Netflix.
