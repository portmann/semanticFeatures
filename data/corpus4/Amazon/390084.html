Ask the Readers: How Do You Host Budget-Friendly Parties? Spring and summer are popular times for partying, especially the outdoor kind! But parties can be a lot of work if you're hosting. Food and drinks, supplies, decorations and entertainment -- you'll need to take care of all these things (or delegate the work to someone else and make sure they take care of it). It can also cost you a pretty penny if you need to buy things for your party. How do you host budget-friendly parties? What aspects of a party do you usually make yourself (food? decorations?) and what do you usually end up buying from a store? Do you ask your guests to contribute in any way?
