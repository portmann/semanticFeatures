While the US economy may have unofficially entered an industrial recession in recent months with the dip in the manufacturing ISM below the critical 50 level, one sector has continued to do surprisingly well: automotive manufacturing, as a result of vibrant car sales. The reason for this, as we have repeatedly demonstrated , has been the record surge in auto loans, which have long surpassed both total credit card debt (and the $1 trillion mark), and continue to fund an unprecedented auto buying spree as they rush to catch up to the $1.2 trillion in total student loans. Furthermore, recent Experian data confirms what most have known: the only reason auto sales are as strong as they are is because for the second time in under a decade, there is a substantial car loan bubble. As noted pbefore, here are some of its key characteristics : Average loan term for used cars is now 62 months — a record. Loans with terms from 74 to 84 months made up 30%  of all new vehicle financing — a record. Loans with terms from 74 to 84 months made up 16% of all used vehicle financing — a record. The average amount financed for a new vehicle was $28,711 — a record. The average payment for new vehicles was $488 — a record. Still, despite persistently record easy credit terms, the final days of the car loan bubble appear to be at hand: with US auto inventories already at their highest levels relative to sales since 2009 - suggesting US consumers can hardly absorb any incremental auto production - all it would take to pop the bubble, is a small exogenous event: like a rate hike by the Fed. But while the car loan bubble has been extensively documented there is another mode of transportation where the bubble in prices may have easily eclipsed anything seen in the auto space, and which, pardon the pun, has flown right below the radar. According to Air Transport World , Delta recently signed a letter of intent to buy a used Boeing 777 for $7.7 million, according to CEO Richard Anderson. The Delta CEO raised some eyebrows in October when he said there was a “huge bubble?? in used widebody aircraft, pricing a 10-year-old 777-200 at $10 million. Anderson said that the market would be “ripe?? for Delta to buy used 777s. To be sure, Boeing president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg was among those who pushed back against Anderson, saying the Delta CEO was valuing used 777’s much too low. It wasn't. Although, as it turns out, Anderson was indeed wrong when he said used 777s were on the market for $10 million. "It was actually $7.7 million. We just signed a letter of intent to buy one.?? Anderson’s comments came during Delta’s investor day and, for added emphasis, were posted on Twitter by Delta. Just as happened when Anderson made the original remark about used 777 values, Boeing’s stock price immediately dropped. CEO: I was wrong when I said used 777s were on market for $10M. It was actually $7.7M. We just signed a letter of intent to buy one. — Delta News Hub (@DeltaNewsHub) December 17, 2015 Here is the punchline: Boeing’s list price for a new 777-200ER is $277.3 million, meaning Delta is buying a used 777 at a price 97.2% lower than the value of a new 777. Delta did not give details on the 777 for which it signed the LOI, such as who the seller is and which airline previously operated the aircraft. This stunning "price discovery" leaves a few key questions wide open: Was this just a one off transaction in which Delta found a very "motivated" seller and took advantage of what was beyond a firesale price? If so, who was the seller and why liquidate in such a hurry? Alternatively, if this deal is indicative of prevailing "used plane" market prices, and judging by Anderson's comment one can find more 777-200ERs for the low price of $10 million, this means that either the market for new plane widebody airplanes is indeed an unprecedented bubble funded by such government vehicles as the Ex-Im bank, or the used plane market is a ticking time bomb for all those billions in EETFs and various aircraft-backed pass through securities which are collateralized by planes such as the the Boeing 777. It explains the stink Boeing made when Ex-Im bank's charter was temporarily revoked by Congress. At the micro level, if new plane prices are just a "huge bubble" as the Delta CEO alleges, that means that the valuation of Boeing is about as "credible" and sustainable as that of New Century just a few days before the subprime bubble burst. Finally, if there is such a dramatic cliff between new and used airplanes, what does that mean for bank amortization assumptions on billions in airplane inventory which is still carried by banks on their books, and just how massive would be the valuation deficit once loans collateralized by airplane "assets" are marked to market. Granted, while it is becoming increasingly difficult to track all of the bubbles and capital misallocations that have resulted from 7 years of ZIRP, NIRP and QE, we hope to present readers with some answers to these questions ideally before the serial, or parallel, and long overdue bursting of said bubbles takes place.

Add a new interior with in-seat entertainment, upgraded avionics and equipment and suddenly this 'cheap' aircraft is cheap for a reason. I can show you a five year old Camry that goes for less than $3,000....which is $18,000 off the list price of a new one. It only has 250,000 miles on the odometer and has been in two accidents. Instead of a little old lady as the owner it is a traveling salesman. Sun, 12/27/2015 - 17:13 | 6967920 monk27 Still, even if a lot of work is needed to make that plane ready, you still end up getting it for less than a quarter of his price. That's very un-bulish for certain stocks (starting with A and B)... Sun, 12/27/2015 - 15:50 | 6967644 JustObserving With oil prices at such lows, one would expect more air travel and higher plane prices.  How can planes be getting so cheap?

Since the 'war on terror' and all the airport bullshit to remind me i am jusg a tax chattel /surf i avoid it at all costs. often manage to go years at a time without commercial air travel. i only nedd it if travelling outside europe / scandinavia. We are on the downwave from peak airlines! its a business with no pricing power on many routes.  Sun, 12/27/2015 - 17:10 | 6967900 sun tzu People need disposable income in order to take vacations.

Sun, 12/27/2015 - 16:06 | 6967700 Socratic Dog I had the same thought.  But if the price is being sustained by an auto-loan bubble, new and used, when that bubble pops cash will be king, and you and me are going to be riding in style.

Sun, 12/27/2015 - 16:00 | 6967683 conspicio Would've been great to see some auto price inflation charts as an auto listing new for $40K 10 years ago is now $60K+ in many cases. The average consumer is a monthly payment buyer or lessor and has little (as in none) clue about residual values or depreciation. Buying an $80K Escalade and financing for 72 months is a poor consumer decision and a socially pressured one. The economy is getting better, everything is great, right??? Psyops for autos. These are truly amazing times we live in. Sun, 12/27/2015 - 16:02 | 6967689 commie Yes, yes, we know from ZH how fucked up is the US economy, but what of Russia.

Sun, 12/27/2015 - 16:54 | 6967834 gregga777 During deep recessions reletively new narrow-body and wide-body passenger jet and large cargo jet pricing typically becomes greatly depressed because of a supply glut and lack of demand.  This bargain basement priced 777 could be a leading indicator that we are entering a deep recession. Sun, 12/27/2015 - 17:08 | 6967891 Oldrepublic Specialist aircraft trade publications indicate that the cost of the 777er  would be around 115 million in the year 2000. Apparently airlines like Emirates, Singapore and China Southern are getting rid of older aircraft and upgrading to new models. Seems cost of reconfiguration would run between 10-15 million per plane. So this is another indication of the rise of Asia and the decline of the US, when US carriers buy second hand from Asian carriers. Any ZH reader who has traveled internationally in recent years will note the very poor condition of US aircraft versus those of the Middle East and Asia.
