Why Leasing A Smartphone is a Dumb Move - Frugal Rules Posted on November 16, 2015 by John Schmoll in Frugal Living , Money Management Iâ€™ve written in the past about how we used to enslave tether ourselves to Verizon each month. At nearly $170 per month in payments we were hemorrhaging cash we couldâ€™ve put to far better use. We were like countless others who thought getting the latest iPhone (for my wife at least. Iâ€™m an Android guy) for just $199.99 was a great deal. The phone itself sells for something like $600 or $700 so thatâ€™s got to be a deal â€“ right? In one of the many hand palm moments of my life Â I failed to look at the fact we were really just agreeing to finance our phones over the course of two years. Many of the big players in the space are killing two-year contracts. Thatâ€™s great to seeâ€¦on one hand. On the other hand, itâ€™s not because they are still accomplishing the same thing in a different way â€“ through leasing. Leasing a smartphone has replaced the two-year contract in some instances and in nearly every circumstance thatâ€™s going to continue to cost you in the long run. Verizon, AT&T, Apple â€“ you name it, they know what we want. They know we love technology and we want new technology yesterday. Smartphones are no different. I like me a good smartphone. Who doesnâ€™t? A Consumer Intelligence Research Partners survey revealed that 94 million iPhones were in use in the U.S. as of March 2015, so I know Iâ€™m not alone. I love that I can be virtually anywhere and do pretty much anything I want. To say a smartphone is a phone is a bit of an oxymoron really. Think Iâ€™m wrong? Ask yourself how much time you spend talking on said smartphone. If youâ€™re like me, itâ€™s very little. Rather, itâ€™s a mini-computer in the palm of your hands. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d live without one, especially with our business and the sites I run. Anyway, the big boys count on us not doing simple math when we go to make purchasing decisions. When we give up the simple math, we guarantee ourselves being on the losing end. Itâ€™s just that simple. That being said, letâ€™s take a look at what leasing a smartphone from Verizon will really cost you in the long run. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re an iPhone fan and want the latest and greatest model. Below are the costs for Verizonâ€™s mid-level plan: iPhone – $649.99, but you lease it for 24 months. This comes to $27.08 per month. 3GB data with unlimited talk and text – $45 per month Right now youâ€™re at $72.08 per month â€“ before tax. If you live in a high tax state like Nebraska (our cell taxes are nearly 20% per month) youâ€™ll be paying $86.50 per month. It doesnâ€™t stop there. What happens if you dent or lose your phone? Youâ€™re on the hook (not Verizon) to cover that cost. So, you decide youâ€™d rather not carry that risk and want the insurance coverage. That adds another $11 to the equation, bringing you to $97.50 per month. Over the course of two years, that comes out to $2,340. The traditional carriers also promote the â€œflexibilityâ€? of these plans. So, if a new iPhone is released a year after you get your phone you have the â€œflexibilityâ€? to upgrade to that new phone. However, you must pay off the original phone or trade it in (assuming itâ€™s in good working order) and start another cycle of monthly payments. That doesnâ€™t sound like flexibility to me; it sounds like a never-ending treadmill of paymentsâ€¦for a phone! It truly is the payment mentality Â at itâ€™s finest. There is one main reason behind the moves by the major carriers. Itâ€™s the no-contract movement started by the likes of Republic Wireless, Straight Talk Â and others. They have brought true flexibility, which is better for consumers. How does a plan at Republic Wireless compare to the $2,340 at Verizon above? Quite well in my opinion. Letâ€™s say you want the top of the line phone Republic Wireless offers â€“ the Moto X, second generation. That runs $249 currently. The highest plan Republic Wireless offers is 3GB, which runs $55 per month. Over the course of two years that would amount to $1,569 or a savings of $771. Thatâ€™s good, but you can do far better. If youâ€™re on WiFi most of the time, like we are then you can get their base plan at $10 per month . They also pay you back for data you donâ€™t use each month, which only sweetens the deal. In fact, the Republic Wireless site says an average bill for a user is just under $14 per month! Thatâ€™s not to say you have to choose Republic Wireless to save money by any means. There are many cheap cell phone plans Â to choose from and many of them around $30 per month. The plan we have at Cricket , for example, is $35 per month. That saves us $100 per month Â over what we were paying at Verizon. The device payment plans the big carriers offer are misleading. They donâ€™t provide flexibility. In reality, they shackle you to them in a slightly longer chain. The solution to that problem is buying your own unlocked phone to break that chain. Admittedly, this can be expensive especially when youâ€™re used to financing your phones. Donâ€™t let the sticker price scare you. You will still save good money in the long-run by going this route vs. leasing a smartphone. You can buy unlocked cell phones at Amazon , Ebay and many other places. This gives you the control, not the carrier, to come and go when you want and not have to worry about making a monthly payment for a smartphone, which is true flexibility. How much do you pay for your monthly cell bill? Why do you think so many of us fail to do simple math when thinking through things like a cell phone? Is having new technology all the time worth the added expense? I'm the founder of Frugal Rules, a Dad, husband and veteran of the financial services industry.

If you have to lease it, that should tell you it’s too expensive! I’m not so sure I agree with that last paragraph. When I was comparing plans in 2014 I noticed that even if I purchased my phone outright, the major carriers still wanted to charge me a monthly line fee ranging from $15-$40 on top of the plan fee. It didn’t make any sense. I feel like they will do anything to get that extra money out of you no matter what you do. Perhaps it has changed since then. I sure hope so because I’m ready to find a cheaper alternative. That’s just the thing Nicole – I’m not talking about staying with a major carrier. I’m talking about going with a no-contract alternative that’s not with any of the 4 major carriers. Most of the alternatives are $30-40 per month. You can bring a phone to most of them and not get hit with a nasty fee. They can either be a new phone or a refurbished one – just so long as it works with their specific network. I really don’t understand needing to have the newest and shiniest tech. Usually something a bit older will do the same job for a fraction of the cost. We’ve been with Verizon, but are getting ready to switch to Cricket. I wish we could just keep our old phones, but we’re going with very moderately priced Androids that will be on par with the two year old models we bought last year. Good move – that’s who we moved to. You should check into if your current phones will work on their network. Both my wife’s & my old phones worked on the Cricket network so we just needed to change out the SIM cards and we were good to go. We have been with Verizon long enough that we have negotiated our monthly phone bill to about the price of Republic per user. I have frequently thought about switching but I always get concerned with the unknown transfer costs like lost connectivity and unplanned downtime. I live in an area that has poor cell coverage as it is and I would be afraid of losing anymore because of the impact it could have on my business.
