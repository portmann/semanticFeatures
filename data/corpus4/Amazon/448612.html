Will Amazon Stock Buckle Under The Weight Of Its Price To Book Ratio? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon shares are currently trading near their highest price to book ratio during the past five years. Amazon shares typically drop in the months following a relatively high P/B ratio. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shares are currently trading near their all-time highs of $728.24 per share (recorded on 6/2/2016), currently at about $725 per share, as of 11:27 AM, July 1, 2016.

With analysts' earnings estimates of $5.31 and $9.91 respectively for the years ending in Dec. 2016 and Dec. 2017, Amazon is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 136.5 and 73.16, respectively. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at a 12-month trailing P/E ratio of 298.8. Many admirers of Amazon continuously point to the fact that such numbers are less important than Amazon's revenue growth, whereby Amazon is expected to grow its revenues by 20.9% from $134.1 billion in 2016 to $162.1 billion in 2017. In its latest Q1 2016 quarter, Amazon international sales of about $9.6 billion accounted for about 32.9% of Amazon's total sales of $29.1 billion. Such international sales grew by 23.5% from the prior year. Given current macro headwinds relating to Brexit, stronger dollar and upcoming presidential U.S. elections, Amazon's international revenues growth is likely to face challenges during the next several months. Meanwhile, any spillover into US financial markets will likely reduce consumption by US consumers as well, hence presenting an additional hurdle to Amazon sales growth. Finally, although falling fuel prices have provided a boost to consumers' disposable income during the past four quarters, oil prices have stabilized during the past few months and are expected to increase, hence possibly reducing future consumer disposable income. As per the below graph, average US gas prices had dropped from as high as $2.81/gal. in June 2015 to about $1.69/gal. in February 2016, but have increased to about $2.25 during the past four months.
