Ask the Readers: How Often Do You Dine Out? Dining at a restaurant is almost always more expensive than a home-cooked meal. Most people can't afford to dine out every night, but for some, the occasional experience of having a tasty meal that you don't have to spend the time and effort to prepare is worth the extra cost.
