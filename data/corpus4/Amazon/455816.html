One Year After Surpassing Walmart, Amazon Is Now Bigger Than Berkshire | Zero Hedge by Knave Dave - Jul 10, 2016 3:50 PM Nothing is more shameless in a bedazzling sort of way than rich banksters standing on the public curb with their hands out. Such is the spectacle across Europe today as its largest banks begin to crash. by BullionStar - Jul 11, 2016 3:15 AM The Bank of England has emerged as an active subcustodian of gold bars held by the SPDR Gold Trust. This raises the possibility that GLD holds borrowed central bank gold.  by Phoenix Capital... - Jul 11, 2016 7:52 AM Despite the Bear Stearns hedge fund blow up, stocks hit a new all-time high in late 2007. They are doing the same thing today, ignoring numerous major warning signs that the business cycle is ending. Jeff Bezos has marked another milestone. Nearly one year to the day following Amazon's surpassing of Walmart's market capitalization on the heels of a great report on AWS (Amazon Web Services) growth numbers, Amazon has surpassed another American business icon's market capitalization, that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway... Notably tomorrow is Amazon Prime Day 2016 . Leaving the big question - when does Amazon rise to Apple's market cap level or will Apple fall to Amazon's market cap level? Place your bets... Boris Alatovkrap Jul 11, 2016 9:14 PM This is measurement of size of customer? If Walmart is measure sag of scooter cart chassis, what is metric for success of Amazon? Size of UPPS delivery truck? How many food delivery per day? This is scare! pretty bird Manipuflation Jul 12, 2016 1:30 AM Winston Churchhill rocks. I later met Sally by the sea. She showed me her wonderful grapes and oranges. After that, she agree to toss my salad. Her mother came and watched. I plan to take Sally's mother to the pumpkin patch. She's a lovely woman. And knows Winston Churchill.

He also has a lot of senior citizens working in non-airconditioned warehouses in the middle of summer for shit wages. If he ever has to bring his profits back to America and pay taxes like most of us have to, he might go under. Also, a change in the minimum wage law would hurt him a lot. flaminratzazz Cabreado Jul 11, 2016 9:31 PM I would rather sit here and buy a trinket from Amazon then go fight the hordes of walmart zombies and half humanoids and wind up with something that falls apart before I get it into the trunk of the car. Between bidding on things and checking amazon for suggested retail prices, I think we have a winning system. The brick and mortar are going the way of the news papers and net work television. Cabreado flaminratzazz Jul 11, 2016 9:48 PM flaminratzazz Cabreado Jul 11, 2016 9:56 PM if you are stating that the trend is the death of walmart, newspapers and network tv, then you are way wrong. I despise all three. Cabreado flaminratzazz Jul 11, 2016 11:36 PM feldgrau Cabreado Jul 11, 2016 9:47 PM How do you prep without AMZN? Although ebay is getting to be as good or better w/ prices and free shipping. As a history buff I think AMZN is great for books. amazon is great for guitar fx pedals, too. but you can do the same/similar (maybe cheaper) things at reverb.com, or ebay, among others. amazon has pretty much 'everything' though. it is a lot easier than going to a mall. but if they're earning $1 per quarter and the share price is $700, that's a p/e of 175:1. maybe that too, is the new normal... I'm sure it's gonna make every investor rich beyond his widest imagination just as those who invested in Tulips firmly hoped so back in the day.  Amazon is recapitizing it's debt to build treehouses in a dome. It's a tax deductible time out zone for unruly employees. Bet that some of those botanical rare plants won't make the urination watering. HRH of Aquitaine Jul 11, 2016 11:08 PM I don't know if anyone else has been paying attention to, or learned about, FBA.  It is wild.  There are also accusations of stealing (ideas and products) that FBA folks are trying to develop.  Who is the thief?  Amazon. Considering tomorrow is the big Prime Day, what was the Alibaba day?  Singles Day go buy yourself a present?  This rabbit hole seems to get deeper and deeper. FBA is Fulfillment by Amazon.  Crazy concept.  I don't understand how they can afford to have warehouses of used books and afford the shipping costs.  I have bought and sold used books, off and on.  The model just does not make sense to me.  Books are heavy and cost a fortune to ship / move / and warehouse.  I know, I have a library with 6-foot high bookshelves.  Don't ask me what my last move cost because this is the answer:  too much. Cabreado HRH of Aquitaine Jul 12, 2016 12:28 AM I've been inside an Amazon fulfillment center. If you get a chance to visit one, do it; the idea that they somehow generate a profit is mind-blowing to anyone who sees their operation at the battlefield level. There's an unbelievable amount of damaged product (the one I saw was a "big and bulky" products warehouse, and there was >25 trailer loads worth of product that was in the process of being liquidated to a wholesaler at cents on the dollar.  Add-in a poor safety record, high turnover rate, and high labor costs. Tijuana Donkey Show HRH of Aquitaine Jul 12, 2016 12:15 AM FBA is the ultimate in real estate. I use it, it's insane how cheap it is for my company. They make money off the entire process. Books are a small part of their biz now. Walmart fucked themselves when they pulled their suppliers in and told them to slash their prices to stay on Walmart shelves. Meanwhile, Amazon helps you turnover more of your product and gives you warehouse space. I walked into an Apple Store three weeks ago with a $100 gift card and didn't see a single thing I wanted to buy. I can't give this gift card away. Atomizer Catullus Jul 11, 2016 10:04 PM Walmart also makes the supplier buy back the inventory if minimum product turns are not met. Walmart is a glorified distribution center. Depending on product cost, they make between 25-500% GP margin. Did I mention, you pay for the shelf space to market your product.  Distribution product class 101. Take the educational class. About 4 years ago, 4 to 1 ratio. Depends on transportation, advertising, and product defect returns. All part of the illusion to make money as a partner with Walmart.  Straw Dog Catullus Jul 11, 2016 10:17 PM How do they make money with prime members with the 2 day shipping. I ordered a 20 pound medicine ball and the shipping alone had to be close to 15 bucks if they had to charge shipping . They are bleeding to death with this 2 day shipping. Atomizer heisenberg991 Jul 11, 2016 10:23 PM Good point. That's the other trick. You sell a product for a dollar + S/H. Receive quote to ship and add on 30% for shipping. Don't forget, product cost was only $0.50. The other angle is to offer free shipping and build to 30% into selling price. Lastly, you offer free S/H and build in 3 easy payments which include 60% into product cost. That way, if customer returns product..you still haven't lost money. Just profit margins.  Remember, we're using a retail sales number of $1.00 for product being sold. All retail sales figures are subject to variations.  Wrote a book once.  Never got published as the publisher closed the doors as my book was going to print.  That was in the 90's. Amazon has it listed, but says out of print.  If Amazon sold it, would I get any royalties?  I never gave them permission to put it on their site. I wonder how much stuff they are selling and never paying royalties etc. I have no use for Amazon or EBay.  Over rated. There will always be a need for traditional type stores, if nothing else as an excuse for people to leave their couches and move around a little. Atomizer cherry picker Jul 11, 2016 10:32 PM You didn't mail a copy to your mailing home address, first mistake. Take portions of the book and search if someone changed the title and kept the content. Otherwise, your book could be in limbo. Who knows, could be Amazon using a backlink to create clickbait. ChargingHandle Jul 11, 2016 11:06 PM lucky and good Jul 11, 2016 11:31 PM Because of its massive advertising budget and other ties to the company  the media often seems to be in bed with Amazon. This means you seldom  hear anything bad about the retail behemoth. While the people who love and support Amazon might claim the points  above show Amazon and its CEO to be clever, cunning, and masters of the  game, an argument can be make that an aura of evil hangs over much of  what it has created. Amazon is a job killer that abuses and  exploits the brick and mortar stores that line streets  throughout America. People should consider what kind of community and  society they want in coming years before jumping on the Amazon  bandwagon. Below are fifteen things Amazon is not in a hurry to tell you. I tried to stop at ten but found it impossible. wizteknet lucky and good Jul 12, 2016 1:00 AM Sales taxes is really why I stopped using amazon as much, since I do live in Texas, found it cheaper on ebay on most occasion's. Plus in the beginning you didnt find out you owed taxes until after you ordered it, till they fixed there app finally. That might stop after Trump becomes president. Bullshit marketing gig but consumers will fall for this crap and that's ok. Just make it work to your benefit.
