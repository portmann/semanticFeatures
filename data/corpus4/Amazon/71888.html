How to Save 20% On Diapers Without Stepping Foot in a Store | Debt RoundUp As a father of a two-year old child, I’m well aware of how much diapers cost. Although we are working slowly on potty training, we still are buying diapers. I remember when we first started getting ready for our son to come home and was told how many diapers they can go through a day. Wait, 7-8 diapers a day? Dang! Â Boy, was I clueless back then. You really learn a lot when a new baby is brought into the world. We are not what you call “brand loyal” when it comes to diapers. We did stick with Pampers for some time, but that’s just because we knew of the brand. We didn’t know any better. Over time we started looking at different brands, mostly to save money. Luckily for us, our son doesn’t have any reactions to the diapers, like some kids do. Before you jump on us, we did have aspirations to try cloth diapers. W even bought a couple sets . That was before I had to handle the first poopy diaper. You can call me what you want, but poop is not something I care to deal with. Never liked smelling it and sometimes it would overwhelm me. Whew, did I have some gag moments when our son was young. That feeling alone made me want to wrap up that nasty mess and toss the diaper outside in the trash. I didn’t feel like cleaning cloth diapers, nor did I even want to handle them. Don’t get me wrong, they are a great deal if you’re up for it. They cost less than disposable in the long run, but sometimes convenience trumps savings in my book. Poop-filled diapers is one of those times! As I mentioned, we stuck with Pampers for some time, then we moved to Huggies , but those didn’t fit very well. We tried out some generic brands from Target and Walmart . We went back to Pampers just because they worked. A few months later, Pampers came out with their “new” diapers to hold more fluid. Well, that didn’t turn out well for us. Every time we would get our son up in the morning, he would be covered in urine-soaked diaper filling. No better way to start the morning than cleaning up your child because the diapers exploded! We used the rest of the box and that was the end of our Pampers run. We have since switched to Luvs and we like that brand. They are cheaper and hold a good amount, plus they fit well. I don’t think we’ll switch any time soon. Let’s hope the whole diaper thing is getting closer to being behind us! Now, I know many people who save a ton of money on diapers. They cut coupons like a crazy person, but they have some serious savings. Now, I do buy the diapers in bulk when they’re on sale, but with regards to coupons, I don’t do a very good job. I’m not going to lie about that. Â There are many ways to save on diapers, but I wanted to share one way which we will be taking advantage of when we have another child. I’m sure some of you have heard of this “secretive” program which Amazon.com provides mothers. Yes, it’s called Amazon Mom . What’s unique about this loyalty program is you can save 20% on diapers. Yes, 20% people! The way Amazon Mom works is you get 20% off diapers using their subscribe-and-save feature. You setup a subscription for your favorite diapers, then Amazon delivers them to your doorstep every time you need them (based on your current usage). It’s that simple and you get to save 20% automatically. That’s right people, you don’t even have to step foot into a store in order to save money on diapers. Now, Amazon Mom is free with your Amazon Prime membership . If you don’t have Prime, then you can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Mom and you get Prime included. After the 30-days, you will get charged $99 a year or you can cancel. Since I’m a fan of Amazon Prime , I would recommend anyone who loves shopping online to get it. The Amazon Mom program is just an added benefit. As said, Amazon Mom is part of Â your Prime membership. You don’t actually have to be a mother, you can also be a dad, grandparent, or caretaker. I guess they should call this Amazon Baby Diapers. Â Anyway, Amazon Mom is free for 30 days if you’re not already a Prime member. Along with the 20% off diapers, you also get all the Prime member benefits. Â The only way you get the 20% off is with a Subscribe & Save subscription to your favorite diapers. It’s actually 5% off with Subscribe & Save, then 15% off with Amazon Mom, totaling 20%. Amazon Mom is a Prime membership program aimed at helping parents and caregivers in the prenatal through toddler years use Amazon to find and save on products that families need. Amazon Mom is open to anyone, whether youâ€™re a mom, dad, grandparent or caretaker. New members are eligible for a 30-day free trial that includes a free trial of Prime in addition to Amazon Mom exclusive benefits. To receive these discounts, you must be in the Amazon Mom 30-day free trial or be the primary holder of the Amazon Mom and Prime account for $99 a year. Along with the diaper discount, you get 15% off when you complete your baby registry. This discount doesn’t go into effect until 30 days prior to your child’s scheduled arrival date. Yes, Amazon has a baby registry section . Why not try it out and get 15% off you stuff when you complete it? In order to get the discount, you need to understand how to use Amazon’s Subscribe and Save. It’s a pretty cool program where you select products to be delivered to you on a set schedule. Amazon charges your credit card and sends you the stuff, so they will be at your door when you need them again. You can learn more about Subscribe and Save now . If you’re already a Prime member, like me, then you can sign up for Amazon Mom and start getting the benefits. If you cancel Prime, your Mom benefits go along with it, so make sure you calculate all the costs associated with a Prime membership and the savings from the mom program. This will help you understand if Amazon Prime is worth it or not. As someone who doesn’t really like to go into stores that much, I think the Amazon Mom program is pretty good. Who doesn’t want to save 20% on diapers? If you’re not looking to subscribe and save, then at least check out Amazon Coupons , where you can instantly click your way to savings!
