David Einhorn Q2 2016 Letter: Hit On Amazon, Fracking Shorts | Seeking Alpha ValueWalk has obtained David Einhorn's Q2 letter to investors. Below readers can find a full copy - below is a brief summary. In the long book , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Macy's were material losers. The earnings estimates for AAPL continue to fall. We mitigated our loss by trading AAPL well - though the stock is down about 9% for the year, we have been nearly break-even on the position in 2016. We sold Macy's for a loss after the company announced a significant reduction in full-year 2016 guidance. This announcement invalidated our thesis that 2016 earnings would benefit from easy comparisons later in the year. We exited the position at $32.08. We used the dip created in the aftermath of the Brexit vote to cover several short positions: Intuitive Surgical at a loss where we overestimated how quickly competition would materialize. Under Amour where we took a second shot at shorting last fall. This time it worked better and we earned a nice profit. United Rentals, which was a sizable winner over the last couple years, as the rental rates and demand for heavy equipment rentals fell and the company missed estimates. David ends the note with a cryptic comment about Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) from long time bull Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) - is he short? And some other shorts in frackers and Amazon .com Most of the quarterly losses came from the short book. An undisclosed oil fracking short (not the Mother-Fracker) was our biggest loser, followed by Amazon, which reported a stronger quarter than we expected. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Fund Holdings
