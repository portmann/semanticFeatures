At Long Last, ‘HBO Now’ Launches On iTunes, Cablevision â€“ Consumerist After what seems like an eternity, and with only five days to go before the season premiere of Game of Thrones, HBO’s standalone streaming service HBO Now is finally available. As initially announced, Apple’s iTunes is selling access to the service on a nationwide basis for $14.99/month. People served by Cablevision’s Optimum Online broadband service can add HBO Now to their monthly bill for the same amount. The service is currently limited to viewing via computer or through Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. HBO plans to expand the availability to Android phones/tablets and non-Apple set-top streaming devices, but has not provided any timelines or named any future partners. Additionally, it’s expected that other cable and Internet providers will make HBO Now available as an add-on for their broadband packages. Both iTunes and Cablevision are offering 30-day free trials for HBO Now . We’ll be giving it a shot this afternoon and hope to have some initial feedback on HBO Now for you soon. « Study: Which Commercial Diet Programs Are The Most Effective?
