[click to enlarge] Amazon Destinations, we barely knew you. The dedicated hotel booking site from the e-commerce giant closed its doors this week, just six months after opening them .Â  According to a notice posted on the site , previously bookedÂ reservations are still valid and will be honored. â€œWe have learned a lot and have decided to discontinue Amazon Destinations,â€? the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. The service allowed hoteliers at about 150 properties in the Northeast, southern California and the Pacific Northwest the choice to offer lodgings through Amazon at either their published rates or for discounts and packaged deals, with only select days available at most. Many of the hotels that listed rooms on Amazon Destinations when it launched were independent hotels, but there wereÂ also some large brands in the mix. â€œThese are all handpicked properties that have been visited by someone at Amazon to make sure they meet our quality,â€? a spokesperson for the company said back in April.
