The Cost Of Keeping The Netflix "Story" Intact: A Record $276 Million In Q4 Cash Burn | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The rest of the FANGs may be crashing and burning, but one "story stock" refuses to give up: Netflix. Moments ago Reed Hastings ubiquitous streamer of videos right into your bedroom reported Q4 EPS of $0.10 (vs the $0.08 expected), on $1.82BN in revenue, a fractional miss to expectations, however as everyone "knows", Netflix does not trade on fundamentals.  Well, the story is simple: all about "eyeballs" or in this case, subscriber data, and here it gets a little dicey, because while NFLX reported a miss in net domestic adds which at 1.56 million were just fractionally lower than the 1.62 million expected, and perhaps more troubling: Q4 US net adds were down year over year, 1.56m actual versus 1.90m prior year.  But it was the surge in low-margin, high cost international subs that saved the day: at 4.04 million, this number was far above the 3.5 million expected. Additionally, as part of NFLX' guidance, while the domestic growth appears to be tapering, with the company expecting 1.75MM net adds in Q1 2016, down from the 2.28MM a year ago, it predicts a surge in international net streaming subs, which should grow by 1.75MM from a year ago to 4.35MM. Some more findings: Q4 total streaming contribution margin of 16.2% declined to the lowest in 2015 driven by the drop in the international streaming loss, which at ($109) million, was a -19.2% profit margin, versus the 34.3% domestic profit margin. In other words, while NFLX domestic growth appears to be trailing off, this will be the cash flow basis which the company will use to grow internationally, even if so far at least the profit contribution from offshore is wildly negative. And a little more to the "story" from the letter: In September, we launched in Japan, followed by Spain, Portugal and Italy in October. We are very pleased with the first few months of membership growth in these markets. Our international contribution loss of $109 million in Q4 increased sequentially due to these launches. We anticipate Q1 international losses of about $114 million. In early January at CES, we announced the availability of Netflix everywhere in the world except China. Pricing is comparable to our existing plans and we have added support for Korean, Arabic, and Simplified & Traditional Chinese languages. Our move into 130 additional countries broadens our addressable market by 190 million broadband homes, on top of the 360 million we counted at the end of 20151. While the opportunity is large, our growth in these new markets will unfold over many years as we improve our service. We are starting by primarily targeting outward?looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones. As with every market weâ€™ve launched, our approach is to listen, learn and improve rapidly, adding more content, additional languages and a better Netflix experience over time. Our global availability sets us up for continued growth for many years and we continue to expect material global profits beginning in 2017. In the US, we ended 2015 with nearly 45 million members, although our Q4 US net adds were down year over year, as expected (1.56m actual versus 1.90m prior year). Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past. Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a prior year actual of 2.28m. New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue. In Q2 and Q3, weâ€™ll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at $9.99 a month. Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly elevated churn. Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%. In the last remaining major market, China, we have work and uncertainty ahead. We are building relationships, understanding the market, and seeking the conditions we require to provide our service to entertainment lovers there. Our expectations are modest and long?term. We may be able to get started this year and thus deliver on â€œwhole world by end of 2016â€? or it may take longer. Most of  our focus is on the 130 countries we launched on January 6, which are now embracing Netflix as a new entertainment option. What was the cost of keeping the last FANG momentum "story" alive? A record $276 million in cash burn in the quarter. Free cash flow amounted to ?$276 million in Q4 and ?$921 million for the full year 2015. As a reminder, our investment in originals, particularly owned content, requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content, which will continue to dampen free cash flow. We finished Q4 with debt of $2.4 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter, and with cash & equivalents and short?term investments of  $2.3 billion. Given our expected cash needs, we are likely to raise additional debt in late 2016 or early 2017. We are managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time, while maintaining financial flexibility. Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international, our bonds trade like a BB credit (vs. their single B rating) due, in part, to the long?term growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio, which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection. Of course, as everyone knows, the lack of cash flow doesn't matter until it does. As for NFLX bonds trading like a BB credit, thanks for reminding us to check what the repo rate on those is. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:20 | 7068698 nuubee What kind of nonsense is this? Cash flow suffers when you invest in original programming? How many seasons of House of Cards have they done and they don't have positive cash flow on their original programming? If CBS/NBC/ABC behaved this way 100 years ago, they would have gone bankrupt. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:35 | 7068755 Mentaliusanything Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:36 | 7068758 Quasi Whoever is in charge of Netflix is batshit insane.  They spend all this money on original programming... and then fail to advertise it!  If it isn't House of Cards... no one knows they have it.  I found Marco Polo and fell in love. The problem is it took me over a year to figure out they had the damn show!  It never showed up in any of their idiotically generated "lists" for me, despite watching plenty of asian/kung-fu cinema.  Kimmy Schmidt? Didn't know about it till a friend turned me on to it. Never showed up in my lists despite watching plenty of 30 Rock.  These guys really need to get their act together. And while were at it, drob the pre-generated list bullshit and let me browse your god-damned selection! Oh, and they also paid NBC a metric shit-ton of cash for the exclusive streaming rights to The Blacklist. Unfortunately, they only stream episodes after the season is well over.  So guess what? They basically paid millions just so Hulu can't stream the episodes the next night! They didn't even get a single fucking customer with the deal! If you need to know why they're losing money hand over fist, this is why.

Can't help but feel some inevitable irony coming with that one. "Negative cash flow does not necessarily means loss, and may be due only to a mismatch of expenditure and income. Chronic mismatch, however, may indicate ineffective credit management, leakage of funds through fraud, or actual loss. Temporary mismatch is covered usually by arranging an overdraft facility."

They want country specific content. If it happens we will probably add HBO or such to our regular programming. There also may be VPN alternatives wihch may still work. That, or we will have to read more.

Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:15 | 7068679 EndlessSummer I live outside the US and Amazon really provides great service. $65 or more and free international shipping - and it is FAST. They have also introduced Amazon Mexico - which doesn't have the number of products yet - but it shows they have an interest . Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:27 | 7068721 besnook the problem with amazon is their business plan is to lose money on every sale because they will make a killing on the volume. they are, in effect, proving it is more expensive to build an internet store than a bricks and mortar chain of big box stores spread around the world. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:17 | 7068686 moonmac My RCA electrified digital antenna on a long pole gets me 50+ channels in English which is roughly half the channels that compose of my $200 cable subscription. I'd rather pay for Netflix than cable, and they genuinely make some quality shows. I would happily pay double for their service. $10/month is just not cutting it, clearly.  Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:21 | 7068703 RealistDuJour Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:24 | 7068712 Dr. Gonzo HBO now streaming is much better. Costs $5 more but worth it. I had Netfilx for over a year and after I went through Mad Men, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Tudors, and a few more series I couldn't do it any more. Only totaly crap was left and their movies were stupid low budget ones. I went through their entire steaming library and nothing appealed to me. Most if it's geared to brain dead no taste retards with $9 a month to spend. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:36 | 7068759 Hitlery_4_Dictator LOL - come on they have some good stuff on there. Making a Murderer is a must watch - a lot of good docs there. Terrible movies though.  Tue, 01/19/2016 - 18:07 | 7068868 I am a Man I am... For the price, Netflix is great, Making a Murdere alone was worth the $9 for that month.  I watched Trophy Kids last night, it was worth watching.  Man some sports parents suck ass. Netflix just went to how many different countries this past quarter?  They make good original content, they have to buy content, I mean, do you realize I had 5 channels growing up on a black and white TV.  Fuck, some of the people on here would complain about anything.  Fucking $9, the price of a fucking cocktail outside of NYC. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:28 | 7068722 J Pancreas I love earnings season. The best ZH articles on a comedy of ridiculously valued companies makes for fantastic reading every quarter. Solid take on IBM and NFLX, Tyler. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:38 | 7068761 gmak Right up there along with "All your base are belong to us" is the memorable "We lose money on every sale but we'll make it up in volume".   Spoken by every Japanese company in the 70's, and every internet company in the late 90's at least.  It's always the mantra of cheap funding and too much money looking for a home. Malinvestment personified Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:41 | 7068768 X86BSD I cant understand the constant bashing of certain companies. APPL being the poster child for a "whipping boy" everyone has been proclaiming Apples death since... fuck since they were founded. Literally. Every. Fucking. Year. Someone claims apple is dying. Its old. Its not true. Its beyond pathetic.  I am feeling the same way about NFLX now. People are constantly hating on NFLX. Is it taking losses? Sure the numbers don't lie. However taking a loss might be acceptable if you are building something. Which NFLX is. They are scaling out their CDN infrastructure. They are just now opening up to stream world wide. And here is a *key* take away, they are producing their own content. And quite good content if I do say so myself. They are becoming the first and so far only global content creator/distributor. This is important to know. If they own a good library of self made content, they can stream it world wide. Warner bros, universal, etc can't bind them up with rope on where they can distribute, how much it will cost per play, etc. Netlix knows this as does apple. NFLX is preparing and laying the ground work to become one of the *worlds* premier source of unique original content AND they have the CDN to deliver it worldwide. They are not just pissing money away with nothing to show for it. I swear to god all these AAPL and NFLX dying stories are beyond ludacris. The haters clearly do not understand jack. fucking. shit. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:53 | 7068811 pitz Pretty messed up economy when a mere FTP server can garner a market capitalization that exceeds the entirety of the US precious metals mining sector. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 17:59 | 7068844 eucalyptus I still don't understand the value proposition from NFLX, when all of their content is available for free via torrent. If you have a connection fast enough to stream nflx, you have a fast enough connection to DL all the shows and movies you want. The technical knowledge to do it safely isn't that great. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 18:10 | 7068882 X86BSD Pirating first of all is not something the average joe can do. They simply want to turn on the TV, scroll to the netflix app and hit play. Without thinking. Netflix is on record as having the same view Apple does. In order to compete with "free" (stolen content), you have to make it easier to obtain and keep the price low. Which they are doing. For a flat fee you can binge watch everything in HD quality. No guessing what the stream quality will be and ease of use. There is the value ad. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 19:04 | 7069122 TheDanimal As people get poorer, more and more are going to rediscover bittorrent.  Hell, even xdcc IRC transfer bots are still around, and fast as fuck too.  Netflix is a frivolous epense. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 19:50 | 7069335 redscud NFLX should monitor the IP address and only allow  one subscription. How many people share and account? My whore wife gave her entire family our info and they shared with their families. I have 7 households that are using our account. Solve that and with addition of TopGear boom  money problem solved. As far as content in other countries, what about ticker: EROS ( Not THAT eros you deviants). Remember that piece of shit India content? Can't believe still at $8ps. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 20:35 | 7069553 VW Nerd Price to earnings is still the key value metric.  At 280, I think I'll pass unless Reed can show me real Y/Y earnings growth in the 500% + range.  Best of luck to the thousands of "fund managers" out there willing to belly up and roll the dice. Tue, 01/19/2016 - 20:39 | 7069572 Able Ape What gives?  On cable TV The Bourne Ultimatum plays incessantly.  I swear, everyone on the planet has seen it at least 10 times and they keep running it.  It may turn out that NFLX is a goldmine... P.S. I don't own any NFLX stock....
