Apple Tumbles After Missing Sales And Earnings, Guides Below Lowest Estimate | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Jim Rickards commented to GoldCore today about the cyber theft: "The case for owning gold in an age of cyber-financial threats is compelling ... " The time to prepare for this bubble to burst is now. Imagine if you'd prepared for the 2008 Crash back in late 2007?  There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaultsâ€™ thick concrete walls. What there is, however, is one of the worldâ€™s most important traded assets....

For those pressed for time, here is the breakdown: APPLE SEES 3Q REV. $41B-$43B, EST. $47.4B APPLE SOLD 51.2M IPHONES IN 2Q, EST. 50.7M APPLE SOLD 4.03M MACS IN 2Q, EST. 4.6M APPLE SOLD 10.3M IPADS IN 2Q, EST. 9.4M APPLE 2Q IPHONE ASP $641.83, EST. $651 APPLE BOOSTS QTR DIV TO 57C-SHR FROM 52C, EST. 57C Moments ago AAPL reported Q2 EPS of $1.90, missing expectations of $2.00 on revenue of $50.56BN which not only plunged by 13% from ayear ago, but also significantly missed expectations of $52 Billion. Perhaps the biggest driver for this was both the sequential and annual plunge in Chinese sales, which dropped to $12.5 billion from $16.8 billion a year ago. And while Apple beat expectations on iPhone sales, selling 51.2 million units in the quarter, above the 50.7 million expected, if still 16% lower than a year ago, it did so on both a lower than expected margin of 39.4%, and lower iPhone ASPs, which dropped to $641.8 below the $651 estimate. Worse, the company's guidance for Q3 revenues was absolutely abysmal, and now sees only $41-$43BN in Q3 sales, well below not only the median estimate of $47.35bn but below the lowest sellside estimate of $43.95bn. According to Tim Cook, "our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds. We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from Services, thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over one billion active devices.” Shareholders do not appear to share his pleasure because more troubling was the CFO commentary according to whom what was slowing iPhone sales was the slowness to upgrade. As of this moment investors says yes, as AAPL tumbles 6% after hours, and that despite AAPL announcing that the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $175 billion from the $140 billion level announced last year.It also added that it will continue to access domestic and international debt markets to fund shareholder returns, adding that it has authorized boost of $50b to holder return plan to a total of $250b by end of March 2018.

Answer is none, check reviews).  The issue is once you control the entire space and the space stops growing, what else can you do.  They have become so huge that there is very little upside left unless a whole new region or market opens up for the iPhone.  Virtual Reality (which Apple is not in, yet) is as retarded as 3D printing for the masses. It will fail.  The watch market Apple is doing fine in sales for but it will always be a very small market and never will bring in iPhone like sales.  There just isn't much more for Apple to do, it needs to find a new market.  Maybe start eating away at Netflix. Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:02 | 7480318 asteroids Like twitter, the stock crashes with incredible speed. It's obvious humans aren't involved, just computers. So, that being the case, why should ANY human have any cash or interest in such markets? Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:07 | 7480332 Au_Ag_CuPbCu I remember reading on ZH that there would be about 5 years of innovative pipeline available after Jobs passed away...pretty accurate.

Since 2008 they just want to print and bail out, and print to bail-out. BUT... the important part here is still while knowing how everything is manipulated to make sure you are on the upside. That you with your knowledge make money to be independent and say whatever you want to say while they take savings from the middle-class and make everyone poorer. I think this guy made a good point when he compared different markets according to CAPE and other indicators. On top of that, he pointed to the cycle of capital transfers between developed markets and emerging ones. Worth watching. Especially second half.  http://independenttrader.org/trader21-lecture-presented-at-fx-cuffs.html Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:25 | 7480410 DirkDiggler11 Tim "Choke on a Cock" Cook couldn't run a San Fran gay bar.  Watch him run Apple into the fucking ground.  Steve Jobs was an asshole and a dick, but he knew consumers.  Timmy knows to to set of 3rd world slave factories and exploit people, but that's about it. Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:44 | 7480490 Hitlery_4_Dictator Not sure what the big deal is, I'm 38 and have never owned a smart phone. Don't plan to. Ever. What made the smartphone was the capacitative touch screen. What made the personal computer was the micro processor. The new technology would already be around. Out there. You would have seen it already, possibly dismissed it as irrelevant. "Apple still is the crowned king of the phone world" Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:55 | 7480527 misalkin Hardly a king. Samsung S series is way better and cheaper, and more ppl buy samsung. Apple's phone can't evern compare. 80% of all phones is android.

Being a SJW eclipses running your actual business these days,  Apple is getting a small taste  what they've got coming to them... PC Assholes. Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:13 | 7480354 Hal n back I guess sooner or later people realize the cost of a new phone every teo years  is several hundred dollrs, when except for batteries going dead the phone is operative for Four years. Tue, 04/26/2016 - 17:36 | 7480459 Huh Reeeally Yup, and who remembers Palm Pilot with that silly stylus, oops, someone has re-introduced it? D'uh! Samsung has equal or better products - I know someone who actually paid $1200 for their shoephone - and may surpass Apple. Does anyone really think the Chinese market will swoon for AAPL forever when they're making the chips and phones and sell their own brands cheap. Hmmm. No O/S is trustworthy, and seriously WHO would pay $600+ for an iphone when a made in India Freedom 251 costs $4? Over-priced tech crap impoverishes people. How much is your smartphone/tv/internet/homephone per year? And how much do you spend on devices? The relative benefit is (ok besides internet alt news and info-sharing)....?

Kind of like being the man in the casino with the most chips just before the cashier says he's out of cash. On top of this, the only hints of new products coming out of AAPL are things that Alphabet and Samsung are already working on.

Tue, 04/26/2016 - 16:50 | 7480247 SallySnyd The United States government has submitted more requests for our Apple account information, including actual content, than all other nations in the world combined. English  people are terrified of displaying their own flag after being endlessly  lectured that it's racist and offensive to immigrants.
