1-In-10 U.S. Households Sharing Passwords For Netflix & Other Streaming Services â€“ Consumerist A new study confirms that video streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, have quickly become the new norm, and are being accessed by a majority of American homes. However, not everyone who’s logging in to binge-watch Orange Is The New Black or Transparent is paying for it. According to research from Parks Associates , 11% of Netflix watchers are doing so on someone else’s account. The number is about the same (10%) for Hulu Plus. Amazon Prime is significantly less, at only 5%, perhaps because people are more reluctant to share an Amazon password that could give the other user the ability to make purchases. As you’d expect, the 18-24 age group has the highest concentration of account sharers at 22%. We’re actually surprised that number isn’t slightly higher. In terms of the overall pictures, the Parks report claims that 57% of all U.S. households with broadband access are now using that connection to watch one of these streaming services.
