Despite the endless media onslaught, which courtesy of Apple's hundreds of billions in cash is nothing but the biggest new product paid infomercial-cum-publicity stunt to roll out the latest new "revolutionary" wearable smartwatch, confirmed by the "media mentions" chart below... â€” Michelle Coffey (@m_cof) March 13, 2015 ... a just released Reuters/IPSOS poll shows that the vast majority of Americans are greeting the new Apple watch with nothing but iYawns. The poll reveals that 69% of Americans are they are not interested in buying the gadget, with 47.8% responding "not at all interested." Ipsos surveyed 1,245 Americans online between March 9 and March 13. The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Only 14.8% responded they are "somewhat interested", and a further 9.7% are "very interested." And most troubling for Apple is that perhaps with the memory of the just as "revolutionary" Google Glass dud, "More than half of respondents, 52 percent, agreed with the statement that smartwatches are a â€œpassing fad.â€? As Reuters notes , "initial demand for the watch is expected to come primarily from existing iPhone users, but its wider success is seen depending on whether developers create enticing apps tailored to the device, so-called killer apps." Apple is among several large tech companies looking to jumpstart a new market for â€œwearableâ€? electronic devices. Samsung Electronics, Sony Corp and LG Electronics have all released their own smartwatches, many of them powered by software developed by Internet company Google Inc. But consumers have yet to cotton to the notion of wearable devices. Google recently halted sales to consumers of Glass, a $1,500 screen attached to glasses which were routinely mocked for their awkward appearance. Roughly 4.6 million smartwatches were sold globally in 2014, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, a fraction of the more than 1 billion smartphones sold worldwide. The graphic below shows just how massive the smartwatch field has become, and how initial buzz is so critical to determine any one watch that could become the standout. This is troubling as more than half of respondents, or 54%, "disagreed" that they are more interestin purchasing an Apple Watch than some other kind of smartwatch: If even Apple, and its (in)famous marketing savvy and loyal fans, is unable to determine the clear winner, then suddenly the case for the much needed "ecosystem boost" that has proppeled the stock massively over the past 6 months (mostly on the back of Apple's own debt-funded stock repurchases) is looking very shaky. As Reuters further adds, "some 46 percent of respondents said that the Apple Watch had a â€œcool factor.â€? But only 29 percent said they were more interested in purchasing an Apple Watch than another brand of smartwatch." Analysts expect that Apple will sell between 10 million and 32 million watches in 2015. If the initial disappointing feedback is anything to go by, the final number will be substantially less. Which means back to the drawing board for the company which deals as much in fads, hype and "aspirational buzz" as in actual products, which will be that much more challenged to provide the next iteration of a "must have" smartphone, not so much due to decline of inherent evolutionary features, but simply due to battery life and chemistry limitations. You have to be a real gadget freak to get a 'smart' watch. "Now with autoselfie technology that automagically takes a selfie of you every time you glance at your watch!" Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:43 | 5886990 nope-1004 Bluetooth will only work if iPhone in proximity, so the watch needs the phone close by for full operational capacity.  That's a good thing, because, of course, the phone doesn't tell time... lol. I'll tell you who will like the watches:  Dentists.  Working with your hands you can glance at your wrist to see who texted or called.  Other than that, this thing is late to the party.  Friend has the FitBit and that thing rocks!

Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:24 | 5886930 MeelionDollerBogus It used to be fancy to have a data-bank watch (we're talking pre-1990) that could store 100 phone numbers and the battery would last for years. In 2015 Apple thinks a watch that costs 10x what that old one did and the battery might last for a day is... advanced.

Within ONE week his power switch no longer functioned, so up to the Apple Shop in Sydney (he lives in Wollongong, 2 hours south of "The Big City") for a replacement.  What he got was a "Works Remanufactured" replacement - full warranty, but a "Seconds, remanufactured" product nevertheless, for the "New Product" price . . . . . FOUR hours round trip, for a "reconditioned" Apple product, for FULL list price - "Take it or leave it" attitude (pretty common in Sydney I seem to remember). Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:37 | 5886931 tgatliff Maybe the reason for the low numbers has something to do with the watch only working with people who have iPhones?  Wouldnt a better "poll" be one that asks only iPhone users if they are interested?   Otherwise, the data is meaningless. I am not saying I like the Apple watch, but iPhone users are only 42% of the cell phone market, so if 69% of total users not being interested, in theory that means that 31% (ie 221 million), which are all iPhone users, are interested.  In that context, it could potentially be a very successful product.   However, any reasonable person would expect a sell off in AAPL after the watch release.  This is inevitable considing how fast it has gone up recently.

Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:26 | 5886940 czarangelus Yes, but are the percentage of morons who are interested the same dwindling percentage of Americans who can afford such a ... I hesitate to call it luxury. Ostentatious display of idiocy? Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:26 | 5886942 davidalan1 Fuck Apple and all the idiots that pack their stores and buy their sheeeeit...fucking Iwatch.. just give me a Timex with big numbers...lol Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:29 | 5886952 City_Of_Champyinz This iwatch crap might be the most useless product ever invented.  I know that I only require my timepiece to have a battery life of 3 hours.  What a joke. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:34 | 5886967 scatha It is sick. Millions Americans worry about food, shelter and how to pay gas and electric bill and those SV lunatics are daydreaming about iWatch or next useless iGadget disrupting their naps. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:58 | 5887031 Berspankme One of the girls that works for me (has one garnishment) says she can't wait to get one. 15 minutes after paycheck every week she's broke. I told her it was useless and showed her my flip phone. She laughed at it. I have my house paid for, pay cash for my cars and 7 figures in savings and PM's and apparently I'm the dummy. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 17:49 | 5887003 Pheonyte I have to agree (on both counts). Same story with the iPad. Everyone trashed it when it was rolled out and said it had no obvious purpose.
