Amazon’s Prime Day Not Off To A Thrilling Start â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Amazon’s Prime Day was supposed to be a celebration of the company’s 20th birthday as well as a shopping frenzy festival to rival Black Friday. After more than a week of hype, customers are finding the deals underwhelming. When one reader did find something he actually wanted, he was unable to get the limited-duration “Lightning deal” into his cart. The “lightning deals” that are supposed to provide the best discounts have limited durations and quantities: when time is up or the item runs out, whichever happens first, you’re out of luck. Reader Ben reports that when he tried to buy this case for his Galaxy Note, all that happens is the yellow circle whirls around and around, and he can’t put the item in his cart. “The spinning circle that says checking deal goes for about 5 minutes, then tells me to add to cart, which it wonâ€™t let me do!” he writes.  Amazon has been less than helpful telling me to try again later. What is the point of a lighting/flash sale if you canâ€™t buy an item that shows to be available?” To draw people to the site to…not be able to put anything in their carts? Other shoppers have sort of the opposite problem: they’re disappointed in the selection of merchandise. A significant discount is great, but customers were expecting discounts on things other than random household crap. Of course, isn’t the ability to order random household crap to be delivered to your doorstep the entire point of having Amazon Prime? #PrimeDay — not like Black Friday at all. I did not have turkey yesterday, and I don't need pencils, granny panties or baby wipes. — Liz Savery (@lizsavery) July 15, 2015 — Gaganjeet (@Gaga0990) July 15, 2015 — Denville Library (@denvillelibrary) July 15, 2015 If you are super lucky in today's #PrimeDay you can get yourself on the wait list for a $24 electric sharpener. pic.twitter.com/ynFcJBLv5e — Kristin Devoe (@Kristin_Devoe) July 15, 2015 Click to print (Opens in new window) 5 Little-Known Ways To Save Money On Amazon TiVo E-Mails Me Coupon Code, Reserves Right To Remove Discounts After Order Amazon’s Sales By Third-Party Sellers Hit 2 Billion Items, 40% Of Total Amazon’s “Make An Offer” Option Lets Customers Haggle Over The Price Of Collectible Items « Consumer Groups Urge CFPB To Provide Better Oversight, Rules Over Student Loan Servicing Oscar-Winning Director Of Snowden Documentary Trying To Find Out Why She's Been Detained At Airports So Much The White Castle Story: The Birth Of Fast Food & The Burger Revolution UPDATE: A Happy Ending For Man Who Almost Had To Sell His House Due To Comcast's Incompetence Couple Gets Stolen SUV Returned To Them With Repairs, Courtesy Of Thief Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
