FAA, Amazon officials see drone operations in a year   | Reuters WASHINGTON U.S. commercial drone operations could take flight on a large scale within a year, as federal regulators finalize rules for widespread operations by companies including Amazon.com, according to congressional testimony on Wednesday. A senior Federal Aviation Administration official said the agency expects to finalize regulations over the next 12 months. This would be a substantially shorter period than previous forecasts that had anticipated rules allowing commercial operations by the end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017. "The rule will be in place within a year," FAA Deputy  Administrator Michael Whitaker said in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee. At the same hearing, a senior Amazon.com executive told lawmakers that the e-commerce retailer would be ready to begin delivering packages to customers via unmanned aircraft when the regulations are in place. â€œWeâ€™d like to begin delivering to our customers as soon as itâ€™s approved," said Paul Misener, Amazon.com's vice president of global public policy. â€œWe will have it (the technology) in place by the time any regulations are ready. We are working very quickly.â€? In February, the FAA proposed regulations that would allow drones to fly during daylight hours, within an operator's visual line of sight and at altitudes of no more than 500 feet (152 meters). FAA officials are in discussions with industry stakeholders including Amazon.com and Google Inc about crafting final regulations to accommodate more sophisticated drone systems capable of flying autonomously over longer distances. Misener said Amazon.com's goal is to deliver packages to customers within 30 minutes of receiving the order. A San Francisco Uber driver is an employee, not a contractor, according to the California Labor Commission, a decision that could dramatically increase costs for the ride-hailing service.  Full Article   Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
