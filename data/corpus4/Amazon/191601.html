Apple TV: The Amazon Ban Won't Hurt A Bit - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's next gen Apple TV will feature apps and games derived from the iOS ecosystem as well as streaming media content. The ban of the device by Amazon is a transparent attempt to salvage something of the failed device strategy exemplified by Fire Phone. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) next generation Apple TV is due to go on sale soon, and will feature the processor from the iPhone 6 and a new operating system dubbed tvOS that will feature apps and games as well as streaming video and music. Already it has been subjected to a preemptive ban by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) that is clearly intended to foster sales growth for the new Fire TV by removing competing devices from Amazon's online store. Far from being a bold strategic move, the ban is an act of desperation that reflects Apple's stronger competitive position. Surprisingly, much of the reaction to Amazon's move has failed to take into account the fate of the Fire Phone. The Fire Phone was only recently discontinued as Amazon finally worked through its inventory of Fire Phones in August. According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ subscription required at link), Amazon is curtailing the development of consumer devices and has laid off engineers who worked on the Fire Phone. Clearly, Amazon is attempting to salvage what it can from its devices strategy, and the new Fire TV is at the center of the new strategy. Amazon's decision to pull both Apple TV and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Chromecast is indicative of how disadvantaged the Fire TV is. The recent article on the Amazon ban by Alcaraz Research misses this context and makes two bold assertions. Alcaraz asserts that the ban is going to hurt sales of Apple TV and that Apple TV will "continue to lag behind the Fire TV". It's not exactly clear what is meant by "lag", but I'll assume "lag in unit sales". There is some divergence of opinion regarding how well Amazon is doing relative to Apple TV. Apple Insider recently published a report by Parks Associates that claims that Amazon had higher market share than Apple in 2014 in the U.S. Statista has a completely different take on 2014 streaming devices market share in the U.S. in which Fire TV and Fire TV Stick are lumped into the Other category. Frost & Sullivan also published a report and was widely reported in June , showing that Apple had the lead in global market share in 2014: Apple also reported in January during the December quarter earnings call that it had shipped to date 25 million Apple TVs. Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) has a report on streaming media user share that indicates that Apple TV and other Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, and Macs command the lion's share of users of streaming media devices. If you sum up all the Apple devices, Apple's share of streaming media device users dwarfs all other device categories, as the chart below shows. The Apple Device category can be broken down further by devices, to show their individual contributions to the overall usage share for Apple, as shown in the chart below. According to Adobe, even the lowly iPod Touch has more users than the Fire TV. The idea that Apple lags behind Amazon in unit sales of streaming devices is not well supported by the available facts. The above charts demonstrate what is meant by ecosystem advantage. Apple offers a wide array of devices, with different operating systems: Mac OS X, iOS, and now tvOS for the latest gen Apple TV. Even though the devices and operating systems are different, there's a commonality of user interface that makes it easy to move from one device to the other. Given that Apple continues to grow Mac and iPhone user sales, Apple's installed base of devices continues to grow as well. This installed base forms the base of first adopters for devices such as the new Apple TV. The installed base is very comfortable making purchases through Apple's brick and mortar and online retail stores worldwide, so I doubt they'll miss not being able to buy through Amazon. Apple's online store actually provides many more localized versions (44) than Amazon does (6). Amazon certainly sells more stuff, but Apple has more global reach. Another important aspect of ecosystem advantage lies in the variety of games that the Fire TV will be able to offer compared to the new Apple TV. Amazon advertises that the Fire TV Gaming Edition offers over 800 games. According to Statista , Apple currently offers 396,000 games on the iOS App Store. Currently developers are working on porting as many of those to tvOS as fast as they can. Since tvOS is based on iOS, and the new Apple TV will use the processor from the iPhone 6 (A8), the process of conversion is pretty straightforward. I expect there to be hundreds of games available when the new Apple TV launches later this Fall, with many more to follow. Most of the current iOS game catalog could be ported to tvOS eventually. Given the ecosystem advantages and Apple's global retail presence, I don't see how the Amazon ban will affect sales of the new Apple TV. Apple TV certainly faces significant competition, but it will succeed or fail in its own right, regardless of what Amazon does. Apple constrained the next gen Apple TV to be a streaming media and gaming platform almost exclusively, somewhat to my disappointment considering that it packs the iPhone 6 processor. But what it does, it does well, and it should do well in the market place. I continue to expect initial sales of about 1 million units per month with quarterly revenue of about $500 million. This could accelerate if Apple succeeds in finalizing a live streaming TV content package from the major broadcast networks, which many expect some time in 2016.
