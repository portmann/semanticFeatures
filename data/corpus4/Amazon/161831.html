Essay On Netflix: Thoughts About Its Ultimate Evolution - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix knows streaming -- but it needs to know more. The company will eventually morph into a complete media conglomerate and own a thriving consumer products business and theme parks. To do this, Netflix will, first and foremost, focus on original content that it develops and owns; it will also seek out acquisitions to create a valuable studio portfolio. There's been a lot of debate about the cord-cutting phenomenon, and how it will affect media companies like Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ). Besides those businesses, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is arguably at the center of any discussion about bundled vs. a la carte models. Netflix is dominating the battle of the broadcasting/cable brands. No one is counting out the continued survival of traditional non-streaming media, but investors have to admit that consumers continue to gravitate toward the subscription service. Many people see it as a feasible way to receive quality content at a reasonable value. For some, it is a zero-sum game. Some subscribers simply can't justify a Comcast cable box alongside Netflix's over-the-top system. They might be able to justify augmenting the latter with conservatively-designed offerings (i.e., HBO plus several other popular networks), but the era of paying for ESPN even if you don't watch it could be over within the next several years (or, at least, current Wall Street price action in the media sector would you have considering such a bleak future for certain digital pipelines). The salient element to Netflix's continued evolution will be original programming and movie distribution. Output deals and winning competitions for rights to older hit TV series won't matter as much over the long run if people don't feel that the service is searching for great stories to tell. The company must also look to emphasize ownership of the programming it develops and to distribute it beyond Netflix. Shareholder value can be enhanced in this manner, and the business model can transform over time, turning the streaming entity into a complete media conglomerate. CEO Reed Hastings has already mentioned the importance of owning content for his company, but he must place that as a top priority equal to that of growing the subscriber base. In other words, Netflix's grand scheme all along should be for it to become the next Disney, the next Time Warner, the next Comcast, with a streaming service at the core of its business but with a desire to sell original content to other parties. Let's imagine how this might work. Netflix could develop the next great episodic series about the apocalypse. Maybe, instead of zombies or vampires, it's a plague of witches and warlocks that walk the countryside and pester the survivors. Perhaps the idea was incubated as a comic book and then turned into a Walking Dead-type series and placed on cable. It becomes a hit. Netflix, of course, would own the exclusive streaming rights and would play episodes of the hypothetical show after a certain time period, no different than what happens now. The difference would be that, unlike what happens with House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, it doesn't start with Netflix. And that's okay. Because Netflix's ultimate future isn't about it being a subscription service (although that will always be important); more so, it is about Netflix becoming a best-in-class storyteller that will sometimes start its story on Netflix and sometimes start its story on a platform owned by some other media conglomerate. It's no different than Disney making a television show for a competitor network such as CBS as opposed to making it for ABC. The Disney analogy is very apt since some of that company's Marvel characters are showing up on Netflix. If Disney/Marvel can supply Daredevil to Netflix, one would have to assume that Netflix could supply content that it develops to ABC. Hastings has also talked about entering the movie business and playing around with window strategies. Netflix will eventually want to attempt to produce all-out blockbusters on the line of Jurassic World. To fully capitalize on such an asset, Netflix will have to start a thriving consumer products division, and then, just like Comcast and Disney, it will be obliged to enter the theme parks arena. The company also could look at Disney as a template in another area: the art of acquisition. Obviously Hastings can't buy Pixar, but he could look to do a deal with DreamWorks Animation. Furthermore, there are producing outfits like Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity) that would be attractive in a media portfolio. Marvel, like Pixar, is likewise taken, but attempts to acquire libraries of characters by buying small graphic-novel studios is always an option. Netflix could also look to a company like Hasbro as a way to enter consumer products, as well as to perhaps start toy lines that could be turned into series on Netflix, and then into big-screen product. All of this makes Netflix probably one of the best long-term investments, but as the company starts to reach for the total-conglomerate template, there will be many painful periods for the stock that probably will be looked upon as buying opportunities. Risks I foresee are competition from other companies that will look to do the same thing -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and, to be completely honest, just about any tech/retail entity -- which will increase the valuations for potential acquisition targets.
