Retail Stocks Going Lower | Seeking Alpha The retail sector has been plagued by various factors in recent months. U.S. retail spending has slipped weighing on overall economic activity. The retail sector has dealt with many negative forces in recent months, driving SPDR S&P Retail (NYSEARCA: XRT ) lower. To begin, general demand for consumer spending remains weak. The headline retail sales figure, released by the Commerce Department, missed estimates, signaling potentially weaker overall economic activity in the fourth quarter. Additionally, brick and mortar stores are seeing sales cannibalized by the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), who has had an amazing string of performance in 2015, alongside other online retailers. Below is a chart of inflation-adjusted U.S. retail sales. The apparent trend has been gradually lower since the recovery in 2010. In the last five years, the annual growth of retail sales has fallen from nearly 5%, to now around 1.5%. This decline highlights the effects of stagnant wage growth, and a declining labor force. The general lack of growth in U.S. retail spending, excluding spending on vehicles, has weighed on top-line growth for companies such as JC Penney (NYSE: JCP ) and Macy's (NYSE: M ). Another such factor cutting into market share of brick and mortar retail shops has been the emergence of online shopping. Online shopping has existed for many years now, but the likes of Amazon are really picking up steam. Amazon has seen its revenues grow sharply since 2010, and in 2015 has finally begun to expand margins and generate profits for shareholders. Online retail spending has disrupted nearly every aspect of the retail community's traditional way of business. As a testament, the long held tradition of Black Friday, a day of shopping following Thanksgiving, has been nearly decimated in recent years. Many consumers have, in fact, chosen to just stay home, and search for better deals online. It is comparable to the convenience of sending an email, as opposed to the effort involved with mailing a letter. Below is a chart of the relative strength of Amazon's share price relative to the broader retail sector. The pair trended sideways for most of the last few years, but in 2015, Amazon's share price exploded higher. The writing looks to finally be on the wall that retailers either find an online presence, or get out of the way of Amazon as a new era arises. Due to the various factors weighing on the retail sector, many of its companies' share prices are on the threshold of a significant decline. SPDR S&P Retail is already down close to 15% this year, and momentum is building. The overall environment of consumer spending has not lived up to what many had hoped for, while Amazon is stealing market share from what is left. Individual companies have already spoken of the difficulties in the current operating environment, which presents an attractive short opportunity for the broader SPDR S&P Retail ETF. The index should decline into the mid to low 30s over the next six months. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
