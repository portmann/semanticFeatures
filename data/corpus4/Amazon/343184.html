How to Pay Your Credit Card With Your Voice and Amazon Debt Fighting Debt Saving Money Savings Today is a pretty cool day in the world of personal finance and technology. At least for those of us who enjoy harnessing the power of technology to further our financial freedom. You’re probably wondering what I’m talking about, so I will share a little press release I got about how Amazon has teamed up with Capital One to use the power of your voice to stay on top of your credit card and banking. I’m excited to see where this takes us as more banks jump on board and get onto the ease of access train. I congratulate Capital One and Amazon for trying to be innovative. Capital One and Amazon Launch Skill for Alexa-Enabled Devices Innovation is often about creating products and tools that consumers donâ€™t yet know they canâ€™t live without. Here at Capital One, weâ€™re always dreaming up new ways to make our customersâ€™ lives easier. If you can order a pizza or a car with your voice, why not manage your money that way, too? Capital One announced today that it is the first company to provide customers with the ability to interact with their financial information through Alexa-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo, Amazon Tap, Echo Dot, and Fire TV. Starting today, customers can stay on top of their credit card account by checking their balance, reviewing recent transactions, or making payments as well as get real-time access to checking and savings account information to understand their available fundsâ€“ all hands free. â€œThe Alexa Skills store is quickly growing, and today weâ€™re excited to add the Capital One skill â€“ which is the first skill that will enable Alexa users to interact with their financial accounts,â€? said Rob Pulciani, Director Amazon Alexa. â€œNow Alexa can quickly provide your Capital One banking balance, latest transactions and more on Amazon Tap, Echo Dot, Amazon Echo or Fire TV devices â€”all conveniently with just your voice. More and more voice experiences are coming, and itâ€™s only going to get better for our customers.â€? Capital One customers can save time by easily interacting with their accounts by first enabling the Capital One skill in their Alexa app, and then asking Alexa questions like: “Alexa, ask Capital One for my Quicksilver Card balance.â€? â€œAlexa, ask Capital One for recent transactions on my checking accountâ€? “Alexa, ask Capital One when is my credit card payment due?” â€œAlexa, ask Capital One to pay my credit card bill.â€? (To be clear: Alexa will use your pre-linked funds to pay that bill, not hers. We can all dream, thoughâ€¦) The Capital One Alexa skill is available today. Alexa customers can enable the skill in the Alexa mobile app on iOS, Android or Fire tablets (or at alexa.amazon.com ), and then pair their Alexa and Capital One accounts using their Capital One username and password. This is the latest innovation from Capital One that demonstrates our commitment to creating straightforward, intuitive experiences, products and tools that make it easier for customers to manage their money, wherever they are. I’m going to be the first to admit that I love technology when it comes to making my life easier. I mean, I am the one who invests with Betterment , saves with Digit , and tracks with Personal Capital . They are all awesome services that have made my life easier and harness technology to do it. You don’t have to embrace it, but I sure do. I love technology and it loves me back (at least that’s what I tell myself). While this news is relatively new (today), I can see where this goes from here. Capital One is the first bank to bring this to Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices ( Amazon Echo , Amazon Tap , Echo Dot , and Fire TV ), but there will be other banks. If you have a Capital One checking account (I do), or a credit card, then you will be set up right now. Once other banks jump on board, you will easily be able to check your balances, make payments, and know when your payment is due. It’s a cool way to stay informed and information allows us to take back our financial lives. You might wonder why this is important, but as a society glued to our phones and wanting more information, this is a great way to do it. Amazon Echo is growing in popularity as it puts information right at your fingertips. If you want to know the weather, add items to your grocery list, have a question, or anything else, you can just ask it. Just start a sentence near the device like this: She will get the answer for you in seconds. This is why banking this way is going to be pretty cool in my opinion. Giving us the information we need to make the right financial decisions is empowering. I would have never gotten out of debt if I hadn’t pulled all of the information together and noticed how bad I was doing. When I can get information at my fingertips, I can make actionable changes. I’ve grown my net worth from -$75,000 to over $200,000 in a few short Â years. This was all due to my desire to get out of debt, change my financial life, and just take control of my money. It’s been great seeing my savings account grow, being able to pay for things with cash, and enjoying the credit card rewards I get when I pay off my card every month (I will use credit cards every day :0 ). Anyway, I just wanted to share the cool news about the new ability to get banking information and pay your bills with just your voice and Amazon. Since I’m a Prime member, this intrigues me even more, though I don’t have an Echo yet. Manage Your Money in One Place for Free Personal Capital changed my life. Their free service allowed me to see all of my financial accounts in one place, but also where I was going wrong with my investments. I have been able to grow my wealth and create a positive net worth all with their free service. Make sure to check out my review and read more about Personal Capital I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a blog management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar , which is a great blog that I co-own. I’ve been seeing a lot about the Echo.  So far it seems to be getting a lot of press but stays sort of on the fringe.  I would expect innovations like this could get it even more attention. Yeah, I noticed it when it came out, but wan’t really impressed, but they have added more “skill” to the platform and this is a cool one to me. Sometimes I love the innovation of technology.
