Has Amazon Signed Wal-Mart's Death Warrant With Entry Into Grocery? - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha 50% of Wal-Mart's revenue today is grocery-related. Wal-Mart didn't enter grocery until the year 2000. No question Wal-Mart's revenue has been under pressure for last two years. Amazon is attacking every consumer-related niche not nailed down, much as Wal-Mart did in the 80s and 90s. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), the retail and grocery giant, does not report its fiscal Q1 '17 financial results until Thursday, May 19th, 2016, but watching Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) new ventures, like AmazonFresh and Amazon's grocery delivery service, you can't help but wonder if Wal-Mart feels like it is standing in front of the proverbial freight train with little signs of it stopping. Wal-Mart comps have been positive for 6 quarters in a row, although just between 0%-1%, but more importantly "traffic" as the comp attributor has now been positive for 5 quarters in a row. Neighborhood comps have been trending mid-to-high single digits; another positive data point. Gross margin trends in the 25% area have remained stable to higher, but that has to happen as Wal-Mart's decision to pay rank-and-file workers a higher minimum wage has put significant pressure on the operating margin which fell 92 bps year over year in the January 2016 quarter. The bright side of this is that Wal-Mart's operating margin laps much easier comps starting with this quarter, i.e. Q1 '17. After reporting Q4 '16 financial results, Wal-Mart's Q1 '17 consensus estimates of $0.88 and $113.275 billion in revenue have been steady, and today are $0.88 on $113.226 billion in revenue. Some margin improvement at Wal-Mart could generate a nice upside surprise for the retail giant. However, that doesn't change the bigger picture at this point and that picture is that Amazon probably possesses the best business model for the 21st century and that Wal-Mart's $480-$500 billion in annual revenue lies directly in Amazon's path and is ripe for the taking. Back in the mid-1990s and I can't remember the name of the Wal-Mart CEO at the time, but this individual (probably David Glass) was being interviewed by Forbes or Fortune, and when asked about market share goals for the retail giant, his response was "all of it". It is no great mystery, but Amazon is doing to Wal-Mart in the last two decades what Wal-Mart did to the rest of inefficient retail in the 1980s and 1990s. And the key is "cost structure"; the lowest cost structure wins. Now, getting back to the Amazon's entry into grocery: to give readers some perspective, when Wal-Mart entered the grocery business in 2000, Wal-Mart's annual revenue was roughly $167 billion ($166.9 billion to be exact in fiscal 2000). Today, Wal-Mart's annual revenue is roughly $480 billion for a compound annual growth rate of 6.97%. However, in the last 15-16 years, grocery has risen to 50% of revenue today, which means that "grocery" as a product line today is $244 billion in annual revenue to Wal-Mart starting from $0, 15-16 years ago. Just Wal-Mart's expected grocery revenue in fiscal 2017 ($244 billion) is bigger than Amazon's current calendar year consensus revenue of $133 billion. And what has made grocery so successful for Wal-Mart over the years is that it fits perfectly with its model of "high-volume, low-margin" product lines that generate foot traffic, and which was then "convenient" for people to buy other Wal-Mart goods as they headed into the store to buy groceries. If AmazonFresh and Amazon grocery delivery can draw even 10% of Wal-Mart's national grocery business (which maybe why it wants to start its own 2-hour delivery service, which has gained some traction already in the tonier areas just north of downtown Chicago), you can see the market share starting to take shape for Amazon. You can see why general retail is starting to see Amazon as John Boehner saw Ted Cruz (i.e. "Lucifer in the flesh"), albeit anyone that has studied retail for years could see this coming. But grocery is the last and biggest market for traditional retail (as I see it). There are too many Amazon bulls right now (judging by last week's Ira Sohn conference), and the stock is still below its late 2015 high, with the ramp in FANG stocks last year. My own pedestrian opinion is that Wal-Mart has to reduce store openings, move more towards the Amazon model and buy back a lot of stock, just as Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) did under Frank Blake which I wrote about here . As a single guy, I don't do a lot of grocery shopping, and when I do, it's not very meaningful in terms of the dollars spent. But I do frequent some of the retail grocery stores in Lincoln Park, just north of downtown Chicago, like Plum Market and Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), and I see Amazon's delivery service already being used and not in small quantities. This could be another genius move by Amazon and it could really hurt Wal-Mart. But the key aspect is how much market share Amazon can take and how quickly. The Amazon trucks and the 2-hour delivery service now makes a ton of sense when wrapped in the "grocery" market. It will be interesting to watch and monitor Wal-Mart's response. This is classic Porter's "Competitive Strategy" at work and readers should take not of it. Just to clarify, I've been a huge fan of Wal-Mart over the years and Sam Walton's genius in creating a truly global and national business based on one simple concept: low cost and low price. However, Amazon and Bezos are doing to Sam and the Walton's what the Walton's did to retail for years.
