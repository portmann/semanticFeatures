Warren Buffett Couldn't Care Less About Tech Stocks - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) | Seeking Alpha Berkshire Hathaway's stakes in Apple and IBM have been grossly overplayed and misunderstood by the media and investors. While it may appear Buffett has backed away from his consistent history of not investing in tech companies, there is more to the story. If you're a follower of Buffett, don't take this as a reason to start changing course and playing in the tech space, as Buffett's investment fundamentals have not changed. A lot has been made from Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) investments in IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Some people question if Warren Buffett, the man who is notorious for avoiding tech companies, has made a significant shift with these investments. First of all, it is most widely known that Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple had little to nothing to do with Warren Buffett at all. Nevertheless, I am going to try and explain why investing in Apple and IBM signals no change in Buffett's investment philosophy, and why it shouldn't open the floodgates for Buffett fans to start playing in the tech arena. Apple has moved away from its technology identity in several different ways, including their future growth, innovation, and of course, valuation. Yes, in the broader sense, Apple is still a technology company - not looking to cause a debate among the people who this matters to. However, in comparison to its counterparts, its identity has made one of the bigger shifts. Investors have finally seen Apple's growth stall in 2016. With the slowdown on the topline comes the typical crowd of investors yelling for the next revolutionary iPod type of product to boost sales again (like it's so easy). But the fact is, Apple is trading at a price due to its image being aligned as a consumer electronics company. And that is one of the reasons why Berkshire Hathaway would like it. If you look at Apple, it shows all the signs of a stock that Warren Buffett would own; cheap valuation, strong cash flow, strong dividend, and share buybacks. At a P/E of 10.9, Apple is trading below the consumer electronics industry average, which is cheap given that the company has a history of maintaining a strong operating margin at around 30%. And Buffett loves strong cash flow because it is synonymous with a bigger and stronger dividend. Currently, Apple has a payout ratio of 23.46%, which seems a little low, but it actually helps keep Apple's face in the technology arena. Reserving that cash is likely a better move for Apple than paying out a larger dividend, which it can easily do. For a company like Apple, the bulk of its profits are better kept on hand and allocated to buybacks, acquisitions, R&D, etc., rather than raising its payout ratio and distributing back to shareholders. And even with a payout ratio of only 23.46%, investors are getting a dividend yield of 2.12% - not too bad. IBM mirrors Apple in many ways - cheap P/E multiple, strong cash flow margin, solid dividend. Sure, it's also facing issues across its topline, but companies like Apple and IBM have great margins and high ROA. So, Wall Street doesn't see them as a tech company anymore - big deal. They produce enough cash flow to sustain their dividend with a payout ratio of 39.29%. What's more, the company has a longstanding history dating back over 100 years - Buffett likes his time tested companies. IBM is an obvious Buffett play, not because it is a tech company, but because it is a high producing cash flow company at a P/E of 11.5. The chart below shows the steady increases in dividend by IBM and Apple, as well as the low price to free cash flow ratios. Look at Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) for example. Buffett loves Wells Fargo, but why? It's because its operations are worth multiples more than many of its competitors. Now the difference with Wells Fargo is that it doesn't appear investors are getting a steep discount. It trades at a very high price to tangible book value of 1.93. Compare that to Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) which trades at a ratio of only 0.94 and Wells Fargo looks like it's trading at a premium - but it's not. Wells Fargo has a leading ROA of 1.27%, which is significantly higher than Bank of America. Combine that with the fact that Wells Fargo has seen positive revenue growth over the last 3 years compared to Bank of America's negative growth and, of course, it's going to trade at a price to tangible book ratio of more than double Bank of America's. Below you can see the comparison between Wells Fargo and Bank of America's ROA and price to tangible book values. So, what does Wells Fargo have in common with Apple and IBM? Same things you'd expect from a Buffett company - stable dividend, high value operations, strong cash flow, and a time-tested brand. Warren Buffett's investments into technology isn't like investing in "technology." It is, in my opinion, a significantly low-risk move compared to other opportunities in the tech space. Rather than comparing it to the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), I think of it more like HP (NYSE: HPQ ). To me, this shows no sign of strategy change or a shift towards the tech space. I believe Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway still maintain the same fundamental investment principles as always, and investments in Apple and IBM demonstrate that. Too much has been made out of this by the financial media. If you're a Warren Buffett follower, then don't go jumping straight into the tech space. Continue to seek out fair prices for great companies across all sectors. For now, Berkshire Hathaway hasn't made any new drastic moves. When Buffett decides to invest in Amazon at a triple-digit P/E ratio, then wake me up.
