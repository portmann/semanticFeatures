Etsy: Is The Bear Case Valid? - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha There is a perception that Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) may have or has a counterfeit, trademark or copyright issue. Zacks has an article in which the Wedbush analyst feels roughly 5% of listings, or nearly 2 million listings, could be problematic. Counterfeit candidates include items infringing on Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Michael Kors, as well as a wide range of Disney and NFL brands. The table below shows the number of listings returned via the Etsy search function. The total number of listings on July 2, 2015, was 32,229,245. My research suggests that the counterfeit, trademark, copyright issue might be overstated. If one assumes all the listing shown below were problematic, it will total 1.10% of listings, not approximately 5%. Any counterfeit, trademark or copyright issue is a concern. The WSJ has an article raising concerns over Handmade at Amazon. Competition is always a concern. However, it is unclear if Amazon would pose a greater competitive threat than eBay. Lock in the cost (fee) structure for current sellers, as long as they list a certain number of listings or generate so much revenue. This might attract new sellers to the platform. Moreover, it could reward the sellers that helped build the site. Create major categories for handmade, vintage, wholesale (new) items. This could assist buyers in locating items. The search feature could provide a filter to expand or contract what items would be displayed. Small sellers may enjoy helping build the Etsy site over being a small fish in the large pond of Amazon or eBay. Sellers moving to Amazon or eBay might be attracted by the idea of having more eyeballs viewing their items but may find the competition to be greater. Their items might be harder to find on the Amazon or eBay platform. Also, repeat buyers may not follow to a different venue. Investor sentiment and price action have been poor. Some details in the first earnings release caught some by surprise. This soured investor sentiment. The first quarter report alerted investors to issues to consider for the second quarter. Second Quarter 2015 Outlook: Factors to Consider We'd like to highlight a few factors that we believe will impact Etsy's second quarter 2015 results. First, if foreign exchange rates continue at current levels, it will likely continue to impact buyer behavior outside of the U.S. Second, we expect to increase the pace of hiring in the second quarter compared with both the first quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2014. Third, we plan to spend more on marketing in absolute dollars in the second quarter compared with both the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2014. Finally, we would like to remind investors that second quarter 2015 results will include some one-time expenses such as Etsy's $300,000 cash contribution to Etsy.org described in the Etsy prospectus filed on April 16, 2015, and approximately $300,000 in IPO expenses not deductible from Etsy's IPO proceeds. Etsy faces some challenges. However, the challenges do not appear to be anything that has not been faced over the past 10 years. The current rebound in the number of listings is encouraging. Should the trend in listings continue to improve then the bears might reconsider or question if the bear case is still valid. I'm long Etsy and considering selling out of the money puts to add to the position at a discount to the current price. Source: Etsy: Is The Bear Case Valid? Disclosure: I am/we are long ETSY.
