It could be if Amazon’s latest patent ever makes it to the real world. TheÂ  new patent details the tech company’s work to create a system aimed at simplifying the way smartphone owners use and access the technology in their phones, The Next Web reports. A rendering of the technology from Amazon’s patent shows how certain points of one’s ear might be used under the new system. This is Amazon’s attempt to resolve consumers’ dueling desires for increased privacy and advanced ease of use. “While various software applications offer differing levels of personalization, many electronic devices such as cellular phones and tablet computers still have fixed inputs for various buttons or other input elements of the device,” the patent states. “Even where some level of personalization is enabled, such as at various levels of a user interface, the user typically must login or enter other identifying information for the device, which can be frustrating if the user needs to repeatedly enter the information.” And so, Amazon has created a technology thatÂ not only simplifies howÂ users answer their phones, but also automatically adjusts certain preferences such as speaker volume depending on the ear being used. The system works byÂ taking a photo of a user’s ear â€“ which is reportedly an equally unique identifier as a fingerprint â€“ with the phone’s front camera and comparing it to a photo previously captured by the user and subsequently stored in aÂ database. The ear recognition input would then let owners utilize their device for certain purposes like receiving a call or listening to an audio file without first manually unlocking their phones. “In some embodiments, the device analyzes the captured information to determine whether the user is holding the device near the user’s right ear or left ear, and adjusts functionality of the device based at least in part upon how the user is likely holding the phone,” the patent states. “In other embodiments, the device attempts to recognize the user based on ear shape or other parameters, and can provide customized functionality of the device based at least upon that determination.” Click to print (Opens in new window) New Amazon Phone Will Reportedly Be An AT&T Exclusive Google Receives Patent For Wearable “Odor Removal Device” « Hereâ€™s Why You Shouldnâ€™t Put Your $10K Apple Watch Between Powerful Magnets CVS Buying Target's Pharmacy Business For $1.9 Billion Michael Kors Settles Class Action Over Imaginary Outlet Prices Florida Officials Warning Swimmers Of Flesh-Eating Bacteria Responsible For 2 Deaths This Year Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
