Amazon Chops $32 Off Amazon Prime Membership Price In One-Day Sale For New Subscribers â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Amazon is in a pretty good mood after snagging five Emmys for its original series, Transparent, and to celebrate, it’s giving new subscribers to its Prime service $32 off the usual price. This is a one-day-only kind of deal: starting Sept. 25 from 12:00 a.m. ET and lasting through 11:59 p.m. PT, new members will pay $67 for their first year of Prime, instead of $99, Amazon announced Tuesday . Though there aren’t more details included on the site right now, we’d presume that the price would return to $99 after that first year of membership is up. Along with free, two-day shipping on millions of items, Prime members have access to free streaming TV shows, movies, music and books, as well as unlimited cloud storage for photos. And don’t forget those free and discounted Washington Post subscriptions . While this kind of a discount might seem like it’d take a big chunk out of Amazon’s profits, the e-commerce giant is betting it’ll make that $32 back pretty quickly: according to research we read about back in January , the average Amazon Prime customer spends an estimated $1,500 per year on the e-commerce site, compared to $625 for nonmembers.
