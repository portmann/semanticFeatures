ETF Hub May 20 2015, 19:00 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor A survey from research firm CIRP suggests Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) U.S. Prime subscriber base has risen by a modest 1M since the end of 2014 to 41M (an estimated 42% of Amazon's total U.S. customers). The firm notes growth was limited by users cancelling subscriptions following a 30-day free trial holiday season promo - in December, Amazon said it added over 10M new Prime users during the holiday season. CIRP also estimates U.S. Prime subs are currently spending at an $1,100/year run rate, down from $1,500 during the holiday season - some doubts exist about those numbers. 34% of U.S. Amazon customers are believed to own a Kindle tablet or e-reader. Amazon remains unwilling to disclose its Prime sub count, though it has stated Prime subs rose 53% globally and 50% in the U.S. in 2014. RBC estimated last September Prime had 30M-40M U.S. and 40M-50M total subs At the full $99/year rate (many users still get discounts ), 41M subs would yield $4.06B in annual revenue. CIRP's numbers come a week after Wal-Mart announced it plans to launch a $50/year Amazon Prime rival. Wal-Mart's service will promise delivery in 3 days compared with Prime's 2, and won't (initially at least) come with content services such as Prime Instant Video, Music, and Photos. Another way to look at this - they already have nearly 50% of US households, and still they are not profitable.  Sounds like they have already saturated the market. you have to remember prime subscribers maximize their membership and can get 1-2 day delivery on purchases which the utilize. I really doubt Amazon beaks even on Prime. Would be nice if they showed revenue and expenses in the Prime column. a large percentage of the 10MM new subscribers during holiday decided that prime was not worth it and cancelled after their 30 day free trial Tons of people sign up for trials and cancel REPEATEDLY.   The percentage of trial users that stay is most likely decreasing rapidly since the vast majority that want and value Prime already have it.    Others like myself that order once or twice / year from Amazon will keep "trying" Prime.
