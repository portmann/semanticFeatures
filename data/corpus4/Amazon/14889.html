Amazon in talks to buy online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter: Forbes | Reuters (Reuters) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) is in talks to buy online luxury retailer Net-a-porter in what could be the biggest acquisition yet for the e-commerce giant, but the negotiations are in early stages and could fall apart, Forbes reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. The potential deal, first reported by Women's Wear Daily, could value Net-a-Porter lower than the valuation of 2 billion euros reported by the fashion industry trade journal, Forbes said, citing the person. ( onforb.es/1IBlus9 ) Seattle-based Amazon has long eyed the high-end fashion retail sector and any deal for Net-a-Porter would mean a new commitment in an area where the company lacks a strong presence, Forbes said. "It's Day 1 in the category," Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos told the New York Times in an interview in 2012, saying the company was making a "significant" investment in fashion to convince top brands that it wanted to work with them, not against them. ( nyti.ms/1IBnGjk ) Net-a-Porter is owned by luxury goods group Richemont (CFR.VX), which bought the London-based company for 392 million euros in 2010. Amazon.com, Net-a-Porter and Richemont could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours.
