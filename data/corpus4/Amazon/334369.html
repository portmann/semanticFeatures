Amazon: Grocery Shopping Has Never Been Easier - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is partnering with Morrisons to enter the UKâ€™s fast-growing online grocery space. Positive implication to the company to expanding its e-commerce vertical while leveraging Morrisons' fresh food supply chain expertise. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) made its entry into the UK grocery delivery space by striking a supply agreement with Morrisons, which will supply fresh and frozen food to the e-commerce giant. Delivery of the product could take as little as an hour, which also highlights AMZN's logistics capability. This move allows the company to compete directly with the UK's large and small supermarket stores. Morrisons' stock was up +5% on the back of this news while Ocado ( OTC:OCDDY ), a leading UK grocery e-commerce site that also partners with Morrisons, saw its shares down -10%. The idea of grocery delivery is nothing new in the UK with the incumbent Ocado already partnering with Morrisons in delivering fresh and frozen produce to the UK households. However, I believe that AMZN's entry will accelerate the e-commerce penetration in non-conventional categories such as food and groceries. Consumers will ultimately benefit from the increased convenience while the e-commerce giant will benefit from a broader service and product diversification. I see this to be a long-term positive for Amazon's Prime ecosystem and its logistics capability. I remain bullish on AMZN. While I acknowledge that the company's near-term investment in fulfilment and logistics will continue to weigh in on its near-term profitability, I also argue that these investments are necessary for AMZN to capture underpenetrated markets and counter the potential competitive risk from rival Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) which operates a far bigger logistics service and could potentially be a long-term threat to Amazon. Amazon launched its fresh food delivery in Seattle back in 2007 and a couple of other US cities while food delivery in the overseas market has focused on packaged goods given the complexity of the delivery and logistics cold chain. AMZN's multi-year investment in logistics appears to be paying off with its recent entry into the UK grocery delivery space, which is expected to nearly double to GBP 17.2b (~$23.85b) in the five years to 2020 according to the IGD research. Worth noting, all of UK's big four supermarkets (i.e. Tesco ( OTCPK:TSCDY ), Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons) are investing in online grocery on the back of a rising consumer demand. Where I think both Morrisons and AMZN can benefit each other is that Morrisons can leverage AMZN's e-commerce expertise and logistics to scale up its online presence, which is still small relative to that of Tesco and Asda. Similarly, AMZN can leverage Morrisons' existing fresh food supply chain without having to invest in additional capital. In the medium term, AMZN and Morrisons could take more market share in UK's online grocery space. What matters the most is whether AMZN may strike similar deals in North America by partnering with chains such as Kroger (NYSE: KR ), SuperValu (NYSE: SVU ) and Albertsons (NYSE: ABS ) in the US, and Metro Inc. and Loblaw ( OTCPK:LBLCF ) in Canada. Such a scenario will accelerate the e-commerce penetration of groceries and food items, drive long-term Prime ecosystem expansion and could potentially be a negative to sub-scale regional supermarket chains that lack superior e-commerce presence. Conclusion - I remain bullish on AMZN. In my view, the UK is a testing ground to many of Amazon's concepts before the company rolls them out in the US market.
