Apple: Hedging Donald Trump's Threat - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In an article on Tuesday, the Financial Times discussed Donald Trump's threat to get Apple to manufacture its products in the U.S. As the FT notes, and as previous articles in other publications have pointed out, it would be particularly difficult for Apple to increase U.S. manufacturing. We discuss why, and present a few hedges for Apple shareholders concerned that the increasing prospects of Trump becoming president might weigh on their shares. In a recent Seeking Alpha article ( Time To Consider Trump Insurance ), we mentioned Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's tariff threat against United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) subsidiary Carrier. Carrier came up in a March 8th Financial Times article (requires registration) - Trump Hits List Of Corporate Targets On Campaign Trail - but so did a company we hadn't mentioned in our Trump Insurance article, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The FT summarized Trump's case against Apple in the tweet screen-captured below, but the article includes an interesting, earlier Trump complaint about the company. Mr Trump's biggest problem with Apple was with the size of their iPhones. "I have a lot of Apple stock -- and I miss Steve Jobs," he said in a Facebook post. "Tim Cook must immediately increase the size of the screen on the iPhone," he urged, or Apple would "lose a lot of business" to Samsung's larger smartphones. The article goes on to note that Apple ended up offering larger iPhone screens the following year, "unlocking huge new growth for the iPhone." Trump's suggestion about screen size in 2013 counters the claim made by some that he isn't a savvy businessman. But how would Apple react to a Trump trade policy that punished it for manufacturing most of its products outside the U.S.? In our earlier Trump insurance article, we mentioned that a company like Carrier, which recently announced plans to shutter an air conditioner plant in the U.S., could decide to reopen that plant to serve the domestic market. But, as the FT suggests, Apple would face more challenges increasing manufacturing here: Only one Apple product, the high-priced Mac Pro desktop computer, has its final assembly in the US today but the company sources several components domestically [...] Nonetheless, increasing its US manufacturing base has not been without challenges for Apple. In one high-profile case, in 2013 it invested $578m in an Arizona supplier of sapphire, GT Advanced Technology. But GT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014 after struggling to meet Apple's production standards [...] The FT's description of Apple's manufacturing challenges in the U.S. brings to mind Jordan Weissman's 2012 Atlantic article ("Why the United States Will Never, Ever Build The iPhone"). Weissman quoted Tim Cook's statement that Apple had moved production to China because of Chinese manufacturers' ability to "scale up" faster, and then drilled down to what that actually means: What does it mean to "scale up" faster? For Foxconn, the global manufacturing behemoth Apple pays to assemble its products, it's the ability to hire thousands of new workers in a single day. It's being able to wake up 8,000 employees, herd them out of the company's on-sight dorms, and order them pull a midnight shift fastening glass screens onto phones. In China, workers are cheap, plentiful, and -- most importantly -- mind bogglingly compliant in ways that America's culture and its tightly enforced labor laws simply wouldn't allow. If you're concerned that the prospect of a protectionist U.S. President could start to weigh on Apple shares as Trump gets closer to winning the Republican nomination - or if you are just wary of a market pullback - consider a few different hedges for an Apple long position. For those who would like a refresher on hedging terms, please see the section titled "Refresher On Hedging Terms" in our article on hedging another tech stock, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Limiting Tesla Risk After Citron's Short . If you know the future direction of the market or of a particular security with 100% certainty, then you don't need to hedge. Hedging is for those of us who aren't certain of what is going to happen. If you knew with 100% certainty that Trump would become president and that that would hurt Apple, you wouldn't want to own Apple at all. Instead, you might want to short the stock. Hedging Apple is for those who remain bullish on the company but want to limit their downside risk in the event their bullishness turns out to have been wrong. We use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and optimal collars to hedge AAPL below, but you don't need the app to do this. You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to take the time and do the work. Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app, an additional piece of information you'll need to supply (along with the number of shares you're looking to hedge) when scanning for optimal puts is your "threshold," which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. When we last looked at hedging Apple, we used a threshold of 15%. This time, we'll be more conservative and use a threshold of 10%. If you are more risk-averse, you could use a smaller threshold. And if you are less risk-averse, you could use a larger one. All else equal, though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge. These were the optimal puts, as of Tuesday's close to hedge 500 shares of AAPL against a greater-than-10% drop by late-October. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $4,200, or 8.31% of position value. Since this cost is fairly high, we are including this hedge mainly for illustration purposes. A couple of points about this cost though: To be conservative, the cost was based on the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and ask). The 10% threshold includes this cost, i.e., in the worst-case scenario, your AAPL position would be down 1.69%, not including the hedging cost. When searching for an optimal collar, you'll need one more number in addition to your threshold, your "cap," which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge. For example, if you're hedging over a several-month period, and you think a security won't appreciate more than 6% over that time frame, then it might make sense to use 6% as a cap; you don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that. Last time we hedged Apple, we tried using Portfolio Armor's website to get an estimate of AAPL's potential return over the time frame of the hedge. But at that time, Apple didn't pass the two screens to avoid bad investments that the site runs on every hedgeable security in the U.S., so the site didn't calculate a potential return for it. This time, Apple passed those two screens, so the site did calculate a potential return for it, albeit a low one: 2.4%. Since we were able to raise that to 3% without raising hedging cost, we used 3% as the cap for the first collar below (if you're concerned that 3% is too low of an estimate, fear not: we'll use Wall Street's higher estimate in a second optimal collar). As of Tuesday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of AAPL against a greater-than-10% drop by late-October, while not capping an investor's upside by less than 3%. As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $2,250, or 4.45%, as a percentage of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $3,225, or 6.38% of position value. So, the net cost of this optimal collar was negative, meaning an investor would have collected $975 more from the call leg than he paid for the put leg, an amount equal to 1.93% of position value. Similar to the situation with the optimal put, to be conservative, the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls. In practice, an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so in reality, an investor would likely have collected more than $975, or 1.93% of position value, when opening the hedge. Although the threshold takes into account positive hedging cost (as in the case of the put example), it doesn't take into account negative hedging cost, as in this case. So, assuming, conservatively, that the negative hedging cost here is 1.93%, the worst case scenario with this hedge wouldn't be 10%, but 10% - 1.93% = 8.17%. Similarly, the best case scenario wouldn't be 3%, the level of the cap, but 3% + 1.93% = 4.93%. For those who feel 3% is too low of a potential return, we'll use a potential return derived from the median Wall Street price target on Apple, as provided by Yahoo Finance (the screen capture below is from Yahoo). That median price target of $130 represents about a 29% increase from Apple's Tuesday closing price of $101.03, but those price targets go out 1 year, and we're going to be hedging Apple out about 7 months. So we've used 17% as a cap (~7/12ths of 29%) below. As of Tuesday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of AAPL against a >10% drop by late-October while not capping an investor's upside at less than 17%. As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar, the cost of the put leg was $3,100, or 6.14% of position value. But the income generated from selling the call leg was $1,100, or 2.18% of position value. So the net cost of this optimal collar was $2,000, or 3.96% of position value. As in the case of the two previous hedges, the cost here was calculated conservatively, so an investor likely would have paid less than $2,000 to open this hedge. And as in the case of the put hedge, the threshold here includes the hedging cost, so, in the worst case scenario, an investor would be down 6.04%, not including the cost of the hedge.
