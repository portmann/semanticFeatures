Facebook: If You Can't Buy 'Em, Copy 'Em! - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg knows how to hold a grudge. His response to Snapchat's (Private: CHAT ) $3 billion buyout refusal comes three years later in the form of utter imitation. The phrase goes, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em," but I suppose Mr. Zuckerberg's twist is, "If you can't buy 'em, copy 'em." "Stories" is Instagram's newest feature that allows users to post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. Sound familiar? This is exactly what Snapchat's "Stories" feature does, too. The question that investors must ask themselves is why Instagram chose to integrate this feature into its application. On Facebook's Q2 conference call , Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Instagram reached more than 500 million monthly active users with more than 300 million active daily. Instagram's monthly active user count has increased at a substantial rate (see below), so what is the issue here? Instagram has a problem with its daily active users (DAU) to monthly active users (MAU) ratio. Facebook has a whopping 1.13 billion DAUs versus 1.71 billion who are active monthly. The daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion who visit Facebook monthly. With this percentage as a baseline, Instagram is underperforming its parent company. Instagram's 300 million DAUs represents 60% of the 500 million users who use the application monthly, driving the need for innovation to boost engagement. Mr. Zuckerberg did not blatantly expose Instagram's shortfall on Facebook's conference call, but alluded to it. Facebook's CEO explained, "We're working on ways to make [the Instagram] experience even more engaging." Instagram has already changed the way it ranks posts to show users the posts they actually care about. The company knows that engagement is higher when people see posts from people or public figures in which they find interest. We now know the feature to which Mr. Zuckerberg was referring: Stories. Another article on the matter has been published since I began this writing, but the author, Alex Pitti, believes that Instagram Stories will turn out to be bearish for Facebook. To quickly address his piece: I disagree. And that is fine. After all, differing opinions is what makes a market. The point of contention is that Instagram Stories is currently viewed in a satirical, socially cautious light. Keep in mind that a majority of Instagram's user-base is composed of Millennials and teenagers, many of whom are afraid to be the first to publicly use new features for fear of social judgement. It may sound trite, but it is true. Currently, Instagram Stories is being used by many to recruit others to add them on Snapchat. Rather than using Instagram's Stories feature how it "should be used," people are instead posting their Snapchat usernames. Is the above a testament to the stickiness of Snapchat? Maybe. Does it mean that Snapchat is stealing away Instagram users? I do not know. The $19 billion company is private and does not release this type of information, so why bother theorizing about it? What I do know is that the above certainly is not how Mr. Zuckerberg envisioned people using Instagram Stories. However, it is too soon to spell doom for the feature. Mr. Zuckerberg has a fantastic track record of knowing what users will react to and when to give it to them. I do not believe that Instagram Stories will play out differently. Speaking anecdotally, I have found that people are quick to criticize an application's new feature, but shortly after forget their initial reaction and end up enjoying it. The first example to pop into my mind is that of Facebook's transition from "walls" to "timelines." You may not even remember having a Facebook "wall" for others to post onto -- and that is my point. So where is the investment thesis in all this? Although Instagram has approximately one-third the MAUs of Facebook, the app exists solely on mobile. With mobile advertising revenue composing 84% of Facebook's total advertising revenue during the second quarter, Instagram has and will play an increasingly important role. Furthermore, I believe that Instagram Stories will help increase DAUs. Because the stories are only public for 24 hours, users must continually return to the app to view them. This is important to investors as many like to see an increasing rate of DAUs as a percentage of MAUs. If this metric can become more in-line with Facebook's MAU to DAU ratio of 66%, then it may warrant a higher multiple for shares of Facebook. Additionally, I do not believe that Instagram Stories is a feature that will attract an overwhelming amount of new users. It is a feature that is solely meant to boost daily activity -- and I believe that this is exactly what Mr. Zuckerberg was after. In the coming quarters, Instagram's core goal should be to boost the percentage of MAUs who are also DAUs, not just the former. By introducing a feature that caters to those who have already downloaded the appliation, Instagram can easily boost their MAU figure and please investors. Whether you use Snapchat or Instagram, or simply invest in the latter via Facebook stock, Instagram Stories impacts you. Looking at the feature from an investing perspective, Instagram Stories is a feature that could greatly impact the application's ratio of DAUs to MAUs, a key metric followed by investors. With many believing that Instagram Stories is initially a flop, it is possible that the feature's impact on activity is not yet factored into Facebook's stock price.
