Amazon: 10 Implications Of A Profitable AWS - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's crown jewel AWS is doing better than anyone thought. It's both profitable and growing at a 49% year-over-year rate. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shares rallied over 14% after the company beat both profit and revenue expectations. For the first quarter, Amazon lost only 12 cents a share versus expectations of a loss of 13 cents, while Amazon revenue increased to $22.72 billion versus expectations of $22.39 billion. Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) division also beat expectations. Most people expected AWS to be yet another breakeven to money losing division that Amazon ran to capture more growth ahead. Instead AWS turned out to be profitable. For first quarter 2015, the division made $265 million in operating profit on revenues of $1.57 billion. AWS revenue runrate came in higher than Citi's estimate of $6.6 billion for 2015 and $9 billion for 2016. (My calculations show a runrate closer to $7 billion for 2015.) Different people have different ideas on how AWS should be valued. The pessimists don't see any value in AWS as they believe it will be cannibalized by other giants in the race to the bottom. Other market participants use peer valuation and apply the peer standard 4x revenue on AWS. Personally, I believe AWS should garner a premium valuation. Given that AWS is the leader in the space with 28% market share, it has more of a moat and revenue visibility than its competitors. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and other leading tech companies used to garner a 10x revenue valuation when they were in similar stages of development. I think that the same can be applied to AWS. The virtuous cycle continues. Because Amazon stock is rising, Amazon can retain/attract the best and brightest who go to Amazon to make the world's next great products. Once those products find traction, Amazon stock rises again. Consumers win. The market reaction to AWS numbers gives Amazon the green light to pursue more money losing projects that may or may not work. This means more Amazon Fire phones in the future. Given that it is profitable, AWS could easily become an independent company. As a leading cloud infrastructure provider, AWS would command a higher valuation than what the market is currently assigning it. Amazon is unlikely to spin off AWS unless its stock tanks. If Amazon stock tanks, the virtuous cycle ends, and Amazon may have no choice but to spin off AWS to maintain its stock price, so that it can retain its tech talent. The cloud infrastructure sector has passed the land grab phase. Amazon would not release AWS numbers unless it was sure that it could maintain its marketshare - otherwise releasing these numbers would do Amazon more harm than good as it would encourage more competition. The race for number 2 is on. Given that the cloud is now in the consolidation phase, AWS competitors will take a hard look at Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ) as a potential acquisition to gain marketshare. Computing and storage prices will fall even faster than before, as competitors try harder to become the number 2 player in the sector. AWS growth could slow more than expected in the later half of the year as interest rates rise and tech startup valuations potentially decline. Long term, AWS has a good shot at becoming the next great computing platform.
