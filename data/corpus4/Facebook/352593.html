Lean In Or Out Of Facebook? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is far outperforming the peer group in EBITDA margin performance. Facebook is performing very similar to their peers in Return on Invested Capital. A few days ago, TIME reported on Mark Zuckerberg's most important meeting of the day: feeding his daughter, Max, using the hashtag #LeanInTogether. This interesting, personal connection to the Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) founder encouraged me to take a second look at how his company is performing compared to their mission and their peer companies. Facebook's stated mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. The latest Facebook 10-K filing references an industry characterized by innovation, rapid change and disruptive technologies. So, how does Facebook measure up? In a comparison of Facebook's stated peer group companies, from their latest proxy filing - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), EMC Corp (NYSE: EMC ), LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), VMWare (NYSE: VMW ) and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) - at nearly 46% EBITDA margin, Facebook is significantly outperforming their peers (25.94%). While some analysts may argue that high EBITDA margin could mean the death of innovation and growth for technology companies, Facebook has consistently outperformed their peers since Q2 2013 (Exhibit 1). During the same time horizon, Facebook has been tracking pretty consistently in Return on Invested Capital (3.51%) with the median value for their peer group (3.37%) over the last four quarters (Exhibit 2). This metric, designed to calculate a company's efficiency at allocating capital to generate returns, combined with the EBITDA margin performance, indicates an interesting paradox to explore regarding Facebook's future performance. In determining the future value of a company, many more metrics and measurements are required than simply EBITDA margin and Return on Invested Capital. For instance, Facebook's 0.71% Debt-to-Equity ratio is far lower than the median value of their peer group at 36.7%. And, Facebook's 11.67x Enterprise Value/Forward Revenue (NTM) compared to peers at 3.91x ratio indicates there is a much larger opportunity here. As a potential investor, I would certainly like to see Facebook's ROIC increase over time to better align with AAPL at 11.15% for Q4, 2015. But, I think Facebook is poised to grow and increasingly lead their peer group in delivering total shareholder return. Prospective investors may want to #LeanInTogether to take advantage of this opportunity.
