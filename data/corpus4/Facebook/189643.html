Twitter: The Undervalued Social Giant - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Price per Monthly Active User 60% lower than Facebook's, 80% lower than LinkedIn's valuations. Project Lightning will turn Twitter into Media hub and increase MAUs. Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) stock price has been very turbulent since its IPO in January 2014. The stock has undulated between highs of $69 a share and has reached lows of under $25 a share recently. I've been doing some analysis of the social giants, Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ). Relatively speaking Twitter is very undervalued. Social networks play any kind of hybrid role of recruiting grounds, dating agencies, media platforms, newspapers, advertising battlegrounds and email replacements. Also, who knows what roles and innovations these companies will develop in future Twitter's financials vs. Facebook and LinkedIn What I've taken here in the revenue and user figures from the latest quarterly reports from LNKD, FB and TWTR. (Please point out in the comments if there are any errors). Then I've taken the market capitalization of the respective networks. I've created some new ratios. Price to revenue, price per user, and revenue per user. What I think is most important is the Price/User figure. As a stockholder, this is what you're paying for. You're buying users' attention and expecting the network to generate revenue from this through advertising or other means. Twitter's price per MAU is $54.78, compared to Facebook's $163.89, and LinkedIn's $250.82. This represents a 60% discount from Facebook's valuations and 80% from LinkedIn's Why have these valuations become as they are? Twitter and Facebook are very similar in nature I believe. People write statuses, brands interact and advertise, funny pictures and videos are shared. And the real commodity here is attention that is being sold to advertisers. While Facebook has grown very quickly, and monetized features very well since IPOing, shareholders have suddenly become very bullish. Maybe over bullish? Meanwhile Twitter's growth has been a little slower and monetization has been slower too. However both figures are still growing significantly. What I think has happened is investors has become overzealous with Facebook and overcautious on Twitter. I've included LKND's figures for reference only. I believe LinkedIn is a different kettle of fish to Twitter and Facebook. It has huge value to recruiters, salespeople and marketers because of the niche targeting and professional information base. Therefore I think LKND's higher valuation per user is justified. What's weighing on Twitter's share price? Recent controversy surrounding the leadership of Jack Dorsey has worried investors. The founder sharing the job does worry some investors. But Twitter can stand on its own two feet without Dorsey's full-time influence. And I believe that when these management worries pass, Twitter's stock price will carry less ballast, and rise. The announcement for Project Lightning is exciting. By rearranging tweets around events and stories, Twitter has the chance to take more attention away from traditional media (notably TV, newspapers, online media AND Facebook). I expect this to increase user numbers, ad spending and Twitter's revenue. Facebook is a saturated social giant with nearly a quarter of the world's population on board. Whereas Twitter has only a fifth of Facebook's numbers. Facebook's expectations of revenue growth are very high, while Twitter's are very low. If Twitter had the same valuation per user as Facebook, it would be at $75 per share. And if it grew to half the user base of Facebook, at the same valuation per user, it would be ~$180/share. In fact Twitter would be a great acquisition target for Facebook at its current valuation. If we add that into the equation, that increases the expected value of Twitter significantly. On many fronts I see Twitter as comparatively undervalued. And as the market cools down from its sell-off and readjusts, I expect significant upside from Twitter over the coming months and years.
