Are millennials abandoning Facebook? Not so much - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Apr  2 2016, 16:38 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor In some circles, the prevailing wisdom is that young users are abandoning Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) in favor of Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) and Instagram. A new comScore report calls this pessimism into question. See this chart . Facebook is the blue dot at the top right corner. In the coveted 18-34 year-old demographic, Facebook users spend more than 1,000 minutes per month on the social network. Reach is almost 100%, vs. 63% for Instagram and 38% for Snapchat. 1000 minutes sounds a lot, it's around half an hour a day. I still think that's way too much..who on earth spends 30 minutes on FB every day (??)... why waste 30 minutes of ur day browsing through garbage of your 1258 friends? I don't disagree but everyone I work with and most people I am friends with are on it every single day... It was a gold mine of an idea 1,600,000,000 people seem to disagree, and all facebook critics need to do is think about that number for ohhhh, i don't know 5 seconds and they should realize their folly. A lot of it could be on news sites. I probably spend that much time reading news articles from local TV stations on my FB news feed. I rarely watch TV, though. I would never short a young growth company with the potential that FB has to offer.  Iam very long and on any serious weakness will add more. When Millennials turn middle-age before long, they surely will return to FB that offers substantially more features than just pictures. Anyone who has passed age 30 know all too well how quickly time flies. When Millennials get married and have children, I doubt if they would continue to fraternize casually as much as they were younger using Snapchat or Instagrams. FB is right to focus on mature users who are at the peak of their earning power with huge disposable incomes to purchase big-budget items and engage in luxurious vacations, for example. Youngsters below 30 are really small fries in comparison. Also, FB is so entrenched as the free, predominant social platform for all age groups that finding people that share common interests is the simplest and easiest way to go.
