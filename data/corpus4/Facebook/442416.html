Facebook hires Google Fiber co-founder for connectivity team - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Jun 24 2016, 18:51 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Facebook ( FB -2.6%) is pressing its wireless connectivity ambitions by hiring Kevin Lo -- a co-founder of Google Fiber who served as the project's first manager when it was still a moonshot. Lo will hold the title of director of Infrastructure Connectivity and Investments at Facebook. He left Google last year just before the Alphabet ( GOOG -3.8%, GOOGL -4.2%) reorg. That means he'll help lead Facebook's partnerships tied to connectivity, including a recent deal to lay a new trans-Atlantic data cable with Microsoft as well as the Terragraph urban project. Facebook says, however, that it's definitely not getting into the service-provider business like Google Fiber is, and that Lo will not work on the controversial Free Basics emerging-markets app. ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
