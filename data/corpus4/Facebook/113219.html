Facebook: Trading Teens Doesn't Add Value - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook continues trading teen users on their different social platforms causing higher costs. The company is still predicting higher cost growth for the year and will be a key indicator on the Q2 earnings report. It definitely isn't news that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has a teen issue, but it clearly hasn't hurt the stock. The real issue is whether the stock is worth $240 billion if the group of social networking sites is only swapping out users including teens. The bull case continues that any teens leaving the Facebook site are going to Instagram that's owned by the social giant. The bear case is that Facebook gains nothing by having a user transfer sites and in fact might actually lose out by having higher costs to re-monetize the user on another site. According to the report from Frank N. Magid Associates Inc., users in the 13- to 17-year-old age range in the U.S. slipped on Facebook. The study found that users dropped for the second consecutive year. The concerning part for Facebook is that the trend accelerated this year, down 6 percentage points to 88% from 94% in 2013. The teen usage drop began from a peak at 95% in 2012. The trend is a mixed picture for Facebook with the teen group moving to competitors like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) or Snapchat, while also transitioning time to other media properties owned by Facebook like Instagram and WhatsApp. Possibly most concerning is that only 9% described Facebook as "safe" or "trustworthy." As an example, Pinterest ranked much higher with 30% agreeing that those words describe that service. The concern should exist that users transfer those issues toward the other properties of Facebook. Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom may attempt to keep a firewall from the privacy issues that are rampant with the Facebook site, but it ultimately is difficult for the influence and mindset to not impact user feelings about that site as well. With Facebook only reaching around $17.1 billion in revenue this year, the story to obtain a $240 billion valuation is the growing and substantial user base of all the properties owned. The company bought Instagram and WhatsApp with fast growing user sets and it even spun off Messenger into a separate app in an attempt to further establish a differentiated user base. The company has provided the following users totals for each sites: Facebook - 1.44 billion users as of March. Instagram - 300 million at start of December. Messenger - 700 million users as of March. WhatsApp - 800 million users as of April. One point to understand with these varying services is that a general link exists between Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Time spent on either app is time not spent on the other. Sure it is better to have a teen leave Facebook for Instagram instead of Twitter or Snapchat to keep that user in the ecosystem, but it doesn't add value to the company. What it does is keep from subtracting value or does it? A big part of the accelerating costs is the company has to now support what is four different services instead of one. Also, it has to figure out how to monetize the non-Facebook services and to a large extent it has to figure out how to monetize a user that left Facebook for Instagram. So in theory a North American teen on Facebook earned the company $8 during Q1 and now earns the company virtually $0 from transitioning to Instagram. At the same time, Instagram adds one more user to MAUs and Facebook probably doesn't subtract a user due to the teen still randomly visiting the site in order to count as a MAU. On the Q1 earnings call , Facebook released that costs in 2015 would still growth at least 50% and continue cutting into margins. Based on the projected cost growth, analysts now forecast earnings only growing 13% to $2.00. Revenues are going to grow around 37.5% to $17.1 billion so Facebook is losing leverage built up the last two years by the platform switch. Analysts do forecast earnings surging back to 30% growth next year, but that is yet to be proven. Investors are clearly willing to look past these escalating costs and assume the increases are transitional. Sure Facebook is doing a solid job of capturing teen users transitioning away from the main site into other owned sites like Instagram, but investors need to understand it has a cost. Constantly buying social media platforms and transitioning users is better than the alternative, but it doesn't create a lot of long-term value. The goal should be building a platform that maintains the users. Paying over 30x forward earnings is too expensive for the earnings growth and a stock with a market value approaching $250 billion.
