Facebook's DAU Figure May Decelerate In FY 2015 - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook reached 1 billion DAUs. Upon closer examination, DAUs have decelerated and growth rates will trend slightly lower. Facebook has already saturated 60% of the market. And if growth were to continue at the current pace, Facebook's saturation will reach 90% in 2018. Without significant reductions in PC and bandwidth prices, Facebook's MAU growth will eventually stabilize at 5% per year. Of course, Facebook can offset some of this impact through pricing and other mobile products. Also there's some potential for more rapid Internet penetration, so I'm still bullish. In a recent Facebook post , Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) had accomplished 1 billion in daily active users. Of course the daily active users figure isn't exactly going to be 1 billion when they do report in the next quarter because they use a 90-day average to express their engagement growth. Needless to say, Facebook reported 968 million daily active users in Q2, which would imply 3.3% usage growth based on their recent milestone announcement, which compares to 3.41% usage growth between Q1 2015 and Q2 2015. When working with averages you need both a combination of both lower values and higher values so the mean can gradually improve. In other words, Facebook would need to have 1.035 billion users by the end of the third quarter for Facebook to report 1 billion in daily active users when averaging 968 million users with 1.035 billion users. The daily active user figure would have to increase by approximately 35 million, so Facebook can average out to 1 billion daily active users. This would sustain 3.4% sequential growth and a 15.7% year-over-year growth rate. This is pretty important because it's much easier to sustain ad monetization when both the user base and the amount of engagement per user increases. Furthermore, Facebook has been able to increase ad pricing on ad units, which correspondingly compounds the growth of the top line. Of course, Facebook would need to see some acceleration in terms of daily active users over the course of September as it would take 35 million in additional users to sustain the sequential growth rate. Keep in mind Facebook has increased its DAU figure by 32 million units in the past two months, so some compounding or seasonal factor would have to play into the company's ability to sustain its DAU ramp. Otherwise investors will have to factor some deceleration in adoption, which will reduce growth expectations in the second half of the year. The transition between Q2 and Q3 tends to be swing quarters - sometimes the DAU metrics accelerate and in other cases they decelerate. In FY 2013 there was deceleration, whereas FY 2014 had some acceleration. It was estimated that in 2014 there was 40% saturation of Internet users, which implies the potential market is 2.88 billion in daily active users. However, Chinese Internet users totaled 642 million, so when excluding those users Facebook's total saturation potential was 2.2 billion in 2014. By the end of 2014, Facebook reported 1.393 billion monthly active users, which implied that the product had reached 63% market saturation. At this point, Facebook's total market size will need to grow more quickly than the remaining pool of viable users, otherwise growth will continue to decelerate. eMarketer estimates that by 2018, the number of total Internet users will grow to 3.6 billion in 2018 from 2.88 billion in 2014 at a 5.65% growth rate. In other words, Facebook will reach a point where it's fully saturating every additional Internet user that comes online. When excluding China I estimate there will be 2.74 billion Internet users in 2018. And if Facebook continues to grow users at a 15% growth rate, the company will reach 2.45 billion users by 2018. That's a 90% saturation rate. There's no way Facebook can exceed 100% saturation! This indicates that long-run growth of MAUs will eventually revert to a 5.6% growth rate unless cheaper PCs are sold into emerging markets and bandwidth costs decline more substantially. I go over the implications of lower-cost PCs in an article I recently published . But, basically growth in PC adoption is the biggest determinant to Facebook's MAU ramp over the next five years. Without a massive shift in PC and bandwidth pricing growth in users will be limited. However, the company can offset user deceleration by increasing the amount of activity on other social properties and through higher pricing on ads. So I don't anticipate revenues to rapidly decelerate even as I anticipate a meaningful rate of deceleration between FY 2017 and FY 2018. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as the good still outweighs much of the bad.
