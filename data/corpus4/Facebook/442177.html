Netflix CEO Reed Hastings changed his tune from “Never gonna happen!” to “Maaaaybe” in April when asked about offline viewing, saying the company should “keep an open mind” to the idea. Now, a new report from communications trade company LightReading (h/t Gizmodo ) citing an industry insider suggests that the feature could be coming to the streaming platform before 2016 is over and done. “We know from our sources within the industry that Netflix is going to launch this product,” says Dan Taitz, COO of Penthere, a company that works with download-to-go mobile video software. “My expectation is that by the end of the year Netflix will be launching download-to-go as an option for their customers.” LightReading also spoke to a Frost & Sullivan analyst who backed up the rumor, saying that Netflix is working on a downloading solution, calling the move somewhat of an “open secret” in the streaming video world. “It’s a natural progression for Netflix to want to have some of their content available for consumers to watch offline, and we’ve been hearing for months now that they are in fact going to roll something out soon,” the analyst said. Netflix is officially staying mum, however, saying in a statement, “While our focus remains on delivering a great streaming experience, we are always exploring ways to make the service better. We don’t have anything to add at this time.” Netflix Mulling The Idea Of Offering An Offline Viewing Option Netflix Wonâ€™t Offer Downloadable Content Anytime Soon Because Users Just Couldnâ€™t Handle It Virgin America To Offer Free In-Flight WiFi For Netflix Subscribers 20% Of Young Adults Are Using Someone Else’s Netflix, HBO Go Passwords Previous Wells Fargo Must Remove Signs Built To “Photo Bomb” New Minnesota Vikings Stadium Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
