A Goldman Sachs report says brick-and-mortar apparel stores may lose some ground to Amazon, noting that the e-commerce giant has grown by leaps and bounds recently and will likely continue to grow, Yahoo Finance reports. The report estimates that apparel and accessories represent $10 billion in sales for Amazon, accounting for 20% of the online apparel and accessories market. Macyâ€™s is behind it with just $5.2 billion in sales. Amazonâ€™s success is due to a few things: many brands sell on its site, or to Amazonâ€™s buyers. More will in the future as well, as companies like Gap have said theyâ€™d consider working with the online retail behemoth . Others should follow suit, â€œbecause they need to migrate to where consumer traffic is,â€? Goldman said. â€œMany wholesale brands still do not sell directly to amazon.com, but access to more brands â€“ which we believe is coming â€“ supports further growth ahead,â€? the report read. Online apparel in general has been a growing business, increasing at a rate of 20% per year over the past few years, the report notes, while at the same time, brick-and-mortar sales have flatlined. In addition to selling other brands’ clothes, Amazon also launched its own private label apparel brands , in an effort to capitalize on its growing success in clothing sales.
