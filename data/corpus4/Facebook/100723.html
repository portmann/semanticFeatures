The Seattle Times reports that Amazon delayed the new Treasure Truck’s first offer of a $99 paddleboard to a later date. “#TreasureTruck has moved its first offer to a later date. Thanks for following us and stay tuned,” the company Tweeted. A similar message appeared on Facebook, apologizing for any inconvenience. A spokesperson for the company offered few details on why the offer was delayed when contacted by the Seattle Times. â€œWe are working hard to bring customers Treasure Truck as soon as possible and apologize for the delay,â€? the rep. said. As Consumerist reported last week, the Treasure Truck drives around the city offering exclusive deals though the Amazon Mobile Shopping app. The company has said that the truck, which looks like a giant Amazon package, will offer one item each day, with several deals taking place each week. Customers who make a purchase through the app will meet the truck at a predetermined location to pick up their goods.
