Apple Fights The Surveillance State, But It May Be A Losing Battle - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended Apple's strong encryption as the safest and most secure for its customers. This has been criticized as affording criminals and terrorists unfettered electronic communications. Following Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook's interview on 60 Minutes , Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton denounced Apple for its use of encryption that neither the government nor Apple can decrypt. Apple is about to come under a much more serious attack in the United Kingdom if the Investigatory Powers Bill, a sweeping codification of the Surveillance State, is passed. The U.K. bill threatens not only personal freedom but could force changes in Apple's business model. Apple's use of so-called end-to-end encryption has been sporadically criticized by government officials both in the U.S. and abroad. Cotton's statement reflects the standard talking points of advocates of greater governmental surveillance: If we apply a different legal standard to companies like Apple, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), we can expect them to become the preferred messaging services of child pornographers, drug traffickers, and terrorists alike . . . How could anyone be in favor of child pornography, drug trafficking or terrorism? These talking points are echoed in the forward to the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill by the Home Secretary Theresa May: Powers to intercept communications, acquire communications data and interfere with equipment are essential to tackle child sexual exploitation, to dismantle serious crime cartels, take drugs and guns off our streets and prevent terrorist attacks. Apple sent a letter to the Parliamentary committee in charge of the bill, according to the BBC , detailing its concerns. Most prominent was the concern that the new bill might require Apple to provide a "back door" to any encrypted data that might be in Apple's possession. The BBC article was careful to state what appears to be one of the selling points of the new bill, that it doesn't expand surveillance powers that already exist but merely consolidates them under a single legal authorization: Current legislation demands that companies take reasonable steps to provide the contents of communications on production of a warrant, but that has not been interpreted as requiring firms to redesign their systems to make it possible. The government had briefed at the time that the bill was published that the legislation did not constitute any change to existing legislation. After reading the draft bill, I can understand Apple's concern. At the very least, the bill describes what will surely become the model of the surveillance state of the future. The bill authorizes government law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all forms of communications for individuals targeted by a warrant. It also allows the government to hack the computing devices of individuals subject to a warrant in order to compromise those systems to facilitate data collection - so-called equipment interference. These powers also are expanded to widespread and indiscriminate versions of the above, the so-called bulk powers. So the government of the U.K. will be empowered to indiscriminately intercept communications, hack into computers and cell phones, virtually without limit. The fact that the new bill makes clear that this is merely the status quo is hardly reassuring. Apple is concerned that it might be required to assist the government in the "bulk equipment interference" authorized by the bill. Depending on how the language of the bill is interpreted, Apple could be required to provide encryption back doors to facilitate individual or bulk interception of communications and individual or bulk equipment interference. It's not clear how the U.K. government would take Apple's standard defense in such matters that it can't provide back doors that don't exist. ... Only Outlaws Will Have Encryption Apple's Fight for the privacy rights of its customers is first and foremost a matter of principle that Apple believes in. Tim Cook has made clear on numerous occasions that Apple should act according to principle, not merely selfish profit motive. By all appearances, Apple's concern for the privacy of its customers also is good business. Apple customers are assured that their personal data and communications are as free of compromise as is currently technically feasible. Apple Pay itself depends on end-to-end encryption to ensure the privacy and security of transactions. This has been a major selling point of the technology that has promoted adoption by consumers, merchants and card issuers. Increasingly, the technology of end-to-end encryption is becoming a fundamental underpinning of the digital economy. It's obvious to those of us who are at all familiar with the technology what will happen if such strong encryption is outlawed by national governments. Encryption will simply be driven underground, and its prohibition will create a thriving black market in the technology, as such prohibitions are wont to do. Law abiding consumers will be denied the protection of strong encryption, while criminals will continue to make use of it. In case it hasn't quite emerged in the course of the article, let me make my bias on the subject explicit. I regard the ongoing encroachment of the right of privacy to be a fundamental threat to all human rights. The surveillance apparatus that is being created in countries such as the U.S. and U.K. is always depicted as being for the purposes of protecting citizens, and not political control. But once the apparatus is created, the potential exists for it to be perverted in the future for just such political control. The surveillance state has always been an essential component of the totalitarian state. Apple's stance on encryption is just one small battle against the surveillance state, but an important one that it must undertake, in my view. This is acting on principle, not for corporate gain. But Apple investors should be aware that there are significant risks. If the U.K. bill is written or interpreted to mean that Apple is required to provide a back door for its encryption technology, it will wreak some havoc with Apple's current business model. Apple would have no choice but to comply with the legal directives of the U.K. government, including an extra-territoriality provision that would require it to unlock encrypted data even if it resides outside the U.K. The U.K.'s action would have a domino effect in which other national governments (including the U.S.) would seize upon the U.K. precedent to demand similar access. Once again, Apple would have no choice but to comply with any legal directive. The resulting patchwork of conflicting national claims and directives would make conducting business internationally more costly. Apple would have to re-engineer its current encryption system, possibly multiple times, in order to satisfy different national governments. In order to avoid running afoul of extra-territoriality claims, Apple would need to maintain separate data centers in each country in which it operates. Of course, even that is an imperfect solution to the problem of cross-border communications. I doubt there is a solution if the bordering countries have conflicting surveillance requirements. Most importantly, Apple would lose one of its most important business discriminators. This is a discriminator that influences virtually every aspect of Apple's online businesses, including iTunes and the App Store. I can't even begin to put a price tag on this impact, except to point out that in fiscal 2015, Apple's Services product category generated $19.9 billion in revenue. So Apple, Apple investors and Apple's customers have a lot at stake in the privacy battle. Apple should probably start defining some form of contingency plan in case things break the way it appears they will in the U.K. The Investigatory Powers Bill is almost certain to pass. Its big selling feature is that it provides for added "safeguards" against abuse of the investigatory powers, including criminal penalties for their misuse. The blue pill gets a candy coating. Despite the threat contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill, I still regard Apple as a buy. Apple's defense of the privacy of its customers is an important positive discriminator for the company. Apple's stance on privacy will be remembered by Apple's customers, even if it is forced to compromise it. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
