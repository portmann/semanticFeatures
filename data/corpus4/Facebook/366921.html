Bookmark Post Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comments special delivery dropbox facebook Facebook Messenger Until now, Facebook users could message each other and share thoughts, feelings, links, photos, and ginormous stickers, among other things. Soon, they’ll have another way to share more data than a snap or two from Uncle Larry’s 70th birthday party, with a new partnership between Facebook and Dropbox that lets people send photos, videos, and other files during a chat on the Messenger platform. To use the feature — which is live as of April 11 — both iOS and Android users will first have to download the Dropbox app. Then, tap the “More” button and select Dropbox from the dropdown list. Select the files you want to share from there and send, without having to leave the Messenger app. If you send a video, image, or GIF, your friend will be able to view them from within the chat stream. Documents or other non-visual files will be funneled into the Dropbox mobile app — which again, you’ll have to download for that function to work. “We want people to communicate just the way they want to on Messenger, with everyone they care about,” said Stan Chudnovsky, Facebook’s head of product for Messenger, in a post by Dropbox. “Giving our users the ability to share their Dropbox videos and images in Messenger threads with just a few taps will help them bring more style and personality to those conversations.” Facebook Messenger Adds Video Calling, Because Why Not Just What You Need: Yet Another Stand-Alone Single-Purpose Facebook App Previous Southwest Airlines Quietly Increases Early Check-In Fee Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
