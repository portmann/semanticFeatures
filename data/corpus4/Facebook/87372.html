Facebook: Altering The Facebook Algorithm To Optimize For Inbound Marketing And Content Creation - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha FB has announced that it will now track time spent viewing a post or article. Facebook's algorithm will now score higher any post that you view for a longer than patter duration - viewing this as more relevant content. I believe this is yet another obvious step in the direction of optimizing FB its Facebook platform for Inbound Marketing and content creation. Continue to be long FB as a Core Position as the company should be able to play any success with this into a huge ad-spend market share. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has altered its algorithm to begin scoring posts that you spend more time looking at higher. That's right, if you stop on a post to read it Facebook's all-powerful algorithm will know. Again, it won't just know, it'll make sure that the content you're viewing, that more content like it, will be presented and visible. For me, this is a huge "shot fired" in Facebook's future relevancy and long term viability. The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. The actions people take on Facebook-liking, commenting or sharing a post-are historically some of the main factors we've considered to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. But these factors don't always tell us the whole story of what is most meaningful to you. Recently, as part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we asked people to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check Facebook. From this research, we learned that in many cases, just because someone didn't like, comment or share a story in their News Feed doesn't mean it wasn't meaningful to them. There are times when, for example, people want to see information about a serious current event, but don't necessarily want to like or comment on it. Based on this finding, we are updating News Feed's ranking to factor in a new signal-how much time you spend viewing a story in your News Feed (SOURCE: newsroom.fb.com) I've spent the last few weeks detailing how I think the social/platform/ecosystem providers of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and FB are in an arms race to acquire, optimize, and position themselves to be the single most important providers of "content" in a world that is slowly (actually, rapidly) seeing advertising dollars shift into Inbound Marketing, Content Marketing, and Growthhacking. I believe FB's algorithm shift is another example of an Easter Egg helping support my thesis. So, as I've written in the recent past, I believe Facebook's Instant Articles are going to be the central focus of FB's overall ad-spend capture strategy. The idea that Facebook can not only make visible an inbound marketing effort but actually present the content to a person in which the content will resonate is a huge differentiator and value add. Now, it should be noted that FB is already showing it can do this via the international markets albeit in small size and not via Instant Articles. But the early results of FB's Creative Accelerator program are no doubt a big push forward in the right direction. FB's ability to dial in its Facebook algorithm are going to be paramount in furthering this early momentum and in establishing a market share leadership spot longer term. FB has watched its Facebook platform, at least anecdotally and the company has acknowledged this in the past briefly, become more and more the playground of content "farms" like Upworthy, Gawker, and Buzzfeed who are simply interested in click baiting an open and a share from users. This, in my opinion, cheapens the overall non-recognized content stream (read: "my friends didn't post this") and also makes users more reluctant to give a non-recognized content piece a read. Again, at least in my opinion. If FB can optimize the Facebook algorithm to eliminate this content altogether or to greatly reduce its occurrence users might be willing to give non-recognized content an open and a read to completion. Both metrics that FB can track and that it can sell. Also, both metrics that will lead to other metric improvements - metrics like time on platform, page views, bounce rate, etc. What that means is that Facebook only shows users, the largest collection of users in the history of technology, what it thinks the user wants to see. Instagram, on the other hand, is an unfiltered stream of content that shows any and all comers. Sure, owning a roadside billboard is better than nothing but being able to advertise in a cinema about a fashion product to a group of movie patrons about to watch Sex and the City is an entirely different value-add. Facebook, again, has the largest "cinema" in the world with the largest "audience" (to stick with our analogy). Maybe sometime soon FB will be able to announce that its top platform can tell what movie the audience bought a ticket for - a very powerful statement. Alone this update from FB would have been meaningful but when taken in with consideration for all the other recent updates - Instant Articles, Creative Accelerator, Lite , etc., it becomes something much more. For me, this is FB securing heavy artillery for what should be the battle of the century. The battle for Inbound Marketing spend that will shape the next century of wealth in the entire technology space. We're seeing the confluence of marketing, social, and technology. If FB can dial in its algorithm it should be able to create generational wealth for those invested.
