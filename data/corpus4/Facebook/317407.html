Facebook explores line between public safety, free speech - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Feb 12 2016, 03:49 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Under pressure from government officials, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is more aggressively policing material it views as supporting terrorism. The world's largest social network is now quicker to remove users who back terror groups, investigate posts by their friends, and has a team who focused on terrorist content. The unit is also helping promote counter speech, or posts that aim to discredit militant groups. Facebook's not the only one figuring out how to curb extremist propaganda. Twitter last week suspended 125K accounts associated with ISIS. I can't believe they found 125k accounts aiding terrorists... Unbelievable. Who knew you could plot terror attacks in under 140 characters?
