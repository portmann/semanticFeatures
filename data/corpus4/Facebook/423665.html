Non-Chronological Instagram Feeds Are Coming Whether You Like It Or Not â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. It doesn’t matter whether you’re happy about it or not: Instagram is switching your feed to an algorithmic one , showing you new posts in the order that the service believes you’ll like them. Users are not super thrilled about this, but Instagram tried to assure users that we’ll like it, even if we think we won’t. How do they know that? Instagram says that they’ve rolled the new feed out to “a portion of the community,” and that portion of the community has been engaging with the posts that they see more. “We found that people are liking photos more, commenting more and generally engaging with the community in a more active way,” the company notes in a blog post . While Instagram’s owner Facebook lets you turn off the algorithmic feed and simply see the latest things that your friends have posted, Instagram hasn’t announced whether they’ll let their users do the same. We’ll find out when the change rolls out to all accounts, which they say will be sometime in the coming month. They also plan to make new tools available for brands and power users â€“â€“ the Instagrammers who care most about the change, since their living depends on people using the service â€“â€“ which will include, naturally, the ability to make any post into a paid ad that will be inserted into users’ feeds.
