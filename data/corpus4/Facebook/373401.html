Stick With Best Of Breed Stocks - Seconds Usually Don't Pan Out | Seeking Alpha Leaders in the industry might maintain above average valuations, but they also maintain above average growth. Buying a lower-valued stock in the same industry wonâ€™t ensure success. Investing in companies that are considered the 'best of breed' or industry leaders is smart momentum investing. This strategy is not blindly buying a stock because it increased significantly recently. Investing in best of breed stocks involves careful analysis of a company's business and where it likely headed. This also involves avoiding similar companies in the same industry that are not likely to achieve the success of the industry leaders. Investors can get caught in a value trap by merely looking at valuation metrics and not thinking clearly about where a business is likely to go. Investors can get a false sense of hope by having a contrarian viewpoint on an inferior company that will never achieve nearly what the industry leader has and will in the future. To avoid such a trap, many investors choose to own an index fund or broad-market ETF to reduce risk. However, other investors enjoy picking individual stocks in an attempt to achieve higher returns. One solid strategy for picking individual winners is to invest in proven industry leaders. These are companies that are clearly the front runners in their industry in terms of sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I would also choose industry leaders that sustain positive operating and free cash flow. When a company consistently grows free cash flow, dividend payments and stock repurchase plans can be sustained and increased. This is beneficial to shareholders since their dividends grow over time. The buybacks are beneficial as they help to boost EPS and reduce dilution, thus making existing shares more valuable. Industry leaders could also be in a high growth phase and not yet pay dividends. However, these high growth companies will use cash flow to expand the business. In this case, think Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) as the industry leader and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) as the less desirable investment. If you think about and compare Facebook's business with Twitter's business, it is easy to see that Facebook is the better investment. Users spend an average of over 42 minutes per day on Facebook, while Twitter users spend an average of 17 minutes per day on the site. Those aged 18 to 29 spend an average of 51 minutes per day on Facebook. Facebook is still able to grow its daily user base at strong double digit rates beyond 1 billion people . Twitter's user growth has been leveling off when looking quarter-to-quarter. Twitter ended 2015 with about 320 million MAUs, which was the same figure that the company reported at the end of September. So, Twitter is suffering from busted growth and that has shown in the declining stock price. Investors might mistakenly like Twitter over Facebook for valuation reasons. Twitter has a lower valuation with a forward PE of 21 and PEG of 0.63, while Facebook has a forward PE of 26 and a PEG of 1. However, Facebook has the higher market share growth in the amount of users. So, investors are willing to bid up the stock price for its industry leading performance. Investors are better off owning Facebook as the industry leader. The company has superior user growth with higher average time spent on the site. Those metrics are important for attracting advertisers. Facebook is continuing to grow its advertising revenue at a strong pace. The company achieved 44% revenue growth year-over-year (53% on a constant currency basis) for 2015. I think that Facebook will continue to grow at a strong pace, especially since WhatsApp represents a user base of over 1 billion, which will be monetized in the future. Another example of an industry leader is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) vs. an industry laggard Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Yahoo had its IPO in 1996 , while Google went public in 2004 . Yahoo did have a great run in the 1990s, but never fully recovered after the dotcom bubble burst. Investors have put more emphasis on rewarding companies with quality revenue and earnings growth after the dotcom era. If we just look at the past five years, Google increased revenue at strong double-digit rates , reaching about $75 billion for 2015. Yahoo's revenue stagnated over the same period and failed to rise above $5 billion . If we think about Alphabet's and Yahoo's businesses, it becomes clearer who the industry leader is. Investors should have compared search market share growth between the two companies. Google's market share increased steadily, while Yahoo experienced a decline. The term Google officially became a verb back in 2006 when the Oxford English Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary added the term as a verb. That says a lot about the popularity and industry leader status of Google's search business. Google attracts advertising revenue because it has the highest market share for search in the industry. To increase your chances of picking winning stocks over time, carefully analyze similar businesses. The industry leaders may have higher valuations than others in the industry, but if they have superior market share, revenue, and earnings growth, they are likely to continue to outperform.
