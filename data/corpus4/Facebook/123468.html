Ask the Readers: Do You Own Apple Products? Apple is one of the biggest names in consumer electronics; whenever a new iPhone is released, you can bet there'll be news stories of mile-long lines at the Apple store. But while Apple products certainly are popular, they tend to come with a higher price point (especially the new models) and many consumers prefer other brand that provide similar functions at a lower cost.

But they do not affect the actual opinions and recommendations of the authors. I do not personally own any Apple products anymore.  My last ones were a 1st-generation iPad from work and an iPod nano.  I just refuse the pay the "Apple tax" of 50-100% over similar items from other manufacturers.  Apple does a fantastic job of industrial design and an even better job of marketing, but I just do not see any added value in their products to justify the price differential I use nothing but Apple products: 2 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 iMacs, and an Apple TV. I would own nothing else.
