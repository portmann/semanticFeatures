Protecting Your Facebook Investment - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook has seen a significant pull back since it reported Q4 2015 earnings, despite an initial pop. Facebook selling off is unwarranted and still trades at an attractive price despite its large valuation. I'll present several strategies to protect your investment in Facebook as the market continues to be more volatile than normal. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), in my opinion, is one of the best long-term growth stocks on the current market and I am incredibly bullish about its prospects. You can read my previous takes on Facebook on Seeking Alpha: I'm Doubling Down On Facebook (September 29, 2015) However, after watching the company experience a rapid increase and then pull back after the recent earnings report , I was curious as to why so much selling was occurring. Given my bullishness on the company, the strategies discussed below revolve around trying to retain a long position in FB, while protecting against downside risk that may occur given the market's instability. On a day-to-day basis, Facebook is generally low beta. However, depending on the time period you choose to look at, the beta for Facebook changes in an interesting manner. While I've observed that Facebook generally holds a tighter correlation to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) than the Nasdaq 100 (NASDAQ: QQQ ), over a six-month time frame you'll notice that the correlation is slightly stronger to the Nasdaq 100, just by a few basis points. Below is the correlation between FB and the Nasdaq, as well as the S&P 500. Notice the 1.18+ beta figures for both correlations, as allows Facebook to have a small premium over just buying into these indexes. The recent trend towards strength with the Nasdaq 100 could be due to the recent selloff in tech and cloud-based equities, and I believe that gets supported with the sharp difference in beta seen through the YTD looking glass. Facebook is sporting a 1.873 beta to the S&P 500 YTD, but only a 1.227 beta to the Nasdaq 100 YTD. Facebook stock, YTD, is only down 0.09%. So, what does this mean? To have Facebook provide the much-needed alpha in a YTD group of equities that have been crushed by double digit losses, you're going to need to hedge your investment as uncertainty continues to grip markets. While I'd recommend selling the mini contracts for both NDX and SPX, that's not necessarily the most viable strategy for retail investors and carries a risk level that isn't easily manageable compared to other securities. Perhaps the best idea here is to hedge your investment, not with futures but inverse index ETFs. The benefit of doing this is you don't short anything, but take long positions in these inverse ETFs, which still allows you to have a payoff matrix of limited downside and unlimited upside. In crafting such a position, it depends largely how leveraged you want to be relative to your investment in Facebook. I'd recommend using either Direxion's 3x Bear S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPXS ), which has a near identical correlation to another inverse ETF, the UltraShort S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SDS ), or use the ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SH ), which is slightly less levered. Naturally, there are Nasdaq equivalents to these ETFs, but based upon the correlations that I've established with Facebook against market indexes, it is ideal to pursue an inverse ETF related to the S&P 500 given that is the index that Facebook is more heavily fluctuating against. To visualize this, below is Facebook's stock against these three particular ETFs over the past six months. Notice how the various uptrends and downtrends directly contradict each other. Once you compute how much you want to reduce down by, adding a long position in one of these inverse ETFs allows you to run a more risk-averse portfolio. Naturally, as these are leveraged ETFs, you're going to want to have a stop loss in place in case of a large market rally in one session or a multi-day sustained rally. These inverse ETFs, when allocated to properly, don't just help you hedge against Facebook, but also any other low-beta equity in your portfolio. That dual purpose could be critically helpful over the coming quarters. Strategy #2: Go Long, Stick To Your Rules 2016 is shaping up to be a volatile year, if it continues on the trajectory we've already seen YTD. We'll likely continue to see more market-wide turbulence and unwarranted selling of FB shares, as the underlying fundamentals haven't changed and if anything, have improved. If hedging is not your forte or you wish to be passive with your investment, then stay long if you already hold a long position. The risk/reward scenario presented is not anything wildly attractive given that it is relatively flat YTD, but the notable rebuttal is that FB is trading nearly $13 off of its 52-week high of $117.59. With a new revenue stream coming online in Q2, we'll largely see speculation drive the stock away from major indexes. This reduces the risk/reward favorability for future longs, but does create a window of opportunity. The pullback sub-$100 was certainly an attractive window for initiating an entry, in retrospect. If there's a pullback in the broader market, there's likely going to be a pullback in Facebook, given what we now know about the correlations. Now it's going to be hard to imagine Facebook trading sub-$90 in the near-term (i.e. 3 months - 6 months), but it's certainly a possibility. The best thing to do in this situation is not to panic. Furthermore, this may be mitigated by the potential strength of future earnings reports, as we just saw with the 2015 Q4 ER. If you notice the pop FB made past the $115 level and even higher, there's an incredible amount of support for the stock. If you went long in FB in Q4 2015, it's likely your cost basis is in the low $100s, which means you are either flat or have only lost a small amount. Additionally, if you want to retain your long position in FB, but want more current income in the short-term, I'm a strong advocate of allocating stagnant capital to current income stocks, such as utilities like Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ), Southern (NYSE: SO ) or even the SPDR Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA: XLU ). Facebook is still a massive growth company and won't likely pay a dividend for quite some time. Starting to build up your cash assets in an uncertain market is a smart step to reduce equity exposure in a volatile market without altering a long position in Facebook. These are the steps that should be taken to secure against losses. If you're already long Facebook, like I am, you likely have a longer time frame in mind before you would consider selling. Personally, I don't plan on selling my stake in FB until I've reached my newly established tolerance. If we reflect on the past performance of FB's equity since its IPO, we see that many of the downturns are no longer than a few months, with enough volatility to create up days for worried investors to exit their positions with some gains intact. However, FB entered in the middle of a bull market in May 2012 and with present fears revolving around a stronger market correction, past performance is likely not indicative of future performance. The small, short-lived declines you can see in this otherwise exceptional chart may not be reflected in the next potential decline. I bought more Facebook last week because I like what I'm seeing for the long-term with this company and the pull back from its earnings report high keeps my cost basis attractive. That being said, pursuing one of the above-detailed strategies is likely a smart decision to protect your investment in Facebook. Finally, you are more than welcome to pursue strategies with options or other asset classes, but I'd recommend you do so at your own risk.
