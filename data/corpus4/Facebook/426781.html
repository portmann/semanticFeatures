Activision Blizzard Smashes Into The Mainstream - Activision Blizzard, Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) | Seeking Alpha The Blizzard portion of Activision-Blizzard has teamed up with Facebook in order to make it easier for users to livestream their gameplay. Blizzard users will have the ability to login to Facebook on PC, and discover which of their friends are playing Blizzard games too. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) has partnered with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) in an attempt to break e-sports/gaming out into the mainstream. The company announced that it will soon allow PC users to login to Facebook and stream their gameplay to their personal page. The feature will be available for all Blizzard games, including the much hyped Overwatch game. This is an exceptionally smart move on Activision's behalf. Here's why: The e-sports and gaming industry is rapidly expanding, and this is just from organic growth. 201 million people either played or participated in e-sports in 2014 alone. Previously, people were getting into e-sports from either friends' encouragement or from simply playing the games themselves. However, e-sports has had some trouble breaking out into the mainstream. The problem at hand is that not many people are going to actively seek out e-sports unless they already play the games. With this strategic move however, it puts live gaming content right into the newsfeeds of Facebook users. The average person doesn't go onto game-streaming services, such as Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Twitch, but they frequently visit Facebook and will see the feeds. Facebook's immense size and nearly complete market penetration will certainly aid Activision in converting average non-gamers to their viewing and playing platforms. Twitch attracted 100 million unique visitors in 2014. Facebook will open up Blizzard games to over 1.65 billion users across the world. Furthermore, this partnership adds a social component to traditional gaming. By logging into one's Facebook account, users will be able to see which of their friends are also users of Battle.net, Blizzard's online gaming platform. From this point, they have the option to initiate games with their friends. This is a very special feature - gaming is certainly better when playing with friends. This will aid the retention period of users and have them play longer sessions, and the public nature of the process will entice non-gamer friends to join in the fun. For a company that has bet so heavily on e-sports, this is a fantastic move. Activision acquired Major League of Gaming for $46 million and has been adding high-profile personnel to its e-sports division. By placing game streams directly to Facebook, Activision is slowly introducing the concept of watching e-sports into the mind of the average person. My prediction is that e-sports will not be adopted by everybody, and I think Activision is aware of that. However, if you cast a huge (1.65 billion) net, you're bound to catch a decent amount of fish. Besides adding new people to the platform, integrating Facebook will add a social element that will enhance gameplay for existing consumers. As a side effect, Activision believes that connecting to a social profile will help curb hate speech from users who typically play anonymously. The exact specifics of the deal have yet to be announced by the two parties, but this looks like an all-around wonderful move on Activision Blizzard's behalf. I firmly believe that e-sports is still in its infancy, and that Activision is making all the right moves to reap immense benefits in the future and justify its current 34.41 P/E ratio.
