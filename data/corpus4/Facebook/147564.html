Verizon Should Act Like A Tech Company - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Management should reduce the dividend, halt buybacks, and pay down debt. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is a tech company and should act as such. It has too much debt, pays too high a dividend, and buys back too much stock. Verizon should completely focus on paying down debt and finding the next hot tech product. Verizon shows $3.3 billion in cash and short term investments and $13.4 billion in accounts receivable. This is to: $4.2 billion in short term debt, $17 billion in accounts payable, $109.5 billion in debt, $32.7 billion in employee benefit obligations, and $43 billion in deferred income taxes. The liability side dwarfs the assets side. Tangible book value is negative $20.5 billion. Wireless licenses are worth $86 billion. Verizon may be able to sell off some of these in a pinch. It would be interesting to see what the market value of these licenses are. In a Wall Street Journal (WSJ subscription required at link) article, "...there are risks as well. Another major auction is planned for 2016, and new competitors like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Cablevision Systems (NYSE: CVC ) are eyeing the wireless business." Cash flow from operations for the first six months was $18.9 billion. That's a lot of money! Capex was $8.1 billion and free cash flow was $10.8 billion. And the year is only half over (or half begun depending on your outlook on life). $4.3 billion was spent on the dividend and $5 billion on stock buybacks. My problem with telecommunications companies is that they pretend likes it's the old days with Mable connecting plugs at a switch board. It's not. A few years ago, you had cable, a cell phone, a business line, internet at home, and internet at work (we're not going back to when we had home phones). Now, you get television and internet bundled. Even Verizon offers internet phones which cannabalizes into their land line business. My point is that Verizon is a tech company and should act as such. Cut the dividend and pay down debt if you want to compete. Where is telecom going to be in five years? Who knows? Maybe you can run everything off your cell phone, which some people already do. Who is going to be number one? If Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) can come out of nowhere in no time, what are the barriers to entry? It looks to me that Verizon is playing catch-up, not on the cutting edge. Looking at the company's web site, it offers the same thing as everyone else: cell phone reception, tv, internet, phone, and high speed internet. When is Verizon going to get ahead of the curve and do something like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) did? Apple decided that it was going to have the i-Pod, then the i-Phone. Do you think Verizon would take such a gamble? I don't think the company will survive for ever at this trajectory and with its debt load. It is going to have to do something phenomenal. It's in a good place now because of its strong cash flow. Find a way to get a gig of download on a cell phone so a person can run their whole life and business off of that. That's the next step in telecom. Verizon seems to have enough free cash flow that it will be ok for awhile. Having said that, telecom-tv-internet is moving very rapidly. So rapidly that some of us can barely keep up. In the past week, I wrote similar articles on AT&T (NYSE: T ) and CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ). They all are tech companies and have too much debt. I hope that Verizon keeps chugging on. I'm not a tech investor, I'm an analyst. My world consists of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. If Verizon can take some chances, like the tech company that it really is, it could be big.
