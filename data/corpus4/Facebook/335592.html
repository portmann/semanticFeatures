The most valuable company on the planet is set to square off against the FBI on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee in a highly publicized dispute regarding the iPhone that belonged to Syed Farook who, along with his wife, murdered more than a dozen people in December at a San Bernardino county holiday party. The director of the FBI will appear, as will Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, who will argue that â€œtechnology companies should not be able to dictate who can access key evidence in criminal investigations.â€? â€œNo device or company, no matter how popular, should be able to exempt itself from court obligations unilaterally,â€? Vanceâ€™s prepared statement reads. â€œAnd they should not be able to write their own laws.â€? â€œBuilding that software tool would not affect just one iPhone; it would weaken the security for all of them,â€? Appleâ€™s general counsel Bruce Sewell counters. â€œMembers of the House Judiciary Committee are considering filing a 'friend of the court' brief in Apple's encryption dispute with the U.S. government to argue that the case should be decided by Congress and not the courts,â€? Reuters reports . â€œThe filing would argue that the Feb. 16 order from a federal court in California that instructs Apple to write special software to unlock an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters threatens the constitutional separation of powers.â€? Meanwhile, in a related case, a federal magistrate declined to grant the government's request that Apple  pull data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York. As The New York Times notes , it's "the first time that the governmentâ€™s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test." The judge, in a 50-page ruling, targeted the All Writs Act which supports federal reuqests for data extraction. "Judge Orenstein said the government was inflating its authority by using the All Writs Act to force Apple to extract data from an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case," The Times noted earlier today. "The All Writs Act is also being invoked in the fight over the San Bernardino shooting."  Below, find the live feed for the hearing as well as a statement from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Ranking Member John Conyers (D-Mich.). From the committee: â€œThe widespread use of strong encryption has implications both for Americansâ€™ privacy and security. As technology companies have made great strides to enhance the security of Americansâ€™ personal and private information, law enforcement agencies face new challenges when attempting to access encrypted information. Americans have a right to strong privacy protections and Congress should fully examine the issue to be sure those are in place while finding ways to help law enforcement fight crime and keep us safe."

Last time I checked, dead people didn't have any rights, especially dead murderers. I wonder how many living white americans they cheerfully betrayed to the FBI until they "suddenly" grew a "spine"? And one more thing-- this is information that is material to an actual crime that happened, and represents a real threat -- not some sort of vague future threat. OMG, I upvoted you!  See?  Nobody is all good or all bad.  All weird, maybe.  As they say, "I hate being bipolar.  It's AWESOME!" :-) Put an Apple tech in one room, gov rep in another room.  Let the Apple tech pull out the data and give it to the gov rep.  Apple keeps the phone.  Gov has info, Apple is safe. It should be case by case painful for the gov to get data but if the event is big enough and a court approves it then they can coordinate with and get the data like above. Apple or no other entity should give open and free access to the gov, never.  And the gov should respect the constitution and not even desire it.  The gov is either with us (including our constitution) or against us.  Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:47 | 7257717 Miles Ahead Which is why they had "Active Shooter Drills" going on at the same time.  And why this is the only similar center in the US that held such drills - monthly. And why when the shooting was going on everyone reported three persons - white men in masks. And it's why the shooters had to "go away" then all of a sudden the black SUV reappears while someone conveniently holds the mobile phone video. And it's why when the lady lay on the ground after the "shootout" she was handcuffed from behind - already dead. And it's why she supposedly tweeted her loyalty to ISIS while shooting a big-ass machine gun - given the Twitter time stamp. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:57 | 7257562 Cruel Aid If it didnt occur  to anyone, these same people are not above false flagging the whole event in order to bring on this case. I wouldnt, I'd have worked out every option to gain access to all of it and how to acheive that end. Lucky for the Apple CEO's, they can't be flown down to Guantanamo and waterboarded,....oh wait. Not only can they be extreme renditioned and goat fucked in dozens of clandestine prisons around the globe, it is now legal for our .gov to do so according to the Patriot Act, the NDAA and the words of our POTUS. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:05 | 7257590 12357111317 What if the dead Muslim couple's phone logs show they were not the shooters?  "Three tall white males dressed in black gear with helmets".  Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:08 | 7257598 Cruel Aid Oh oh, no that is not possible, we all saw the dead body in the streets and bombs all over their apartment. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:13 | 7257622 12357111317 I upvoted you for your name, "Cruel Aid", which I love, not because of your post, because I can't tell whether your post is sarcasm.  If it is sarcasm, then I'm sorry I can't upvote you twice. I imagine that bombs can be placed in people's apartments after they've been gunned down in the streets.  Doesn't that happen in movies all the time?  And I don't see how the witness lady can be wrong, because how frequently do 3 males in black gear with helmets storm into your lunchroom and gun everybody down? The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Why is it the case that the FBI does not approach a Judge, present the judge with probable cause, and then have the judge issue a Court Order to unlock that phone? Can it be the fact that the MURDER of the people in San Bernadino have been set up and carried out by Law Enforcement to further the political agenda of banning guns? Can it be that the FBI is so intent on covering up their own crime that they want all loose ends accounted for? Can it be that the FBI fears that there might be incriminating evidence, implicating Law Enforcement, on that phone and during the execution of the crime on that December day? The ending of that day was so very reminecent of the movie, Running Man, where Killian fakes the death of Ahnold and his compatriots. They are as intent on covering this up as much as they were intent on covering up 9-11. They only had over 3000 killed in that massacre. But you go right on ahead and WORSHIP your state. Give homage to your god and get down on your knees for your glorious leader. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:16 | 7257375 doctor10 Surely blatant abrogation of the Fourth Amendment, and coercion of a  business to that end IS sedition?

If the guy had no apps on his iphone, never used safari, never jailbroke it or clicked on browser based exploits, it's possible that they actually can't get it. The chances that he stored encrypted data or communications on his phone though is extremely unlikely. That they were most likely patsies casts further doubt that Farook or his wife knew anything signifcant about encryption, or even had any reason to attempt to use it. I mean, let's face it, these supposed "jihadists" posted on facebook through a traceable ip address while trying to "escape". How's that for a well-thought out plan? As others suggested though, it's highly likely that they have something else in the stack compromised already and simply want it to be legalized so they can present it as evidence in court, which of course would allow them to set legal precedent and start the new reign of digital terror. I've no doubt that they want to formally build backdoors into encryption standards though. Would help them save alot of time, energy and money that they have been pouring into the NSA. Pricks. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:01 | 7257574 JuliaS The goal is to make use of encryption a crime... I'm pretty sure anything that can't be cracked already puts users on a some watchlist. I remember sending encrypted data to myself - personal documents from my own mailbox to itself and the email provider blocking it for the reason that it wasn't able to determine whether the content was safe. Sure, something that came from me, meant for myself cannot possibly be trusted, unless they can dig aroud. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 15:54 | 7258019 Tall Tom Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:02 | 7257275 Deus Irate You can't buy this kinda marketing. Oh wait, this is apple we be talkin about... You know, the guys who routinely hacked anything the gubmint asked them to. But this time it's different. If folks were clever they would take note of those who are in on this charade and render judgements accordingly. But it's all influence and tribalism now. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:07 | 7257327 Fish Gone Bad It would be interesting to get Snowden's take on all this.  If the NSA already reads everything, then what is the point of this dog and pony show?   Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:13 | 7257367 Normalcy Bias Perhaps it's a psyop to steer the truly slow/naive criminals/dissidents toward iPhones, who may think the govt can't access their info? Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:29 | 7257434 Deus Irate I read somewhere that Snowden made some positive-ish comments that apple is standing up to the man etc, which frankly forced me to reconsider some things. Sad truth is there are damned few if any who have the nads to stand up to the man for more than a certain length of time. I know I wouldn't last very long, especially if they alternated beatings with a glimpses of particularly attractive females. Nope, I reckon I'd sell my own family after a few hours. But I bear that in mind when deciding who is reliable and who is not. Nobody is. Not even me. Best to judge everything on it's merits and nothing else. Belief is for priests and sheep. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:00 | 7257573 12357111317 Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:04 | 7257586 JuliaS Snowden did do a take on this and it was right here on ZH. He said that NSA already had all the data up to 6 weeks prior to attacks and Apple never had problem sharing user information either. It's all about the ability to do warantless data scrubbing legally (as oppose to the way it's being done) and then use the evidence in court, instead of crafting probabe cause post mortem. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:08 | 7257331 Dr. Spin I got me a Chinese phone from China.  How do you say, "all your data are belong to us" in Chinese? Tue, 03/01/2016 - 14:12 | 7257614 coast Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:03 | 7257305 WTFUD Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:04 | 7257310 the.ghost.of.22wmr They can dump the data off any captured phone (or device) and then brute-force the decryption cipher on the canned data sans phone. What they are actually asking for is the ability to decrypt the data without having to go get the phone.  Since the same warrant that would allow them to do a digital search of your data over the network would also allow them to get the phone...  Ergo...since they can get a warrant to go pickup the phone and apply all the brute force they wish today....what they are really asking for is the ability to bypass the encryption on any data stored on a network attached device (like a phone) without a warrant. This case is about the final death of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution...ie if they win the amendment is a dead letter. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 13:39 | 7257463 Deus Irate Interesting. Cheers. But I would lay money on the fact that it's more for covering ass against any liability for PAST "unlawful" access, rather than asking up front. Somebody musta spooked a lawyer in the NSA or somewhere, who decided now was the time to obtain retroactive permission(s). Apple was probably told exactly how to benefit from this and also help establish the BS narrative. Freedom of speech - gone in favor of "anti-bullying". Right to bear arms? There, as long as your peashooter has no way competing with the MIC arsenal of latest and greatest. 3rd - subject to president's mood. 4th - being chipped away with cases such as this one. Fifth? That's what Gitmo's for as well as hundreds of prisons we own in foreign countries. Right to fair trial? Justice system is mafia. Plain and simple. 7th - killed by the Patriot Act. 8th? Civil forfeiture! 9th? The entire congress wipes their asses with The Constitution. It's meaningless. etc. Tue, 03/01/2016 - 16:25 | 7258190 raeb In the testimony Daryl Isis explained this and Comy played dumb and said if you have any good ideas send them to the FBI.
