Why Would You Underestimate Facebook? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha It seems that even with ample notice of an investment year taking place, some investors think this could be the end of Facebook's growth story. When Facebook has invested, such as in mobile, it has proven that it can make substantial revenue and subsequent profits on those investments. Underestimating Facebook as it invests could lead to a serious mistake on the part of investors on the short side or simply a missed opportunity for those on the sidelines. For some reason, when a company announces their capital expenditures will be increasing about 55% to 65% in order to invest into new products and further already closed acquisitions it means that this will be the way company spending, and subsequently growth, will look like from now on. Growth will immediately come to an end and all who are holding the stock are doomed. At least that's the train of thought I'm hearing from the bear side of the Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) investment theory. If you forsake all future looking perspectives in companies then the only way to look must be rearward. I would think, then, one with a clear rear view mirror perspective can understand the results of past investments into a company's business and can say with confidence what current investments should yield. If one can see the lack of successful investments then they surely have a case for why current investments should fail and why growth is now doomed to slow to single digit numbers. I believe if you're going to call the end of Facebook's growth it's diligent to review what they've done in the past with other investments and how they've turned out. Therefore, if you can't believe in the future then the past must be your window, and if the past is your window it should tell you about what you should at least expect for the future. Otherwise, it's just an attempt at reviving a bearish thesis, but with no factual basis. When Facebook IPO'd in May of 2012 it was a desktop only revenue company and thus revenue primarily came in through desktop ads. This worried investors as they, along with the company, began to realize that the future was in mobile browsing and app usage. Shortly thereafter, Facebook stock began to sink on worries that there was no road map for an expansion into mobile and mobile revenue. In fact, it was reported at one time in the Fall of 2012 that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) would overtake Facebook in mobile advertising. Stock sentiment was at an all time low by the time shares sank to a bottom of $17.55 at the beginning of September of that year. Mobile, though, was something Facebook was looking into. It had a mobile site and it had a desktop site. The difference was there was no ad product on the mobile side to generate income. Their entire income was generated through ads placed on the desktop site along with a small percentage through games and payments. The company began working on an ad product that would serve ads in a manner that coincided with smaller screen sizes and blended better into a user's overall news feed. Estimates were that Facebook would generate $72.7M of mobile ad revenue in all of 2012, as we can see from the following chart. What began to happen by Q3 of 2012 was the first real revenue from mobile. For that quarter it was recorded at $153M or 14% of the overall advertising income. Facebook actually posted mobile revenue of $458M for 2012 as a whole. That was up from $0 the year prior. This is also 530% higher than what estimates said in the above chart. As we can see the investment in mobile paid off in the very same year the company decided to begin investing. Let me continue my rear view mirror looking with the purchase of Instagram, the mobile only app, during 2012. This purchase highlights Facebook's drive to become a mobile company and during 2012 that's all Instagram could be used on. The purchase was first announced in April of 2012 and would, at that time, hold a $1B price tag. By the time the deal closed it would be worth $715M because of the sinking share price in 2H 2012. This acquisition seemed outrageous to most critics and investors. How could a company with zero profits - or income for that matter - be worth roughly $1B? Facebook had plans with Instagram, though, but it started with gaining users and a larger, steadier following. Still looking in the rear view mirror, we can see that mobile has paid off very well. In fiscal 2014 we find that Facebook brought in $7.6B in mobile ad revenue. This compares to the 2014 estimates from 2012 of $629.4M. Even if you read the previously referred to chart as operating income instead of revenue and applied the company wide 29% GAAP operating income margin from last year you still wind up with $2.2B. As you can see from the chart below revenues were up drastically, mainly due to mobile ad revenue. Of course, this is only part of the picture. As we know businesses have more than just a revenue aspect; they have a bottom line as well. During this time net income also increased dramatically as mobile revenue had a high margin, much like desktop ad revenue. The chart below shows the time frame of June of 2012 to December of 2014 and the normalized diluted EPS of the company. Clearly this wasn't just a top line growth investment but one that made it to the bottom line as well. Together it not only grew the company's revenue, which would have hit a wall with desktop ads, but also made the company profitable. Instagram is another investment that seems to have paid off well. While still not contributing much to the top line we see that the potential of Instagram is starting to be realized. Analysts believe in 2015 that Instagram is worth 4,515% more than what Facebook paid for it in 2012. I think that's something I would call a "good" investment. Instagram went from being a mobile only 40 million users app to a $33B entity with both Android and iOS apps and 300M+ users, which has surpassed Twitter . Jumping to this month's news quickly, we find that Facebook is now upping the revenue energy on Instagram. This should only now be an earnings call or two away from understanding the full earnings potential of Instagram. It seems when Facebook puts its mind to something it produces quite the return on investment. Mobile has proven to be the biggest cash cow year after year that the company has ever had. Something that was producing zero dollars in one year is now 64% of their overall yearly revenue as of Q4 of 2014. Their acquisition of a small mobile only app has turned into a bigger than Twitter, revenue ready machine. The Future Based On The Rear View Perspective Now we get to the heart of the matter. If investors expect Facebook to produce more revenue, and subsequently more profits, then it only makes sense to let the company invest in itself. If one begrudges the company for investing then I point you to the above facts about what the company has done when it says, "Let's invest." With new assets (acquisitions) that have been in the user growth stage and are seeing continued product improvements, it's time to invest in them to turn them into revenue producing cash cows. This investing will take time, and of course money, and should be considered a standard and proven route of accomplishing this goal. When Facebook announced last year on the Q3 conference call that it was going to begin spending more on capital expenditures and that cash flow and profit would take a hit the stock reacted in a manner that put downward pressure on it. Acquisitions such as Whatsapp and Oculus had not proven anything substantial to that point other than a continued drive toward 1 billion users on the former and a few product developments from the latter. The key point to take away here is this isn't the first time we've seen this pattern. First, an announcement that mobile isn't some place Facebook is at, the stock price falls in lockstep, they invest in that area and it turns out to be the most profitable division of the company only a year later and the stock price rises along with revenue and profits, again, in lockstep. It seems the company is able to choose something to invest in and do it right. With Facebook's ability to turn something they haven't done into a lot of cash it has proven investors wrong. This was evident when the company began investing in mobile ads and have since ridden that success to exponential growth. This is also evident by how their acquisitions have grown by hundreds of millions of users since their taking over. When the company says it's going to invest it's not time to think this is the end of growth; it's time to think about how much will it stand to profit and re-engergize its growth. Judging by the past performance it looks really good. If you don't believe in the company going forward then you only have the past to look to. The past, it turns out, doesn't support the notion that Facebook will stop growing. In fact, it proves that when Facebook invests it creates revenue and profits that are beyond even the wildest dreams of analysts and of course any estimate figures published.
