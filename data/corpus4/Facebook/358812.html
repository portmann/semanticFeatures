That is set to change in May, a new report says, with the e-commerce giant taking Prime Now to the Web. In a push to expand the appeal of Prime Now , the service will run on Amazonâ€™s website as well as the app as of next month, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News . In addition to opening up Prime Now to Web users, Amazon is peddling advertising space to big brands for the occasion, promising visibility with tens of millions of Amazon shoppers. Prime Now debuted in December 2014 in New York City and is now available in about 20 U.S. cities, as well as across the pond in London. It started as a way for customers to get basic household goods and now includes delivery from local restaurants and stores. Two-hour delivery is free for Amazon Prime customers, and one-hour deliveries cost $8 each.
