Click to print (Opens in new window) By Mary Beth Quirk December 17, 2015 File this one under things we’ve said a million times and will say as many times as it takes to keep all shoppers away from scammy things: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is… especially if it’s showing up all over Facebook. So it goes with the most recent coupon scam circulating social media, a fake Kroger coupon offering 40% off all store purchases. Even though it has all sorts of coupon-y language and restrictions — “no rain checks” and “limit one coupon or offer per guest” — it’s a big fat scam, Kroger confirmed on its own Facebook page: Attention Kroger Customers: There is currently an unauthorized â€œ40% off all purchases in storeâ€? offer circulating. This giveaway is not affiliated with or supported by the Kroger Co. in any way. We recommend not engaging with the site(s) that offer links to the coupon, or providing them with any personal information. Our team is actively working with Facebook and domain service providers to address the concern. Because retailers generally aren’t in the mood to steeply discount their prices for no apparent reason, these kinds of offers are pretty much always fake. There was the bogus chance to get 50% off everything from Target for liking a Facebook page; this $200 off everything at Kroger scam; a fake offer for $100 worth of free stuff at Publix It’s always a good idea to check with the retailer’s Facebook page to start with — any special offers will likely be included on the official page, or if you’re in doubt, the company may have already refuted the deal in question, like Kroger did in this case. You can also hover over any links included with the coupon: if the URL leads to something other than the retailer’s official site, it’s safe to say it’s a fake. Surprise!
