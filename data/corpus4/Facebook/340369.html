Microsoft Saves Itself $8 Billion - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha News out Friday suggests MSFT considered buying messaging service Slack for $8B, but has steered clear. All social networks are working on cloud systems and messaging for work, but Microsoft already has the tools to do this with Yammer and Skype. Per user, MSFT would be paying 45 times what FB paid for WhatsApp if they made this purchase at this ridiculous valuation. News broke late Friday afternoon that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) had thought about acquiring messaging service Slack (Private: SLACK ) for $8 billion. We think this would be an enormous waste of capital and absolutely terrible decision for the company. It looks like the company made the right move in avoiding purchasing Slack, especially for that much money. Slack is similar to Skype or other person to person messaging services, but it focuses on providing tools for the enterprise. For instance, it offers cloud-based document sharing, discussion and collaboration on top of simple messaging. It takes the best of social media functions across several apps and tries to do what many other companies are working on doing; using cloud computing to create efficiency in the workplace. Microsoft has the choice of starting anew if they wanted to enter this market, or trying to build out services they already have, like Skype. In addition, Microsoft already acquired enterprise messaging system Yammer in 2012. There are two other products that we can compare Slack to - WhatsApp, for person-to-person messaging, and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) at Work, the company's goal of creating efficiency in the workplace. Lets put it simply. Facebook bought WhatsApp for its user base. The user base is the commodity. WhatsApp was only earning about $20M/year when it was purchased. The users are the key, and Microsoft either doesn't seem to understand that, or they're just poor negotiators. So Microsoft could be targeting Slack for its already existing user base. We are guessing Microsoft is thinking about trying to capitalize on what it clearly sees are the strengths of other companies like Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (even BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY )) in their messaging platforms. Even LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) added messaging capabilities to its platform. LinkedIn, like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and many other social network services is starting to look suspiciously like Facebook. It's clear that enterprise messaging and cloud for collaboration is already the next thing social media companies are targeting. Could Microsoft be trying to follow in the social media giant's footsteps? With the quarter Facebook had last quarter, why wouldn't you try? But $8B for Slack is not the answer, Microsoft. We think you understand that. We are guessing that Microsoft is thinking about getting in on this trend and perhaps trying to stretch out the way that they are monetizing mobile users by adding a high octane messaging platform. While we certainly admire Microsoft's effort to try and think about carving out new moneymaking segments for itself, we don't think spending $8 billion for this enterprise messaging product, when you already have Yammer and Skype, is a reasonable idea. We think shareholders should be happy that the company seems to agree. Why not spend the $8 billion to build out your already existing technology? People will note that in the case of Facebook, the company shelled out for WhatsApp because it had an enormous user base. It clearly turned out to be a fantastic move for Facebook because they were essentially buying hundreds of millions of users. That is why the WhatsApp purchase still looks like a fantastic idea to this day. This new system Microsoft was considering would have about 675,000 paid users and 2.3 million total users, which is absolutely nothing (less than 1% of WhatsApp's base when acquired) when compared to the mass of numbers that other messaging platforms have. Facebook paid about $19B for WhatsApp, which conservatively had about 250M users at the time. This works out to about $76 per user. If Microsoft were to pay $8B for Slack, they'd be paying $3,478 per user, or about 45 times what Facebook paid for WhatsApp. What more would they be getting? Document storage and sharing that Microsoft already can handle with Azure and enterprise communication that the company already has with Yammer. Yammer, again, already handles messaging and is already integrated with document sharing for the Microsoft Office suite. By ducking out of this deal, Microsoft may be saving $8 billion for shareholders. It's a smart decision that is indicative of the "new" Microsoft under Nadella. We're not sure Ballmer would have had the composure to skip a deal like this. How many times have we watched the company come in second on something because of an impulse purchase from Ballmer or lack of innovation? Take Zune for instance. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) came out with the iPod, Microsoft invested a substantial amount of money in coming out with their own personal music device, and it went absolutely nowhere. We would have been looking at a repeat of this Zune with Slack, except we're guessing far more expensive and substantially more pointless for the company in this potential acquisition. As we've written in previous posts, we like the "new" Microsoft under Satya Nadella. Nadella's regime has shown smarts in the way that it has done business and its immediate ability to grow Azure. Avoiding this Ballmer-esque acquisition may have been Nadella's latest great move. We think torching $8 billion that could be used for many purposes, not the least of which is improving Skype or issuing a special dividend to shareholders would have been completely foolish move and we surely hope that Microsoft does not go down this route. Prudent capital management at Microsoft continues to be one of the reasons it's easy to like as a long-term investment, and this latest news encourages us that management's judgment continues to be on point. *Steve Ballmer Image Source: Wikimedia Commons Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
