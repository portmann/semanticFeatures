Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) has appointed management consulting firm McKinsey & Co to help with the reorganization of its core businesses, technology news website Re/code reported on Monday. McKinsey will help Yahoo decide which units to shut, sell or invest in, Re/code said, citing several people close to the situation. ( on.recode.net/1QdGTOu ) McKinsey and Yahoo, which is preparing to spin off its 15 percent stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), were not immediately available for comment. Yahoo has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O). Under Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, Yahoo has been trying to revive its core media and online advertising business by spending more to get users on its websites. Top executives at Yahoo have been asked by Mayer over the last month to make three to five-year commitments to the company, sources told Re/code. The sources said they expected at least two people reporting directly to Mayer to leave the company. Several top executives, including Media head Kathy Savitt and Chief Development Officer Jackie Reses, have left in the last couple of months.
