F Stands For Facebook: Presenting The New FICO Credit Score | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Chinese investment in U.S. commercial real estate has changed over the  past three years, and this has caused changes in the ownership of U.S.  assets. It has changed even more over the past six... We would like to believe that a period of peace and prosperity lies ahead of us. Unfortunately, the facts do not support this panglossian assertion. If history  repeats it is more likely... Colorado is now the newest state to approve intrastate crowdfunding allowing the stateâ€™s residents to be able to purchase stock in local, private companies without becoming an accredited investor.

In April, we brought you the " FAKE-O " score or, as we delicately described it, "banks' brilliant plan to lend to deadbeats." The problem with FICO scores - or any other measure of creditworthiness where the model inputs are linked to payment history - is that they donâ€™t end up being very high for people who arenâ€™t good about making payments on time and thatâ€™s bad news when youâ€™re trying to build a successful â€œoriginate to sellâ€? model.  If youâ€™re a subprime auto lender for instance, and you want to make as many loans as you can so that you can sell them to Wall Street where they will be put through the securitization doomsday machine, you donâ€™t really care about the creditworthiness of the borrower, but you have to base your decisions on something because if any annoying regulators ever come sniffing around your books trying to figure out why the entire market just disintegrated into a smoldering pile of subprime ashes you can point to a number and say "see, by this metric things should have been ok." So what do you do? Well, one thing you can do is come up with an alternative way to measure creditworthiness and preferably one which is virtually guaranteed to come back with a happy result, which is exactly what Fair Isaac decided to do. Hereâ€™s what WSJ said about the new "unnamed" score at the time: The new score, which isnâ€™t yet named, will be calculated based on consumersâ€™ payment history with their cable, cellphone, electric and gas bills, as well as how often they change addresses and other factors, according to Fair Isaac, also known as FICO. Traditional FICO scores that lenders use in the approval or rejection process are calculated based on the information in the credit reports from the three major credit-reporting firms, Equifax Inc., Experian PLC and TransUnion. The new score will instead pull data from a separate database of telecommunications and utilities providers maintained by Equifax. Got that? The "new score" will determine how creditworthy someone is by asking the utility company if the lights are still on and asking the phone company if the phone is still connected.  Now obviously, some of the last things people will stop paying as they descend into abject poverty are the electric bill and the phone bill, so if you wanted to engineer â€œevidenceâ€? of creditworthiness, this is a good place to start as anyone who managed to keep electricity flowing to their home last month suddenly deserves a loan for a car.  But because that wasnâ€™t (nearly) absurd enough, Facebook has a better idea. Mark Zuckerberg will determine your creditworthiness based on your friend network.  No, really. Hereâ€™s The Consumerist : Earlier this year Facebook announced it would dip its toes into the pool of mobile payments by launching a system that allowed users to send money to friends via the Messenger app. Now it appears the company may take things a bit farther after receiving approval for a patent this week that would allow creditors to determine whether or not someone is worthy of a loan based on their circle of friends on the social networking site. The patent â€” which was actually applied for by Facebook back in August 2012 â€” is for a system of authorization and authentication based on an individualâ€™s social network. It could have several uses, including filtering out spam email and offensive content, and improving searches on the site. However, itâ€™s the use related to approving or denying a loan request based on the friends you keep that is a bit worrisome. â€œWhen an individual applies for a loan, the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individualâ€™s social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes (connections),â€? the patent states. â€œIf the average credit rating of these members is at least a minimum credit score, the lender continues to process the loan application. Otherwise, the loan application is rejected.â€? According to the patent, the lender would be able to access a potential borrowerâ€™s social circle by submitting a request for information from Facebookâ€™s databases. They would then receive a series of lists â€“ grey, black and white â€“ that would be used to determine the average credit score for the would-be borrowerâ€™s friends. And while Bankrate.com's Greg McBride assures us that this is "nothing to lose sleep over for people with decent credit history," it's not the borrowers we're concerned about. The question is this: what happens when billions in loans that were made based on Facebook's proprietary friend check end up packaged and sold to investors? Or maybe more to the point: how utterly insane will this one day look when everyone suddenly realizes that a wave of defaults all have one thing in common... that the underlying loans were made based on borrowers' social networks?

Fri, 08/07/2015 - 13:57 | 6401953 OrangeJews  No seriously, load it up. Why not. The difference between being fucked, totally fucked and totally and utterly fucked is that you've got friends you can rely on. I'd like to buy a central bank please, it doesn't matter what it costs, I can get it, and I've got a shit load of friends who just 'like' me to death... Fri, 08/07/2015 - 14:17 | 6402021 froze25 Next stop will be since the credit scoring process is faulty, the credit scorers will be put out of business by the goobermint then the goobermint will take over the business and improve upon it by just granting everybody a 750+++, AAA, A-1+, P-1, etc., and then releasing them from their debts if they live in certain fucked up zip codes, are illegal immigrants, Muslim, black, quadriplegic running backs (I told one of my SF 49ers Progressive fans that they should get a quadriplegic running back since he's into diversity and equality, but "Oh fucking no!") Fans of Cait, registered Democrats, whatever. Fri, 08/07/2015 - 15:12 | 6402189 saints51 Fri, 08/07/2015 - 15:22 | 6402225 saints51 Good deal. You will be my first friend on facebook. Our whole Facebook motto can be built around buying the fucking dip. Have stickers made saying "I Love the Fed" and do that share shit for some middle finger +1. Every time market goes down we can ask Kevin or Janet on facebook is it time to BTFD. If they do not respond we will just say they hate jews. It will work. Fri, 08/07/2015 - 16:05 | 6402330 The9thDoctor I tell average joes all of the time, that the easiest way to increase your FICO score is to simply request a credit limit increase once every seven months after having a 100% payment history. They look at me like I have two heads and then they argue with me, telling me it isn't true.  Then they come up with all of these logical reasons why that won't work. Hey, if you think keeping your Capital One card at a $300 limit and putting a $297 balance on it every month works, then keep doing it.  That's why you're still in the low 600s and won't ever escape. We have so many subprime borrowers in this country, because we have so many economically illiterate people in this country.  The two go hand in hand.  Even when you explain how the flawed system works, the average joe idiot argues with you, instead of just accepting the system as flawed and gaming it with that knowlege.  They have this bias on how they think the way things should work, instead of going off of the way things do work. In the schools today, the only exposure to finance is a half credit economics course for Seniors in high school.  The textbook mentions the existance of the FICO system, but doesn't explain how it actually works.

Fri, 08/07/2015 - 14:33 | 6402077 markovchainey I give up.  ND, I'm creating a new screen name "TotalDebt".  I'm gonna borrow my way into complete and insolvent hell.  You can drive my Ferrari as long as you get here before the repo man! THE huge problem here is that "your social network" is now having their credit history investigated without their permission and without them directly applying for credit. Am I wrong here?  Since when does FB or FICO have permission to crawl through my credit because Joe Blow applied for some car loan he is unable to afford? Just face it, you're nothing more than a little slave.  You were born a slave and you will die a slave! Fri, 08/07/2015 - 15:58 | 6402311 Zymurguy What happens if one of my FB "friends" defaults?  Does that impact my score?  See where this is going???  I've had an account for some time, I don't use it and mainly only have it as a way to keep track of some folks and maintain some contact info.  But this is as good incentive as any to quit FB altogether. Fri, 08/07/2015 - 16:09 | 6402338 nerfCash The next time you click 'OK TO UPDATE FACEBOOK?' that little credit consent nugget will be buried in there.  Frankly, the entire illusion-of-control dance has grown tiresome, but apparently the Minions still enjoy listening to the music.

Fri, 08/07/2015 - 13:30 | 6401848 Herp and Derp Actually, it is more for things like credit worthiness of potential roommates.  Myself and a couple of friends thought this up back in 2008/9.  This was filed back during first to invent, so I have a feeling we would have priority if it turns into something valuable.  It is an alternative to credit ratings for young people with little to no credit and about how honorable they are.  It was actually a derivative from an online payment sharing/splitting system complete with easy credit card programs and a rental bundling system.  Never got the capital together to launch. Fri, 08/07/2015 - 15:08 | 6402179 sun tzu FICO is an absurd and arbitrary measure of credit worthliness that cannot be improved through common sense measures.  For example, as FICO stands, if someone is incorrectly placed in collections, there is at once a take down of one's score and no means (aside from hiring a lawyer and suing the company) of actually expunging the record, even if paid. Factoring in utilities seems like a pretty common sense measure to me.
