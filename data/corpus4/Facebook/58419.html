Why Apple 'Gets Away With It' In China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple products do not threaten China's government. Apple conforms its policies to both Chinese law and policy priorities. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has done it again. While other large companies, from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), find mostly frustration in their dealings with China, Apple goes from strength to strength. Its latest move, the inevitable introduction of Apple Pay alongside Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Chinese banks , illustrates how it works. First, Apple is in a fortunate position in that it does not threaten the Chinese government. It makes gear, it doesn't define how that gear is used, and it doesn't produce content the government might see as dangerous. Second, Apple has deliberately made itself as dependent on China as China is on Apple. Nearly all Apple gear is produced in China, and while a cut-off of operations would greatly damage both, this would be of greater risk to Apple. Third, and most important, Apple conforms its corporate policies to the needs and desires of the Chinese government. Cook's own recent visit to China, in which he used China's Weibo (NASDAQ: WB ), a Twitter-like service, and where he announced a series of environmental initiatives (very popular in China), is a perfect illustration. Apple will now work with the World Wildlife Fund to make Chinese forests more productive and sustainable, and it will build a 40 Mwatt solar project in western Sichuan province - the country has long been troubled by an east-west divide in terms of prosperity. The idea is that, just as in the U.S., Apple will produce all the electricity it needs from the Sun. Thanks to its deep understanding of what China wants, Apple has been allowed to take the top layer - the profitable layer - off the Chinese mobile market, just as it has taken the top layer off the global market. Apple has beaten back Xiaomi on its home turf , bringing in $16.8 billion in revenue from China during one quarter and taking 26% of the market . Since China is now the world's largest buyer of technology, not just its chief producer, this is absolutely vital. Few American companies seem able to do this without literally selling out to their Chinese partners, as IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has in selling its PC and server operations to Lenovo. China does not want American companies to kowtow to it, as ultra-nationalists here insist. It demands to be treated honestly and transparently, as an equal, not as a place to dump goods or production problems like pollution. Apple does just that, and gives the impression of being honored to do so. American ultra-nationalists may not like that, but that's how you do business, and Americans would demand the same of large overseas companies operating here.
