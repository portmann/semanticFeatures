Why Apple Should Invest In Tesla - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A tie-up could return excitement to the Apple name and create the next "big thing" for the company. Apple needs a boost for its venture into autos and this could be the ultimate disruptor for the auto industry. Tesla would benefit from the capital infusion and Apple's software expertise. Both companies would gain, especially in Asia, from where much of their future growth will come. There has been much speculation about what Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is hoping to do in the auto space. Nobody but Tim Cook really knows, but there is little doubt it concerns the inevitable future of electric and autonomous vehicles. An investment in, but not an outright purchase of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) would bring many benefits to both parties. There would be benefits in terms of product and in use of capital. Massive investment is needed in moving from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles ((EVs)). Apple has the money and the software expertise, Tesla has the best product and the strongest brand on the road. Apple has been ramping up its R&D research in recent years. The reasons for this increase are hard to know. Some have speculated that it is investing towards building an EV. This seems very doubtful. The capital requirements would be huge, and it would be a huge gamble by the usually cautious Tim Cook. Some of it is no doubt being directed towards investments in the auto space. Much of it may be just the result of increased vertical integration by Apple, which comes at a cost. What is not in doubt is that Apple has huge stockpiles of cash and that the market has been concerned that it does not have a clear direction in how to spend this cash. That is one reason for the relatively low stock price with its P/E ratio of 10.60. This seems ridiculously low when compared to that of, say, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) at 30.92 or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) at 71.90. The current cash position has not been good for the Apple stock price and thus Apple investors. Apple does buy small companies on a regular basis. Its largest purchase of recent times was that of Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014 for US$3 billion. The benefits of this are not so clear, especially bearing in mind the unenthusiastic reaction to the recent Apple Music launch. Most recently, Apple has invested US$1 billion in Didi Chuxing. This makes a lot more sense. It is another step into the auto world, and an investment in a country, which represents a quarter of Apple's sales total. Didi is in fact losing substantial amounts of money in a price war with Uber (Private: UBER ) in China. However, Apple's investment is presumably not for short-term profits. An investment in Tesla would also not be for short-term profit. China is of course Tesla's second biggest market, and one in which it is planning to build a factory. A three-way co-operation with Didi Chuxing has obvious potential. Apple, as of Q2 2016, was anticipating a total program up to March 2018 in which US$175 billion would be spent in Buybacks. The total capital return will rise to US$250 billion when taking into account dividends and share settlements. Apple's cash in hand, plus the money it is likely to make in the next two years, would leave it with about US$300 billion in the bank. As of Q2 2016: Some analysts have come out against Apple buying Tesla for revenue reasons. This is a case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The argument is that Apple will produce revenues of about US$227 billion this year and Tesla only about US$11 billion. So there would only be a 5% increase in revenues for Apple in the first year of a total buyout. This misses the point of the long-term synergies and reflects short term-ism. The market cap of Tesla is currently round about US$30 billion. So Apple could swallow up the whole company without much of a financial problem, despite most of its cash being held offshore. However, a complete takeover would present difficulties in combining the two, even though they may share quite a lot in "corporate culture." The history of large corporate mergers is not a happy one. They are more often the product of the egos of CEOs rather than adding value for shareholders. There needs to be a clear strategic imperative for them to succeed. This was shown in an article studying the matter by "The Economist" magazine. One of the few successful mega-mergers has been in the auto industry, that of Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ). In that case, CEO Sergio Marchionne has had a clear strategic vision, which he has successfully implemented. Owning Tesla outright would dilute Apple's earnings and reduce gross profit margins. The stock market might not take that very well. The P/E ratio is already very low compared to its market peers. Apple's Gross Profit Margin is 39.8% (Tesla's 21.53%). Apple's Operating Profit Margin is 29.39% (Tesla's is -20.2%) Apple's Net Profit Margin is 22.27% (Tesla's is -23.9%). However, any negative effect on return on capital for Apple would be small compared to the effects of actually producing an EV themselves. Another argument against a full takeover is that the Tesla's stock price is overvalued. That of course is a matter of opinion, and only time will tell. So a complete takeover might not benefit stockholders of Apple even if the long-term benefits might well be very positive. Also, it is hard to see Elon Musk staying at the helm of Tesla if he is not still the all-powerful leader. It is difficult to imagine Tesla without Musk at this stage. However, many see Elon Musk as the type of charismatic and visionary leader that Apple has been lacking since Steve Jobs. A partnership between the media-savvy Musk and the administrator Tim Cook has great potential. So a minority stake with joint marketing and branding agreements would be ideal. It would produce mutual benefits for the companies and for their investors. A complete takeover at a later date would be likely. Apple needs the "next big thing" if its stock price is not to crawl along at the current low P/E levels. The development of EVs and autonomous vehicles could well be this, as I detailed in a recent article . Gasoline and diesel vehicles cannot provide a quantum leap in the auto world. There are too many compromises necessary between CO2 emissions, nitrous oxide emissions, performance and engine life. EVs can offer radical new opportunities in which software is key, especially in autonomous vehicles. Car manufacturers could become just hardware producers, much as Apple caused to happen in the personal computer industry. It is hard to see how Apple can make a big impact in the auto market without a dramatic move. As other partnerships get announced almost daily, Apple is in danger of following a trend rather than creating it. There are countless obvious synergies between Apple's software and hardware products and Tesla's software driven EVs. As the time of autonomous vehicles gets closer, so the pace of such software and hardware tie-ups will increase. Another such tie-up has just been announced as the pace of change quickens. Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM ) and Uber ( UBER ) signed an agreement to cover both vehicle sales and other research as well. Uber is deeply involved in autonomous technology. Toyota is investing large sums in Artificial Intelligence for self-driving cars. On the same day, another such partnership was announced between Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) and Israeli-based taxi start-up Gett. Volkswagen is reeling from its diesel emissions scandal and needs to move on rapidly and try to look like a good corporate citizen. Apple has its "CarPlay" using the iPhone. It is now available in 100 auto models from 40 automakers. As it is, though, it just seems like one more software revenue generator. It does not move the needle in any meaningful way. It is a connectivity tool for an iOS interface to a vehicle's information and entertainment system. It has competition from auto companies investing in their own systems, as well as Google's "Android Auto." It is true that Tesla's own system is based on open source Linux, but long-term integration with Apple's iOS would not be a major hurdle. Apple derives 25% of its income from China and is making a big push into India. Tim Cook's recent swing through Asia showed this. In India, the not particularly charismatic Cook was treated almost like a rock star. This is a sign of the power of brands in India and in Asia as a whole. During his visit, Cook announced various initiatives including retail stores and software developments involving the hiring of thousands of Indian engineers. Foxconn, Apple's main contract supplier, has plans to invest US$10 billion in manufacturing facilities in the country. Much of it is expected to involve Apple products. To gain meaningful traction in the country, Apple or Tesla would need to manufacture there under Prime Minister Modi's "Make in India" campaign. China is a more likely immediate recipient of a tie-up between Apple and Tesla. Apart from the Didi Chuxing situation, combined marketing and investments there would make sense. Tesla is extremely focused on China and has had discussions with potential joint venture manufacturing partners. For both Apple and Tesla, China is their second largest market. One reason for the tie-up with Didi was the further promotion of Apple Pay. One can imagine the consumer calling a taxi or an autonomous vehicle or a car-share vehicle on his iPhone and paying for it with Apple Pay. This could be standard in all Tesla vehicles and in many countries, Tesla has proved ideal as a taxi or ride-sharing vehicle. It is Uber's most popular vehicle in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, as I detailed in a recent article. Even away from autos, there are clear synergies. Tesla's move into home energy storage systems fits with Apple's move into various home management features and its "Home Kit" product. The photo below shows how Tesla feels they can combine their "Powerwall" and "Powerpack" products along with their autos. News reports from Reuters suggest Apple is studying the EV charging business especially as it relates to Home Energy systems. These have not been confirmed. Despite what some bears here have claimed, Tesla is in fact ramping up its home energy storage solutions. There is a strong international push to this. There are dedicated sales teams and web-based offerings for specific markets such as China and Australia. "Home Kit" is another sound Apple product but not one that is setting the world on fire. iOS devices enable homeowners to connect products around their house, such as turning off lights, lowering thermostats etc. It works with 50 outside brands, and enables accessories to talk to each other and interact with each other. The synergies with Tesla's "Powerwall" are clear. The single biggest benefit to Tesla, at least in the short term, would of course be a cash one. The orders pouring in and the need for large sums of capital investment tell their own story. The recent capital raise was highly successful. The US$1.4 billion raised should leave the company with cash of about US$2.85 billion. Even this amount would not rule out a future return to the market in either late 2017 or early 2018 as Model 3 production ramps up. A cash infusion from Apple would cut out the need for this. It would therefore cut down on the bears' constant (and so far unfounded) claims of a stock price crash due to stock dilution. So it would also be accretive for Tesla stockholders. The Gigafactory, now starting to ship out Tesla's energy solution products, may need some extra finance for completion. Additionally, Apple is a huge user of batteries. Co-operation between the two would make a lot of sense. Particularly in Europe, there is growing potential for energy storage systems such as this. Customers can reduce energy bills by storing energy from solar panels or other renewable energy sources. They can also be used as a source of emergency backup power during energy blackouts. Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ) has been doing this as a backup to the effects of typhoons and earthquakes in their home country of Japan. It will be marketing aggressively a range of consumer home storage products in Europe starting in September this year. In retail in general, there could be opportunities. Apple stores are undergoing some design updates as they may be getting a bit dated now. On a revenue per square foot basis, they are still the most successful retail operations in history. Tesla sells direct through its own stores and cuts out the traditional dealer network. Combining Apple retail with Tesla retail is an exciting and logical idea. It would also help in countries like India where Apple is such a strong brand despite limited sales. India's Minister of State for Power, Coal and New and Renewable Energy, Piyush Goyal, announced in March a target of having an all EV fleet on the roads of India by 2030. The move was backed by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. As things stand now, Tesla would not have the finance or the Management time to be involved. In an alliance with Apple, their involvement might be possible. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that the driver-less auto market will be worth US$42 billion by 2025. Tesla is at the forefront of this technology. Its "Autopilot" feature is the most advanced on the market. The driver-less auto market will need increased capital investment and require top software and hardware engineers. Apple & Tesla together could achieve this. The financial might of Apple behind Tesla would give confidence to consumers that Tesla is here to stay. The biggest advantage to both companies would in fact lie in Asia. China is key to the success of both companies. India is being looked at with yearning for the long run. Many other countries in the region have great potential. Apple is perhaps restricted by management resources from putting more focus on Asia. The lack of Apple retail stores in Asia is an example of this. Apple has stores only in China (but there are a lot more in just California), Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. Tesla is restricted by the lack of management resources, but even more so by the lack of finance. Even in countries where there is high demand, and a charging infrastructure in place, Tesla cannot meet up with demand. This is currently the case in Hong Kong where buyers have complained that their lead-times for delivery for the Model S had got longer. South Korea is an example of both the problems and the opportunities Apple and Tesla face. Apple has made substantial inroads there, despite it being the home of archrival Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Up to July last year, market share for mobile phones tripled to 14%. This compares to Samsung at 59% and LG Electronics at 22%. Yet there is not a single Apple Store in the country. Tesla has previously said it would like to market its cars in Korea, where 1.7 million autos are sold each year. The main market players there are both coming out with EVs. Hyundai has a plug-in version of its "Sonata" mid-sized sedan and a hydrogen fuel cell version of its "Tuscon" crossover. Kia has an electronic version of its "Soul" economy vehicle. Tesla's CTO J.B. Straubel visited Seoul in November last year. He confirmed Tesla was interested in the Korean market, but had no firm plans for officially entering the market at that time. "We don't want to damage the brand by growing too quickly and not having enough infrastructure, service and support for our customers." In January this year, Tesla did however incorporate Tesla Korea Ltd. in the country. Now it has been reported that Tesla has struck a partnership agreement with Korean automotive company Mando Corp., to work on self-driving autos together. However, this has not been confirmed by either party. In another sign of the potential for Tesla, a report in The Korea Herald this week made interesting reading. A survey of the country's autoworkers showed a stunning 51.2% would consider buying a Tesla if the brand was available in their country. It predicted that when EVs became widespread in Korea, the market leaders would be Tesla, Hyundai and Kia. We live in an age where brand power and brand loyalty are key, especially in brand-conscious Asia. Apple and Tesla would be a brand combination made in heaven in a country like Korea, with two of the most powerful brands in the world joined together. Worldwide brands matter increasingly. Apple is still the most valuable brand in the world. It has however lost a bit of its brand equity amongst the young and environmentally conscious. An alliance with Tesla would do much to repair this damage. Apple has historically shied away from taking over large companies. There has been much speculation on potential targets in recent years. A complete takeover of Tesla might not be advantageous in the short run. A substantial investment in Tesla by Apple would have nothing but advantages for both companies. These advantages could play out in finance, product development, sales and marketing opportunities, and in brand development. Since Steve Jobs, Apple has been following trends rather than setting them. They have done this very successfully. However, this is a golden opportunity for Apple. It could define a new market and the next "big thing" for the company. The financial might and software expertise of Apple could combine with Tesla's clear lead in EV manufacture to prove the ultimate disruptor of the auto industry.
