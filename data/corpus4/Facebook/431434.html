Basically, a lot of people watched LNKD drop off the table and thought to themselves “Oh, so it’s not just me that doesn’t know that LinkedIn is actually – like – for?” But apparently it wasn’t everyone who thought that… Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella knows what we’re talking about… Microsoft Corp. said it will buy LinkedIn Corp. in a deal valued at $26.2 billion, giving the worldâ€™s biggest software provider access to a virtual Rolodex of connected business professionals. Microsoft will pay $196 per share in an all-cash transaction, including LinkedInâ€™s net cash, a 49.5 percent premium to LinkedInâ€™s closing price Friday. That’s a lot, but it’s not cheap to buy a company with all that personal data and bend it to your corporate will. You know, change it and fix what’s broken… LinkedIn will retain its brand, culture and independence and Jeff Weiner will remain chief executive officer of the company, Microsoft said in a statement Monday.Â  The offer values LinkedIn about 91 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the highest multiple of any takeover valued at more than $5 billion this year, the data show. Wow Microsoft, even Clippy is looking at this deal and saying “I don’t get it.” Vying For Aramco Deal Fees Means Twiddling Your Thumbs For Hours In The Waiting Room Then Being Told You’re Pitching A 22 Year-Old David Tepper Not Amused By His Super-Horny Facebook Impersonator Real Estate Bubble Outpacing Stock Market Trouble Summer Intern Explains Tardiness Was On Account Of Being Forced To Take The Time To Tell His Father Off Billionaire Upgrades To $270 Million House Because The $49 Million One Felt Cramped Court Awards Jerome Kerviel 0.007991228% Of Damages He Demanded From SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Credit Suisse CEO, Credit Suisse Bankers Pretty Much Openly Hating Each Other Right Now: NYT Guy Figures Out How To Put Hedge Funds Out Of Business Once And For All Private Equity Exec To Basically Become Hugh Hefner’s Landlord Vying For Aramco Deal Fees Means Twiddling Your Thumbs For Hours In The Waiting Room Then Being Told You’re Pitching A 22 Year-Old Congress Doesnâ€™t Understand Why SEC Is Being Such A Killjoy About This Whole Insider Trading Thing 209469No commentshttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F2016%2F06%2Fmicrosoft-pays-26-billion-for-linkedin%2FMicrosoft+Pays+%2426+Billion+To+Figure+Out+What+LinkedIn+Is+For2016-06-13+15%3A56%3A30Thornton+McEneryhttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F%3Fp%3D209469 Money Laundering in the Digital Currency Age When the world learned that the terrorist organization al-Qaeda used money-laundering techniques to fund the tragic event of 9/11, the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other government bodies around the world intensified their anti-money laundering tactics.
