Facebook's Earnings Were Exactly What I Expected - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha A few days ago I explained how Facebook may report subdued earnings and with Wednesday's release that is exactly what transpired. The beat on the top and bottom line was more inline with last quarter's results and less like the previous year's blowout results. But, I also explained that this was completely expected and not a cause for worry since the company is deep in their investment year. I examine the two quarters to understand if these subdued earnings were in fact due to continued investments. Overall, keep a long-term outlook on the company and stock as these investments will be the beginning of new growth. In my article earlier this week detailing how I expected Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to report subdued earnings I explained that this quarter's earnings will look much like last quarter's - nothing of a blowout and probably close to consensus estimates. This year as a whole has been - and will continue to be - a departure from Facebook's typical earnings releases where reported numbers far surpass Street expectations. Instead this year, due to the on-going investments in the company through R&D and marketing, earnings numbers are far more inline with expectations. Much like last quarter earnings only beat by 3 cents while revenue beat by $50M. Last quarter earnings beat was by 2 cents and missed by $20M on the top line. These are far different from prior year's expectations where Facebook in Q2 of 2014 beat by 10 cents and $110M. That was a 31.25% bottom line beat where this year's beats have been by margins of 5% and 6.3%, respectively. The reason for these more inline earnings numbers is due to the company investing within itself and its products. Expansion of current products has taken a breather this year while management focuses on future growth catalysts to push the company further on the path of income expansion. All of this is showing up on the costs and expenses line on this report and the last while surely the next two will as well. As I briefly explained earlier in the week, all of these investments and expenses are hurting the bottom line in a numbers sense but not a long term sense. One can look at the report and see that GAAP EPS fell 5 cents to $0.25 from $0.30 in the prior year's quarter, good for a 16.6% drop. At first glance - and without any prior understanding - one would think this is a glaring red flag. How can Facebook who is considered a growth company and a domineering force in its sector be showing a reversal in its bottom line? The problem is looking at this bottom line during this investment period. The key is the top line where revenue has been growing at a 39% clip (and more if it wasn't for forex headwinds). This top line has been pretty steady the last several quarters even though it is slowing slightly. For a growth company it is important that revenue continues to increase at growth pace. I consider growth above 25% to be a pace at which a growth company grows its revenues. Anything above 50% I consider to be super growth pace. Facebook seems to be just outside this phase at this stage of their company but it is still comfortably within the growth pace. As long as this top line number continues on this growth path then the investments can certainly continue to happen. Now that we have two quarters in the books during this investment year I believe it would be wise to compare the two to understand the progress. Moreover, in order to understand how my pre-earnings article compares to the results we need to look at the margins and spending to see if they are indeed the reason for the subdued earnings. Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26% compared to Q2's margin of 31%. It seems the heaviest spending was in Q1 while Q2 showed some easing of spending to help bring it up 500 bps. R&D in Q1 was 29.97% of revenue while Q2 was 28.94% of revenue or 103 bps lower. Marketing and sales was 17.5% of revenue in Q1 while Q2 was 15.48% of revenue or 202 bps lower. GAAP Net income in Q1 dropped 28% while in Q2, as I already mentioned, it dropped 16.6%. This slowing in bleeding is a sign that investments were front loaded rather than back end loaded quarterly speaking. Revenue in Q1 increased 42% over the prior year while Q2 revenue increased 39% over its prior year. While a small deceleration it still is very comparable especially as currency headwinds continue to push against what would be considerably more growth. Free cash flow came in at $1.3B this quarter while Q1 showed $1.2B. This is a good sign that cash flow remains strong and is within a tight range quarter to quarter when compared to revenue. It seems that these numbers show continued signs of investment as expected. It seems so far that Q1 has been the highest investment to revenue quarter thus far and that Q2 showed signs of less investment intensity. During the conference call management gave a tighter budget guidance for investments in the coming quarters as they expect full year GAAP expenses to be between 55%-60% instead of the previous 55%-65% range given. This should give investors a better idea of how much expenses will impact the rest of the year. I expect Facebook to continue on this trend even though I believe a majority of the expenses are probably behind us at this point. However, I still expect a similar level of expenses to continue to the end of year. At that time I expect Facebook will have finished absorbing their acquisitions, made progress in their R&D department where many of their expenses are contained, and will ramp up current campaigns with Instagram and video ads and release new products that are being developed right now. Management is focused on product development but more importantly product integration as slow and steady is a winning formula. As I said in my earlier article, continue to look long term on this company and stock because investment today is growth tomorrow. When this giant finishes taking its recovery breath it may be time to sit back and watch the vision and growth come to life ... again.
