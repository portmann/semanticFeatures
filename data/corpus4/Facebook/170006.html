Verizon Wants Millennials: I'm Skeptical It'll Get Them - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti , My Latest YouTube Video (for the beginning investor) (850 clicks) Verizon will lose the millennials if it doesn't do something. It is experimenting with a skinny package that has experienced muted success. VZ is giving access to NFL games to its subscribers for free. It is clear to Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and all investors in the stock that the way most people consume video content in the next few years will look vastly different than it looks today. Generally, this is viewed as negative news for cable companies because millennials are moving away from subscribing to linear TV. While I agree with the prognosis, investors must analyze the new initiatives Verizon is working on to see if it can maintain any sort of hold onto the video content market. These initiatives haven't been fully released, but the theme is they are aimed at succeeding in a post-linear TV era. I will examine the possibility of their success in this article. One worry I have is whether the initiatives can be properly executed. You will see why I am worried when you see the product Verizon plans to offer. I have written about Verizon's plan to offer a skinny package in an article in April. To recap, Verizon has a subscription package which costs $54.99 per month. It is a pared down version of a regular cable package. It has the option to add more channels for an additional $20. The package also includes exclusive content produced by AwesomenessTV which appeals to younger viewers. AwesomenessTV is a multichannel YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) network that employs talented video creators. In my April article , I wasn't keen on the initiative. It ended up only adding 9,000 new subscribers last quarter. It represented about 1/3rd of the subscribers added by Verizon. Most of the users didn't want to add the extra packages which were supposed to be where Verizon made significant profits. The results were partially negatively impacted by the firm having to delay its advertising of the product in New York and Philadelphia because of legal issues. Verizon is still going through another legal battle with ESPN over whether it can include the network in a custom package. Overall, my opinion on this initiative is the same as it was in April. This plan is reactionary and not proactive. It isn't a long-term solution to the subscription growth problem. Consumers are just going with the cheapest option Verizon offers. Lowering spend per subscriber is a leading indicator to a steep drop off in subscribers in the long term. Besides this skinny package, VZ is also offering more flexible ways to consume NFL and NHL games. The company has gotten exclusive access to show those live events on its customers' mobile devices. Through this $1 billion multi-year deal made in 2013, the NFL is providing all of CBS's and Fox's in-market Sunday afternoon games, NBC's Sunday Night Football, ESPN's Monday Night Football, and CBS/NFL Network's Thursday Night Football. The deal, which lasts from 2014 to 2018, originally was available to certain customers who purchased packages, but now it is available to all customers. This apart of the NFL's strategy of moving away from reliance on linear TV to broadcast its games. The NFL, for the first time, is offering a game exclusively on Yahoo. It also released a $99 product called NFL Game Pass which lets viewers watch the games after they are over. In my opinion, the NFL is somewhat panicked. It knows the linear method of broadcasting games is not sustainable and it doesn't have a viable solution for the future. It is now experimenting with different options to see what works. I don't see how the NFL would consider limiting its free broadcasts only to Verizon customers to be a long-term solution. Right now, AT&T (NYSE: T ) customers can get games on mobile only if they subscribe to its NFL Sunday Ticket plans. In this temporary model, it gets to charge Verizon more because it is exclusive and it makes money from individual extra payments from AT&T customers. In the long term, the NFL probably will not keep mobile viewing exclusive to Verizon which means the competitive advantage VZ has is not sustainable. If the NFL builds out the technology, it may begin to sell its product without the cable companies. This would end the need for most consumers to subscribe. Because the cable companies know this, it makes them willing to pay the NFL even more money than in the past. This puts Verizon in a bad situation. Either it pays up for NFL content or it loses subscribers in droves. The biggest launch Verizon is working on currently is Go90 which is a mobile video service aimed at the millennials. On paper the plan sounds appealing as it will include networks such as Comedy Central, Food Network, ESPN, NFL Network, Discovery, VH1, MTV, SPIKE, TLC, Adult Swim, HGTV, BET, and Investigation Discovery. In the beta form of the website, which was released by accident, it showed the app having content from Fox, AMC, GoPro, and Vevo, but a spokesperson said those were just placeholders. Vevo does seem likely to be on the platform because Erik Huggers, who is the CEO of Vevo, was the person who was originally leading the Go90 when it was owned by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) (and called OnCue). Having Vevo on the platform would be extremely appealing to millennials. On the other hand, they are already used to viewing its content for free on YouTube anyway, so it may not been seen as a product which increases the price consumers would pay for it. Go90 will also have content from multichannel networks such as AwesomenessTV, Vice, Tastemade, Maker Studios, Fullscreen, StyleHaul, Defy, Collective Digital and Machinima. These networks will also appeal to millennials, but channels such as AwesomenessTV, Fullscreen, Vice, Machinima, StyleHaul, and Tastemade already offer a bevy of free content on YouTube. This would make even exclusive content less valuable to consumers. However, YouTube is going to be experimenting with paid subscriptions in the future. If this happens, these channels will likely be one of the first to have paid offerings. This would give the content more value on Go90. While everything I described would lead you to believe this product will be a runaway success, there are some reasons to be skeptical about its execution. The first reason why I am skeptical is that this project has been talked about for years and has been delayed a few times. The project was originally called OnCue. It was an Internet TV service owned by Intel which was set to launch in 2013. Instead, Intel sold it to Verizon in 2014 for $200 million. Erik Huggers, who led the project, left after Verizon acquired it. Clearly, there has been confusion among employees as to what the project will end up looking like when it gets launched. In September 2014 , Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said OnCue would launch in mid-2015. Obviously, this hasn't happened. Instead, it has morphed into a service which appeals to cord-cutting millennials called Go90. Adding to this theme of disarray within the company, TechCrunch, which is a company owned by Verizon through the AOL acquisition, is reporting that there will be a social element to Go90. This sounds to me like the company is trying to do too much. My philosophy on business is to create an MVP which is a minimum viable product in order to see what works before creating a product with a lot of "bells and whistles" which the consumer may not want. Instead Go90 looks like it is doing the opposite as it has been worked on for a few years and it may have unnecessary features such as a newsfeed showing the TV shows your friends are watching. Verizon is not YouTube or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), so I don't see how this will work out. The social element lets users follow friends and celebrities. There is also a feature called "crews" which is the equivalent of a Facebook group. I'm skeptical of Verizon executing this properly. As you can see below , its current trending topics feed on FiOS looks clunky. Another problem Verizon has is its brand isn't seen favorable among millennials. You can see this in action with the success of T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ), which has grown quickly. John Legere's statements about how Verizon doesn't treat its customers well are obviously resonating with customers. This credibility will hurt Go90 when it attempts to compete with other networks. It won't be a problem when it has to compete with Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) version of this product which it calls Stream , but if YouTube begins to compete in this arena, Verizon will be in trouble. YouTube already offers more content than Verizon does and it has a better relationship with young people. Another question I have for this new platform is about how it will be monetized. AOL's technology is expected to be used for the programmatic ads on the service. AOL has previously used its technology for its own properties and content as well as some third-party content. AOL had a revenue growth problem because it had a difficult time growing traffic on its properties. Its technology should work well considering the amount of acquisitions it has made in the past few years. However, this also is a problem because of potential integration difficulties. In essence, when Verizon purchased AOL, it did not buy a single company, it bought a portfolio of companies in the programmatic advertising industry. Tim Armstrong, the former CEO of AOL, will be leading this Go90 platform. He was able to revive AOL from the dead, but it remains to be seen whether he has the skills to grow this type of product. Tim was great at turning the AOL subscription numbers around and creating a portfolio of companies which would make a potential acquirer salivate. This may not translate to running an OTT division. The possibility of Verizon using Go90 to make money on data plans seems ridiculous to me. While customers who use this plan will increase the amount of data they use, overall there is a clear long-term trend towards increased data usage anyway. An analogy would be if Verizon released a competitor to Periscope just to get its customers to use more data. There is no need for this since Periscope and other online video streaming products are causing consumers to use more and more data. Verizon is facing an uphill battle trying to get the millennials to pay for TV content. Because of the amount of content on Go90, it certainly has the potential to be successful. However, its development and monetization pose potential execution issues. It was a risky decision to purchase AOL, but Verizon can't sit idle as young people decide that paying for cable is a waste of money. It is impossible to predict the success of the launch until we see what is released, but I am skeptical of it doing well. When I read about it having a social element, I got nervous because it sounds too ambitious. I do like the feature where celebrities I follow on Periscope can recommend a broadcast to me. However, I doubt Verizon's ability to re-create this with TV programming. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
