Could Facebook's Valuation Be Too Excessive? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook's valuation remains a contentious issue in the tech investing community. While there's no denying Facebook isn't exactly cheap, I believe that various growth drivers substantiate the valuation despite how excessive the valuation may appear. The biggest issue with FB value analysis is the notion that DCF is the go-to model for early growth phase companies. Many have adopted comparative value estimates whereas members of the academic community have suggested qualitative metrics/failure probabilities to be implemented in financial models. When pertaining to Facebook, there's enough predictability and visibility to help mitigate quarterly misses and sustain healthy growth rates. Hence, the valuation premium seems substantiated due to its high predictability. Over the past couple years, the most heavily debated topic has been the valuation of high-flying growth stocks. I dedicate this article to further explore Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) valuation and define why instances of volatility tend to occur. Furthermore, I question conventional financial models when pertaining to early-stage or mid-stage growth companies. Given the lack of operating history and uncertainty behind long-term forecasts it would take an immense amount of foresight to accurately determine sales and earnings going forward. However, I believe a strong investment case can be made despite uncertainty around long-term fundamentals. Valuation frequently surfaces as a key theme for this battleground stock. In the past, many have agreed with my stance on growth, but really can't stomach the valuation. Clearly Facebook isn't cheap, but there's no denying the quality of the business model and long-term growth potential. Facebook has the ability to increase pricing on ads and launch additional products ad infinitum. Therefore the valuation is mostly supported by the company's ability to execute on nascent opportunities as they emerge. Furthermore, Instagram and WhatsApp have yet to reach the scale of FB, but will likely do so given enough time. I believe that these other platforms in conjunction with new growth opportunities like VR are driving speculation. However, the speculation around the stock seems to be grounded in reality. There's no denying that some of the buying also is driven by fear of missing out. While, we have witnessed cases in the past where a stock's valuation could no longer be supported by company fundamentals (dot com bubble for example), I view Facebook's unique positioning in a lot of social verticals, healthy margins and continuous expansion of audience metrics provide enough evidence to support meaningful upward bias. Facebook's valuation has expanded quite significantly following its IPO. For the most part, it's difficult to say it's cheap. On the other hand, there's still upside to sell-side forecasts. So, I can't exactly say it's priced to perfection. Furthermore, there's no denying that assessing the value of FB is difficult due to the limited operating history and uncertainty to long-term forecasts. Nonetheless, analysis is rooted on future value assumptions, otherwise no one can rationalize what they're paying in the present. As such we're basing everything on a prediction and for the most part the market is very optimistic on Facebook's long-term growth trajectory. To that extent, I do have to agree with the market despite how irrational it may look from the perspective of other analysts. As you have all witnessed in the past, many on Wall Street have thrown out DCF models because they have frequently witnessed these growth companies flying off to Jupiter leaving their DCF models on earth. So, these days we use comparative value and statistical measures to come up with a reasonable appraisal of value. So, while Facebook is trading at high valuations relative to its IPO date, I think it's business like usual for investors who can differentiate rampant speculation vs. growth at a reasonable price. However, I'm going to use a research study published in 2009 from Aswath Damodaran (Professor at NYU Stern School of Business) to help characterize the market inefficiencies of conventional models. He's one of few Finance PhDs in the world, so he's worth listening to: Young companies are difficult to value for a number of reasons. Some are start-up and idea businesses, with little or no revenues and operating losses. Even those young companies that are profitable have short histories and most young firms are dependent upon private capital, initially owner savings and venture capital and private equity later on. As a result, many of the standard techniques we use to estimate cash flows, growth rates and discount rates either do not work or yield unrealistic numbers. While these approaches require us to estimate inputs that are often difficult to nail down, they are still useful insofar as they force us to confront the sources of uncertainty, learn more about them and make our best estimates. While we may be tempted to add premiums to these values for potential opportunities that we see in the future, the use of real option premiums should be limited to those companies that have some degree of exclusivity in exploiting these opportunities. It has been a while since I found an academic that's well-versed on the topic of growth investing and the shortcomings of conventional financial models when pertaining to these companies. However, he identifies that a premium should be attached to companies that have exclusivity (high market share, durable advantage, barriers of competition). He then follows up by mentioning that a qualitative probability of success and aggregate business failure rates needs to be factored into long-term financial models. Given what we know about Facebook, the company has a high-quality moat and a high likelihood of success. It's easy to deal with a steady growth stock like Facebook because we can simply separate the distinct growth variables and extrapolate them separately. Furthermore, the quality of management and various efforts to enter into new markets forces us to further extend our long-term growth forecasts, which is why the stock defies the laws of gravity. At some point every good growth story comes to an end, but in the case of Facebook, we've seen the company continually reinvent itself. This leads me to believe that there are at least several years before the growth rate starts to decelerate considerably. While Damodaran provides a primer on almost every valuation technique used by analysts and alternative ideas on valuing early-stage growth companies, I try to highlight the degree of difficulty to predicting sales and earnings. I believe volatility in a stock is often misinterpreted as irrationality when in reality it's just uncertainty about future value assertions on a forward basis. Quarterly misses forces everyone to question their own respective crystal balls and while crystal ball forecasts are often frowned upon, it's the only basis by which we can arrive at a rational valuation for companies. However, I feel like the long-term time horizon of DCF makes it even more difficult to rely on, especially on infant growth companies. So there's a bit of an art and science to dealing with forward looking analysis, and when the entire consensus gets this wrong the stock can only move up or down when based on efficient market hypothesis. The market is only efficient when it accurately predicts the sequences of events that occur. In every instance when it does not, the market corrects aggressively (more like chaotically), which is why there's so much volatility around quarterly earnings reports. This quarterly volatility is heightened when dealing with momentum names or deep value stocks. Volatility seems to be more a function of unpredictability rather than irrationality. However, I believe there's enough visibility to Facebook's revenue and earnings to make it a worthwhile candidate despite the juxtaposition of market efficiency and modern valuation methods. FB Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts In a sense, Facebook seems like one of those businesses that have much longer growth legs than what terminal value assumptions can insinuate. And it's why many analysts are hesitant when dealing with this specific company because later on down the road it's hard to anticipate how Facebook can pursue strategies to scale sales and earnings. Furthermore, the market tends to attach a premium on stable growth businesses. Predictable large-cap growth businesses trade at even higher valuations than small-cap counterparts growing at similar rates. Investors value certainty, and a broad consensus associates size with quality. Conventional models have difficulty with capturing the upside, but they also put a lot of pressure on analysts to accurately anticipate a stock's market value. Despite these difficulties, many of my prior calls on Facebook were right. However, like everyone else I have encountered instances where I have overestimated or even underestimated. I'm not saying I'm always going to get it right, but I think I have a broad enough outline to get a sense for where things are going. I continue to reiterate my $125.92 price target, which implies 19.4% upside from current price levels. While I know valuing stocks is a touchy subject for growth stocks, I believe there's enough tangible evidence to suggest that FB's valuation will continue to trend higher.
