Most Bought And Sold Stocks By Top Hedge Funds | Seeking Alpha Top 10 pure play hedge funds increased their Facebook holdings by $2.3 billion during the first quarter, making it the most bought stock. Baker Hughes turned out be the most bought by existing position holders. Well, any investor would want to own equity in a company which is expected to deliver an earnings growth of 70% next year and north of 200% in three years; however, when the biggest hedge funds start investing aggressively, it's all the more the reason to believe that Facebook is doing most things right. During the first quarter of 2016, among the top 10 pure play hedge funds, active stock pickers with less than 100 positions, holdings in Facebook rose by $2.30 billion, making it the most bought stock. In the light of the fact that nearly $2.13 billion came from new buyers, it appears that most of this buying occurred after an 18% earnings surprise reported by the company for the last quarter of 2015 - EPS stood at 59 cents per share versus 50 cents expected by the market. To its credit, FB came with a bigger surprise in the following quarter, reporting an EPS of 57 cents per share, compared to market consensus of 44 cents, a nearly 30% positive surprise. Watch out for the next quarterly earnings report, expected in the first week of August. Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI ) - Most Bought By Existing Position Holders BHI stood as the most bought stock in terms of increases in exiting positions among the top 10 hedge funds, holdings in the company increased by $566 million during the first quarter. However, last twelve months were not easy for one of the leading oilfield services provider in the wake of the energy industry experiencing a historic weakness. On the surface, Baker Hughes's pristine balance sheet with a level of debt compared to equity at a meager 26%, compared to Haliburton's (NYSE: HAL ) 118% and Schlumberger's (NYSE: SLB ) 60%, appeared to be a good enough reason to bet on the company as the oil market was expected to stage a rebound. However, bulls had more reasons to go all in. The company had a troubled merger deal with Haliburton - several anti-trust issues, regulatory delays, and board approvals. Although, if it went through, investors were set to gain substantially. In case the deal did not materialize, Baker Hughes was set to get $3.5 billion in termination fee from Haliburton, adding almost $6 per share to the existing value of its shares after adjusting for tax. Now, when the merger bid has been rejected by the Department of Justice after nearly two years of regulatory conundrum, hedge funds reaction to the decision would be interesting to watch out for in their next quarterly filings. The net reduction in the top hedge-funds' holdings stood at $5.38 billion, out of which $4.89 billion was the amount attributed to the sold out positions, while the rest came from a reduction in existing positions. Not just retail investors are divided about the fate of the largest company in the world by market capitalization. While billionaire-investor Carl Icahn liquidated his position, citing issues in China, Warren Buffet initiated a $1.1 billion position at $109 per share in the stock, finding it substantially undervalued. Apple shares are down more than 10% since then, currently its trailing PE stands at 10.6 compared to the industry's average at 18.2. Apple naysayers are citing weakness in iPhone sales and the reducing craze for Apple's upcoming devices in addition to growing competition as the reasons for the weakness in share prices to continue On the other side, bulls find Apple's huge ecosystem with multiple fronts to generate recurring revenues, and an unmatchable cash pile to continue huge buybacks, to be good enough reasons for the company to be a winner in the long-term. With this kind of selling, it's pretty clear that the top hedge funds don't have a positive outlook on Apple in the near future, we will be watching out for their next move on Apple for either a change in perception or further liquidation.
