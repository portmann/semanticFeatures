Facebook May Report Subdued Q2 Earnings But The Outlook Doesn't Change - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook reports Q2 earnings this week, and I expect that we will see much of the same that we saw in the Q1 report. These subdued earnings are to be expected, though, as investment into the company continues. The idea is to have a long-term outlook on the company, as these investments are not Facebook slowing down but rather taking a deep breath to continue its run. This week, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings which will conclude the first half of its "investment year." Last quarter, the company posted earnings only two cents above expectations and missed revenue by $20M but still a 42% increase year over year. Some of this was due to the strong dollar, because in constant currency, revenue would have been 49% ahead of last year or an additional $185M. Most of the "other line" weakness was due to its high expenses. That earnings report was the first in the company's self-designated investment year. According to FB's Q1 release "GAAP costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2015 were $2.61 billion, an increase of 83% from the first quarter of 2014." This correlated with its GAAP earnings being lower than the previous year, as net income was $512 million compared to $642 million in the previous year's quarter, or down 20%. Both the currency headwinds and the huge increase in spending were factors for the "sub-par" report that the company issued back in April. With another quarter in the books and the company set to report round two of investment year '15, I expect that we will see another subdued quarter with much of the same margins and spending - but not at all surprising. This is all expected, as management clearly guided for this over two quarters ago. What investors have to keep in mind is that this investment year is just that - an investment...and a year. What I mean by that is this is about investing into the company. Investments are what got Facebook to where it is today. Think Instagram, think mobile, think about the investments it has done in the last three and a half to four years and you realize much of what has been invested in has turned to something profitable. Sure, there were the apps or things that it tried that didn't catch on, but that is to be expected because not everything you create will turn to gold. The difference is the things that did catch on either have produced billions in revenue and income (think mobile platform) or have the potential to make those very same billions (think Instagram). The second part of the statement is "year." A year is short term, very short term, as it is only four quarters, which is a small time frame for a technology company of Facebook's size to move. The earnings that have been squeezed - and will continue to be as it reports this week - due to the investment spending are not the new normal. Metaphorically speaking, this is like a giant who has been running and running and then decides to stop to catch its breath only to continue running some more. Facebook is at the inhalation part of the deep breath getting ready to exhale. And, when it continues to run more, it will have recovered its energy to make its next move - a move into more growth. What I expect after the investment into R&D, which jumped 133% last quarter from the previous year, as well as investment into its sales and marketing team is for the company to produce results. I expect these results to come in the form of income with video on Facebook proper, ads through Instagram, products from its Oculus VR division, and an expansion of features on its Messenger platform as well as further development of the WhatsApp platform which will be monetized at the right time. We are beginning to see some movement on video, Instagram, and some with Oculus , but I think the company has plenty more to come with these products and from its constant tweaking of the main Facebook platform. For those that see Facebook slowing, you are only looking at a few trees while there's an entire forest to consider. The "slowing" is really a breath to regain energy, and when the company finishes that breath, it will again be running, but this time faster. And when it does, those who are invested and have been invested in the company will be thankful for this investment year because of the growth it provided both short term and years afterwards. All in all, this investment year is to be taken in stride. While we will sit through a few more subdued earnings, we will start to see the light at the end of this investment tunnel in another six months. The idea is to keep a long-term view of the company - and stock - as these expenses and reinvestment into the company will produce something larger on the other side. That something larger will be explosive growth in the form of revenue and net income - not to mention some new products.
