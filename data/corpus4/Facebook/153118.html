Netflix Soon To Be Tested Hard By The Growing Threat From YouTube - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google committed to finally making YouTube profitable. Original, premium long-form content is its chief strategy. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has struggled to generate a profit from its popular YouTube video site, and is being threatened by Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) on one side, and short-form focused Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) on the other. There are of course other key players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime and Hulu, among others. Together they're competing for digital eyeballs, and Google understands it must defend YouTube by going on offense, or it'll gradually shrink under the pressure of increasingly compelling and effective competition. Its major strategy to deal with that over the long term is to build out an original premium content platform to differentiate and compete against its video peers. We'll get into some of the details of this, but what will be the game changer for YouTube will be when it gets its first long-form hit that it can leverage into awards and marketing campaigns. That was the route Netflix took, and it was very successful in regard to original content. YouTube without a doubt will employ a similar strategy. A lot of other good content is still important, but YouTube must produce a solid hit to put it on the competitive map. That's one of the reasons it has went after experienced professionals to bring the desired result. For its part, Netflix was the first significant mover with original, long-form content, but it will increasingly face new competition that generates questions on how it will successfully defend an easily reproducible business mode. That has always been the concern of those watching the growing streaming video industry. In the latter part of 2014, YouTube hired Kelly Merryman away from Netflix to become its VP of content partnerships. In July 2015 it hired Susanne Daniels, who had been head of programming at MTV. What's important about this beyond the obvious need for experienced professionals to make the transition to original content, is the fact YouTube leadership are signaling they're all-in with its new strategy. Merryman's role is to do some handholding (managing relationships) with traditional and emerging media companies and brands; including those building out large YouTube audiences. Coming from MTV, it seems certain Daniels will target younger audiences with the goal of producing pop culture hits. She has a strong programming background which should help the burgeoning and hungry YouTube stars. These hires don't mean YouTube hasn't had original content as its strategy, because it has. With mixed results it started with some traditional TV stars for its original content drive. Now it's gravitating toward its home-grown stars to not only keep them on the platform, but to be a foundation for its upcoming subscription service, which has the potential to finally bring YouTube into the black. There are a couple of reasons YouTube has to change its business model. First, as mentioned above, its competitors have started to poach its stars by offering them more production capital and ways to participate in revenue from subscription services. It has to provide incentive so it can benefit over the long term from its providing of a platform for those that have built out huge followings. YouTube can't remain a minor league player underwriting the costs of talent, and then when they reach a level they could generate meaningful earnings for them, have them scooped up by competitors offering them better opportunities. Secondly, it has been proven YouTube won't generate a profit using ads as it primary way of generating revenue. It had to search for other ways to generate revenue. Not only will it produce a more predictable revenue source, but it also deals with the first problem, which is to also provide a more predictable revenue stream for its content providers. Finally, Google in general is trying to mitigate its almost total dependence on ad revenue as its primary source of revenue. At this time it accounts for about 90 percent of Google's revenue. If it could successfully develop a subscription service without a loss of search ad revenue, it would be a powerful catalyst for growth. The company would be even more valuable in the eyes of investors. What will the new YouTube look like? On the content and revenue side, once these steps are put into practice, YouTube will take on a different look. It's possible there would be several different revenue options, including the prior ad revenue, and possibly some tiered subscription model, depending on where it draws its talent from. For sure there will be an option for viewers to watch free content with ads, as the service now operates, with a second option of subscribing to premium content. On the talent side of things, I'm referring to whether or not YouTube decides to go solely with the talent grown on the platform, or it also taps once again into Hollywood talent. That's why I mentioned there could be more than one subscription option to choose from in the future. I don't believe that's how it will launch, but it could end up that way in the years ahead. There is also the potential to offer subscriptions for individual channels of its top performers, which would suggest different subscription price points. What's different about YouTube and Netflix in regard to a big hit, is Netflix did it the more traditional way with 'Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards.' It looks like YouTube is going to go with native talent, which means there could be different expectations, and definitely a different audience in mind. YouTube will focus on a pop culture hit with a younger audience in mind. Considering some of the more popular YouTube stars, it's also probably going to be a comedy of some sort; although that's necessarily a surety. If it wants to boost its fortunes with a critically acclaimed hit, it would go more with a drama. I don't see a lot of YouTube stars to meet that criteria, so I'm sure it'll go with edgy comedy of some sort. I'm not saying premium long-form original content will start that way, but that the big hit being sought will probably go that way. It's possible YouTube leadership will put out some trial balloons to test the waters before it puts its marketing muscle behind what appears to have major hit potential. The risk for YouTube in all of this is on the cost side. Not only will it have to increase the amount stars are paid, but it will also have to commit significantly to the marketing side of the business. That means it must have profitable content to gain and grow momentum. Netflix already had a profitable business model, and could acquire the talent and content on a less risky basis. YouTube doesn't have that luxury at this time, which means revenue and earnings will be under pressure until it not only gets a big hit, but also some smaller hits that are still profitable. It can't afford to miss on too many of its original content projects. Investors want to start seeing the justification for the acquisition costs of YouTube, and the potential it represented at the time. Google will have to deliver on that promise YouTube isn't to become a negative catalyst on the bottom line. There is no doubt YouTube has Netflix in its sights as it grows out its premium, original content platform. To be a serious threat to Netflix it will have to prove it can create sustainable hits, as Netflix has already proven. Investors need to understand this has been an ongoing project for some time, and this isn't something being started from scratch. The difference now is Google and YouTube are taking the necessary steps to make this a successful foray, where premium original content will drive a successful, profitable subscription service. For now, YouTube has to prove it has the ability to create such content. Assuming it does so, that's when the assessment will need to be made on whether or not it can start to take market share from Netflix, which isn't going to sit around and wait to see what YouTube does. I'm limiting this discussion to Netflix and YouTube, but there are going to be many new players focusing various niches, which has the potential to disrupt the disruptor's. That means not only will YouTube and Netflix have to continue to churn out quality, compelling content, but do it in an increasingly crowded market. For years this has always been the concern of Netflix, in that it would have to find a way to differentiate so it was considered more than the technology that accompanied the streaming content. It has done that some with its original content, but it will remain vulnerable to the growing competitive environment it faces. This is why YouTube must produce a big hit. It will allow it to not only get a momentum boost, but seperate its brand from the smaller competitors already nipping at the heels of Netflix. It will also put Netflix more on the defensive, as it will have to come up with more hits of its own to maintain its vulnerable moat. That moat will remain for now, but it's only a couple of hits away from being vulnerable to attack. In other words, Netflix has become a streaming network, and it'll have to operate in a similar fashion as traditional networks. That means it's only as good as its latest group of hits. Other than that, there isn't a lot of differentiation that can't be easily copied.
