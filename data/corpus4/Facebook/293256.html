Why I've Been Wrong On Twitter - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. My macro analysis tells me to sell high-beta tech. I was right about the popularity of Periscope, but I was wrong about its effect on Twitter's stock. I was wrong about Twitter re-accelerating growth. Moments hasn't worked because it doesn't incorporate Scopes. The best explanation of my investment in Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is my macro view has bailed out my mistaken company-specific analysis. My article on the imminent recession was one of my most important articles I have ever written because it summarizes the best arguments for why the stock market is about to crash. My macro view leads me to be bearish on most stocks, which is why I have been focusing on short ideas instead of long ideas in the past few weeks. The stocks that have the potential to do especially badly are high-beta tech stocks, which is why I am bearish on the FANG stocks. I explained my decision to sell Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) last week, now I will go over my thoughts on Twitter. The reason why I have gone over my macro framework is because even if I was right about Twitter or become right over the next few months as it re-accelerates user growth, it may not matter. Proof of this reasoning was when Fidelity devalued Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) by 25% . Snapchat has had nothing but success in 2015, but it has had its valuation compressed because it had gotten out of hand. Even after the haircut, the $12 billion market cap implies a valuation of 240 times 2015 revenues. Profits start to get scrutinized much more closely in a recession than at the end of the bull cycle. We hadn't seen the decline in Facebook until recently because money managers have been piling into the FANG stocks, which were the last stocks to work in the mature stages of this bull market. I sold Twitter at $20 because even if I'm right about user growth, I'm going to be wrong about the stock. Twitter is a high-beta tech stock, so it must be avoided. While I am satisfied with my recession call thus far, it doesn't absolve my mistake in owning Twitter stock which has counteracted my gains in Facebook. In this article I go over my thoughts on why I have been wrong Twitter in order to avoid making similar mistakes in the future. I am going to melt this down into three points, one of which I was right about and two of which I was wrong about. The point I was right about was the popularity of Periscope. I started writing about Periscope before it was released on the App Store. Recently, it hit 100 million total Scopes. But this article isn't about this topic because the points I have gotten wrong override that point and have caused me to lose money. Periscope Has Not Helped Twitter Stock The first incorrect point I made is that Periscope would help Twitter stock go up. It's clear that Twitter's stock has gone down as Periscope has increased in popularity. There are a few reasons for this. First, Periscope is difficult to value. Investors in Twitter have already seen the popularity of Vine wane, so giving Twitter the benefit of the doubt on this new app isn't rational. Most investors who have tried Periscope probably liked it. However, the rationale could be that they also enjoy using Twitter and if Twitter couldn't become profitable with its own application, which has over 300 million users, how will it monetize Periscope? Facebook is given the benefit of the doubt with WhatsApp and Instagram because it has already successfully monetized its main platform. Periscope's monetization is not obvious and Twitter has laid out no plans to do so. Personally, I think monetizing Periscope this early would be a mistake, but other investors may not see it in this perspective. I viewed my investment in Periscope through Twitter stock as I would if I were investing in a private early-stage company. This was a mistake. Public investors don't view investments in the same way as private investors, as they are more oriented toward short-term events and immediate profitability. Even an established firm like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will see its stock fall if it misses estimates. If Twitter had been firing on all cylinders, then Periscope may have added it its momentum, but it will never be the stock's savior in the immediate term. I was too early to get excited about Periscope even though I still believe the app will become as popular among teens as Snapchat is, in a few years. I made the point numerous times that I believed Periscope could be a bigger opportunity than Twitter itself. While bulls like myself may have viewed this transition through rose-colored glasses, investors don't see it this way. A comparison to this would be if Apple tried to cover up declining iPhone sales growth with the release of a car. The car may be successful, but a change in the firm's business model would be viewed as risky. If Facebook had declining DAU/MAU, its stock would be hit, even though Instagram may be able to gain back the lost users. Twitter's Growth Has Not Re-Accelerated The second error I made was the belief in Twitter's revival. I was definitely biased toward believing Twitter would re-invigorate its user growth because of my enthusiasm about Periscope. It would be wrong to say it's impossible to see a turnaround, but investors deal with the likelihood of events occurring. Right now the chances of Twitter ever hitting one billion users is much lower than it was 12 months ago. The stock's performance doesn't help users become optimistic about the app. It's not as if they check it everyday, but hearing the stock hit its all-time lows doesn't help. It's difficult to understand how possible changes would help or hurt a social network because there isn't much historical precedent. I think most Facebook users have noticed that whenever it makes major changes, users tend to complain about them, but continue spending time on the app. In this case Facebook was trying to improve the performance for its users. Whether or not they liked the measures is up for debate because sometimes angry users are louder than the satisfied ones. What is not up for debate is Facebook's motivation to satisfy current users. As I have mentioned in previous articles, Periscope appears to be in a similar situation as Facebook. When Periscope's co-founder and CEO Kayvon Beykpour talks to users, he appears to be on the same page, as them as he is working on features they are asking for. This is not the case for Twitter. Twitter is not trying to satisfy its current users. It is trying to satisfy users who have used the app in the past and then deleted it. This reminds me of how the NHL attempts to grow its viewership by increasing the amount of goals scored through trying gimmicks like shrinking goalie pads or increasing the size of the nets. In doing so the NHL has not reached the size of the NFL and marginalized diehard fans. Any growth it has seen is because of the excitement of the game, not silly gimmicks. Twitter should focus more on power users instead of those who already deleted the app. If Twitter was able to grow the amount of time current users spent on the app even while total users stagnated, the stock would have life. Changes such as Moments, 10,000 character tweets, and a timeline based on an algorithm instead of the current reverse-chronological timeline have been met with complaints from users. Twitter doesn't care about its current users and is instead focused on future users. Social apps grow based on satisfying their current users. Maybe Jack Dorsey should apologize to users like he did to app developers and as a reward to users, allow for the ability to edit tweets like thousands of users have been begging for, for months. Let's quickly go over these three changes. Moments hasn't moved the needle as much as I thought it would. The reason why I was wrong is because I was biased. Going into the product launch, I figured Periscope streams would be included in Moments at the onset. When they weren't included, I should have changed my opinion. Because I was already bullish on the initiative, I was less likely to change my mind. Without Periscope, Moments isn't a differentiated experience. If there weren't enough Periscopes to fill Moments with content, Twitter could have pushed for quicker growth. Instead of paying people to sift through the 'best of Twitter' it could have paid a few reporters to scope major events such as the Golden Globes. Surely it would cost much less money to hire temporary reporters than it costs to have employees find the most popular tweets. By the way, since these tweets are already popular, what is the point of highlighting them? They are already highlighted by the inherent definition of what popularity is. Periscopes should be the main content in Moments. Before I go over the other two proposed changes, let me mention the new initiative to have Periscopes auto-play in the timeline. This is a great move that should boost viewers on Periscope and provide unique content to Twitter. The only unique videos to Twitter previously were Vines, which have a six-second lifespan. This implies limited potential retention. Twitter needs to do more to support Periscope. Periscope should be highlighted in trending topics and Moments. Currently the only way for a replay scope to go viral is to have Periscope highlight it as featured content. The reason Vine became so popular is the ability for videos to go viral. The higher the potential for virility, the more effort users will put into their scopes. 10,000 Character Tweets Still Have Potential Even though there has been much blowback about the 10,000 character tweets and I just mentioned that Twitter should focus on its current users, I still think it should go through with the initiative. 10,000 character tweets could create more original content on the app. It could make Twitter the YouTube of articles as users generate content and get paid through ad impressions. This concept is somewhere between Facebook articles and Facebook Instant Articles. What I mean by Facebook articles is the ability to post an article instead of a status update. There isn't much of a point to this since statuses can be any length. Facebook Instant articles bring publisher's content behind Facebook's gate and load quicker. Since the product hasn't been announced yet we aren't sure if this will be like Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News or more focused on user-generated content. Both would keep users behind Twitter's gate instead of pushing them to other websites. The complaint that Twitter would change from its core message doesn't hold water because these tweets would only link to the longer pieces. Some are arguing that we already have Medium for longer posts. This is like saying Facebook shouldn't have allowed native video because we already have YouTube. As you can see from the chart below , Twitter becoming like Medium wouldn't be a bad idea because of the growth the website has seen. If Twitter accepted long-form articles, it would wipe out other blog sites because it has superior traffic and most journalists and amateur writers already have Twitter accounts. With regards to the algorithm, I think the firm should hold off on this change until it sees how successful 10,000-word tweets are. This is a change from my previous opinion, but I have to change my stance because it seems changing the platform entirely is enraging existing users more than it is bringing on new users. Although I have been wrong on the stock, I still have to make a decision on what to do with it. My macro opinion tells me to avoid all high-beta tech stocks. There are only a few stocks to like in this market, namely utilities and other defensive stocks such as Reynolds American (NYSE: RAI ), General Mills (NYSE: GIS ), and Colgate (NYSE: CL ). I will re-evaluate my analysis after the recession. I will still do articles on Twitter and Facebook from a neutral perspective, but I won't consider buying either until the macro environment improves. I will leave you with a chart from Hedgeye which shows SPX margins and corporate profits as a percentage of GDP. As you can see, a peak in this metric signaled the past two recessions. It has now peaked which would signal another recession if this metric maintains its accuracy. All of the metrics I mentioned in my article calling for a recession are worse than they were a few weeks ago. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
