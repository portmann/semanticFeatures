Facebook's Next Multibillion-Dollar Opportunity Begins To Take Form - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha EMarketer recently provided guidance for the video advertising market. To no surprise, mobile video ad spending is expected to surge. EMarketer recently provided its outlook for digital video advertising, and to no surprise, mobile is expected to be the big winner. While there are countless companies that will try and hit home runs in this fast-growing arena, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) certainly looks to be a big winner. This year, digital video ad spending will reach $7.77 billion. The market will grow 33.8%, but video ad spending on mobile devices will grow much faster at 70.4% as it accounts for $2.62 billion of the market. Over the next four years, mobile video ad spending will continue to outpace desktop spending. By 2020, digital video ad spending would have surged to more than $14.3 billion and mobile will account for almost half. In other words, mobile video ad spending is a future $7 billion market that's up for grabs, a market that's expected to maintain a double-digit growth rate well beyond 2020. While Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube has a good opportunity to steal a large share, Facebook looks particularly well positioned. With 1.25 billion monthly active mobile users, Facebook's core app is by far the largest on mobile. According to comScore , the Facebook app accounts for nearly one-quarter of all smartphone activity. This use alone is appealing to advertisers who want to get their product to consumers. Facebook's presence on mobile devices - this doesn't include other popular apps like Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp - is a large reason the company has managed to succeed in mobile at a faster rate than any other company. It seems almost like ancient history that Facebook was once unable to figure out mobile, but today mobile accounts for 73% of its total ad sales, up from 69% at the end of last year. This further supports the notion that advertisers are flocking to Facebook mobile and that it has a good chance to grab a large chunk of spending on mobile video ads. When you incorporate the speed of video growth, Facebook looks like the most obvious winner of this fast-growing market. During Facebook's last quarter it noted that four billion videos per day were watched on its platform. That's up from three billion in the fourth quarter and just one billion in the third quarter. Importantly, mobile accounts for 75% of views, or three billion per day. This implies that Facebook's mobile video ads will be highly sought after and that the company has found a delivery of video method that users gravitate too. Given Facebook's ability to monetize mobile, the expected growth rate of mobile video ads, and the rapid adoption of mobile video on Facebook, investors can conclude that Facebook will control a large share of this near $7 billion market opportunity. For investors, this is great news. FBR recently estimated that video ad prices can be 10-20x higher than display prices. That means higher margins for Facebook, and it also diminishes the need to show a higher volume of display ads to drive revenue growth. In other words, Facebook gets more bang for the buck with video ads. That said, I don't see a mathematical limit to how large Facebook can grow its video ad business. Currently, it is hard to tell what's an ad and what's not on Facebook. The company has done a great job with autoplay and delivering ads to the targeted user. For example, if a user likes Nordstrom, you might see a video ad delivered on your news feed that actually interests you, something you might have watched anyways without knowing it's an ad because Nordstrom is an interest. This fact should keep demand and pricing for Facebook's video ads quite high. The exact pricing for video ads on Facebook is unknown, but the rumored amounts range from $1 million to $3 million per day for advertisers to have a 24-hour slot for its ad to be shown. If Facebook sells just one ad per day at $1 million, that equals $365 million. However, if it sells three per day at $3 million, that's nearly $3.3 billion annually. If video viewing and advertising demand continue to rise, there's no reason Facebook couldn't sell 10 slots a day, maybe at $5 million per. Then, video advertising becomes a near $20 billion a year business. The reality is that its success all really depends on demand. However, given the numbers and expectations discussed herein, I tend to believe that demand and pricing will be very high long-term. The final outcome is a clear path to where Facebook owns much of this fast-growing industry or could single-handedly exceed even with the most bullish of expectations.
