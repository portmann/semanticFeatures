Facebook defends extremist content standards - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Jul  4 2016, 03:14 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) approach to extremist content is once again in the spotlight following accusations by Israel's Public Minister for Security Gilad Erdan. "Facebook today, which brought an amazing, positive revolution to the world, sadly, we see this since the rise of ISIS and the wave of terror, it has simply become a monster," he declared. The company "sabotages" Israeli police efforts by not cooperating with inquiries... and "sets a very high bar for removing inciteful content and posts." Facebook did not respond directly to Erdan's criticism, but said in a statement that it conferred closely with Israel and there was "no room for content that promotes violence, direct threats, terrorist or hate speeches" on its platform.
