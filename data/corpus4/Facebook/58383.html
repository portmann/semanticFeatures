Why Facebook Is Poised To Win In The Rapidly Shifting Ad Landscape - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The three leading players have been hammered in the social media selloff. Facebookâ€™s hammering, however, has been tame by industry standards due to its impressive results. Many social media and ad companies have been impinged by the transition to programmatic advertising hence their poor outlook for the year. Facebook, however, is relatively immune to this shift due to its superior number of users and huge cache of social data that acts as a magnet to marketers. This is perhaps the first time that the investing world is being treated to a drama of the three leading media companies, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), all getting hammered after reporting their quarterly results. Normally it's one or maybe two of the three that earns investors' wrath after failing to live up to expectations. Facebook actually was the least hurt by the social media selloff since the company managed to deliver good first quarter fiscal 2015 results with the only major gripe by investors being the company's ballooning operational costs. Facebook's R&D spending during the quarter jumped to $566 million from $181 million during the prior year period. Facebook's overall costs grew 83%, almost double its top line growth of 42%. As for Twitter and LinkedIn, the story was a lot more dire. Twitter missed both top and bottom line expectations then went ahead and issued weak guidance. LinkedIn on the other hand, beat expectations but issued weak guidance that came in below expectations, the first time it did this since its IPO. Investors in particular had set the bar high for LinkedIn and were spooked by the weak growth expectations by the company. It's important to note that LinkedIn blamed the problem on weakness in its display advertising being brought about by a major shift in the display ad industry. LinkedIn was not the only company to blame disruptions in the display ad industry on its disappointing outlook. At least two more companies offered similar tales during their latest earnings calls: Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Both companies clearly blamed the shift to programmatic advertising on their poor display ad revenues. So what exactly is programmatic advertising and why is it causing such mayhem? In a recent article that I published on Seeking Alpha, I talked about how programmatic advertising had affected LinkedIn. I gave the example of a web user visiting a sneaker website to view some sneakers only to find that the same website later continues bombarding him with more sneaker ads across other Internet sites. This is basically the long and short of it. Programmatic advertising has been growing in leaps and bounds. Programmatic ads were at first mainly used to sell excessive ad inventory. Quite naturally, the CPM rates for these types of ads was lower than that of traditional display ads. But programmatic ads have now literally taken over traditional display ads. eMarketer has provided estimates that these types of ads will account for 55% of all display ad spending, which translates to $14.8 billion, in 2015. The figure will continue expanding to reach $20.4 billion next year, or 63% of display ad spending. Marketers love programmatic ads because they are not only cheaper than traditional ads, but deliver a better ROI. For publishers such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others, the lower CPM rates for these ads obviously means lower revenue. And, since these ads are automated, they require less input from publishers. This also means that publishers cannot justifiably increase their rates to match those of traditional display ads, hence they are almost guaranteed to remain cheaper. This is why publishers have been so hard hit by the transition to programmatic advertising. Keen investors will, however, notice that Facebook did not say anything about these ads that are threatening to topple the gravy trains of so many publishers. That seems a bit odd when you consider that Facebook is heavily reliant on ad revenue than a company like LinkedIn. About 85% of Facebook's top line is driven by ad revenue compared to just 20% for LinkedIn. There is a good reason why Facebook is not crying foul about the rapid shift to programmatic ads. When you look at Facebook's ad numbers for the recent quarter, you will notice that the company was able to realize a healthy 46% growth in ad revenue despite ad views dropping 62%. The reason why Facebook was more than able to offset the large decline in ad views was due to a large 285% increase in the price per ad. In other words, Facebook simply enjoys a lot of pricing power, and can still grow its ad revenue even when it continues to jack up its ad pricing rates. The huge growth in the company's price per ad is probably partly due to the huge surge in video ads since they typically carry better CPM rates, and partly be due to the company's ability to leverage its natural advantages when negotiating ad prices with marketers. When it comes to programmatic advertising, Facebook is much more immune to feeling the heat from the ongoing transition because of the huge number of users on its platform, and its massive cache of social data. Marketers would naturally prefer to do business with Facebook than its peers with much less reach because they get a better ROI on their ad spend. A company like LinkedIn also happens to have a lot of valuable user data on its platform, but it has a far smaller number of users making it less attractive to marketers. A company like Yahoo has a huge number of users, perhaps comparable to Facebook's, but it knows next to nothing about its users placing it at a big disadvantage. Facebook has recognized that programmatic ads are here to stay. The company announced, just a few days ago, that it will partner with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) to use IBM's deep expertise in analytics to help it target users better with its programmatic ads. IBM is a market leader in business analytics and its analytics capabilities are reputed to be best-in-class. With IBM's analytics, Facebook's programmatic ads will become even more streamlined and offer even better ROI for marketers who use the platform. Of course FB is doing this to increase the value proposition of the platform to marketers, especially now that competition in programmatic advertising is so intense. Twitter announced a similar partnership with IBM about two months ago, though Twitter's partnership is different from FB's because it is aimed at helping enterprises and developers to mine valuable insights from its data. The rapid shift to programmatic advertising has taken the display ad industry by storm, and has already claimed some casualties. Facebook's huge cache of social data, as well as its large number of users on its platform, however, give it a huge leg up its competitors and has been helping it weather the storm much better than its contemporaries.
