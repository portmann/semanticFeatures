Ask the Readers: Have You Started Saving for Retirement? We need money for a lot of things, like day-to-day expenses, paying bills or debt, or even saving up an emergency fund. It's easy to put off saving for your retirement when it seems to be a long way off. But it's important to take advantage of the years to have to save...and the interest you'll accrue from a retirement savings account. And if you're almost at retirement age, it's imperative that you begin preparing for your non-earning years. Have you started saving for retirement? What kinds of accounts (or other methods) do you use? Are you happy with the amount that you're saving so far?
