But it turns out, you don’t even need a fake mustache and a fedora to go undetected if you have the right shirt on. Police in New York say a gutsy thief waltzed into a Soho Apple Store in a blue shirt, “dressed similarly” to Genius Bar employees on June 1, reports DNA Info . He apparently knew where he was going, as police said he walked straight back to an electronics repair room, where he grabbed 19 iPhones, totaling $16,130, from a drawer, and handed them to an accomplice. His fellow thief hid the phones under his shirt, and the twosome walked out. Police are still investigating, and Apple has yet to issue a comment on the incident.
