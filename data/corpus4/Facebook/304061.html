Biotech Bloodbath As Investors Seek Safety Of Facebook 83x P/E | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! We have made a contrarian call for a falling silver price and a rising gold to silver ratio for years. This ratio has risen a lot during this time. Are we ready to change our call yet? Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Biotechs are getting crushed, extending losses of the last few days as it appears the earnings beat for Facebook has sparked a great rotation from everything into the social network. Yes we know Fwd P/E is "just" 35x... This has dragged FB back into the green for the year but TSLA and NFLX are getting hammered...

The targeting tools.  That is why.  Have a great day bitchez.  NOTE: Over the Holidays we spent around $3000.00 on FB.  The results were 5 to 8X greater with FB, then any other media that we used spending the same amounts.

Assessing how monetizable these things are beyond the short term is another matter.  Not to mention creating some enduring, defensible, unique competitive advantage to keep people from fleeing FB to a competitor the same way they fled Myspace.

The only difference is that they're wasting fewer physical resources accomplishing the same series of tasks, thanks to the internet. If a cubicle dweller spends his day updating FB (instead of playing solitaire like in the old days), that's not really a problem. Somebody has figured out how to make money and gradually bleed these non-productive parasites dry and good riddance. Send them ads and virtual macguffins - anything they'd pay for. Let'em take selfies and brag to eachother. Let'em try keeping up with the Joneses' avatars. None of them will be missed and if a long-nose Jew swindles them out of their fortunes... well, that's their own undoing. Ignorance is a choice in the age of the internet. Some think it's a wonderful tool. Some waste money and time. Others are able to get more done with less and use the information to improve their physical surroundings. The rest? Let'em do whatever they hell they want. It's their lives.

Jew Zuckerberg looted the FB Treasury for $19 billion to give to neighbor Jew, and the shareholders have nothing to show for it. Nineteen BILLION dollars. The Crime of the Decade. But the fawning Jewmedia remains silent. Here is what Facebook had to say on... ....User metrics:"The methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors" ....Processes: "We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics" ....Daily active users: "Some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs" ....how much they know about their users: "While user-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete". ....their key metrics: While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. ....duplicate accounts: There may be individuals who maintain one or more Facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service. We estimate, for example, that "duplicate" accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account) may have represented less than 5% of our worldwide MAUs in 2015. ...."false" accounts: We estimate user-misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than 2% of our worldwide MAUs. ....the reliability of their estimations: Our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts. "We are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology" At least "investors" can't say they haven't been warned when this thing crashes to ZERO. Provided that they read the fine print...

Anyway - who cares; it is anti-social and used for data mining; there is good, but the bad outweighs the good imo.

All i did was simple online work from comfort at home for 3-4 hours/day that I got from this agency I discovered over the internet and they paid me for it 95 bucks every hour...  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 12:59 | 7109277 besnook omg! you can't make this shit up. fuckerberg says they can't do anything about isis posts on fuckbook so everyone should like their posts. wwwwaaaaaa? Thu, 01/28/2016 - 13:13 | 7109364 besnook while there are certainly many unicorn stocks in the biotech sector, biotechs are the only sector that is virtually recession proof with a lot of real companies making real money. ironically a market downturn may be be good for them as a crash would certainly make a lot of people sick.
