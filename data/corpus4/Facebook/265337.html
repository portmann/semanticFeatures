The feature was first spotted by a tech blog. Facebook has not made a public announcement of the feature. The webpage for the new feature, which reads "Find local businesses with the best Facebook reviews and ratings", can be accessed through the URL, www.facebook.com/services. Facebook, which allows businesses to create pages on its site, has a section on such pages that enables users to post and read reviews.
