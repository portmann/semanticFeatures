Even though Apple hasn’t made a 4? iPhone since releasing the 5S in 2013, the company said today that it managed to sell more than 30 million of these smaller-screen devices in 2015 — many of them to first-time customers and in emerging markets like China. Dubbed “the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,” the SE features the same A9 chip and motion co-processor as the 6S, meaning it has the same processing performance and graphics as the bigger device. It also features a 12MP iSight camera. The big selling point: The $399 price; that’s the least that Apple has ever charged for a newly released iPhone. If you have a wireless provider that still offers two-year contracts, the SE would be free of charge with a re-upped contract. For people paying on two-year installment plans, expect to pay $17/month. Pre-orders for the SE start March 24, with the actual device being available March 31 On those same dates, Apple will be selling a new, smaller iPad Pro with a 9.7? screen — about three inches smaller than the first generation Pro. With that trim in size comes a cut in price. The larger Pro started at $799, but the new, smaller version starts at $599. In addition to the change in screen size and price, Apple says the new Pro features several upgrades to the original — including a 12MP camera that lets you shoot and edit 4K video on the device; a “True Tone” display that senses ambient light and adjusts accordingly, and better speakers. Both versions of the Pro will also be available with 256GB of storage for an upcharge.
