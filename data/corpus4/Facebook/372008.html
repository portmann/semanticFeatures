Bookmark Post Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comments distorted selfies mergers and acquisitions murders and executions facebook snapchat masquerade filters Lenses Your friendsâ€™ posts on Facebook are about to get a bit more cartoon-like now that the social media company has acquired selfie-altering startup Masquerade Technologies.Â  The Snapchat-like filter company announced the deal on its website Wednesday, noting that while it will integrate its technology with Facebook, its current app will continue running as is. Financial aspects of the deal werenâ€™t immediately available. It was also unclear if Facebook would charge members for using the filters, a practice employed by Snapchat when it comes to its photo changing lenses.Â  Much like Snapchat, Masquerade allows users to place filters on their selfies and videos so that the image is distorted or made to look like someone else, such as celebrities, the President, or zombies. The Los Angeles Times reports that Facebookâ€™s purchase of Masquerade comes after the company offered to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013. After that failed venture, the company worked on several disappearing message projects , including Poke and Slingshot.
