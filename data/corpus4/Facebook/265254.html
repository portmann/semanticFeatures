ETF Hub Dec 15 2015, 12:42 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Under the URL facebook.com/services , Facebook ( FB +0.9%) has created a searchable directory (still in test mode) of local service providers such as electricians, auto repair shops, veterinarians, and spas. Browsing through category listings provides phone numbers, addresses, links to service provider Facebook pages, and average Facebook review ratings. In addition to standard local service providers, searches on the site turn up listings for local businesses such as restaurants, bars, and hotels. TechCrunch observes the site's search rankings suggest Facebook could be leveraging user data (e.g. which business pages a user has previously visited or reviewed) to optimize results. As is the norm for new product launches, Facebook isn't monetizing the service for now. Local business search and directory ads would be a natural fit. Facebook recently said it has 50M+ active business pages that collectively receive 2.5B monthly comments. Earlier this year, the company took steps to turn Messenger into a business-to-consumer communication tool. Local business reviews leader Yelp ( YELP -4.1%) has sold off in response to Facebook's move - this isn't the first time Yelp (still dominant in its core market) has reacted this way to a Facebook product launch. Paid local services marketplace/reviews site Angie's List ( ANGI +1.3%) remains up moderately on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.4%. Can't wait to see Yelp get punished for this.  FB tries to help businesses which helps them make money in return, Yelp just found a way to legally steal a businesses name, use it to make money off them and allow anonymous people to slander them....then they defend the anonymous slanderous reviewers calling it free speech instead of defending their real "paying" customer, the business. One company tries to solve a problem by helping the business become stronger.  The other company tries to solve a problem by harming the business and stealing what they can, for as long as it will work.
