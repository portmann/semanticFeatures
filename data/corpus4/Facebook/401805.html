Bloomberg reports that Amazon, which recently promised to expand same-day delivery coverage to areas of the New York City and Boston markets that had been ignored, has told the Congressional Black Caucus that it will expand Prime Same-Day to “every ZIP code of the 27 cities” where the service is currently available. Amazon also says it won’t offer same-day service in any new markets unless it knows it will be able to deliver in every ZIP code of that market. “We are still figuring out the details and procuring last mile delivery for each of these ZIPs,” says Amazon, “but we should have 100 percent coverage shortly.” The issues with Amazon’s service came to light after a Bloomberg investigation found that non-white areas of six cities — Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington, D.C. — were not able to take advantage of the same-day delivery benefits seen in areas with more white residents. The company has maintained that race was not a factor in deciding which areas to offer the same-day delivery option.
