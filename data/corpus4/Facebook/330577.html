Apple Responds To The Government: "No Court Has Ever Authorized What The Government Seeks" | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! With the last crash being the almost-terminal Crash of â€™08, readers have been warned on many occasions that the Next Crash is scheduled for this year.  Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Moments ago, as part of the ongoing feud between the FBI and Apple over the question of whether or not the US government should be allowed to have a backdoor hack into every iPhone, the Cupertino company filed a 65 page brief in the matter of the "search of the seized iPhone". As can be seen in the full filing presented below, Apple argues that the government's request is "unprecedented" and violates the company's First Amendment rights. "This case is not a case about one isolated iPhone," Apple said in the filing, reiterating previous comments. This is not a case about one isolated iPhone. Rather, this case is about the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power that Congress and the American people have withheld: the ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. The government demands that Apple create a back door to defeat the encryption on the iPhone, making its usersâ€™ most confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, hostile foreign agents, and unwarranted government surveillance. The All Writs Act, first enacted in 1789 and on which the government bases its entire case, â€œdoes not give the district court a roving commissionâ€? to conscript and commandeer Apple in this manner. Plum Creek Lumber Co. v. Hutton, 608 F.2d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir. 1979). In fact, no court has ever authorized what the government now seeks, no law supports such unlimited and sweeping use of the judicial process, and the Constitution forbids it. That's all great, but how is any of this different from the access the NSA already has to all digital communication technology? Apple continues: There are two important and legitimate interests in this case: the needs of law enforcement and the privacy and personal safety interests of the public. In furtherance of its law enforcement interests, the government had the opportunity to seek amendments to existing law, to ask Congress to adopt the position it urges here. But rather than pursue new legislation, the government backed away from Congress and turned to the courts, a forum ill-suited to address the myriad competing interests, potential ramifications, and unintended consequences presented by the governmentâ€™s unprecedented demand. And more importantly, by invoking â€œterrorismâ€? and moving ex parte behind closed courtroom doors, the government sought to cut off debate and circumvent thoughtful analysis. The order demanded by the government compels Apple to create a new operating systemâ€”effectively a â€œback doorâ€? to the iPhoneâ€”that Apple believes is too dangerous to build. Specifically, the government would force Apple to create new software with functions to remove security features and add a new capability to the operating system to attack iPhone encryption, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock the iPhone by â€œbrute force,â€? trying thousands or millions of passcode combinations with the speed of a modern computer. In short, the government wants to compel Apple to create a crippled and insecure product. Once the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool. And why Apple just says no, for now. The government says: â€œJust this onceâ€? and â€œJust this phone.â€? But the government knows those statements are not true; indeed the government has filed multiple other applications for similar orders, some of which are pending in other courts. And as news of this Courtâ€™s order broke last week, state and local officials publicly declared their intent to use the proposed operating system to open hundreds of other seized devicesâ€”in cases having nothing to do with terrorism.3 If this order is permitted to stand, it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor, in some other important case, before some other judge, seeks a similar order using this case as precedent. Once the floodgates open, they cannot be closed, and the device security that Apple has worked so tirelessly to achieve will be unwound without so much as a congressional vote. As Tim Cook, Appleâ€™s CEO, recently noted: â€œOnce created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locksâ€”from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.â€? Whatever the ultimate outcome, expect much more drama in this tragicomic case study of a marketing campaign, one which seeks to portray AAPL as a defender of personal privacy right. How do we know this is one big farce? Because moments ago both Google and FaceBook, the biggest abusers of private information, filed motions supporting Apple.

Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:14 | 7236214 Anopheles Why do you think Apple keeps almost all of their $200 billion in cash, overseas, outside of the country?  The government can't touch that cash.    The way Apple has it structured, they also have difficulty in bringing that cash back into the US, without giving most of it to the government as tax.    Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:26 | 7236296 Beam Me Up Scotty Why do they need a backdoor into the iphone?  Isn't this about simply unlocking his phone (bypassing the security thumbprint)??  I thought the courts already had the ability to subpeona information like this.  Or is this truly much more Orwellian??   Yup, its like we all know---its MUCH MORE Orwellian!! Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:13 | 7236134 CPL They gave up their rights as a single corporate entity as soon as the laws passed.  All their base are belong to the government.  No one gives a fuck what they say.  If they really had an opinion, they should have fought BEFORE the laws passed worldwide.  Here are their legal options at the moment. Nothing.  Zero.  Nada.  Zlich.  They signed away their rights.  Not some of them either.  They gave away all of them if they go review all four pieces of legislation.  They literally gave away all of their IP to the government.  Again, if they wanted something 'different' they shouldn't have followed the herd or sold their own customers down the river.

Uhm, I think we already HAD that:  It was called a Blackberry (from Canada). Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:38 | 7236402 TradingIsLifeBrah Apple is exposing this government for its lies.  I expect Apple to feel the government's wrath for this one.  Shareholders should be worried, citizens should be cheering and supporting Apple on this battle Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:02 | 7236101 Dr. Engali Apple didn't realize they had that much in common with Trump. They are both getting free publicity peddling fiction, and they're both a great distraction. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:35 | 7236381 BuddyEffed Free publicity?  Hell no.  More probable that those corporations with weak security and back doors and trap doors might be trying to weaken apples strong position and good reputation. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:37 | 7236400 Dr. Engali For God's sake man, you don't really belive this is legit do you? Apple sold it's soul to the government long ago.  Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:58 | 7236420 BuddyEffed I suspect some corporations took 30 pieces of silver or 30,000,000 of gov cash in the past to provide back doors, but not apple. At first back doors were hidden code exploits if you knew where to look and those were highly kept secrets.  And then multiple encryption keys were likely added (when encrypting got popular) where any of the keys could be used to decrypt. As the OS got bigger and with any new version, more exploits could be hidden and you could get rid of old exploits just in case they had been compromised. I've been in the belly of the beast and I do have a very educated opinion.  Crypto is on my resume along with Secret.

Hamfisted statists that have an appetite for power. No wonder this case came to the forefront.

But why waste an opportunity on Apple - the biggest tax evader in the world - Congress is going to fuck Tim Cook up the ass - and not the way he likes it. Big gummamint has time and endless cash and if you fuck around with their tax system, they will fuck you back 100X harder as Tim Cook is about to find out. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:36 | 7236387 dexter_morgan Unfortunately, likely to soon be moot. Once we have the 5 lefty 4 righty court, this will wind up there and who wants to bet THAT court will take Apples's side. Regardless of who appoints out of current crop of potential nominators, none is likely to find a strict constitutionalist that would uphold the 4th amendment.    Fourth Amendment  (The Rights of the People)   "The Rights of the people to be SECURE in their persons, houses, papers, and effects   against UNREASONABLE searches and seizures, shall not be violated, no Warrant shall   issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly    describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized." Cruz, Carson and Trump along with all the other republicans are siding with the government. So much for personal liberty. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:41 | 7236418 TradingIsLifeBrah People quote Bill Gates because he says Apple should comply.  Microsoft embedded an "assistant" called Cortana into all of its operating systems (phone and computers) and then created a video game of Halo in which Cortana was the villain and tried to destroy all of humanity.  What are they trying to tell us? Thu, 02/25/2016 - 16:42 | 7236441 Bennie Noakes I wonder whether the FBI is at all worried that some of the tens of millions of Americans who oppose the request might simply refuse to convict if ever serving on a jury in a case involving the FBI.
