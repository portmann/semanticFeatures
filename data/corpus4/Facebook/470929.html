Half The Population Of America And Canada Uses Facebook At Least Once A Day | Zero Hedge by Sprott Money - Jul 27, 2016 11:35 AM The proof is all around you. People are breaking out of the false  realities built for them and they are growing backbones and are asking for  - no, DEMANDING - change. by Steve H. Hanke - Jul 27, 2016 3:18 PM Itâ€™s no surprise that Renzi has his eye on banks. Itâ€™s also easy to see why he is worried and ready to pull the trigger on a state-sponsored bank bailout. While we, like everyone else, were stunned by Facebook's financial results, which showed torrid growth in virtually every metric, from user growth to revenue to earnings to eyeball monetization, one specific number sticks out: according to Mark Zuckerberg, there are now 175 million daily active users in the US and Canada. Considering that there are about 325 million Americans and about 35 million Canadians, this means that every single day half the population of the US and Canada uses Facebook at least once. And just as mindboggling, with 226 million monthly active users in these two countries, it means that nearly two-thirds of every single American and Canadian uses Facebook at least once a month. While we have no reason to doubt the validity of these numbers, we hope economists who still are confused why America's productivity is going down the drain, will finally figure it out.

Also, electicity is cheap around here (wind generated) and companies like Facebook are throwing up billions worth of datacenters (borrowed money); and of course the local politicians are giving away the farm...rezoning, free infrastructure construction (roads/water/sewer/elect/gas) via tax abatement, total ass kissing...all in the hopes the place is still in business 10 years from now...take away all those "freebies" and Facebook was bankrupt long ago. Bastiat FireBrander Jul 27, 2016 5:44 PM Same here.  She likes to keep in touch with family around the country.  I don't touch it.  Hedge is addiction enough. walkÃ¼re WTFRLY Jul 27, 2016 5:34 PM The bell has just been rung at the top of FB's and other social media valuations. FireBrander walkÃ¼re Jul 27, 2016 5:43 PM "terrorists coordinating geographical drop-off points for payments using cellphone applications such as WhatsApp and Kik. Not only can WhatsApp be used around the world but, crucially, it incorporates a GPS mapping tool that makes it easier for terrorists to communicate their exact locations to each other. Kik offers the added benefit of allowing terrorists to register a username without providing a phone number that could identify them. Affiliated ISIS Twitter accounts openly publish their Kik usernames." I use the toilet every day...if only they had a way to get some advertising to you every time you flushed... smacker ejmoosa Jul 27, 2016 5:33 PM Of course, they have to "update their status". They'd use it a lot more except they're too busy using their smartphones to send text messages and play games ,,, The question is - how many people block the ads? Advertsiing with FB must be the worst investment ever. Why dont companiess see this problem? I kinda feel a little lonely. I never once used FB. No account, avatar, nothing. I do text and use the phone to communicate. I just like my privacy. And I forgot, what do they produce in this country? Facebook is a great way to share content with people.  It's just another tool.  Use it wisely, no need to be ignorant of it. I don't have a Facebook account and it hasn't affected my life a bit. Still have a healty life style, still got a job, still can feed my family, still can work from home. The most telling feature about FB is it's 'delete' post functionality.  One at a time, multiple clicks for each deletion.  No mass delete or select multiple. And even if deleted....they are just archived, like gmail. You can't tell me that delete all or multiple 'missing' from the feature set by some of the top programmers around isn't done on purpose. They insist on keeping your life history.

All that data is gov't sugar. 07-27 17:15: ASIA-PAC SERVICE NOW LIVE FOR TODAY'S SESSION 07-27 17:15: ASIAN DAILY ECONOMIC RELEASES CALENDAR NOW AVAILABLE IN THE RESEARCH... 07-27 17:15: Alcoa (AA) announces plan for 1-for-3 share consoldiation 07-27 17:15: Groupon (GRPN) Q2 Non-GAAP Loss/Shr USD 0.01 vs. Exp.
