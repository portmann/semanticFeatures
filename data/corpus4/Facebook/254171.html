Here's Why "Philanthropic" Mark Zuckerberg Will Place Facebook Shares In A For-Profit LLC | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The global Central Banks have literally bet the financial system that their theories will work.  They haven’t. All they’ve done is set the stage for an even worse crisis in which...

Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog, Yesterday, all the media hoopla over Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement to “give away” 99% of his Facebook shares to philanthropic causes, came and went in the expected torrent of internet commentary. However, what you might have missed are the specifics around how he decided to safeguard those shares, and how unusual the for-profit LLC structure is for a charity. The decision by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan,  to gradually give away 99 percent of their Facebook fortune  is big news not just for the huge sum involved—about $46 billion—but for how the couple chose to achieve their philanthropic goal. Rather than set up a private foundation or charitable trust as Bill and Melinda Gates did, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will be structured as a limited liability corporation. It’s a highly unusual step for a massive philanthropy. “I’ve never seen someone set up an LLC exclusively for a philanthropic purpose before,” says Jane Wales, vice president of philanthropy and society at the Aspen Institute. “Normally they set up a foundation for the tax advantages of doing so.” Here are some significant ways that LLC status will shape what Zuckerberg and Chan do with their wealth. It seems clear the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will put money to work in politics. Facebook, in its official description of its founder’s new LLC, noted that “making private investments and participating in policy debates” will be part of the mission. In a public letter Zuckerberg wrote to his newborn daughter, Max, he likewise emphasized an appetite for pushing a policy agenda: “We must participate in policy and advocacy to shape debates.” If the charitable venture had been set up as a traditional tax-exempt foundation—what is called a 501(c)(3)— it wouldn’t have freedom to lobby lawmakers or engage in other political activities.  The Internal Revenue Service prohibits  tax-exempt groups from “directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” There you go. As many expected, it appears this move is less about charity, and more about ensuring that Zuckerberg, the oligarch, is able to frame U.S. government policy in any way that he, and his billions, so desire.

They think the World revolves around themselves, and their money.They are genetically predisposed to myopia, and tunnelvision, with regard to their collusive ethnic oligopoly. The Italians operate the same way. That chosen myth has been the root of many problems, but who doesnt like to feel special? Maybe one day asians will be over-represented by 4/6times in the Ivies too... Thiugh it would mean taking spots from wealthier people and knock the jewish over representation down to about 3/4.

He's an atheist and seems to like amnesty for illegals.

His tribe are into that kinda thing! Wed, 12/02/2015 - 22:00 | 6869084 Niall Of The Ni... Zuckerberg may be trying to get around the rule that says non-profits have to give away five per cent of their net worth a year. Such a rule no longer makes sense in a low or negative interest rate environment. If he's just trying to buy influence with the Abedin White House (good luck with that, Mark---Huma will nationalize FB anyway as a downpayment on your share of the jiyza tax), why not do it directly in his own or in Facebook's name? Thu, 12/03/2015 - 01:45 | 6869560 Raymond_K._Hessel Chicago  Jews put Obama in office, his first chief of staff was a mossad saysnim and hes appointed a disproportionate number of jews but not muslims to high office. Your hate of Muslims as a Jew offended by muslims daring to resist Ashkenazi conquest of their homeland apparently blinds you to basic rational thinking. Your outright Jewish Supremacism is well attested. As is your peculiar brand of inane quips. Obama is not a muslim and if he were hes a puppet.  Its a funny kind of muslim that is propelled into office by a zionist network in chicago - appointing jewish advisors, to head the fed, treasury, national evonomic counsel, and spending an absurd amount of time dealing with that shitty little country you love above all else. https://electronicintifada.net/content/how-barack-obama-learned-love-isr... http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/american-recognize-duped Wed, 12/02/2015 - 22:07 | 6869103 Otrader Recap - Everyone wants a revolution but the future revolutionaries are too busy with the NWO distraction tools like facebook, twitter, etc.  The avg family owes the founders of Facebook (the billionaires) their cars, homes, education, flat screen TV's...basically everything they own.  And, they go to work so they can feed the money machine every fu**in day of their life.  And, they don't even know it's happening.
