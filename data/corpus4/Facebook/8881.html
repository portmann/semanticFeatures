LinkedIn: Rebuttal To Bullish Case - LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) | Seeking Alpha There are some major stumbling blocks which need to be addressed. This article was inspired by WestEnd511's recent bullish articles on LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) found here and here . Many arguments are valid but investors must look at quantitative figures to support a qualitative thesis. WestEnd's articles are missing this key component and since these are the two most recent articles on the company (at time of writing) I felt the need to do this as well as add a few points. Overall, LinkedIn has seen good growth in all aspects of its business in the last couple of quarters. Its three main divisions - talent solutions, marketing solutions and premium subscriptions - each increased at a very healthy pace of over 40%. More importantly membership growth continued to grow at a healthy 25% reaching 347 million users. Besides a mere count of users added, page views increased by 34% in this quarter showing higher growth than users added which means there's higher user engagement. These data points imply a strong business model and the ability to sustain growth going forward. However there are some major stumbling blocks which need to be addressed. There has been much talk about the fact that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is working feverishly on its productivity suite to help companies and employees connect and benefit from its platform. Facebook is the Goliath of social networks and one needs to be wary about any new area which it focuses on. Currently a handful of companies are trying the "Facebook at Work" platform for sharing internal data and communication between employees. This strategy is akin to how Facebook started itself by first going to a handful of elite colleges and slowly rolling out the services to a wider audience. I'm still unsure how this will ultimately play out and impact LinkedIn's business but it remains a material risk. A large enough risk where it should be accounted for in the company's share price, but it seems investors are more concerned about next quarters earnings as opposed to earnings over the next few years. This has driven the company's value to unreasonable levels which is obvious when you compare LinkedIn side by side with peers such as Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and Facebook. The interactive chart compares the three companies and you can see that LinkedIn's growth trends, margins and valuation multiples are significantly less attractive compared to its peers. LinkedIn's non-GAAP EPS rose to $0.61 in Q4 of 2014 from $0.39 in Q4 of 2013. This is a 56% growth in earnings. However at the same time expenses increased dramatically registering a 50% increase. As the firm makes increasing efforts to ward off competition over the next few years, these expenses on product development, sales and infrastructure are going to eat into earnings. This will lead to lower GAAP earnings going forward. I do not factor the increasing competition and higher expenses in my model below and still only reach a fair market value of only $225 for LinkedIn. This exercise helps illustrate just how much the company is overvalued. The business model created by LinkedIn is currently strong and could withstand major headwinds. But the fierce competition from Facebook and lack of geographical diversity could lead to higher expenses and a battle of attrition in its core area. Furthermore, applying a simple fundamental valuation approach illustrates that shares are trading at unreasonable levels. As opposed to WestEnd's views, I expect the stock to fall back to a more sensible valuation in 2015.
