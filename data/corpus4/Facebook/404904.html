Senate committee presses Facebook over news selection - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha May 11 2016, 03:47 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor A U.S. Senate committee has launched an inquiry into how Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) selects its news stories following a report that company employees blocked news about conservative issues. "Facebook must answer these serious allegations and hold those responsible to account if there has been political bias in the dissemination of trending news," Chairman John Thune declared. Tom Stocky, whose team is responsible for Facebook's Trending Topics, said the company has "found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true." I have quite a big problem with this. Yes, they are a private company but as a company that has gained the trust of over 1 billion users I believe this is very unethical behavior. Secondly, while many criticize the Chinese government and others for blocking sites like Facebook, this is one reason that they do so, to avoid companies like Facebook using their influence to cause social unrest or push their own agenda in China or elsewhere. This behavior is also disruptive for shareholders. Anything that causes a lack of confidence in Facebook could lead to users closing their accounts, giving out less information to Facebook or spending less time on the site, all things that impact revenues. In addition, as I mentioned above, allegations of this sort of behaviour are likely to give countries like China more reason to keep Facebook banned in the country, something that affects the future prospects of Facebook. It's a private organization. On what grounds does the senate have the legal right to inquire on the "bias" of its newsfeed?
