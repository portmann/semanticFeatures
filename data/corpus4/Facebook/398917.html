The youngster â€” who is too young to actually have an account on Facebook or Instagram, per the networkâ€™s rules â€” uncovered a vulnerability in February that allowed anyone to delete comments on Instagram simply by inputting a malicious code into the photo sharing site. â€œI tested whether the comments section of Instagram can handle harmful code. Turns out it canâ€™t,” the hacker told the local Finnish paper, Iltalehti. “I noticed that I can delete other peopleâ€™s comments from there. I could have deleted anyoneâ€™sâ€”like Justin Bieberâ€™s, for exampleâ€”comments.â€? The boy didnâ€™t delete Bieberâ€™s comments, and instead notified Facebook of the issue. The bug was an issue with Instagramâ€™s application program interface, or API â€” how the app communicates with a server, Melanie Ensign, a security representative at Facebook, tells the Post, noting the flaw was fixed in February. If someone wanted to erase a remark from Instagram, the API checks that they have the authority to delete the comment. â€œThat checking process wasnâ€™t working properly,â€? Ensign said. â€œYouâ€™re only supposed to be able to delete comments that you own.â€? Once Facebook was notified of the issue, the company says it created a test Instagram account and posted a comment. They then instructed the boy to delete it, which he was easily able to do. As for the hefty reward the youngster pocketed, Ensign says Facebook bases bounties on the scope of risk, and that the Finnish boy’sÂ find â€œwould have impacted everybody on Instagram.â€? Ars Technica reports that the boy’s feat makes him the youngest hacker to receive a reward for finding a flaw. The previous record holder was a California 12-year-old who found an issue with Mozilla in 2012.
