ETF Hub Mar 24 2015, 09:57 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Long a huge referral traffic source for the many online media firms that provide excerpts and links for their material on the company's site and apps, Facebook ( FB +1%) is now in talks with at least a half-dozen media firms to fully host their content in exchange for a chance to profit from related ad revenue, the NYT reports . The NYT itself is said to be one of the publishers Facebook is talking to, as are viral content giant BuzzFeed and National Geographic. Tests are expected to begin in "the next several months." Some publishers are reportedly wary of Facebook's overtures out of fear of losing site traffic and control over the user experience. Facebook could pitch publishers on providing a quicker/more seamless content-viewing experience, as well as on countering the rising popularity of video on Facebook - the social networking giant's video views have soared to over 3B/day following the launch of autoplay videos. Facebook hasn't been shy about wanting to act as a media platform for its 1.39B MAUs, though readers still often engage more with viral content than longer-form material. The NYT's report follows a December video clip deal with the NFL for which Facebook is sharing revenue produced by Verizon ads run against the NFL's content.
