IRS Seeks Documents From Facebook Related To Irish Asset Transfers | Zero Hedge by Capitalist Exploits - Jul 7, 2016 10:00 AM Kyle Bass believes China is facing unprecedented problems and that it will crash within the next 2 years. But is he correct in his view? by Sprott Money - Jul 7, 2016 9:14 AM In this post, we turn to Comex  silver, where The Banks are pulling the same tricks but with a very  interesting twist. Facebook Ireland Holdings Unlimited and Facebook are receiving the IRS stink-eye. The social network is under the microscope of agent Nina Wu Stone. Agent Stone has been trying to hunt down documentation related to the valuation and characterization of assets transferred to Ireland by Facebook.  For months Agent Stone has attempted to retrieve the documents and has even hand delivered six summonses to Facebook's CFO David Wehner as the DoJ Petition notes: "In furtherance of the examination for 2010 and in accordance with 26 U.S.C. § 7602, on June 1, 2016, Revenue Agent Stone issued six IRS summonses directing Facebook to appear at 55 South Market Street, 6th floor, San Jose, California, 95113 on June 17, 2016, at 1:00 p.m. and to produce for examination books, records, papers and other data as described in the summonses. Stone Decl. ¶ 6 & Exs. 1-6" "In furtherance of the examination and in accordance with 26 U.S.C. § 7603, on June 1, 2016, Ms. Stone served an attested copy of each of the summonses on Facebook by personal delivery to David Wehner, the Chief Financial Officer for Facebook. Stone Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibits 1-6." Facebook's CFO David Wehner never delivered the documents Agent Stone requested.  Agent Stone is furthering an ongoing audit of Facebook, continuing the 2008 and 2009 examination through 2010. What Agent Stone wants to know is whether Facebook's auditors, Ernst & Young, valued the company's assets (user base, online platform and marketing intangibles) as stand-alone assets while employees view the assets as interdependent. She believes the stand-alone nature has caused a material under-valuation of the assets to the tune of a couple billion US dollars, leaving the potential tax haul lower than Agent Stone believes it should be. In Agent Stone's declaration we read: "The books, records, papers, and other data sought by the summonses may be relevant to determine Facebook's correct federal income tax liability for the period ending December 31, 2010." Comey: Hillaryâ€™s FBI Testimony Wasnâ€™t Under Oath Or Recorded, But It Would Still Be a Crime To Lie What a joke, an IRS collection agent being the one by herself to demand records from a giant coporation like Facebook.  Using that logic, when the IRS's Lois Lerner blocked the filings for tax emempt status by non-profit groups considered the enemies of Obama, Congress should have subpoenaed the filing clerk in Lerner's office who filed away the non-profit request.  Also, no one is yet pointing out the disparate treatment "Predator" director John McTiernan received from the FBI, eventually sent to federal prison for 10 months for allegedly lying to the FBI during an evening phone call he received from an FBI agent.  Which the FBI also did not record.  booboo Zero-Hegemon Jul 7, 2016 2:04 PM It's not been reported in the MSM that since the inception of FaceFart , the number of serial killers has risen 6800% with items such as Gorilla duct tape flying off the shelves. What kind of twat posts online details, thereby , handing every lunatic & the Government personal details? Like, come and get me, i'm over here. "Hey Zuck!  What's up?  This is Barack - hey, I'm gonna have the IRS make some noise about taxes, you know, to make it look like we have that impartiality/equal justice thing.  Anyway, just ignore it and reply with the canned responses enclosed.  I'll make it up to you before I'm outta here - thanks!" I hate Facebook with a passion ..... but I despise IRS agents even more.  Agent Stone can go fuck itself.  I hope it dies in a horrible fire - but not before watching everyone it loves die slowly and horribly first.... but we all know that won't happen because to love someone you have to be human ... and IRS agents aren't humans at all.  Nope, not even close.
