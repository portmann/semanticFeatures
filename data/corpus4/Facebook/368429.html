Facebook: Messenger Platform Must Focus On Advertising - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook unveiled the Messenger Platform and Chatbots. The social media giant plans to leverage the over 900 million users on Messenger to conduct commerce and interact with corporations. The big news from the F8 Developer's Conference for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is the push toward expanding the use of the Messenger app with Chatbots. The move is another plan by the social media giant to enhance and grow consumer dependence on another family app. The goal is another attempt at incorporating commerce into the user interactions of the platform that users have mostly blocked in the past. With a market cap of $325 billion, anything from the Developer Conference needs to be spectacular to move the stock. Will this attempt provide the next catalyst for Facebook? First and foremost, the Messenger app already has more than 900 million users each month. Facebook has routinely promised to start monetizing services as they reach one billion users. In such the manner, the company announced the Messenger Platform via the developers conference. Facebook plans to monetize the Messenger app by introducing chatbots that allow businesses to connect with consumers to complete ordinary tasks and requests. The company gave examples of ordering flowers and other items by sending messages to robotic assistants. In theory, Facebook is set up to collect a cut of the digital transactions though the company didn't highlight the method for collecting revenues from the endeavor. The company provided company examples including CNN and 1-800-Flowers while previous news already included hailing rides from Uber (Private: UBER ) and Lyft (Private: LYFT ). Those expecting consumers to want these interactions with bots from corporations have missed what makes Facebook money. Facebook has made numerous attempts over the years with commerce and payments via the social platform, but consumers repeatedly show limited desire for interactions with connecting their social live to a purchase. In fact, the platform had some of the initial usage surge based on playing games on Facebook. The company got a cut of the virtual goods purchased on the platform to play those games. The platform though saw a peak in the fees obtained from transactions a while back. The below slide highlights how fee revenue basically peaked in Q4'13 with a minor bump higher in Q4'14 before a big decline over 2015. While the fee revenue from transacting on the platform is flat to down, the revenue from advertising continues to soar. During that period of peaking transaction fee revenue, the quarterly advertising revenue is up roughly 150% to $5.6 billion. The numbers are clear that Facebook could make this Messenger Platform a rewarding venture if it increases user engagement and leads to the ability to advertise more space. The platform won't work if it relies heavily on collecting fees from transactions. Consumers haven't shown much interest in conducting commerce over social-media platforms. The privacy concerns linked to Facebook and the social connections on the platform makes users hesitant to connect that world to commerce transactions. Do you really want an interaction with a bank or flower shop one step away from your hundreds or thousands of friends? Not to mention, Facebook needs to explain how one is going to order flowers via this app without providing all of normal information such as payment details and delivery details. Not to mention, ordering pizza or flowers typically takes some exploration on a website to derive the item wanted making visiting the app or website necessary and beneficial anyway. The Messenger Platform and chatbots are marginally interesting in that the move could increase engagement that might provide more advertising options such as premium placements. All historical data suggests this concept won't work if the move is reliant on conducting commerce on the platform. Without adding a commerce element though, the stock is going to have a difficult gaining value from increasing engagement on Messenger without having the move take away time from Facebook.
