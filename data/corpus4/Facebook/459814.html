Ackman Takes Another Blow - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Herbalife's agreement with the FTC doesn't look so good to me. However the stock is up big, as the market continues to punish Mr. Ackman. Pokemon Go - probably not the Facebook killer. Markets are still quiet, so let's not waste too much time with a recap of either Thursday's session or Friday's thus far generally dull trading. Here's what's on my mind ahead of the weekend. Citron Research, a leading short seller and one of my favorites on the bear side, has been hinting at a negative take on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) for awhile. Last month, Citron tweeted that it was to publish a view on Facebook but decided to wait given the tragedy in Orlando. Citron broke that twitter silence with a tweet about the company a couple days ago, suggesting that Facebook could be the big loser from the success of Pokemon Go. And yes, at first glance, that chart seems pretty powerful. In barely a week, Pokemon Go has managed to overtake all the major platforms and surge to the top of the usage leaderboard. However, I don't think this is a huge long-term blow to Facebook's prospects. Social media games never have the sort of sticking power that broader platforms do. Games such as Farmville and Candy Crush lead to significant market caps for their owners for a time, but never anything to rival Facebook. Stated otherwise, Facebook will still be somewhere on that chart next year, where Pokemon is likely to already be out of the top 6. While the game is revolutionary and has opened a new pathway as far as game development goes, it's hard to believe Pokemon Go itself is going to remain extremely popular once the initial wave of curiosity and nostalgia passes. Make no mistake, Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) and its partners have done an absolutely fantastic job bringing a well-loved older bit of intellectual property back into the mainstream. But don't expect this Pokemon craze to last nearly as long as the original one did. To the point that Citron is getting at with Facebook, it's true that change does come quickly, and Facebook is likely to be toppled from its current spot. I don't think Pokemon Go itself is a huge threat, but it's a strong reminder that consumer preferences, particularly among young users, change at a lightning pace. As I noted in my article Facebook Is Turning Into AOL , the company is acting like a private fiefdom that can abuse and ignore its users (see the user-unfriendly and unpopular decision to split messenger from Facebook itself, among others). Younger users have long thought Facebook isn't cool anymore, and engagement overall is dropping as fewer and fewer users post anything personal anymore. By getting everyone onto the site, now fewer people want to post, since there are so many consequences to accidentally putting up something that could create trouble amongst your hundreds of friends or distant family members. For the more intimate and personal stuff, many users are heading to Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) or other more private platforms. While Pokemon Go is unlikely to be the thing that sends Facebook's traffic into terminal decline, it's a good reminder of how quickly internet interest can move from one seemingly big thing to something totally different. If Facebook doesn't focus on restoring the user experience to previous levels, you're going to see some bad trends coming in usage and ad revenues over the next 12-24 months. At this point, you'd have thought we'd wrung just about all the possible drama out of the Herbalife (NYSE: HLF ) story already. But the excitement just keeps coming. Shares have opened about 15% higher Friday morning on news that the FTC has reached a settlement with the company. On first glance, this seems like an odd reaction, the FTC made Herbalife disgorge $200 million of profits and essentially forced them away from the current MLM structure. Going forward, 80% of sales (a huge amount) must go legitimate end users, or distributor payments will be forced to decline. Almost undoubtedly, foreign regulators will use this decision to fine the company and force similar agreements overseas. It's not hard to imagine the company's revenues really taking a hit as people realize that merely attracting more distributors below them no longer is the path to big dollars. The FTC chairwoman stated that: This settlement will require Herbalife to fundamentally restructure its business so that participants are rewarded for what they sell, not how many people they recruit. This hardly reads as bullish for Herbalife. Yes, it's better than being fully shut down, but it seems like a major negative development. So why are shares higher? That answer is simple. Herbalife put a good enough spin on the news in its press release to leave things ambiguous, and given the chance, the market decided to turn it into another "punish Ackman" moment. Pershing Square is obviously hurting. Valeant (NYSE: VRX ) continues to hurtle lower, and insiders and other major investors are bailing out. The street tends to prey on funds it views as weak, figuring that if you cause them more pain, their investors will pull out, forcing the fund to liquidate at bad prices. In short, it's a self-generating squeeze that often causes sinking funds to fail outright. Since Ackman got himself into this public and bitter battle, other big fund managers are happy to kick him while he's down. The FTC settlement announced today, coming after a two-year investigation also concluded that Herbalife is not a pyramid scheme - a conclusion that obviously vindicates our research and conviction. While Bill Ackman and I are on friendly terms, we have agreed to disagree (vehemently) on this subject. Simply stated the shorts have been completely wrong on Herbalife. It's arguable whether the shorts have been "completely wrong". You don't usually get fined $200 million for nothing, nor have your business model forcibly reorganized by the government. But this was less about Herbalife and more a battle of egos between famous fund managers. And on that front, Ackman's losses keep piling up. Always do independent analysis before acting on a famous investor's advice.
