Is It All Just A Publicity Stunt: Apple Unlocked iPhones For The Feds 70 Times Before | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The event that has gripped the tech and libertarian community over the past 48 hours has been Tim Cook's stern refusal to comply with a subpoena demanding that Apple unlock the iPhone 5C belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters for a full FBI inspection. As reported previously , Judge Sheri Pym of U.S. District Court in Los Angeles said on Tuesday that Apple must provide "reasonable technical assistance" to investigators seeking to unlock data on - in other words hack - an iPhone 5C that had been owned by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. So far Tim Cook has refused to comply, saying said his company opposed the demand from the judge to help the FBI break into the iPhone. Cook said that the demand threatened the security of Apple's customers and had "implications far beyond the legal case at hand." He added that "the government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers â€” including tens of millions of American citizens â€” from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals," he said.   "We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack." "The implications of the governmentâ€™s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyoneâ€™s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phoneâ€™s microphone or camera without your knowledge." On the surface, this appears like valiant attempt by the CEO of the world's most valuable company to stand up against the Big Brother state made so famous in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden revelations. However, a quick peek beneath the surface reveals something far less noble and makes Tim Cook seem like you average, if very cunning, smartphone salesman. According to the The Daily Beast's Shane Harris , in a similar case in New York last year, Apple acknowledged that it could extract such data if it wanted to. But the real shocker is that according to prosecutors in that case, Apple has unlocked phones for authorities at least 70 times since 2008. (Apple doesnâ€™t dispute this figure.) As Harris observantly adds, "in other words, Appleâ€™s stance in the San Bernardino case may not be quite the principled defense that Cook claims it is." Here are the details of the NY case: But in a legal brief, Apple acknowledged that the phone in the meth case was running version 7 of the iPhone operating system, which means the company can access it. â€œFor these devices, Apple has the technical ability to extract certain categories of unencrypted data from a passcode locked iOS device,â€? the company said in a court brief. Whether the extraction would be successful depended on whether the phone was â€œin good working order,â€? Apple said, noting that the company hadnâ€™t inspected the phone yet. But as a general matter, yes, Apple could crack the iPhone for the government. And, two technical experts told The Daily Beast, the company could do so with the phone used by deceased San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook, a model 5C. It was running version 9 of the operating system. Still, Apple argued in the New York case, it shouldnâ€™t have to, because â€œforcing Apple to extract dataâ€¦ absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,â€? the company said, putting forth an argument that didnâ€™t explain why it was willing to comply with court orders in other cases. â€œThis reputational harm could have a longer term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,â€? Apple said. In other words, it was all about the brand. Which leads to Harris' damning punchline: Appleâ€™s argument in New York struck one former NSA lawyer as a telling admission: that its business reputation is now an essential factor in deciding whether to hand over customer information. Others agreed: "I think Apple did itself a huge disservice,â€? Susan Hennessey, who was an attorney in the Office of the General Counsel at the NSA, told The Daily Beast. The company acknowledged that it had the technical capacity to unlock the phone, but â€œobjected anyway on reputational grounds,â€? Hennessey said. Its arguments were at odds with each other, especially in light of Appleâ€™s previous compliance with so many court orders. Curiously, it was not until after the revelations of former-NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Apple began to position itself so forcefully as a guardian of privacy protection in the face of a vast government surveillance apparatus, Harris adds. Perhaps Apple was taken aback by the scale of NSA spying that Snowden revealed. Or perhaps it was embarrassed by its own role in it. The company, since 2012, had been providing its customersâ€™ information to the FBI and the NSA via the so-called PRISM program, which operated pursuant to court orders. The NSA made it quite clear that Apple customers are their favorite in a presentation that was disclosed by Snowden: That... and the revelation that on at least 70 previous occasions AAPL had complied with a comparable unlock request. However, with such a high profile case, perhaps a light bulb went off over Tim Cook's head, one which Harris once again explains best: ... it may have as much to do with public relations as it does with warding off what Cook called â€œan unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers." After all, what better way to boost sagging iPhone sales for the company whose stock recently entered a bear market than by being constantly talked about in the media 24/7, a company which has taken on the admirable role of being the noble David taking on the evil Big Brother Goliath. But while AAPL milking the San Bernardino deaths for its own PR campaign is deplorable if perfectly reasonable, what is more disturbing is that for the government to play along, it must be in on the plot. Here why: For now, Apple is resisting the government on multiple grounds, and putting its reputation as a bastion of consumer protection front and center in the fight. None of this has stopped the government from trying to crack the iPhone, a fact that emerged unexpectedly in the New York case. In a brief exchange with attorneys during a hearing in October, Judge James Orenstein said heâ€™d found testimony in another case that the Homeland Security Department â€œis in possession of technology that would allow its forensic technicians to override the pass codes security feature on the subject iPhone and obtain the data contained therein.â€? That revelation, which went unreported in the press at the time, seemed to undercut the governmentâ€™s central argument that it needed Apple to unlock a protected iPhone. There was no further explanation of how Homeland Security developed the tool, and whether it was widely used. A department spokesperson declined to comment â€œon specific law enforcement techniques.â€? But the case had nevertheless demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the government can, and has, managed to get around the very wall that it now claims impedes lawful criminal investigations. Said otherwise, the true trajedy here is not if Apple is engaging in another public relations stunt, but if the government - which is perfectly capable of extracting whatever information it wants from the iPhone - is actively aiding and abeting this cheap attempt to peddle more iPhones to the masses. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:29 | 7204082 nuubee Apple as a company is a PR stunt. Apple doesn't sell technology, they sell fashion. Their entire business model revolves, not around developing new technology, but about convincing everyone in the world that their single "killer" product is a must-have. They're literally the louis-vuitton of the tech sector, and people still pay for their shit. Give me technology that I own and control, not a walled-garden where you piss on me and tell me it's rain. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:33 | 7204108 JLee2027 I thought the Feds wanted Apple to supply the code so they could crack Apple phones themselves, which is why Tim Cook refused.  Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:37 | 7204132 kliguy38 dog and pony show for the masses......of course they don't need Apple's permission ....like China doesn't know that Apple is all part of the CONtrol grid already....hehehehheheheheheheehhehe Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:58 | 7204247 ACP Publicity stunt + not to mention the fact that Tim Cook has no problem with the government forcing teen girls to share locker rooms and bathrooms with deranged perverts (CA transvestitie law). Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:49 | 7204201 undertow1141 1) 70 phones since 2008.  The phones and operating systems have become more secure, much more secure since.  How many of those phones were pre Iphone 5's?  I am betting all of them. What happened to good old detective work?  My understanding is that pre-Iphone 5's were easy, but since they have become amazingly secure with a simple 4 or 6 digit code that only allows 10 false entries before it wipes the phone.  You know it must be good or the FBI would not need their help.  Also, the phone was probably never backed up on a local computer or they would be able to hack it and get the same info. But don't you just love the irony?  A government owned phone, used by a government employee, used in the commission of a terrorist act to kill 14 other government employees.  But they need a public companies help...  go figure.

That should be enough to cover up the failed fiat ponzi scheme and take care of the â€˜excessiveâ€™ population! " Unlocked iPhones For The Feds 70 Times Before " Thu, 02/18/2016 - 17:00 | 7204253 stant Indian phone maker Ringing Bells launched a $4 smartphone on Thursday, with huge customer demand promptly crashing the little-known company's website hours after the phone went on sale. The Freedom 251 was unveiled a day ahead of the launch and is being sold for 251 rupees ($3.66) - a price that skeptics said was far lower than what its components would cost. The smartphone went on sale in the morning but the company later stopped accepting orders after its website crashed. "We humbly submit that we are therefore taking a pause," it said in an apology to customers. Ringing Bells, based in the Delhi satellite city of Noida, was set up only last year and the launch event for the new phone on Wednesday night was attended by a senior leader from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. Company president Ashok Kumar Chadha said the Android smartphone would have pre-installed apps that tie into Modi initiatives such as 'Make in India' and 'Clean India'. "Let us see what can we do to bring about a real liberation of Freedom to all our brothers and sisters," he said in a speech, referring to the name of the new phone to make a play on words.

Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:30 | 7204090 BeaverCream Look. You're missing the point. If Apple had designed a secure system. They would be UNABLE to unlock the device without the permission and authorisation of the owner. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:32 | 7204103 Gregory Poonsores Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:33 | 7204107 E.F. Mutton Had it been Cliven Bundy's phone he would have ran out of the bath house nekkid to get that fucker unlocked ASAP Then there's unlocking the iPhone of an Islamist terrorist for Obama.  Maybe the FBI wants that.  But does Obama? When Obama spoke at Georgetown U. some years back, he had Christian religious symbols in the background covered up.  When he recently spoke at a mosque in Baltimore, he did so in front of numerous religious symbols of Islam, left uncovered.

I totally fucked up.  Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:36 | 7204124 opt out Oh Horseshit. They don't want assistance unlocking that phone; they want a key to unlock all phones. Apple will be forced to cave eventually but in the meantime the .gov crowd can fuck off. Want to know about an individuals terroristic proclivities? Start with their public fucking facebook posts - geniuses. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:37 | 7204131 if The more important issue not being discussed is that the newer A7 based phones with the built-in Secure Enclave will be beyond Apple's ablility to comply with court orders (unless someone finds a flaw in the implementation).  So what then ?  Will we simply ban properly implemented crypto ? http://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/02/17/apple-can-comply-with-the-fbi-cou... â€œWhy not simply update the firmware of the Secure Enclave too?â€? I  initially speculated that the private data stored within the SE was  erased on updates, but I now believe this is not true. Apple can update  the SE firmware, it does not require the phone passcode, and it does not  wipe user data on update. Apple can disable the passcode delay and  disable auto erase with a firmware update to the SE. After all, Apple  has updated the SE with increased delays between passcode attempts and  no phones were wiped. ... Update 3: Reframed â€œThe Devil is in the Detailsâ€? section and noted that  Apple can equally subvert the security measures of the iPhone 5C and  later devices that include the Secure Enclave via software updates. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 16:38 | 7204138 me or you iPhone sales are all time low Apple is just trying to assurance the public (sheep) that they can trust in the company.... Remember Ubuntu phone is coming Monday made by a Chinese company.  Cook is looking at his company's viability if his customers start to believe their privacy cannot be protected from the fascists in American government. Serious, and intelligent terrorism does not use iPhones, Galaxies, or Blackberries. The asshole Jihadists in San Bernadino are proof, and all of this retail, consumer, bullshit is a distraction from the real shit.
