If not, don’t judge. If you do, it won’t matter if you’ve purchased those items in the past: Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa will no longer be limited to just reordering stuff you got before. Folks who own an Echo, Echo Dot, Tap, or Fire TV can now direct Alexa to buy tens of millions of things, from a frisbee to a frozen yogurt machine, as long as it’s eligible for Prime shipping . To place an order, you just say, â€œAlexa, order [fill in the blank with your heart’s desire].â€? Alexa will then suggest a product that ships with Prime and tell you the price, apply any discounts, and calculate your total. Once youâ€™ve said â€œYesâ€? to confirm the order, youâ€™re done. All products purchased via Alexa qualify for free returns as well. If Alexa canâ€™t find something you want or complete the order, it might offer options like adding the item to your cart on Amazon, adding it to your Alexa shopping list, or checking the Alexa app for more options. Amazon says there are tens of millions of products you can now order with Alexa, excluding apparel, shoes, jewelry, watches, Amazon Fresh, Prime Pantry, Prime Now, and Add-On items.
