Short Twitter And Facebook, They Are Grossly Overvalued - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Investors continue to refuse to see the valuation behind the story. Granted both Twitter and Facebook are still growing, but you are paying through the nose in terms of valuation for this growth. I hate to sound like a broken record, but Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is nowhere near being a stock that you can hold overnight and sleep like a baby. Don't take my word for it, Twitter's chart speaks for itself. I first wrote about Twitter when it first got listed (please consider: Twitter: A Bubble Is Born ). What surprises me time after time is that investors refuse to see the valuation behind the story. Time after time again investors look at the story, but do not bother to look at what they pay for this story. Such is the case with twitter and many other social and internet stocks these days. In the case of Twitter, the story is that of a stock that is growing rapidly, however even after the recent correction, you are still paying through the nose in terms of valuation. Lets start with what analysts think Twitter will do this year and next year. According to data from Yahoo, revenue for 2015 is expected to come in at $2.2 billion and for 2016, analysts think Twitter will book $3.3 billion in revenue. A 50% increase is revenue is impressive for any company, and to be sure, many investors would love to own such a stock. However, has anyone thought of what they are paying for the stock? Setting aside metrics like an after tax multiple (which Twitter does not posses), investors who buy Twitter today will have to fork up about 10 times revenue for the stock, and about 7 times revenue for next year. As you read this article, Twitter has a market cap of $24 billion folks. I am sorry, but that is a lot of market cap for $2.2 billion in revenue. Given that Twitter still does not have a trailing PE to speak of, honestly I do not understand why anyone should pay that much for any stock, even with these impressive growth rates. Now let's look at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Contrary to Twitter, Facebook has a trailing PE of 78. However, just like Twitter, Facebook is trading at an astronomical Price/Sales ratio. For the current year analysts expect Facebook to book revenue of $17 billion and for 2016, analysts are modeling $22.7 billion. However, currently the market cap of Facebook is about $225 billion. So in other words, investors today are paying 13 times revenue for 2015 and 10 times revenue for 2016. In fact, if you forced me to buy one of these two stocks, I would be buying Twitter at the moment and not Facebook. The reason is that while they are both valued about the same in terms of the revenue you pay for them, Twitter at least is expected to increase revenue by about 50%, where Facebook's revenue is expected to increase by about 33%. Why you should not have these stocks is a long-term portfolio It's one thing holding and trading these stocks for the short term, and its another issue if you think you can keep them in your portfolio for the long term and expect to make money. In Twitter's case, every long term minded investor who ever bought the stock is losing money, with the exception if you bought at the IPO or below the level the stock reached May and June of 2014. Everyone else is losing money. In the case of Facebook things are not that bad because the stock is close to an all time high. However please keep in mind that this stock is even more overvalued than Twitter, and if the slightest piece of news comes out that deviates from the extraordinary expectations the market has of the stock, it will come crashing down. Why exactly did Twitter crash a short while ago? So what was the problem that caused Twitter to drop 18% a short while ago and about 25% for the month? Like I have said before, when future expectations the market has of any company are not met, then stocks that are priced to perfection like Twitter crash. To begin with, Twitter's last quarter was better than expectations. Twitter reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.07 versus expectations of $0.04 per share. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, Twitter reported $104 million above the company's guidance of $94 million. Finally, monthly active users increased nearly 5% quarter-over-quarter and met expectations of 302 million monthly users. The culprit in Twitter's case supposedly was that revenue guidance for the year came in at the mid range figure of $2.23 billion, about 5% lower than previous guidance and adjusted EBITDA guidance was 7% lower. Well I am sorry if I do not buy it. If you ask me, no matter what Twitter reported the stock was going to correct. Because it is priced to perfection and then some, and there is no way in the world any company can stay so overvalued for long before crashing. Personally I think if it wasn't forward guidance, the market would have found some other excuse to sell the stock. But investors who buy and hold these stocks also have another problem. And that is none other than the continued increase of the total number of shares. Granted the dilution being incurred to shareholders is not as much as in many other companies, however given how expensive these stocks are, one would at least expect the total number of shares not to increase. Because not only do investors have the overvalued element to battle with, when share increase over time, it's like trying to swim upstream like salmon do. Eventually you get exhausted and die. In Facebook's case, its easy, short at will at these levels any day of the week. There is little chance in my mind that this stock can go much higher, even it exceeds expectations. Even a slight deviation of what the market expects will provoke a massive sell-off. I am not sure of the timing, but I can tell you that it will be easier make money on the short side than the long side at these levels. Twitter is a little more complicated, because it continues to experience revenue growth of 50%. In addition, it just experienced a big correction and investors will be looking to buy the dip, as opposed to look at the market cap and jump out the window. So in Twitter's case, I would hold on a little more and look for any sign of technical weakness the weeks ahead. Use any indicator you are comfortable with. if you see the ground shaking under the stock, chances are it's ready for the next leg down. In both cases, I am very curios to see how long investors can continue to swim upstream before they get tired.
