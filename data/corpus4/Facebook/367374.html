10 Reasons You Can't Short Facebook - Hold Rating Now But Looking To Go To Buy Rating - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is a game changer with years of market leadership ahead. No other player can easily catch up to Facebook's share of social. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is expected to report earnings April 27th after the market close. There seems to be some concerns about Facebook's upcoming quarter from several Wall Street firms. We think there is a chance that revenues can accelerate and beat Street estimates despite many of the recent worrisome reports. Because the stock is up in a (deserved) straight line, we have to be patient for a pullback. For that, we have a hold rating. If the stock were not up in a straight line, it would be worthy of a buy. At times, traders have the urge to short a stock 'up too much' on 'value' which is typically a losing plan unless they sniff out a chink in the armor. For that reason, we wanted to list 10 reasons why we don't think Facebook is a short for, potentially, years to come. Revenue growth was up 51.7% in Q4 versus 40.5% in Q3. The two-year run rate of growth has been consistently 100% now for 3 quarters (see chart below). If they keep up the 100% growth then the reported revenues should be above the Street expectations for the next couple of quarters. You can see above that the Street numbers imply a slowdown of the extremely steady 2-year trends, which may prove conservative. 9. Facebook May Weather An Economic Slowdown On the last conference call, the company said they were not seeing a slowdown, unlike other companies. We think that a slowdown may spur advertisers to more carefully review their ad spend and ensure that it is directed to high ROI projects. Facebook has the ability to show their advertisers the direct payback immediately. We expect this to cause Facebook to take share from competitive advertising venues. The global Ad market is $569B. Facebook revenues last year were $18B. Other industries' leading players have far more share of wallet of their customers and Facebook is showing the ad clients that their spending isn't matching where the consumer is spending their time. This tells us there are many legs to drive growth. The largest swath of new consumers that almost every international company has tapped into over the last couple of decades is still virgin territory for Facebook. This is a huge opportunity for them. And if you say 56% does not include stock compensation and other regular expenses, so then they still have 35% GAAP EBIT Margins, which does include the kitchen sink. That doesn't exist everywhere. 6. Mobile About To Increase Their Growth Rate Mobile is most of their revenues and growing faster, stealing share fast from the PC business. If the pace of mobile continues, it will take the company's overall growth rate higher. In fact, last quarter's revenue growth rate did accelerate from previous quarters. For consumers they own that mobile experience right now. 5. Near 100% Reach to 20-35 Year Olds If you are an advertiser and you want to target people that change their mind to switch buying habits, that's this demographic. As people age, they stop changing as much. You need to catch them young. There is almost no other opportunity out there for an advertiser to capture the entire target audience in one choice. Facebook offers that choice which is unparalleled in any media vertical. If we think back to past competitive fields on new technology industries one player won, there were close seconds, and the leader kept their lead for some time. Facebook won social. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) can't win it back for one reason. For social, the amount of people using the platform matters to the users themselves, cycling the winners' competitive position and consumer stickiness. Here, consumers need to be on Facebook. It's going to be tough to rip them away from 'need to be'. This is share to keep which is in the hands of Facebook not to lose. Technology winners can hold their lead for decades. Think back to Microsoft that didn't relinquish their PC lead for years. Facebook has that potential. How can you face people saying I shorted Facebook. Okay, waiting to buy makes sense, but shorting may be embarrassing, at least in the long term. Imagine admitting you shorted Microsoft, Apple or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) 20 years ago. Great companies and great talent are one thing, but a great company needs a visionary leader. Zuckerberg is focused with a passion that his product is important to mankind. With that deep-rooted will and directed motivation, he will be driven to accomplish many of his goals. To have the purse strings and support to go along with it will help too. He already stacks up with the legendary greats of business and he is only 31. He is focused on winning on video, conferencing, messaging, living experiences, which likely ties into his bigger vision for Oculus, to win human interactions over time. He is a good business person but that he exudes that he cares about his customer maybe more than his business, causes him to win on social and on business.
