Should You Show Match Group Some Love In Your Portfolio? - Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) | Seeking Alpha Company operates numerous high traffic online dating properties. Enormous brand presence, with 89% of singles aware of the Match Group dating products. Valuation is not cheap at three times revenue and thirteen times EBITDA. Sector is extremely competitive with Match Group heavily dependent on third party platforms. Match Group (NASDAQ: MTCH ) is a global leader in the online dating sector. The company has successfully grown their portfolio through internal development and acquisitions, to producing approximately a billion in revenue. However, the online dating sector is extremely competitive and unlike a Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) or LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), the switching costs are much lower for dating applications. Additionally, Match Group is heavily dependent on third party platforms, such as Facebook, which can alter their terms at any point and/or demand some type of compensation for using their platform. With these major risks and an already premium valuation in our view at 3.5 times revenue and 13 times trailing EBITDA, we see little reason to purchase Match Group shares currently. Match Group was originally part of IAC Group (NASDAQ: IACI ) but was spun out as the business gained scale and momentum. Match Group has been well positioned as online dating has gained momentum. There are approximately 106 million unmarried individuals within the United States, so the market size is enormous. Additionally, it is estimated around 10% of these individuals will never marry. However, this market also has substantial churn and numerous new companies are gaining traction within the sector including Hinge , Happn , and Coffeemeetsbagel . Hinge offers users the ability to meet people through their friends and Happn lets users meet people who they crossed paths with based on their phones GPS. Both applications have almost identical interfaces to Tinder see below (Tinder is the lower image) and offer the same messaging functionality, just with slightly different marketing angles. Match Group will likely have to continue acquiring companies as it has previously, further diluting investors in order to maintain its market share. Additionally, some high growth companies may not be interested in taking a buyout opportunity, thereby limiting the efficacy of Match Group's existing strategy. Dating apps additionally have a built in churn of 20-30% , so the better the service is, the shorter your customer retention. This contrasts to other technology networking businesses such as LinkedIn and Facebook where users are retained for a much longer period and extensive data can be collected for advertising and premium offerings. In Match Group's prospectus they discuss how the company is heavily dependent on third part platforms such as Facebook for their registration. Tinder only allows registration through Facebook and there have historically been issues with using the Facebook platform when Facebook has outages and/or developer issues. Ultimately Tinder's growth and monetization are dependent on Facebook which allows Tinder to pull extensive user data and we feel it is a major risk to be dependent on an external service provider for your core operating businesses growth. In order to value Match Group, we looked for similarly sized subscription internet businesses, subject to reasonable churn rates, albeit less than dating applications. Using the median enterprise value to revenue of 2.5 and assuming some dilution as the company continues to issue employees shares and pursues acquisitions, a price target of $12 is derived. We note this is less than the current price of around $14 per share and around the lowest analyst price target of $11 per share . We thus do not feel shares are attractive from a valuation perspective, although we would not recommend shorting shares at this time although we note short interest has risen considerably since the stock's IPO. In conclusion, we feel Match Group is not an attractive investment at the current price. The online dating industry although large is competitive with no technological barriers to entry and difficult to monetize given users built in churn rate. Additionally, Match Group trades at a premium valuation relative to its peer set and is likely to further dilute shareholders through employee stock issuances and acquisitions. Despite operating in an enormous market, we would swipe left to this spin-off investment opportunity. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
