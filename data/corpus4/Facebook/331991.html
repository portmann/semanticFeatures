With FANGs still down 10% from the end-2015 highs, and only Facebook green for the year, some might question the "never sell" mentality preached to all from the bullish-pulpit of brokerage-TV. However, for one of the FANGs, things just got a little dark. For the first time since 2014, NFLX just suffered a "death cross."
