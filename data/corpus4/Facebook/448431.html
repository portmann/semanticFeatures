The new feature is rolling out to a small slice of Facebook users to start, and will let users create standalone Pages to raise money for the U.S.-based 501(c)3 nonprofits nearest and dearest to them. “Fundraisers allow nonprofit supporters to set up a dedicated page to share their story, tell others about a nonprofitâ€™s mission, and rally around a fundraising goal,” Facebook says in its announcement . Pages for nonprofits first launched last fall to let groups raise money from their Newsfeed. Since then, more than 600 nonprofits have signed on, Facebook’s Naomi Gleit, vice president of product management for social good at Facebook, told Mashable . Fundraiser creators will be able to choose from almost 100 charities to start, like Nature Conservancy, Alzheimer’s Association, Oxfam, Mercy Corp, World Wildlife Fund, and more. “Before we actually disburse funds to them, depending on how much money it is, we’ll do some more quality control,” Gleit said about the nonprofits overall. “We just want to make sure there’s no fraud, so there’s an additional layer of vetting.” Facebookâ€™s fundraising efforts are part of its Social Good team, which was launched in September 2015 and integrates tools like Safety Check and Amber Alerts.
