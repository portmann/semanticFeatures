Facebook: Messenger Going Non-Social Hints At Enterprise Solution Aspirations - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha What Messenger not requiring Facebook participation does is open up the platform to much wider use and presumably to just about every person in the country. It also opens it up to folks having very specific use cases, such as using it strictly for its photo messaging, video chat and video calling capacities. The key point to be made is that Messenger offers all of these services and it can offer them in a very non-social network way. When you pair this non-social evolution of Messenger with an almost non-social Moments app, which is also collaborative, your mind can really get going in speculation. Being active in consulting with a focus on SMB/enterprise solution deployment the pairing, to me at least, is very closely resembling many of the workflow/collaboration solutions I work with daily. Ten days ago I wrote an article detailing how Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) Moments App was "the new version of Paper". It was in that article that I opined that Moments wasn't a serious long-term strategic initiative but a bread crumb in a series of bread crumbs that would lead to something much bigger and more strategic. I equated this current Easter Egg in Moments to the former Paper, which has now become Instant Articles - Facebook's primary foundational offering into the Inbound Marketing space. Instant Articles is a big deal whereas Paper certainly was not. I also detailed that I thought Moments, with it being a collaboration focused app and on-device learnings mechanism, was going to eventually show itself as a business first application. This speculation was not taken well. But that's where I think consensus and the greater Facebook market again fails to see the bigger picture. I think that's where the market will show itself, once again, to have underestimated the scale of Mark Zuckerberg's vision and the fearlessness of his leadership. Does Facebook have any business being an SMB/enterprise solution? Maybe not. At least right now (outside of Businesses on Facebook and Messenger for Business), but it has entered the general space and I think it has serious aspirations to serve the space in size. Think about it. Facebook already has a customer service platform via its Messenger for Business - including impressive integrations, it already has a deep roster of corporate partners on the marketing and advertising side, and has a comprehensive platform of blend-ready technologies that could very visibly, even from here, blend together to create some interesting solutions. What triggered today's article was the news that followed my Moments article of Facebook now offering a very Whatsapp-feeling Messenger option. One that doesn't require a Facebook account - only a phone number. I believe this is step one in Facebook consolidating Whatsapp and Messenger, but that's subject matter for an article down the road. What Messenger not requiring Facebook participation does is open up the platform to much wider use and presumably to just about every person in the country (we'll keep this article focused on the US). It also opens it up to folks having very specific use cases, such as using it strictly for its photo messaging, video chat and video calling capacities. These are important advances no doubt. But the key point to be made is that Messenger offers all of these services and it can offer them in a very non-social network way, with Facebook no longer requiring membership to its social network. When you pair this non-social evolution of Messenger with an almost non-social Moments app, your mind can really get going in speculation. Being active in consulting with a specific focus on SMB/enterprise solution deployment, the pairing very closely resembles many of the workflow/collaboration solutions I work with daily. That is, if Facebook were to combine the core technologies of Messenger and Moments. But still, there are plenty of competitors on the domestic and global front that offer nearly identical services (albeit to a much smaller user base) either as standalone apps or that could be combined to meet this benchmark. None of the above differentiates Messenger or is what really excites me about Facebook's most recent additions to the service. What does is that Messenger will do all of the above while offering "friend-to-friend" payments, something I believe is the best kept secret at Facebook. Facebook is now involved in the money transfer business, the collaboration business, on and off device, and in the chat business, on and off platform. If I asked you what the best collaboration solution was currently you might say Slack. You might say that because of its incredible and user friendly chat functionality. If I asked you what the best file sharing and quasi-machine learning app was you might say Dropbox or Box. You might say because of the near-universal reach of both when combined. If I asked you what the best pure-play chat app was that had text, photo, and video capacity you could list a hundred names and they'd be the usual suspects - Messenger would likely be included in that list. But if you could white label these products and if I could present to you an app that blended Moments' and Messenger's core technologies - and keep in mind you would also be able to remit money within this blended solution, meaning potentially pay an invoice or receive AR - would you be able to tell me unbiased that Facebook doesn't at least need to be involved in the conversation? I would argue with its network being the tie breaker that Facebook's blended tech would be near best of breed if not best of breed as a comprehensive solution. By the way guys, I don't believe there's a comprehensive solution offering the combined tech that the blended Facebook tech would offer. Period. So, call me crazy. Continue to consider that I'm way off the mark here, and maybe I am, but I've been fooled by Facebook before (I, like many, passed on Facebook under $20/share) and won't be fooled again. I'm not looking for a reason to be long the stock because I already am and with leverage. I'm simply recognizing patterns and using Facebook's prior track record of innovation to guide my thesis here. I think Facebook is headed into the SMB/enterprise solution space.
