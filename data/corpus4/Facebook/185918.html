Facebook's Stock Correlates Well With This Metric - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha David Zanoni , Momentum at a Reasonable Price (333 clicks) Facebookâ€™s stock follows a key shareholder-friendly metric. The stock is still fairly valued on a DCF basis. Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) stock correlates well with free cash flow [FCF]. Free cash flow is considered shareholder-friendly, because it is the money available to repurchase stock, reinvest in the business, and pay dividends. Facebook doesn't pay dividends, but it has done buybacks and reinvested in the business. Since Facebook is still in a high growth phase, it chooses to forgo paying a dividend and reinvest in the business. This is positive for shareholders as this leads to above-average gains in revenue and earnings, which leads to higher stock prices. For the first two quarters of 2015, Facebook had about $2.5 billion in free cash flow. This means the company is on pace to have about $5 billion in FCF for the year. This would be about 39% higher than last year's FCF of $3.6 billion. So, with the correlation between the stock price and FCF, I would expect the stock to continue to rise. Facebook's valuation still looks fairly valued on a discounted cash flow basis. I calculated the intrinsic value of the stock by using the company's WACC of 10.19% as the discount rate. If Facebook can grow its FCF at 29% annually (in line with consensus estimates ) for the next five years, 15% annually for years 6 to 10, and 3% annually thereafter, the stock has an intrinsic value of about $96. This is a few dollars higher than the current price. At this valuation, I think that the stock can continue to grow approximately in line with its FCF growth over the long term. The company's PEG, based on 5-year projected earnings growth, is 1.6. This reinforces the stock's fair valuation. Some investors might be turned off by the trailing PE of 94 or the forward PE of 34. These metrics only look back and forward one year. So, the PEG is a better measure as it accounts for multiple years of growth. The stock should perform well because of Facebook's strong above-average revenue, earnings, and FCF growth. The PEG is a more refined valuation measure for such a high-growth company. With the PEG between one and two, the stock is fairly valued in terms of its 5-year projected earnings growth. The bottom line for Facebook's valuation is that the stock is fairly valued in terms of long-term earnings and FCF growth. Facebook is still achieving strong double-digit gains in daily and active monthly users. This is being converted into increased revenue growth as advertising continues to grow. I think that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future since many people like to stay in touch with their friends and family and post information that is funny, political, religious, inspiring, or just updates on what they are doing or what is important to them. Facebook also has strong growth potential with the consumer version of the Oculus Rift being released next year. There are numerous uses for this device. The immediate use will be for virtual reality gaming. However, there are numerous applications that are likely to use this technology. For example, viewing movies at home or even in theaters is a likely use. I could see special theaters equipped with Oculus Rifts to allow for virtual reality movie experiences. Viewing sports with the Rift could make viewers feel like they are present at the game with perfect seats. Medical students could perform surgery in simulation mode before actually touching a body. Exercising could turn into gaming with the Rift. Users could play virtual reality games or have the experience of traveling on a scenic trail while riding a treadmill or stationary bike. It would be reasonable to assume that the Rift will be used for driving and flying simulation to provide education and experience before users hit the road or the air. The bottom line is that the Oculus Rift is likely to produce a significant amount of future revenue for Facebook. I see Facebook as a good risk/reward investment for the long term. The current advertising business still has plenty of room to grow. The numerous uses for the Oculus Rift make it likely that Facebook will experience strong above-average growth for many years. The stock's fair valuation makes it likely that the stock will continue to increase approximately in line with free cash flow growth going forward. Since revenue, earnings, and free cash flow are likely to increase at an above-average pace, I expect the stock to outperform the market over the long term.
