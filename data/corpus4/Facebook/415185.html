Facebook is shuttering its FBX ad exchange; Criteo slumps in response - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha May 25 2016, 15:29 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Facebook ( FB +0.2%) is shutting down its FBX ad exchange, which launched in 2012 and (via ad tech partners) delivers Facebook ads based on browsing activity on non-Facebook sites. Criteo ( CRTO -2.6%), which has delivered targeted e-commerce ads for its clients via FBX, has sold off on the news. As it is, FBX has only functioned on Facebook's PC site - mobile accounted for 82% of Q1 ad revenue - and didn't support video ads. Other PC ad options, such as news feed ads recommending a user like/follow a page or shop at the advertiser's site (they can be purchased directly from Facebook), remain in place. Facebook has been pruning its ad offerings in order to focus on high-quality formats that deliver a strong ROI. In March, the company ended a test for an automated ad-buying platform after seeing "many bad ads and fraud. More recently, it laid off ~40 workers within its LiveRail video ad unit (server third-party publishers), and stopped doing business with LiveRail publishers that didn't meet Facebook's quality standards.
