Why Do You Own Facebook? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Being long in Facebook isn't rocket science and I'm honestly curious what your reasons are for buying the stock. Geographic expansion in terms of MAUs is pivotal to Facebook's success in the next twelve months. EPS growth will pick up because of mobile ad growth and Oculus next spring, creating exceptional versatility for the company. I've recently picked up a good amount of shares of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to help diversify one of my clients' portfolios a bit better. I could've picked Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) or Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), but I found Facebook to provide an incredibly simple and sound basis for an initial entry. Great top-line growth from impressive expansion of the user base, domestic and abroad was the real pull factor and with my full confidence in Zuckerberg to provide future EPS stability based upon a slew of growth catalysts, the upcoming Q3 report is looking bright on expansion potential. With the global equity correction providing a lot of volatility in Facebook's stock, I got in at the $87 level, which is decent considering the stock is trading at $92.05 now. We're now decently away from the all-time high of $99.24, which from a simple psychological standpoint, gives the stock adequate space to run. So, why did I buy on the dip? Let's get into it. When you have a tech company with double-digit user growth, it's hard to pass up. When we talk about Facebook's potentiality, we have to turn directly to DAUs and MAUs. DAUs are currently at 968 million online and 844 million on mobile, both showing double digit growth from Q2. Is that necessarily sustainable? If you figure another 17% and 29% trend in those categories YOY, then we're looking at DAUs of 1.13 billion and 1.09 billion, respectively. This isn't going to be any easy task, but nonetheless I believe it's possible given their past user growth statistics. In particular, in an increasingly scalable user base, I think the Africa platform is going to need to show much greater user growth over the next twelve months. The MAUs are in the same boat with double digit YOY growth, just slightly higher for online and mobile, at 1.49 billion and 1.31 billion. If that's not incredible enough, their acquisition of WhatsApp has now allowed for that app to pass 900 million MAUs, making it the second most downloaded app in the Android store and a real monetized force to be reckoned with. Although it's going to be a while until the $19 billion acquisition cost is recovered, there is little indication that this growing platform won't pay for itself. The exceptional user growth, altogether, lends itself to exceptional financial metrics. Just look at this beautiful OCF growth. Despite one quarter of a slight 6.94% dip, the company has shown significant overall improvement, keeping both short and long-term liquidity extremely high. View the trend below: Oh, and with only $110 million in long-term debt, I'm not worried about them being able to pay it down and if anything, they have room to borrow much more. That comes before we even mention the strength of $14.13 billion worth of cash and marketable securities, on top of an incredibly impressive gross margin of 83.47%. COGS have declined the last two quarters by nearly 15%, showing increased efficiency. There's very little not to get excited about here. Revenue in Q2 was up 39%, when adjusted for currency translation. That's absurdly good when we look at them versus companies like Twitter who only have 15% growth. Furthermore, Facebook crushes the industry average of 6.8%. If we pan back really quick to MAUs, Twitter only has 316 million MAU where as Facebook has nearly 4.7x that. You can clearly see the resilience of Facebook relative to Twitter in the LTM. All the news you hear about Twitter is that they're a potential acquisition target, while Facebook is a company more geared towards making acquisitions themselves and can do so based upon the amount of cash on hand. I'm not so concerned about competitors taking on Facebook, given its scale, but the comparison is certainly useful. Looking forward, perhaps one of the best catalysts moving forward for the company is the expansion into Africa. Lining up the fresh statistics: South Africa MAU is 12 million, which should grow now that the office in Johannesburg is directing development 60% of all internet users in Africa are on Facebook If the 20% growth trend in one quarter can continue over the next year, given their revamped ad platforms, Facebook is going to have an incredibly strong top-line, surpassing expectations With all of these positives, of course I have a few concerns. The effective tax rate is 44% (recorded in Q2), which is much higher than the standard U.S. corporate tax rate of 35%, but this is because of a lack of cash kept overseas, as well as the payment of stock options to employees. As Facebook begins to mature as a company, taxes and cash reserves will be better held and I expect to see a marginal reduction. Another significant concern is bottom-line stability. In Q4 2014 we saw a QOQ decline in diluted EPS of 16.67%, followed up by an even more disappointing decline in Q1 2015 of 28%. Granted, the bounce back in Q2 was notable at 38.89% to rest at $0.25, but we need to see more stability. I fully believe the only way this is going to happen is to see stability in the ad platform and capturing the potential of the below listed catalysts. Of course, there's also the concern of currency headwinds, which for Facebook, the euro is a large concern; but, in the grand scheme of things, the $7 million loss due to translation in Q2 and total $11 million for 2015 is not a lot when you consider the company's Q2 net income was $715 million. I believe these risks are fully countered by other catalysts, including: Oculus hitting store shelves early next year and providing a projected revenue stream of close to $1 billion. They still have to make up the acquisition cost of $2 billion and fully integrate it with the Facebook platform, but VR and AR are operating in an environment where the total market is expected to grow to an aggregate value of $150 billion in just five years' time, leaving me incredibly confident in this catalyst. Buying Instagram for $1 billion is looking like a steal at this point, with the thirty additional countries having ads by the end of September, and new "call to action" buttons that basically let users subscribe, sign up, or buy something with a simple click. The real value-added component which I think is going to be huge is the 30-second video ad options on Instagram, considering the app's growing user base. Instagram, great acquisition by the company, has the potential to do $1 billion in ad revenue over the next four quarters. The call to action integration to Facebook, in general, is going to be pivotal moving forward considering the 45 million businesses that advertise on the site. The new personal assistant "M," which now competes with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Cortana and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri, has exceptional monetization potential . I'm personally advocating for a buy rating not just because it's at a good technical level, but because of the astounding balance sheet and amount of growth catalysts. I'm curious, if you own Facebook - why did you buy it? I'm putting a price target on it of at least $96 by December based upon my above analysis. I'd say that if global equity markets can gain some much needed traction, it'll hit $105 in the next twelve months. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.
