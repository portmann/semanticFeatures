Apple Pay's Leverage Will Keep Royalty Rates Intact - If Not Lead To Something Greater - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Some fear that AAPL's $0.15 per $100 transaction fee is at risk after Visa and MA did not strike a similar deal with GOOG. There's a big difference between the leverage that AAPL has vs. GOOG in negotiating fees. AAPL could be one of the few companies to disrupt MA and Visa's business in payment processing. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is launching its new mobile payment service Android Pay, and it will not collect transaction fees from credit card companies, according to the WSJ . Double Diamond Payments Research figures that Google's lack of terms could be an indication that banks are not willing to share fees, and that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could end up in a heated battle to maintain its small $0.15 profit per $100 spent on Apple Pay. However, payment processing companies Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) are unlikely to do such a thing, and if by some chance they did, Apple has an answer. The payment processing industry is pretty much dominated by Visa and MasterCard. It is the one segment of financial services, or any industry for that matter, that has not faced an innovating threat or increased competition by fragmentation. What I mean is that Citigroup (NYSE: C ) not only has to compete with Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), but also the 100s of small regional and local banks where its branches are located. Google not only has to compete with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) for digital advertising dollars, but also Yelp (NYSE: YELP ), Zillow (NASDAQ: Z ) and the many small dot-com/mobile application companies that now earn revenue via ads. My personal belief for why payment processors were willing to work with Apple and share transaction fees is because they did not want Apple as a competitor. Up until now, Visa and MasterCard sit atop the payment processing industry with little competition - American Express (NYSE: AXP ) also is in the conversation - and there are quite a few reasons why. For example, if Citigroup were to become its own payment processor then it could potentially push customers away from the bank who prefer the accessibility of Visa and MasterCard, with services that really are accepted just about everywhere. When banks issue a Visa debit or credit card, their customers know that the card will be universally accepted. Meanwhile, if Citigroup, Bank of America or another large bank were to become a payment processor, they'd have to spend years to build out the infrastructure and point-of-sale presence that Visa and MasterCard have established. This would be especially difficult in areas where Citigroup does not have an established branch presence and limited customers. Meanwhile, Apple does not have these same problems. Reportedly, there are more than 800 million accounts with credit card information on iTunes . This proves two things: Apple has a large ecosystem (we already knew that) and that consumers trust Apple with their financial information. Furthermore, Apple Pay is on pace to become available in over one million U.S. locations next month, and just recently announced that it is expanding into 250,000 U.K. retailers. Therefore, Apple has the presence with businesses that accept Apple Pay. It has the network and the trust in that network. It also has partnerships with almost all of U.S.'s largest banks through Apple Pay. As a result, Apple has the things needed to become a successful payment processor. While I'm sure there would be a lengthy regulatory process to do so, the capital spending requirements would not be outside of Apple's budget. As seen below, Visa and MasterCard's capital expenditures relative to revenue are far lower than Apple, and that suggests that becoming a payment processor could be a good idea for Apple's profits and margins. AAPL CAPEX To Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Specifically, Visa and MasterCard's operating margin is about twice that of Apple's 30% margin. The reason is because costs and competition are low whereas the need for the service remains increasingly high. In essence, payment processing could be the next industry for Apple to disrupt, implying that Visa and MasterCard need Apple far more than Apple needs either of them. That said, the natural rebuttal to my argument is if MasterCard and Visa needs Apple, then why wouldn't either negotiate on fees with Google, which owns an even larger mobile operating system market share by use. The reason is because Apple's U.S. market share is higher - the U.S. is a top market for payment processors. Furthermore, Google relies on a delicate balance between software (IT), hardware (Samsung), and network providers (Verizon) to adopt and support new services on the Android operating system. For example, one reason for Google Wallet's failure is believed to be the fact that AT&T (NYSE: T ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) all blocked its use in favor of promoting their joint payment venture. With these carriers not supporting Google Wallet, hardware manufacturers can decide against supporting the technology, and Google is then at a competitive disadvantage. Meanwhile, Apple owns the hardware, software and has a loyal following of consumers that makes not supporting its technology a big risk for network providers and even retailers. In other words, Apple has a lot of leverage. It has leverage over wireless service providers. It has leverage over retailers and merchants. It now has leverage over banks due to consumer demand. And it also has leverage over payment processors like Visa. This makes the chances of Visa cutting its transaction fee share very low, but in the rare event that it would, investors should not worry. That would only push Apple into a far more lucrative path, one that may be part of Apple's long-term future anyway. In closing, I will add that there are long-term risks to Apple Pay, so much that it makes more sense for Apple to take the path of becoming a payment processor. There are mobile app payment services being used like CurrentC that perform the same function as Apple Pay, but is more interactive, allowing consumers to receive coupons and rewards at select stores. This gives retailers an incentive to suggest CurrentC to its customers. Then, there are company specific payment processing services like Starbucks' app, which allows customers to not only order drinks but also pay from their app, also earning rewards. Fact of the matter is that Apple Pay faces the risk of retailers developing their own payment apps that offer their customers more incentive not to use Apple Pay. Not to mention, there are countless payment services like PayPal (Pending: PYPL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and now Android Pay that are all fighting for share in the mobile payment space. While Apple may have the largest and most engaged network, these things could put a limit on the potential of Apple Pay as a service. Further, the payment processing space may be well penetrated, but it is less fragmented, and while dominated by Visa and MasterCard, Apple has all the components needed to be successful. If Apple were to enter, Apple would not be competing against these other payment services like PayPal or Android Pay, but rather reeping the high margin rewards of a more digitalized payment universe that requires the process of payments. In other words, Visa and MasterCard are unlikely to mess with Apple Pay's royalty, but investors should hope that they try, thereby pushing Apple in the direction of payment processing.
