Facebook Is Testing A Localized Version Of eBay - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is testing a Buy & Sell button to help people buy new or used products from sellers located nearby. A dedicated searchable localized page for trading products is something that eBay has not yet implemented. Aside from aggressively promoting hyper-local advertising to its advertisers, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) also wants to enable localization awareness for ordinary people to trade goods inside Facebook. Facebook is currently testing a Buy & Sell button in New Zealand and Australia. This is a very important development because it could lead to a better version of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) inside Facebook's web and mobile platforms. As far as I know, localization awareness is still not available to eBay sellers. The desktop version of the Buy & Sell Facebook page being tested shows only products for sale by vendors located within a certain city or municipality. There is also a search engine box and, like eBay, items for sale are organized into different categories. People who can't seem to sell their used or new items on eBay might eventually find Facebook a worthy alternative. The experimental Buy & Sell Button/Page is a big improvement over the Sell Something feature that is available to Facebook Groups. Trading new and used items on Facebook groups has no search ability and sellers are often located in faraway locations. Consider this buy & sell group that was created for trading cars and car accessories among residents of the City of Manila. The lack of location awareness feature allowed vendors outside Manila (Batangas and Laguna provinces) to still post their items. The technology and talent acquired by Facebook from purchasing product search engine specialist, TheFind, last March is obviously helping toward making Facebook a viable store for online shopping. Marrying the product search technology of TheFind with Facebook's location awareness technology is a decisive move that could help Zuckerberg's company compete with eBay and other e-commerce portals. Location awareness-enabled advertising is a cheaper and better alternative for small businesses to promote their people located near their area of business. The same principle applies to Facebook's hyper-localized version of trading goods online. It has several advantages compared to eBay's current business model. Selling items on Facebook's Buy & Sell platform is likely to be cheaper and faster than using eBay. Since the buyer and seller are located near each other, delivery costs of sold items is minimized. A short 20-minute drive to pick-up/deliver an item sold through Facebook is superior to any 1-day express courier delivery. It is also possible for prospective buyers to personally inspect items through a face-to-face meeting with a vendor. Product return or refund is also easier done when the people are located within the same area. Like eBay, Facebook can monetize trades on its experimental Buy & Sell Page service by charging business or professional sellers a small fee per item posted or sold. Facebook can also allow users to use their local bank accounts (and not just credit cards) to buy Credits to buy physical goods. Facebook Credits is losing steam because it is only being used to buy in-game items on social games. Web-based gaming is on a big decline. It is time for Facebook to enable its payments service to include processing online trading of actual products. Testing a localized e-commerce platform is one more reason to go long on FB . Facebook certainly has a far higher number of active (and loyal users) than eBay or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has now. Enabling 1.49 billion people to quickly search, buy, and receive products from their friends, neighbors, and town mates is a believable future scenario. Fast-tracking the implementation of a localized Buy & Sell platform in all countries could generate new revenue for Facebook Credits or a new digital wallet service. Peer-to-peer buy and sell transactions should go hand in hand with digital payments. The peer-to-peer Money transfer feature implemented on Facebook Messenger app is still free because it was deemed to be "just another feature to improve user stickiness and as a means to show more ads to people." FB investors will likely agree with me that digital wallets should be monetized through transaction fees - and not through advertising. Alpha Omega Mathematica also agrees with the Buy rating made by TipRanks analysts for Facebook. Alpha Omega Mathematica still believes that Facebook can sustain its impressive growth in sales and net income. Facebook has outpaced its peers. Getting involved in e-commerce is another fuel that will help maintain or improve the growth of Facebook. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.
