Nvidia: Expect Amazon To Buy More Pricey Tesla GPUs - Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is ramping up its cloud-based, artificial intelligence services. Amazon is going to rent out Nvidia-powered computers to corporations who want to run deep learning software in the cloud. Nvidia is a pioneer and undisputed leader in GPU-accelerated artificial intelligence computing. Shareholders of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) should welcome the news that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is increasing its presence in cloud-based artificial intelligence compute services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) will rent out computers (powered by up to eight Nvidia GPUs) to companies who want to run cloud-based deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) software. The Bloomberg article also mentioned that a single artificial intelligence software could utilize up to 80 computers. Amazon will likely become a major buyer of Nvidia's new Tesla P100 GPU. Nvidia spent $2 billion on Research & Development to make the Tesla P100. Nvidia specifically created the Tesla P100 to accelerate deep learning and artificial intelligence computing. With 15 billion transistors, the Tesla P100 can learn incoming data 12x faster than previous Nvidia GPUs. Amazon is definitely impressed with Nvidia's promise of "Infinite Compute" for the Tesla P100. The Tesla P100 touts up to 50x performance boost for data center applications. Nvidia has long-term benefits from Amazon's ambition to compete with the deep learning services of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ). Alphabet is now renting out its Google Cloud Platform to developers who want to use machine learning computers. IBM already touts a long list of cognitive or deep learning, cloud-based apps powered by its Watson machine learning software. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is also getting its feet wet on cloud-based artificial intelligence. These companies are all rivals of Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing. Amazon already wrote to its shareholders that it expects to make $10 billion in revenue from AWS this year. Adding Nvidia-powered artificial intelligence services will definitely help AWS keep its leadership position over cloud computing. Tractica estimates that artificial intelligence for enterprise applications alone could have a market value of $11.1 billion by 2024. As the current leader in enterprise cloud computing, AWS has vested interests to keep its clients loyal. Amazon can and should offer its own for-rent deep learning computers. Amazon will also have to buy more Nvidia GPUs to meet the demand of machine learning-powered Big Data Analytics. Artificial Intelligence plays a big role in Big Data Analytics' becoming a $118 billion/year business by 2018. Amazon's choice of Nvidia GPUs for its custom machine learning enterprise computers is a big endorsement. Other companies might follow Amazon's choice of Nvidia GPUs for their deep learning computers. Nvidia itself sells the Tesla P100-powered DGX-1 Deep Learning System computer. The cheapest version of DGX-1 sells for $129,000 . Debt-laden Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has great Radeon GPUs but it never had any extra money for R&D to create AI-specific GPUs. Nvidia has spent billions to make its GPUs the go-to processors for artificial intelligence. Nvidia, therefore, has an early monopoly on GPU-accelerated artificial intelligence computers. This big advantage makes NVDA a better long-term investment than AMD. For the last three years, Nvidia's stock has outperformed AMD . I expect this trend to continue for many years to come. Selling very expensive Tesla P100 GPUs or DGX-1 deep learning computers is a strong tailwind for Nvidia. AMD is still stuck making GPUs for gamers. Nvidia has already moved on to selling GPUs for hyperscale deep learning computers. I firmly believe that Amazon will buy tons of Nvidia GPUs for its machine-learning computers. Yes, Amazon buys custom Xeon processors from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) for its server farms. However, GPUs are proven to be much faster than x86 CPUs when it comes to deep learning. Below is a screenshot of an article from Domino Data Lab explaining why GPUs are better suited for deep learning tasks. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and IBM are now also using Nvidia GPUs to accelerate their own deep learning frameworks. Facebook uses GPUs in neural networks for its Open AI project. Furthermore, Nvidia also has potential revenue stream from affluent people buying their own deep learning workstations. Exxact Corporation sells consumer-level $9,000 deep learning computers powered by four Nvidia Titan X GPUs. I would love to own a deep learning computer that can help me beat Komodo or Stockfish chess engines. Nvidia's big lead in GPU-accelerated deep learning computers makes it a worthy long-term investment. It doesn't really matter which firm becomes the top dog in cloud-based, artificial intelligence services. Nvidia is still going to sell lots of its GPUs to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Facebook. The only threat to Nvidia's early lead in deep learning processors is Altera. Intel paid $16.7 billion to acquire FPGA-maker Altera. Microsoft found out that FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) could help Intel Xeon CPUs catch up with GPUs when it comes to specific artificial intelligence workload. Microsoft's research suggest that scaling up a neural network using Xeon E5 and Arria 10 GX1150 FPGAs could eventually match the performance of GPU-accelerated deep learning computers. Unfortunately for Altera, Microsoft is still using Nvidia GPUs for its Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK). This goes to show that FPGAs' future in artificial intelligence is still years away from commercial adoption. Microsoft is just one company among dozens of firms involved in deep learning/artificial intelligence that trust Nvidia GPUs. The chart below should convince investors just how great Nvidia's future is in deep learning. Nvidia's GPus are compatible with all major frameworks of artificial intelligence.
