Ask the Readers: What Are Your Alternative Thanksgiving Traditions? Thanksgiving is one of those holidays with many traditional aspects like sharing a big meal with friends and family, carving into a whole turkey, and watching the Macy's Thanksgiving parade. But sometimes, tradition can get expensive and stressful, so we come up with easier, cheaper ways to celebrate Thanksgiving — maybe offering different dishes on the menu, or substituting the big sit-down dinner for an outdoor activity.
