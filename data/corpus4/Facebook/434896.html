One of those humans now has more than two years of jail time to look forward to after sending more than 27 million spam messages through Facebook. The so-called “Spam King,” who pleaded guilty to fraud and criminal attempt in August 2015 , admitting that heâ€™d committed mass spamming efforts in 2008 and 2009, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison and ordered to pay $310,628.55 in restitution, the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Northern District of California announced . The man admitted that he sent unsolicited ads disguised as friend posts over a three-month span, harvesting Facebook user account information by sending â€œphishingâ€? messages to users and tricking them into providing their passwords, prosecutors said. Heâ€™d then take that info, log into their accounts and spam their friendsâ€™ Facebook pages. Unsuspecting folks who clicked the link would then be redirected to websites that paid the Spam King for the Internet traffic. He also admitted to violating a 2009 court order to stay off of Facebook by logging in to his Facebook account while aboard a flight from Las Vegas to New York. This wasn’t his first spam rodeo, either: he started his spammy ways back in the â€™90s, sending junk fax messages. Heâ€™s also faced civil lawsuits from both MySpace (2007) and Facebook (2009), leaving him with almost $1 billion in fines that he was unable to pay. However, this sentence marks the first time heâ€™s been convicted of a crime, prompting prosecutors to originally push for up to 36 months of jail time. “The defendant’s history demonstrates that he has yet to suffer a consequence — other than a default judgment that cannot be collected — for his spamming activities,” prosecutors wrote, via Ars Technica . “A sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment will impress upon the defendant the seriousness of his actions and deter him from engaging in similar conduct again.” â€œSpam Kingâ€?
