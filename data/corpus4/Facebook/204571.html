Thoughts On Momentum Stocks: Effects Of The Correction | Seeking Alpha David Zanoni , Momentum at a Reasonable Price (334 clicks) Momentum Stocks typically do fall hard during market sell-offs. Popular names are dropping more than average. The current situation is not the end of the world, so stay focused on the long-term. The sharp sell-off last week had momentum stocks dropping more than average as compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 indexes. The reality is that the market was due for a correction after such a strong consistent run-up from 2012 through 2014. The Dow average has now officially corrected by 10% from the high of $18,312. The S&P 500 is now down 7.5% from its high of $2130. The momentum names such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) have fallen more than the market indexes. The good news for momentum investors is that these names typically increase at a greater rate than the averages once the market rises again. So, although momentum stocks have more volatility than the market, the companies that are growing at an above average pace will outperform the averages over the long-term. So, it is best not to panic during sharp sell-offs and keep your eyes on where the stocks are likely to be a few years down the road. The sell-off can be used to buy stocks that are on your watch list for a long-term investment. I think when you look back at this sell-off, a few years from now, it will most likely prove to be a good time to buy. Things looked bleak back in 2011 during the European debt crisis, but we can look back at that now and see what a great buying opportunity that sell-off created. It was Barron Rothschild who was credited with saying, "The time to buy is when there is blood in the streets". Rothschild made a lot of money by buying in the panic that followed the Battle of Waterloo. So, now that the market is in the red, it is time to start looking at your buy list. While fears are focused on a slowdown in China, Apple's stock has been punished. However, the people in China tend to have a strong love for American products and Apple products are among them. Fellow author, Mark Hibben, recently pointed out that Apple is likely to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace in China. I think that this is likely due to the love for the Apple brand among aspirational people in China. I also think that the fear over China's slowdown is overdone. Even if China's GDP slows to below 7% in future quarters, it is not likely to cause the wealthier citizens to stop buying Apple's iPhones. I also don't think that the yuan devaluation will make the iPhones too expensive for these aspirational citizens. What typically holds true for momentum names with strong fundamentals is that the stocks are a buy after sharp sell-offs. Although, I'm not a fan of the valuations for Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla, those stocks will probably bounce back significantly after the market's bleeding has stopped. These three stocks have defied normal valuation levels and will probably continue to do so. Disney has been selling off sharply this month. In addition to the overall market sell-off, Disney investors have been worried about the company's media segment. One concern is that some cable customers are cancelling their service, which would reduce revenue sources for Disney's channels such as ESPN and the channel bearing the company name. However, I think that this worry is overblown. The media segment increased 5% for Q3 and 9% for the first 3 fiscal quarters. Although there are concerns within the segment, I don't think that cord cutting will have a significant negative impact on the company. The new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens , is a likely catalyst for Disney for the next fiscal year. The movie debuts on December 18, 2015 and is expected to bring in $2 billion in revenue. Facebook still has strong double-digit revenue and earnings growth which is likely to continue going forward. The company consistently rakes in plenty of operating and free cash flow. So, I expect the stock to perform well after the current correction ends. Facebook is constantly coming up with creative ways to implement ads which is likely to translate into future revenue growth. To conclude, the current correction in momentum stocks and the market in general is creating a great buying opportunity. It is good to keep some cash on hand to take advantage of these sell-offs.
