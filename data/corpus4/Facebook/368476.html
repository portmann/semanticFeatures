Facebook has literally been one of my best investments over the last five years, and everything I predicted about the company's performance came true. Yet, how many sleazy ZHers have apologized for mocking me? Precisely zero. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:41 | 7431632 Skiprrrdog +1 MillionDollarDickweed... I think you need to go to your FaceFuck page and rant to an audience of one (yourself)... https://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=231281 I recall some other chatter as well about ad revenue flows for sites acting similar to the last major blow up ...

Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:22 | 7431543 pods I dont have enough time nor energy to be able to pretend to give a fuck about people I am not friends with. As I said to my hyper-social Sister once, most of her 'friends' are only acquaintances who would stab her in the back in a a second, if it were to their advantage. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 13:34 | 7431841 jus_lite_reading Well said. Facebook has proven to me that I needed to clean ranks and remove desparately shallow "friends" from my circle. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:15 | 7431504 Newbie lurker No worries, they are going the way of myspace. FB, Twitter, Snapchat, instagram, etc.....fads. They will all go tits up in due time.

Like many of his scumbag ilk, he created nothing but either outright stole his software or parasited from the creation of others. Either way, he is a parasite who steals from others and then enjoys being called a genius. I say put him and Soros in a locked cage with an assortment of weapons and put their families on separate ships sinking in shark-infested waters. Only one of them can get out and save their family, and to get out, they have to kill the other.

First announced in January , Brave is a web browser for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android that has ad  blocking built in. But instead of eliminating ads entirely, Brave wants  to replace them with speedier, non-intrusive ads from its own network.  Users who agree to see these ads will then get paid in bitcoin. Under this plan, advertisers pay for a certain number of impressions,  and Brave aggregates those payments into one sum. Websites that  participate in the scheme get 55 percent of the money, weighted by how  many impressions are served on their sites. Brave then divvies up the  remaining bitcoin between itself, its ad-matching partner, and the  users, each getting a 15 percent share. For both users and publishers, Brave deposits the money into  individual bitcoin wallets, and both parties must verify their identity  to claim the funds. This requires an email and phone number for users,  and more stringent identification steps for publishers. Users who donâ€™t  verify will automatically donate their share of the funds back to the  sites they visit most."

Wed, 04/13/2016 - 13:00 | 7431710 arby63 Told my buddy the same thing. He was incredulous. I told him to keep his powder dry because when FB dies it will be quick--within two weeks to total abandon.  Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:09 | 7431466 SERReal1 I guess I must be old school but I fail to see how a company that does not make anything or sell anything other than advertising is worth ~$240 billion dollars (market cap). Everyone looks down on Wal-Mart, but at least they sell something.

There you go NWO, if you want to maintain humanity at 500 000 000 simply pull the plug on social media.  4 of 5 people would fucking kill themselves.  No wasting money on WW3 or nuclear false flags. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:24 | 7431554 SERReal1 You are correct. So many people don't know how to communicate other than Facebook that they would shrivel up and die because they couldn't ask for a meal. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:44 | 7431642 jamochavez look at any highschool between classes or lunch--its rediculous.  Social media may be the most ant-social invention of all time. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 13:04 | 7431729 SERReal1 My daughter is almost 13 and has yet to ask me if she can have a facebook account. If she ever does, I will tell her she can once she is on her own.
