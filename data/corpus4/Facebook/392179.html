Moments ago the social network reported another round of blowout results, as follows: FACEBOOK 1Q REV. $5.38B, EST. $5.27B Some more details on the user growth: Daily active users (DAUs) - DAUs were 1.09 billion on average for March 2016, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Mobile DAUs - Mobile DAUs were 989 million on average for March 2016, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Monthly active users (MAUs) - MAUs were 1.65 billion as of March 31, 2016, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Mobile advertising revenue - Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 82% of advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2016, up from 73% of advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures - Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $1.13 billion. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities - Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $20.62 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, the company also announced that its board has approved a proposal to amend and restate our existing certificate of incorporation to create a new class of non-voting capital stock, known as the Class C capital stock. As the company explains, "If the proposal is approved, we intend to issue two shares of Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend in respect of each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock. This proposal is designed to create a capital structure that will, among other things, allow us to remain focused on Mr. Zuckerberg's long-term vision for our company and encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to remain in an active leadership role at Facebook. The adoption of the proposal is subject to the approval of our stockholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June 20, 2016, and the record date for the payment of the Class C stock dividend would be set by the board of directors at a later date. More information will be available on our Investor Relations site and in our forthcoming proxy statement to be filed today." Marc Zuckerberg added the following note to the earnings release: To maintain our focus on this mission, we have always been a founder-led company. This structure has helped us resist the short term pressures that often hurt companies. It has helped us grow our community, build our business and create shareholder value. It has given us the freedom to prioritize your product experience and invest in new apps like Instagram â€” decisions that donâ€™t always pay off right away, but that we believe help us serve our community and our shareholders. When I look out at the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. Weâ€™re focused not on what Facebook is today, but on what it can be, and what it needs to be for our community. That means investing in areas like spreading connectivity, building artificial intelligence and developing virtual and augmented reality. I am committed to our mission and to leading Facebook there over the long term. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing I do, there are more global challenges that I feel a responsibility to help solve â€” like helping to cure all diseases by the end of this century, upgrading our education system so itâ€™s personalized for each student, and protecting our environment from climate change. Thatâ€™s why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99 percent of our Facebook shares during our lives to advance human potential and promote equality. Today, Facebookâ€™s board of directors is announcing a proposal to create a new class of stock that will allow us to achieve both goals. Iâ€™ll be able to keep founder control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, and Priscilla and I will be able to give our money to fund important work sooner. Right now, there are amazing scientists, educators and doctors around the world doing incredible work. We want to help them make a bigger difference today, not 30 or 40 years down the road. If this proposal goes into effect, weâ€™ll get to keep improving your Facebook experience the way we do today. And over the long term, I think youâ€™ll have better services and be part of a stronger community as a result. I believe in our community and the good we can do in the world, and Iâ€™m looking forward to continuing this journey with you. The kneejerk reaction in the afterhours has been to send the stock just shy of all time highs and was trading up nearly 7%.

Any business-person I've ever spoken to about facebook advertising says it blows. Most have already quit it.

What happens when they have to report more users than actual people on the planet.  Aliens have facebook Wed, 04/27/2016 - 17:06 | 7485052 Wait What fake IPs, fake accounts, fake friends, that's what facebook is all about. you can go on Fivver (another social intermediary site) and have a hot chick friend you on FB or make a video saying she loves you to post on FB. Advertisers keep eating that crap up, though.

Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:54 | 7484989 Theonewhoknows Politics, economics and media - they all in the gutter. We have to ask ourselves a question what we can do about it HERE AND NOW. We all know that the ship is going down but the music keeps playing but what we should be thinking about is how not to be swept by the wave of bad consequences developed world indebtedness, bubbles in many corners of market and war on cash. Playing a bear against central banks may be very hard, on the other hand, prolonging this bingeing on QE-driven bubbles equals meeting a wall sooner or later. Especially that smart money is already evacuating http://independenttrader.org/is-time-to-short-already-here.html Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:20 | 7484790 remain calm Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:42 | 7484928 Peconic Bay I've done Facebook advertising for our small business for several months. It didn't produce any sales...Zero!  I don't know anyone that looks at Facebook ads on their mobile device.  Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:18 | 7484772 NDXTrader How can they report that 1 out of 7 people on the planet is an ADU with a straight face? That is just laughable. That said, there is something fitting about the greatest destroyer of productivity invented since porn leading us higher during these times Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:18 | 7484776 NoDebt Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:25 | 7484824 silverer How come it hasn't helped the plight of the planet?  Nothing has changed, except people can sit on their ass instead of going themselves to actually see, meet, and talk to their friends for real.  Phone in the face planet is where we landed.

It's more like you're trying to make the world more indoctrinated and controlled. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:34 | 7484884 NoDebt I wonder what happens to people like us who really don't WANT to be more open and connect with others through "social media"? Is it like when I told my kids their old cat went to live out his days on a nice farm in the countryside?  I bet it is. Every article I've seen lately is how people are abandoning Facebook in droves. The anti-social media backlash has begun and people just don;t give a shit anymore. Facebook counts the installed applications on your phone as an active user even if you don't log in or even have an account. Take a look at the full installed apps sometime. there are a dozen different Facebook applications you need to uninstall or deactivate. Fuckerberg couldn't tell a half truth if his life depended on it. The sociopathic fuck lives so far outside reality that he probably thinks unicorns are real. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:26 | 7484833 Hal n back I'm not doing my part, even though I get several e mails a day from FB telling me I have notifications and friend requests. Cannot be a part of a system where some people tell you when they go to bathroom and brag about where they have dinner. Not sure wtf advertisers target a segment where the biggest users are life underachievers and the others who take part are too busy living life  to look at ads.  i do not believe there are 1.09Billion people onthe planet who use FB each day.  if you are counting everytime someone checks in perhaps there are a billion 'hits' to FB. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:33 | 7484880 buzzsaw99 there are millions of accounts set up for the sole purpose of generating billions of hits to other facebook accounts. of course it's bullshit.

Wed, 04/27/2016 - 18:02 | 7485291 Esso Everythime I check it out, I'm sold on the fact that there are a lot of braindead idiots out there Yeah, that's it Mark.  Altruistic.  It has nothing to do with having people voluntarily give you all their personal information for free so you can sell it to advertisers, government agencies, whoever to make billions. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 16:47 | 7484942 fed_depression Isnt this a fucking of Class A and B shareholders? As I read this this is a conversion from Class A and B to C. Meaning no dividend and no voting rights No, it is a method of diluting the economic value of Zuk's voting shares by transferring that economic value to the new, non- voting "C" shares he will receive as a stock dividend, which he can then transfer to his Chan Zukerberg foundation without transferring any voting control. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 17:10 | 7485036 PPT Inc. They are fake-counting "Users"- they claim you visit the page if you receive a notification on your phone, even if you are asleep. They claim 10% growth over 2 years in US/Can when the kids aren't even on FB anymore. Does anyone really believe that around one in three smartphone owners check Facebook EVERY DAY? I doubt one in three smartphone owners even have Facebook app installed or check it on browser EVERY DAY. OK, some people will check on their laptop/tablet/computer at work, but do those same people not use a smartphone to check FB?
