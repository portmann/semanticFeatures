RBC Capital Markets restates Sector perform rating on Twitter - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Jul 22 2016, 17:04 ET | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney issued the note with a $20 price target. Cites multi-platform unique visitor deceleration, a 14% Y/Y total minute per unique visitor decline, further MAU and ad revenue (approximately 90% of total revenue) growth deceleration and immaterial product updates over the past quarter. In Q1 2016 Twitter ( TWTR ) made $1.71 per MAU vs. $3.21 for Facebook. Mahaney forecasts 17% and 33% Y/Y growth in these numbers for Twitter and Facebook, respectively. This call will define Twitter for the next two quarters. I expect a stellar earnings call with a super positive outlook. Wednesday morning the stock will open above $19 I'm my opinion. if it does I'll be purchasing a new Twitter blue BMW. if not I'll need a new laptop because I'll trow it out the window and I'll take a conservative approach to trading the next year and a half. let's go!!!!
