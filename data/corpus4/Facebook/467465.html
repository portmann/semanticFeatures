Reports: Verizon to announce $4.8B deal for Yahoo before open - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jul 24 2016, 14:53 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is set to pay $4.8B to acquire Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) in a deal that is likely to be announced before the market opens Monday, according to Bloomberg. As reported in the past few days, the deal will include core Internet assets as well as Yahoo's real estate, though some intellectual property will be sold separately. After those sales, Yahoo would hold its stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Group (combined value of about $40B). Verizon's expected to keep its new purchase relatively intact in a bid to combine it with AOL and compete with Google and Facebook in digital ads "by tapping into users on sites like Yahoo Finance," Bloomberg notes. Previously: Verizon's Yahoo interest includes real estate, not IP; Munster: 'Great outcome' (Jul. 22 2016) Previously: Verizon reported to be close to landing Yahoo (Jul. 22 2016) How much is MM getting paid for this? Cause it feels like it was her and the board's priority all this while. Verizon bought AOL and Yahoo for the purpose of building a network to generate ad revenue. Its not as stupid as it sounds. There are ~1 Billion shares so ~$4.80.  Yahoo still keeps its $40 Billion in pre-tax stock in Yahoo Japan and BABA plus ~$6 Billion in cash. Better than the $2-3 billion that had been reported earlier in the bidding process. I guess that should be good news. I also don't like the new Yahoo finance format, it's slow and not easy to use. Thought I was the only one don't like it. I stopped using Yahoo Finance, in fact I no longer use Yahoo at all, with the adoption of the new social media format on the Finance page. The new format does not have enough information on one page to make it useful any longer. Wait and see. I am pretty sure you will be hugely disappointed, as your target price is one-way-street day-dreaming price that only those dishonest sell-side analysts will try to spin to the schmuck retail investors. I would hope one of the first things VZ does us change  the finance web page back to what it was before the "upgrade " Yahoo was fourth or fifth best in everything it tried to do in the past 10 years, all because they thought they knew better than their subscribers. Twenty years ago they were first or second in everything, then they stopped caring; robots took over the chatrooms, spam took over the mail, trolls took over the finance boards, they bought and vandalised flickr... all huge errors of their own making. Maybe Verizon can put in a proper MANAGER to fix things. It can still have a future if it just delivers on its services as the members expect. Or maybe it's too late, and the internet has moved on....
