Facebook Messenger Is Now Equipped With Payments: Where I Was Wrong, Right, And Way Off - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub FB has officially entered the mobile payments space via text. However, it's not a service that will directly impact PayPal, yet. Instead, WU investors should be most worried, as FB's large user base and free service could lead to a deterioration of WU's business model very quickly. Back in June of last year, I suggested that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) was preparing to take the mobile payments industry by storm following a presentation by BlackBerry's (NASDAQ: BBRY ) CEO John Chen regarding its own messaging service. Later, I concluded that Facebook would in fact use payments as a core product for Messenger and WhatsApp, and that it could be the death of PayPal if targeted at the thousands of small- to large-sized businesses that already advertise on Facebook (allowing merchants to sell directly to consumers on Facebook). However, now that Facebook has officially added payment services to its messaging apps, it is clear that I was way wrong about which company would be most affected by Facebook's payment presence. Just to be clear, no one knows exactly what Facebook's payment services will become. In the past, I have suggested that Facebook might become a payment processor like MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), maybe even a full blown bank, and would certainly allow for the purchase and sale of goods through its platform. But for the time being, Facebook is only allowing users to send and receive money between friends/family by using its PC and mobile Messenger app, which reportedly has 700 million users. For example, a parent can now use their debit card to send money to children in college, who can then retrieve those funds for use. A person can send money to another Facebook user regardless of the reason, just tap the $ icon and click "Pay." So, this of course affects eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY ) PayPal, as many of its 160 million-plus users certainly use PayPal to transfer funds back and forth. However, the main purpose of PayPal is for paying and retrieving funds for the purchase and sale of goods. Therefore, Facebook's initial services with Messenger won't really affect PayPal all that much. Instead, this looks like a much bigger problem for Western Union (NYSE: WU ), whose core business is sending and receiving money between two people. Admittedly, I did not see Facebook Messenger's entrance into payments being a problem for Western Union, as I had originally thought it would be more so aimed at merchants to consumers and vice versa. However, Western Union could take a major hit from how Facebook now plans to use Messenger. And the reason is because of the number of people that use Messenger and the fact that Facebook is essentially offering the service for free, whereas Western Union charges a steep fee based on the amount sent. During the fourth quarter of last year, over $1.1 billion of Western Union's $1.4 billion in revenue came from consumer-to-consumer transactions. This is a business that Facebook is targeting directly with its Messenger payment services. Moreover, this is a business with an operating margin of 20%, which may not be sustainable now that Facebook allows users to send and receive money for free (or a very small fee). Lastly, Facebook is directly targeting the dot-com and mobile side of consumer-to-consumer payments. This is Western Union's fastest growing segment. In fact, it is one of the very few growth drivers that Western Union has within its business. During the last quarter, WesternUnion.com's revenue and transaction growth increased 34% and 64%, respectively. This is an area that could be significantly affected by Facebook's new service. All things considered, I was certainly wrong about Facebook Messenger's payment services being an immediate threat to PayPal, as that doesn't seem to be a near-term goal for the company. Also, I completely missed the effect that Facebook Messenger could have on Western Union. However, I was right that payments is in fact a part of Facebook's future, and won't be surprised to see this service evolve in the coming quarters and years to where it becomes a meaningful part of the company's growth outlook. While investors shouldn't expect any meaningful revenues or profits from Messenger in the immediate future, it doesn't mean that Facebook won't soon begin to charge higher fees once users become comfortable with the service. At that point, Facebook could begin to charge a per-transaction fee like PayPal and Western Union, and even expand with WhatsApp by allowing instant currency exchange via text due to WhatsApp's large global user base. In essence, the sky's the limit, and that's something that should make Facebook investors very bullish long term.
