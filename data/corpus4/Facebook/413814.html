Eye On Tech: Apple Reportedly Preps A 'Pro' iPhone And New MacBooks - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Apple Inc.

Also covered: eBay's purchase of an international ticket marketplace, Facebook's purchase of a VR audio startup, and Facebook's latest enhancements to its Live video platform. Netflix's Disney movie deal, Spotify's 2015 sales, and a Computer Sciences acquisition also receive attention. Report: Apple orders more iPhone 7 units than expected, plans "Pro" iPhone 7 model - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) gained following a report from Taiwan's Economic Daily News stating the company has ordered 72-78M iPhone 7 units for 2016 (more than an expected ~65M), as did Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS ), Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ), TSMC (NYSE: TSM ), and other suppliers. Production orders, of course, aren't the same as end-user sales - in the past, Apple has often increased or decreased its original iPhone orders in response to demand. But the report does suggest Apple is optimistic about the iPhone 7's reception. And that can't help but go over well with the stock below $100 amid iPhone 6S sales pressures and fears the iPhone 7 won't spark strong upgrade activity among iPhone 6 owners. The report also stated Apple plans to offer a "Pro" or "Premium" iPhone 7 model - the former name would make more sense, given the existence of iPad and MacBook Pro lines - to complement the iPhone 7 and 7+. An Apple Pencil stylus and a Smart Connector (both are supported by the iPad Pro line) would be natural fits for an iPhone Pro; the S Pen stylus has long been a staple of Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy Note line. Leaked schematics suggest the iPhone 7+ will have a dual-camera array, and the iPhone 7 won't - Schematic images from a Chinese forum indicate the iPhone 7+ has a dual-camera array (can both improve image quality and give users more ability to manipulate a photo), but not the smaller iPhone 7. This fits with what was previously reported by KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, and would represent a notable departure from Apple's approach with the 6/6+ and 6S/6S+, in which the 4.7" models are virtually identical to the 5.5" models outside of display size. Apple has been charging $100 more for iPhone 6+/6S+ models relative to 6/6S models sporting the same amount of storage. Thus, giving the 7+ a more advanced camera than the 7 could help boost iPhone ASPs, albeit while carrying the risk of upsetting iPhone users who prefer a smaller phone. There are some parallels to be drawn with the 4" iPhone SE, which (outside of display size) has many of the same features as the 6S/6S+, but lacks 3D Touch support. One has to think an iPhone Pro (assuming it arrives) would also feature a dual-camera array. KGI Securities: MacBook Pros featuring a fingerprint reader and an OLED "touch bar" are due in Q4 - In his latest scoop, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo reports Apple plans to launch MacBook Pro models sporting a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and an "OLED display touch bar" (separate from the main display) that would replace the function keys located above the notebook's QWERTY keyboard. In line with past MacBook overhauls, the new MacBook Pros are expected to be thinner than their predecessors. They're also expected to support reversible USB Type-C ports and high-speed Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple refreshed its 12" retina MacBooks in April. Overall, Macs accounted for 10% of the company's calendar Q1 revenue. eBay's StubHub buys European/Latin ticket marketplace Ticketbis for a reported $165M - Ticketbis is based out of Bilbao, Spain, and is present in 47 markets. TechCrunch reports eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) is paying $165M for the company (presumably with offshore cash). eBay declares the purchase will significantly increase StubHub's international footprint - the site has launched in the U.K., Germany, and Mexico in recent years, but remains very dependent on the U.S. StubHub has been a bright spot for eBay, as the company's core Marketplace unit continues ceding ground to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). The company's StubHub revenue rose 34% Y/Y in Q1 to $177M, with GMV rising 29% to $869M. Facebook buys VR audio software/technology firm Two Big Ears to strengthen Oculus - Two Big Ears provides software tools, encoders, and rendering engines for creating spatial audio for VR content, as well as for providing 3D audio for games in general. The company will work with Oculus to "create best-in-class VR audio." This is the latest in a string of technology-related acquisitions Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has made on Oculus' behalf since buying the VR hardware/software developer for $2B in 2014, as the company tries to differentiate Oculus' hardware and software in a market featuring Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and HTC ( OTC:HTCXF ) on the high end, and Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) new Daydream VR platform on the low end. Mark Zuckerberg has said Facebook is "mostly interested in the software" when it comes to VR, and suggested it's willing to let third parties develop high-end VR headsets similar to the Oculus Rift in the long term. Facebook removes 90-minute restriction for live video , creates "engagement graph" that helps users skip ahead to interesting parts - Facebook's big April overhaul of its Live streaming service drove home just how important it considers live video to be, as did the company's aggressive efforts to promote Live to its users (both through the news feed and via notifications) and its willingness to pay media firms to use Live. Monday's announcements show that Live very much remains an engineering priority: Streams can now run perpetually (provided a user is fine with the stream not being saved/recorded), and an "engagement graph" that tracks likes and comments can be overlaid on a recorded stream, thus helping users figure out the more interesting parts of a stream (and skip ahead to them). Perpetual streams mesh well with Facebook's efforts to support streams recorded with professional video hardware (rather than just smartphones), and the engagement graph targets the 2/3rd of Live watch time that involves recorded content. Your move, Periscope . Netflix provides ETA for Disney exclusivity, receives positive survey data - Thanks to its major 2012 deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) "will become the exclusive U.S. pay-TV home of the latest films from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar" starting in September. The deal, which was doubtlessly expensive, highlights Netflix's growing willingness to sacrifice library depth in order to enable unmatched investments in hit movie/TV titles and original content. The company's streaming content obligations totaled $12.3B as of Q1, up from $9.8B a year ago. Separately, an RBC survey of U.S. Netflix users found 66% are "extremely" or "very" satisfied, and (though price hikes just went into effect for many) 89% are "not at all likely" or "slightly likely" to churn. An RBC French/German survey found 16% saying of respondents saying they use Netflix (up from 5%/4% in December 2014), and a Piper survey of Brazilian and Mexican web users found "awareness of Netflix, as well as intent to subscribe, is high." The U.S. figures suggest Netflix still has a fair amount of headroom to hike prices over the long run... at least as long as its big content investments continue. Computer Sciences buys European ServiceNow integrator Aspediens - Like U.S.-based Fruition Partners (acquired by CSC last year ), Aspediens helps companies implement top cloud IT service management software firm ServiceNow's (NYSE: NOW ) offerings. Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC ) says the deal "cements CSC's position as the number one ServiceNow integrator in the world." Like IT consulting/outsourcing peers, CSC's sales have been pressured by cloud software and infrastructure adoption, and the company has been turning to M&A to grow its cloud exposure. Last September, Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) bought cloud advisory/services firm Cloud Sherpas , and IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) bought Workday (NYSE: WDAY ) integrator Meteorix . Spotify had 2015 revenue of $2.2B, net loss of $194M - As Pandora (NYSE: P ) can vouch for, making money from web music services isn't easy, given the huge royalties owed to music labels and publishers. A financial filing states Spotify's (Private: MUSIC ) revenue rose 80% Y/Y in Q1 to â‚¬1.95B ($2.2B), but adds its net loss nonetheless grew to â‚¬173.1M ($194M) from â‚¬162.3M. Gross margin was just 16.5%, thanks in large part to royalty expenses. Spotify disclosed in March it had topped 30M paid subscribers. WSJ: Tencent in talks to buy SoftBank's 73% stake in Finnish mobile game developer Supercell - Supercell, developer of Clash of Clans and other hit mobile games, was reportedly valued at $5.25B last year. A Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) purchase of SoftBank's ( OTCPK:SFTBF ) stake would suggest the Chinese messaging/gaming giant is getting more aggressive in growing its overseas footprint as it contends with Chinese macro pressures . The company's online gaming revenue (responsible for over half of all revenue) rose 28% Y/Y in Q1, and its ad revenue grew 73%.
