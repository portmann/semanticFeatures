Verizon Is Positioned For Long-Term Growth; Low-Yield Environment Provides Near-Term Support - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Low-yield environment continues to provide support for Verizon stock. Verizon's recent increase in data plan is a testament of its network quality compared with that of T-Mobile. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) recently reshuffled its data plan to better compete against Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ). I consider this to be a move that leverages its network quality and to regain its pricing power. Because of the fact that we are still in a low yield environment, stocks like Verizon will continue to get support from fund flows and I would be a near-term buyer of the stock. Long-term speaking, Verizon continues to have a lot of good assets to work with, such as AOL. I think many investors forget about the value of AOL, its portfolio of brands and ad technology that will position Verizon in the digital age. Relative to AT&T (NYSE: T ) and even Canadian telecom providers such as Bell (NYSE: BCE ), Rogers (NYSE: RCI ) and Telus (NYSE: TU ), Verizon's AOL asset is very attractive in digital ad and ad tech, which is why I believe that Verizon is a long-term buy. Contrary to the prior strategy of waging an expensive price war against T-Mobile, Verizon is now raising prices in what I think is a testament of its network quality. On average Verizon is raising its prices by 13% and about 35% on monthly data allowance. The plan will be labeled S, M, L, XL and XXL, and will each see a 1GB increase in data and $5 increase in prices. There will also be a "Safety Mode" that throttle data that prevents overage and "Carryover Data" that allow customers to rollover data similar to T-Mobile's Data Stash. This plan is an improvement to Verizon's prior plans not only because of higher pricing and increased data allowance but also it positions Verizon more reasonably against T-Mobile and allows Verizon to leverage its network quality rather than price to compete. Another thing worth mentioning is that AOL remains an important asset for Verizon. Although it is small within Verizon's total business, it is still a fundamental part of Verizon's content strategy. Worth recalling that AOL continues to have a robust set of portfolio brands such as Complex Media, Huffington Post, Engadget, Moviefone, Autoblog and so forth, and these brands could lead to long-term monetization once Verizon ramps up its content distribution. In addition, AOL continues to focus on innovation such as the NFL and the NBA partnership that will have content delivered via Go90 and several virtual reality experience delivered via Engadget and Autoblog. In an age of Facebook and Twitter, I think it is easy for investors to forget about how AOL remains very much relevant and continues to be part of our daily lives even when the products we use does not have an AOL brand attached to it. When we compare the content in Verizon relative to AT&T and the Canadian telecom providers, Verizon has an edge over AT&T and years ahead of the Canadians because Canadian telecom providers do not own many unique contents (their bestselling contents are all from the US). Finally, at-tech is another important asset that Verizon has, given how mobile ad spend grew 165% in the past three years and over 80% of US mobile uses check their phones on a daily basis. The increased reliance on mobile is a positive for the ad tech market and Verizon is well positioned for this given its ad-tech platform. By 2020, the mobile ad market could hit $100bn and if AOL were to take 5% of the market then Verizon could see an additional $5bn in annual revenue, which is quite significant given how little it is contributing right now.
