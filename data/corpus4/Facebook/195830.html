Facebook's 'Like' button set to get more emotive | Reuters Like it or not, Facebook Inc's (FB.O) trademark "Like" button is set to get more expressive. The social network said on Thursday it is launching a pilot test of "Reactions", which will allow users to express a range of emotions including love, happiness, anger and sadness. "Dislike" is not one of them though. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month the social network was working on adding a button other than "Like" to express empathy on posts where a "Like" would not be the appropriate response. In a video accompanying a Facebook post by Chief Product Officer Chris Cox on Thursday, the six new buttons appear as animated emoticons and pop up when the "Like" button is long-pressed.

Cox clarified that the button was not a "dislike" button. "As you can see, it's not a "dislike" button, though we hope it addresses the spirit of this request more broadly." Zuckerberg's comments last month prompted contrasting opinions over the potential "dislike" button. While some said they would use Facebook more if a dislike button were introduced, others said it would lead to cyberbullying and more negativity on the site.
