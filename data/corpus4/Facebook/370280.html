Facebook is reportedly in talks with the National Football League to score streaming rights to â€œThursday Night Football,â€? along with others in the tech world. Dan Rose, Facebookâ€™s vice president of partnerships, recently confirmed the social networkâ€™s interest in partnering up with the NFL to Variety . â€œWeâ€™re talking to a lot of folks about live (video). There are a ton of types of content that can fit under this format,â€? Rose said. The NFL said in a statement that itâ€™s expecting to reach a deal for over-the-top streaming rights soon, but didnâ€™t name any bidders. It could be a win-win for both sides: Facebook â€” or whoever wins the rights â€” gets people interacting and talking about a shared experience using its platform. In the meantime, the NFL could stir up competition for the rights and thus, command higher prices, one research expert explains to the Los Angeles Times . “The more customers, the higher price the NFL can command,” Brett Sappington, director of research at Parks Associates told the LAT. “For Facebook, the NFL would drive huge volumes of consumption to get advertising and data. Facebook has to remain relevant. With other social media platforms emerging, Facebook has to push the envelope.” Facebook reportedly in talks to stream NFL’s ‘Thursday Night Football’ games [Variety] NBC To Get In On That Thursday Night Football Lovin’ NFL Suspending TV Blackout Rule For 2015 Season Previous Operation That Illegally Debited Consumers’ Bank Accounts Must Repay $43M Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
