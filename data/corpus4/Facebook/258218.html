Apple: The Android/iOS Struggle, Revisited - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha This article updates metrics used to measure the struggle between Android and iOS. This is relevant to establish if Android will build enough of a usage advantage - it might challenge iOS and Apple for development resources. In early 2015, I wrote an article titled " Apple: More Data On The iOS/Android Struggle ." In that article, I covered how Android was still gaining on iOS in many different metrics. In most of these metrics, Android was still behind iOS, and the then recently-launched iPhone 6 gave people hope that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could keep Android gains in check. This article tries to provide an update on what was discussed at the time and see how things evolved in the following 10 months. When I wrote my previous article, Apple had just launched the iPhone 6 to great success. The iPhone 6 interrupted Android's massive market share gain due to large pent-up demand for an iPhone with a larger display. Today, we can see how things evolved since the iPhone 6 launch. What we observe is something along the following lines: (Source: IDC I , II , III , IV , V ) As we can see, the iPhone 6 allowed Apple to reverse the market share loss for the entire year. However, its market share gains have been eroding, and by Q4 2015 or Q1 2016, they seem likely to stagnate again. The year-on-year comparisons are needed because Apple's share is seasonal, usually peaking in the quarter after the launch of new models. In my previous article, we saw how Android had caught up with iOS in web usage. This is obviously driven by international gains. How have things evolved since then with the iPhone 6 launch? This validates my thesis from the previous article that Android has become much more usable, so Android's massive share led to web usage gains even though Apple narrowed its market share deficit. This also is set to continue, especially as Apple's market share gains stagnate. One item where Apple still had a lead when I wrote my previous article was in e-commerce usage as measured by IBM. It should be noted that these studies by IBM refer to the U.S. market only. And in the U.S. market, Apple still leads the smartphone wars. (Source: IBM Commerce, " U.S. Retail - Black Friday Report 2015 ") What we see here is that Android's gains stagnated in what regards mobile usage for e-commerce in the U.S., but they continued in regard to actual sales. This in part was due to Android also gaining in terms of average order value. As I said, this impacts the U.S. market, where Apple is particularly strong and in the context of the iPhone 6. Hence the ability to still keep Android in check in terms of usage for e-commerce, though with a further erosion in relative online sales. With Apple's market share stagnation predicted for H1 2016, I expect Android to erode Apple's advantage further in this regard as well. This also will be helped by a new generation of Android devices which: Will gain from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 as well as competing lower-priced offerings from Huawei and MediaTek. This will be in stark contrast to 2015, where Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stumbled with the Snapdragon 810, leaving Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) as the only supplier with a "modern" SoC. Samsung pushing the envelope in design (starting with the Galaxy S6), which will force other Android smartphone makers to respond in kind. This will make the entire Android flagship space more competitive design wise. Also, Samsung seems likely to mend its hand regarding the microSD card capability on the Samsung S7. Will gain from entering the market at a lower price point right at launch. This already is seen in Motorola's latest flagship as well as the two new Nexus Phones. This is likely to spread to others in the space, instead of firstly trying to match Apple on price. A similar effect took place in the tablet space and marked the start of the iPad's stagnation. The trends which were in place when I published my previous article on the Android/iOS struggle remain in place. Apple retook some global smartphone market share from Android with the launch of the iPhone 6, but those gains are already stagnating again. This, together with my prediction that the iPhone should start shrinking in Q1 2016 (Q2 FY2016 for Apple), leads me to believe that pretty soon Apple will be losing share again. The trend regarding actual web usage has now turned powerfully in Android's favor, with Android's share now being 1.6x larger than iOS' share. This large relative loss for Apple is happening mostly outside the U.S. so it might not be immediately evident for investors, but it's a clear reality. This change is borne both of Android's massive lead in overall market share and the fact that Android is increasingly usable even in low- to mid-end phones, so the overall market share is being turned into an usage advantage. Over time, if Android gets enough of a usage advantage, this will turn into more development resources being allocated to Android - which could replicate the PC/Mac problem for Apple. This can start being seen for businesses whose main priority is reach instead of ultimate buying power. An example here would be Facebook, which already has specialized apps just for Android. In the U.S., Apple still leads in e-commerce usage, but the lead continues to shrink even with the iPhone 6's success. The iPhone 6s seems unlikely to reverse that trend. This particular risk remains a reality for Apple. Indeed, it's likely that Apple stock will underperform over the next six months due to the iPhone likely stagnating or shrinking over the next six months.
