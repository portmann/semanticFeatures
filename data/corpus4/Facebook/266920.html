To hail a ride inside the app, users have to download the latest version of Messenger. When you’re in a conversation with a friend, you can then tap the “more” menu and select Transportation. Users can also search for Uber and tap the car icon to request a ride. All updates regarding the driver’s status will then appear within Messenger, you’ll be able to pay for the ride, and your friends will be notified that you’ve called a ride. Ostensibly, this just means the friends you’re in the conversation with, and not all your Facebook friends in general. To encourage Messenger users to get onboard with the in-app travel tool, Facebook is offering the first ride for free (for a limited time, up to $20) with Uber. You’ll have to claim your free ride by linking your existing Uber account to Messenger, or setting up a new account inside Messenger and requesting a ride. Facebook says it’s currently testing the service with select users in locations where Uber operates, and that other countries and more transportation partners will also be included in the future.
