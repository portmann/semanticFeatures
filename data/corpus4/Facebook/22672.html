Judge Rules: Woman Can Serve Elusive Husband Divorce Papers Via Facebook Message â€“ Consumerist The times, they are completely and totally changing: Used to be serving someone with divorce papers required some sort of face-to-face interaction, which can be difficult if the other party gets squirrelly and tries to avoid the encounter. But now it seems repeatedly pinging someone’s Facebook inbox will do just as well. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper ruled that a Brooklyn woman can use social media to make sure her former beloved knows he’s getting the ax, reports the New York Daily News . He ruled that she “is granted permission serve defendant with the divorce summons using a private message through Facebook,” with the help of her lawyer through her account. with her lawyer messaging Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku through her account, Cooper wrote. â€œThis transmittal shall be repeated by plaintiffâ€™s attorney to defendant once a week for three consecutive weeks or until acknowledgedâ€? by her husband, who seems to have no fixed address and isn’t the easiest to nail down. He’s only been keeping in touch with his wife by phone and Facebook, and apparently doesn’t want a divorce. The â€œlast address plaintiff has for defendant is an apartment that he vacated in 2011,â€? the judge noted, adding that the woman “has spoken with defendant by telephone on occasion and he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment. He has also refused to make himself available to be served with divorce papers.â€? Even the post office had no forwarding address for him, he has no billing address listed on his prepaid cell phone account and he might as well not exist to the Department of Motor Vehicles. He got his first divorce papers message last week.
