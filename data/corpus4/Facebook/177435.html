Facebook Is Not Good Value: Challenges Of Slowed Earnings Growth And Expansion Into Emerging Markets - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook will be able to successfully expand into emerging markets, but faces the threat of decreased revenue per user. Facebook's earnings growth has consistently declined since 2013, and most recently the company had negative earnings growth. While Facebook will have a favorable future and successful expansion, it seems clear that the company its overvalued, and will not experience the same growth it experienced in the past. Beyond being incredibly overvalued, I believe that Facebook has a flurry of challenges in achieving growth ahead of it, and it is best for investors to avoid this stock. The following factors lead me to be bearish on Facebook: The social media industry can certainly be classified as being in a bubble , and a look at Facebook's most recent earnings reveals that its growth has begun to slow substantially. Facebook already has a strong domestic presence, with not much room for growth. A high P/E is certainly justifiable if there is high projected growth ahead, but this is not the case for Facebook. My call may be premature, as the stock price could still rise, but I assert that Facebook is not good value, and the growth ahead is not strong enough to justify its current valuation. Facebook's stock price has experienced a consistent upward ascent, which is becoming less and less logical, considering the consistent decrease in earnings growth. Growth in EPS has been decreasing substantially since 2013. The company's EPS grew by the following amounts, when compared to the period 6 months before: The continuous trend of decreased earnings growth, coupled with the most recent decline in earnings, necessitates caution, and a shift from a bullish to bearish view of the company's upside potential. FB PE Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts A recent rise in valuation can be seen, as a result of the newly experienced decrease in earnings, which has resulted in increased valuation this year. Realistically, valuation can go much higher, and its stocks price can continue to go higher, even if earnings continue to decline. However, it certainly needs to be noted that Facebook is not delivering on earnings growth, as it most recently had a decline in earnings of 9.1% . This new phenomenon is merely a warning sign, and indication that Facebook is not good value. A further look at Facebook's challenges that it will face entering emerging markets further warrants a bearish sentiment of this company. Facebook is currently being used by over half of the world's population that has access to internet, currently having approximately 1.5 billion users. Its financial success is based on the United States and Canada, which already account for approximately 46% of its revenue . Naturally, there is not much room for growth in this area, which leads Facebook to have to turn to other markets. Facebook's success in emerging markets can be considered a next crucial step, yet there are significant restraints to this being a positive driver for further revenue and earnings growth. During 2014, the average revenue per user in the United States and Canada was $7.17, compared to the collective average of $2.36. Furthermore, another significant concern is that revenue per user from Asia Pacific users averages at only $1.12. Therefore, the implications of diminishing marginal returns on earnings, solely based on revenue per user, is very clear. Facebook's ability to tap into Asia, much of which is emerging, has been very impressive. I lived in a village in India, and practically everyone used Facebook on their mobile phones, yet every house did not have running water, and homes only had electricity for 2-4 hours a day. This is a success story, but the low revenue per user is Asia Pacific is an obvious thorn. What of Facebook's expansion into Africa? Senegal, one country I am extremely optimistic about, will not be emerging until 2035, according to projections made by the World Bank. A quick glance at the small percentage of the population that uses facebook in Africa is extremely disappointing. Facebook must therefore await for this growth, while leveraging off of its success in domestic markets. However, there is obviously not much room for domestic user growth, and Facebook's only hope is increasing its revenue per user. The lack of opportunity for growth in its domestic market provides a clear explanation of the company's consistent decline in earnings growth since 2012. Over time, Facebook will surely be able to successfully expand into current frontier markets, but the timeframe and implications for earnings growth are severely disappointing. While I believe Facebook will be extremely successfully in its endeavors to expand internationally, it seems clear that there are very high challenges for the company to continue delivering the same earnings growth. Therefore, 2013-early 2015 seems to be the clear success story, while the future of Facebook's stock price looks less favorable. It is clear that Facebook's earnings have consistently been declining, and that there is not much hope for the company to experience similar growth that it had between 2013 and early 2015. The stock price will most likely continue to go up, based on optimistic sentiment, but it is clearly not good value. A historical look at valuation does prove that the stock is not at its highest point of valuation, yet now is an excellent time to really begin to be skeptical of the company's continued upside potential.
