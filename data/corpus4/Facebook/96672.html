HBO offers premiere episodes of two series on Facebook | Reuters Television network HBO said it would offer the premiere episodes of two new comedy series on Facebook, underlining the growing popularity of the social networking site as a video platform. The popularity of web videos have led to U.S. networks experiment with new platforms to attract new viewers. With about 1.44 billion monthly active users, Facebook has become a sough-after outlet for companies looking to market their products via online videos, the fastest growing category of Internet ads. Last week, Amazon.com Inc released the pilot episode of its show "Catastrophe" for a limited time on the social media network, instead of its own Prime Instant Video streaming service. HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc, said on Wednesday viewers would be able to access the premiere episodes of Dwayne Johnson-starrer "Ballers" and "The Brink" on Facebook for a limited period. The two new original series premiered on Sunday. Turner Broadcasting, another Time Warner network, said in April it granted exclusive video-on-demand rights to its Cartoon Network and Adult Swim programs to video streaming service Hulu. On Tuesday Hulu said it would soon allow users to add CBS Corp's TV network Showtime to their subscriptions.
