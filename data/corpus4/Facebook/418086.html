Does Facebook Have A Snapchat Problem? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha When I invested in Facebook, I promised myself I would monitor the platform very closely to avoid a MySpace repeat. When I first noticed Facebook showing signs of fatigue among younger users, I was not worried because Instagram was extremely popular with this demographic. Snapchat has recently overtaken Instagram as the most popular app amongst teens, and this should be very alarming to investors. However, I believe Facebook has diversified itself adequately and Mark Zuckerberg will continue to demonstrate his exceptional leadership and foresight. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) competitor Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) is firing on all cylinders. The younger social media platform recently raised $1.81 billion dollars for its quest to overthrow the current social media king. This latest funding raises its valuation from $16 billion to $17.81 billion. Its user base is growing at a healthy clip, adding approximately 133,000 users each day. Lastly, revenues are exploding. In 2014, Snapchat produced $3.1 million in 2014. The following year, revenues were $59 million. Analysts are predicting anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion in revenues for 2017. The revenue projection is eerily similar to Facebook in its early days, as pointed out by Business Insider. For a while, Snapchat was primarily for teenagers and refrained from stepping on Facebook's turf all that much. Even so, Instagram kept the former at bay by claiming the #1 spot for social network used by teens. Just this spring, Snapchat has officially wrestled that spot from Instagram. Additionally, Snapchat's user base is no longer contained to teens, and has seen people from all demographics join the network. Back in November, it was announced that Snapchat was garnering 8 billion video views a day, the same as Facebook. (That number has now been increased by Snapchat to over 10 billion.) Even though the videos are considerably shorter, this is still incredibly impressive seeing that Snapchat has around 1/10 the DAU's as Facebook. Alright, enough with the negatives. Facebook has a couple of things going for it that Snapchat specifically does not. First, there are substantially more companies on Facebook than Snapchat, and the site is better suited for companies to host a page, which is usually the first step to converting that company into a paying advertiser. Secondly, Facebook contains a treasure trove of data on its users. This data can be used to hyper-focus ad campaigns to make sure they're viewed by the intended audience. This second factor will be a large advantage to Facebook when vying for digital ad dollars. The most successful digital ad campaigns highlight their ability to target and retarget segments of the population. Lastly, if live video takes off as Facebook imagines, Snapchat will have to play catch-up in developing an equally impressive feature to engage its users. Mark Zuckerberg has not been sitting on the sidelines while Snapchat's rise was occurring. In fact, he had the foresight to try to buy Snapchat in 2013 when it barely had any revenues and a modest user base. Facebook has invested heavily in its video offerings, brought live video online, and increased the length of its Instagram video time restrictions. Outside of Facebook and Instagram, Facebook has nicely diversified itself. It owns WhatsApp, one of the largest messaging platforms in the world. Moreover, Facebook could have a huge hardware and software business if the Oculus Rift works its way into hundreds of possible applications . Facebook has more than just its core platform and Instagram. However, these are the only two segments generating a profit at the moment. To an extent, digital ad dollars are limited, which means Snapchat could begin to eat away at Facebook and Instagram's revenues. This makes Facebook's newer investments, such as the Oculus Rift and WhatsApp, all that more important. I believe in Mark Zuckerberg's ability to navigate his company through hardships, but I urge investors to closely monitor Snapchat's ever-growing challenge to Facebook.
