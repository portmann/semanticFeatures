More Evidence That Uber Is A Money Loser (And A Unicorn Bubble Bellwether) - Uber (Pending:UBER) | Seeking Alpha Uber is burning hundreds of millions of dollars per year with losses likely to accelerate. The cash burn will accelerate as Uber increases their driver subsidies to compete with other ride-sharing services. The subsidies war between competitors extends overseas where in 2015 alone Uber plans to spend a billion dollars on their China expansion against aggressive Chinese competitors like Didi Kauidi. We are skeptical that Uber can use this growth strategy to gain an insurmountable advantage in the ride-sharing industry like their valuation predicts. When Gawker posted internal documents that prove Uber (Pending: UBER ) is losing substantial amounts of money, this was Uber's officially provided response (in a statement to Business Insider): "Shock, horror, Uber makes a loss. This is hardly news and old news at that… It's the case of business 101: you raise money, you invest money, you grow (hopefully), you make a profit and that generates a return for investors." Yes it's old news that startups burn capital. The playbook is to grow like crazy, and figure out how to monetize later. But still: A private market startup valued at $51 billion… and still burning hundreds of millions per year… with losses likely to accelerate? We say the case for a 90% valuation decline is still well intact. Uber is spending money at a breakneck rate to crack the China market - even paying its drivers more than the fares they collect. Fat with almost $6 billion in venture capital, Uber, based in San Francisco, is doling out bonuses up to three times the amount of its fares, in a bet that its exceptional rise in the United States can be matched in China. ~ NYT, Uber spends heavily to establish itself in China Shattering prevailing assumptions, really? It's a surprise when the core strategy is "give away tons of free money?" If you opened a donut shop in China and gave away $50 with every donut, you would probably see record sales too… Uber reportedly plans to spend a billion dollars in China in 2015. Meanwhile its biggest home grown China competitor, Didi Kauidi, is also spending in the hundreds-of-millions range on driver subsidies. There is a giant subsidies war going on, fueled by an ocean of venture capital money. Uber is fascinating because it's such a bellwether for the Unicorn bubble, and thus the entire Silicon Valley bubble. Nobody knows how profitable this company will actually be. From the given reports, it sounds like Uber's cash burn is actually accelerating. They are literally "losing money on every ride… and making it up on volume." And for what? The ride-share market is tough. There are multiple competitors, both internationally and within the United States . In big markets like China, those competitors are entrenched, well-funded, and ruthless. The theory is that, if Uber expands rapidly enough, it can gain an insurmountable advantage from network effects. Get huge, then benefit from a combination of scale and lock-in, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Amazon has network effects because it first established a presence back when credit cards were a dicey proposition on the web. People came to trust Amazon as a one-stop-shop for purchases, and then a huge logistics operation got layered on top of that, turning Amazon into "the everything store" (which is still barely profitable, apart from Amazon Web Services). Google, meanwhile, has developed a permanent advantage in search engine quality, with all kinds of useful free services attached, as such that there is no reason for the world to switch, and a technology moat in that their results will continue to improve faster than anyone can keep up. And Facebook has lock-in because, when all your friends and family are on Facebook… and you have dozens of contacts on Facebook… you stick with Facebook. But where is the lock-in for a ride-sharing app? In San Francisco, most drivers work for Lyft and Uber simultaneously. Does anybody really care what ride-sharing app they use, as long as the car is clean and the app works? And what happens when the driver subsidies stop? Trying to compete on price is notoriously low on loyalty. Why shouldn't all those drivers getting subsidies switch to someone else when the gravy stops? Will they hope to pull an Amazon, and stay break-even for the next fifteen years? Will the market tolerate that, with so many ride-sharing wannabes running around? And won't the type of logistical problems Uber solves get cheaper and easier to figure out as the cost of computing power drops? Uber's $51 valuation seems an entirely made-up number, almost randomly pulled from a hat. It wasn't randomly pulled from a hat, of course, but represents the marginal extreme of what investors are willing to pay. And that's why it's such a great bellwether. At some point investors may say "This business is nowhere near as profitable as we hoped and dreamed it would be - and what's that say for all these other cash burning companies?"
