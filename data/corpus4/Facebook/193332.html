Facebook Could Surprise To Upside With Currency Tailwinds - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook should get revenue boost from favorable exchange rates in the third quarter. Fed holding off increasing interest rates will put downward pressure on dollar against major currencies. Even though in the last quarter Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) had some good numbers, the currency headwinds resulted in the company's revenue being about $330 million less than it would have been if exchange rates had remained constant against the U.S. dollar. With a growing consensus the Federal Reserve won't be raising interest rates this year, the dollar is expected to drop some against some major currencies, including the British pound and euro. The reason being the dollar was priced in higher if there was going to be an interest rate hike by the Fed. This is likely to result in better international revenue coming out of the UK and Europe, and possibly some parts of Asia. The depth of the improvement in revenue will be determined by the level of strengthening of the currencies against the dollar. It doesn't look like under this scenario emerging markets and weaker parts of Asia will see any improvement, so revenue growth there should remain subdued, with no surprises on the currency side of the performance of Facebook in those countries. Last quarter the company stated in its earnings report it would have generated another $330 million in revenue to an already impressive $4 billion in revenue if exchange rates had remained constant. That's a significant number. This isn't to say there are going to be some major surprises to the revenue upside, because Facebook is starting to work from a larger base, and that means revenue growth won't be able to keep up with past performance. Where it could make a difference is where revenue growth as measured by percentage is already priced in because of the larger base, it could boost results if major currencies in fact do improve against the U.S. dollar going forward, as they are likely to do. What this would mean in Europe is ad revenue would improve from its growth rate of 30 percent in the last quarter. The outlook by the company then was currency headwinds would continue. But that was based on the assumption the Fed would increase interest rates in the near term, which is now increasingly unlikely in the next quarter or two, if it does at all with the global economy starting to show weakness in all markets. How this should play out for Facebook will be for a weaker dollar to help increase revenue and Europe for sure, and probably some Asian countries. Some of that will depend upon whether the weakening economies trigger more easing in those countries or not, which would weaken those currencies against the dollar. As it is at this time, the U.S. dollar should weaken against major currencies, which will improve its revenue growth in Europe for sure, and possibly parts of Asia. This should help offset some of the percentage of revenue growth decline that is inevitable because of the much larger base the social network giant is working from. Management had guided for lower growth rates from these two catalysts, but it could be less of an impact than originally believed because of the probability of increased revenue coming from an improvement in exchange rates. In its recently-released Internet & Media report, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali said he also sees the dollar falling against the euro and British pound, which will help Facebook in the third quarter for sure, and in the fourth quarter as well, assuming this currency trend remains in place. Using an assumed 0.4 percent increase in major currencies against the U.S. dollar, he sees it having a positive impact on revenue of just under $10 million in the third quarter. Again, this would also be the case in the fourth quarter if currencies continue to perform as they are at this time. On the earnings per share side of things, there is unlikely to be significant impact in regard to exchange rates. The only way that would change is if the exchange rate improves so much it generates a much higher amount of revenue than being stated here. That could happen, but it's not a strong probability. Outside of Europe, international revenue growth in the third quarter was 22 percent. This is a highly volatile region, and currency values can swing wildly. Larger economies like Japan and South Korea are wild cards here, while smaller emerging market economies and China are almost certainly going to continue to experience downward pressure on their currencies. Any positive surprises here, coupled with expected strength from Europe and the UK, could result in better international revenue numbers than already expected. The problem here is we simply don't know the depth of the weakness in the global economy, or the pace of its slowdown, which is certainly happening. That's important because of the propensity for central banks to ease under these circumstances, which would significantly alter the exchange rate impact. The risk to this particular thesis is central banks around the world. I don't see it being an issue this quarter, and probably not next quarter. Data from around the world point to the global economy starting to slow down, and we're not sure if it's going to be a a small correction or a big one. Central banks, for example the ECB, has already said if the euro zone weakens, it ready to ease if it has to. All of that would be bad news for the U.S. dollar and Facebook, as it would put further pressure on revenue results. My thought at this time is this isn't going to happen in the third quarter for sure, which should be a positive catalyst for Facebook concerning revenue, and if some currencies surprise outside of Europe and the UK, revenue could come in stronger than expected. Further out this is going to be a headwind if the global economy weakens to the point where central banks around the world feel they have to pull the easing trigger. If the economy weakens to that level, it also means the Federal Reserve will put its interest rate hike on hold indefinitely. That would further strengthen the dollar at a time other currencies are weakening, which would have a strong impact on Facebook's revenue. Facebook will continue to grow revenue nicely, it's the degree of revenue and upside surprise that is probable in the short term. Further out it could struggle if it increases its ad business internationally but has it offset by weak currencies. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
