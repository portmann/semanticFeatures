Facebook's Live Celebrity Streaming Videos Will Draw In Advertising Dollars - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook will keep its live streaming feature "Live" only for celebrities for now. Having exclusivity for the service is Marketing 101 in driving interest and ad revenues. Live streaming apps like Twitter's Periscope and the independent Meerkat won't be able to market their service as well as Facebook. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has turned its sights onto the likes of Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) Periscope and the independent Meerkat by offering its own live streaming video. The new feature called "Live" has a twist - the service will only be for celebrities streaming to fans. Regular Facebook users have already asked when they will be able to stream their own videos, but Facebook won't give a definite time when that will happen. Eventually it will. I think at least in the beginning Facebook wants to stand out. Facebook's Live is not simply a "me too" move. In my view, it's strategic for Facebook. I can see how initially limiting live streaming to celebrities and public figures could immediately be coordinated with other promotions like Facebook's new product pages that can be created to cover events and ad campaigns. That has the potential to help drive revenues and keep Facebook stock going higher. It's Marketing 101 - make it exclusive and hard to get, and everyone will want it. And for diehard fans, Facebook would become a favorite place to be for seeing their favorite artists, sports players and cult personalities. Some of the first who will be able to do live streaming are Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Martha Stewart, Serena Williams and Michael Bublé. As much as Periscope and Meerkat opened up the new field, it will be some time before they can harness it to make money. Showing videos of average people might spark some interest and curiosity, yet it won't be focused enough to drive viewing traffic in a coordinated effort on a large scale at this stage. This new feature gives more marketing power to Facebook, which in turn could lead to capturing larger ad budget spends from advertisers and businesses. Live streaming by celebrities could increase Facebook's average revenue per user (ARPU) generation and user login time, two of the most important metrics that Facebook and its analysts use to judge the company's performance. Viewers may stay logged into Facebook longer to get the latest updates in NewsFeed about their favorite celebrities, or even catch a video suddenly streaming from the celebrity. User login time is now on average 46 minutes per day, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the earnings call. The greater the time logged in, the more opportunities for users to see ads, engage with businesses, and shop online with new features coming out as we speak . Average view time means activity, so increasing that time increases Facebook's potential earnings capability. Since Facebook is forecast to grow earnings in the high double digits annually, live streaming connected with ad and event promotions can help make that growth rate a reality. Facebook is trying to convince Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) huge number of businesses and video creators on YouTube to switch over to Facebook. Those advertisers will want to split their ad budget among the best advertising platforms. Facebook wants to make sure it gets the majority of that split. My take on this is if major brand businesses like cosmetics and haircare producers, which heavily use YouTube to showcase their products in short commercials or extended videos, were to link up with celebrities who live streamed on Facebook, they would want to advertise on Facebook to harness that star power for their brands. According to eMarketer , Facebook grew its net US digital display ad revenues 61% in 2014, taking the market leader position with 24% of the nationwide total. The market research firm also projects the company will continue to increase its market share over the coming years and widen the gap between it and Google, Twitter and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Live streaming will be one more weapon in its arsenal to do that. The recent flurry of new features and services from Facebook, in particular those connected with video, have made me much more bullish on the company's prospects. Investors can better understand how Facebook can create its high growth. Twitter also is planning to use its Periscope app for multimedia events as a marketing tool. However, Twitter is having difficulty revamping its product offering to make it more appealing to the mass market, while at the same time hunting for a suitably strong, new CEO to drive the messaging platform company. These distractions will allow Facebook to leapfrog ahead of Twitter and secure more ad revenue that might potentially go to its rival. Facebook is carving out its new territory and extending its social media empire. For me, that's a good growth catalyst for the stock.
