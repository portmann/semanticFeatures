Facebook And Others Favor Intel For Their Mega Server Farms - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Apr.  1, 2015  7:38 AM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: AMD , AMZN , CAVM , FB , GOOGL , MSFT , QCOM by: Alcaraz Research Facebook has again opted to use the new Intel Xeon D server processors for its server farms. Itâ€™s already 2015 but the ARMy of 64-bit server processors have yet to make any serious design wins from major data center operators. The Chipzilla, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), remains the favored processor supplier of mega server farm operators like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Unlike the 64-bit ARM-based server processors of Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Intel's x86 Xeon chips are getting big-budget design wins from major hyperscale data center operators. Chipzilla's latest low-power 14nm Xeon D System-on-Chip (SoC) is once again inside Facebook's new Yosemite server rack design. Cavium, AMD, and other ARM-based server processor vendors have yet to announce a major collaboration with Facebook. The Open Compute Project's only verified winner is Intel's Xeon D Yosemite microserver board design . Facebook's engineers still opted to use the Xeon D in spite of the touted power savings of ARM-based server processors. It is a strong hint that major server farms and data center operators rely on x86 server architecture. The mission-critical network that serves more than 1.3 billion users of Facebook is something the ARMy cannot dream of invading this year. Intel will continue to thrive in the server farms of other major data center operators like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). These firms spent decades building their x86 server architecture and have custom software running/managing their networks. Porting custom enterprise software from x86 code to ARM would not be cheap. Even cash-rich Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) (which now designs 64-bit ARM processors) would not dare abandon the x86 architecture. The Intel Xeon D-1520 and Xeon-1540 SoCs are less energy efficient than the Avoton Atom C2000 Series of processors for microservers. However, the new 45W Xeon D family offers greatly enhanced performance, which should help Facebook meet its growing server load. The issue of the higher power consumption made by Xeon server-class chips is not a priority. Performance and 24/7 reliability is always the top priority of IT administrators. The obvious risk is that Facebook's advertising cash cow will die if its global network goes offline due to probable errors from x86 code being ported to ARM-based microservers. The energy efficiency of ARM-based processors is a weak reason to buy them. Server farms and data centers are tapping solar power to feed the hunger of their servers. Google is also using wind power for its server farms in Europe. My point is that existing users of Intel Xeon server processors will continue to use them because they are reliable and proven moneymakers. Fifty data centers and firms have signed up to use the new Xeon D server processors. On a performance per watt basis, these 50 server farm operators apparently still believe that Intel's low-power Xeon D products offer the better deal than Cavium's or AMD's ARM-based server processors. As long as Facebook and other data center companies can find cheap solar and wind power supplies, there is no compelling reason for them to experiment with server-centric ARM-based processors. Sure, there would be a market for cheaper ARM-based microservers from AMD or Cavium. However, those ARM-based products would probably cater only to small data center players. Facebook is expanding its empire beyond social networking and advertising. The new money transfer feature of Facebook Messenger means Zuckerberg wants to transform Facebook into a digital wallet and e-commerce player. The increased server load and web traffic from processing digital payments and online shopping means Facebook needs to build more and more server farms. Facebook is also expanding into virtual reality games and social experience. Streaming virtual reality worlds into millions of gamers will again require lots of server power. Facebook also wants to host news content on its site and mobile apps. Hosting news content that updates every minute also exerts pressure on data center servers. Facebook's ambitious empire building is great for Intel. The more higher-margin Xeon D chips that get sold, the more money that Intel can earn to help offset the company's contra revenue on mobile chips. Intel's Chipzilla dominance in data centers and servers will continue for many years. The chart above says the server market is a multi-billion annual industry that is hugely dependent on Intel's products. As of Q4 2014, Intel's x86 processors accounted for 83% of global server value in 2014. Sales of Intel's x86 server processors have steadily increased since 2009. The RISC-based ARMy of 64-bit ARM-based processor vendor wannabes are midgets that will take years to develop before they can hurt Intel's server business. Cavium, AMD, and other small ARM licensees do not have the marketing muscle (or OEM support) to challenge Intel on custom server or microserver design. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is the only challenger rich enough to challenge Intel on server processors. However, Qualcomm has yet to offer real evidence to support the rumors that it will release server-class Snapdragon processors. Qualcomm, if ever it decides to engage in the server processor arena, will likely fight a bloody battle. Intel already showed it is willing to lose billions of dollars in mobile chips contra revenue. I expect Intel to fight tooth and nail to protect its server processor sales. Intel has Facebook and other major server farm operators in its pocket. INTC therefore remains a long-term great investment . My bullish outlook for Intel is supported by the predictive algorithm of I Know First . INTC has double-digit positive 30-day (12.60) and 90-day (20.37) scores on I Know First's forecast engine. The chart below says INTC might be underpriced right now and has strong probability of rewarding investors in the future.
