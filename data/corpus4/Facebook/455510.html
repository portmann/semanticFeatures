Facebook sued for $1B in suit filed in New York - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Jul 11 2016, 16:35 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor Facebook ( FB +0.5%) is being sued for $1B in federal court for allegedly allowing Hamas to make use of its platform to plan terror attacks resulting in the deaths of four Americans. "Facebook has knowingly provided material support and resources to Hamas in the form of Facebook's online social network platform and communication services," reads the suit filed by families of those affected by the attacks to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Although the concept of initiating legal action against social networks following terror attacks is not new and the possibility of negatively impacting the company low, this same court has handed down verdicts assigning responsibility for acts of terrorism in the past.
