Apple reportedly preps smaller iPad Pro, officially files motion to throw out court order - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Feb 25 2016, 19:46 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor 9to5 Mac reports Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) next 9.7" iPad will be part of the iPad Pro line rather than an iPad Air 3. Like the 12.9" iPad Pro, the 9.7" model will have an A9X CPU and quad stereo speakers, and likely support Apple's Pencil stylus and Smart Keyboard accessory. Pricing is expected to be "closer in line with the iPad Air models" the smaller iPad Pro will succeed. 9to5 adds Apple will likely discontinue the iPad Mini 2 and first-gen iPad Air. The site previously reported Apple plans to show off a new 9.7" iPad and 4" iPhone at a March 15 event, and begin selling them on March 18. The company is coming off a calendar Q4 in which iPad revenue fell 21% Y/Y to $7.1B, with units dropping 25% to 16.1M. Meanwhile, Apple has officially filed a motion asking a judge to throw out an order calling on the company to help create a backdoor to unlock an iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. ( the 36-page filing ) In addition to reiterating its argument that creating a backdoor would undermine the security and privacy of all iPhone users, Apple asserts the court order is unconstitutional. "The demand violates Apple’s First Amendment rights against compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination ... The government’s demand also violates Apple’s Fifth Amendment right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of its liberties in that it would conscript Apple to develop software that undermines the security mechanisms of its own products." The WSJ reports Google, Microsoft, and Facebook plan to file a joint motion supporting Apple, and that Twitter is also in Apple's camp. Yesterday, the NYT reported Apple engineers are working on security measures "that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone" using methods similar to the ones sought in the San Bernardino case. I would expect that users of the company's products are encouraged that not only has the company refused to add a 'backdoor' to the iPhone, their reaction is to make the iPhone's security even stronger! So Apple's innovation is now making its products larger and smaller.  I'll hold on to my AAPL a bit longer but if it doesn't tick up, I'll sell them and take what I can. I preffer to hAve security then let the terrorist kill more people cause of what whatever naked picts u have on your phones ?? WTF ! Foolish thoughts my friend. Many of us have credit card numbers, banking applications with numbers, Social Security and drivers license numbers, etc. oh and maybe a few naked pics of legal aged ladies! Lol. No it's not foolish. Your thought is foolish. You must not understand the reason of the constitution. And it's value in ensuring the government does not have back doors into phones. Also it would defeat the whole security of the iPhone itself. A huge part of some of apples loyal users. Hitler tricked everyone in to giving up there guns because the government will protect them. then he started rounding up the Jews. Give up your rights and you'll have nothing left to defend yourself from tyranny. Users should make sure they don't forget their password.  On a similar vein, would the NSA try to infect everything with a dedicated password keylogger?  And it is interesting I haven't heard much about the large recent infiltration of celebrity iCloud accounts.  This experience has to be at the core of Cook's push back.  I'm sure he went through hell for a few days. Infecting everything with a dedicated keystroke logger would work fairly easily on PCs with separate keyboards as physical access to a keyboard would make such an approach quite easily accomplished. All keyboards sold in the US would need to first be authorized by the federal authorities in which the devices are unpacked, disassembled with a hardware keystroke logger installed and the keyboards reassembled. All the FBI would need to do is then later disassemble the keyboard and download the data stored in a tiny flash memory chip. However, it is much more problematic on laptop and personal devices where there is really no room to install additional hardware inside. A software approach could be done. However, it would require the government to install the software in a hidden fashion prior to the sale of the device. It seems that is akin to what the FBI is asking Apple to do. Such an approach renders a device vulnerable and someone would figure out a way to activate the software and obtain data that was meant to be confidential. Social engineering could be done but would be far more problematic, especially with iOS which requires a user to intentionally install software on the device. There will be many who won't install any outside software on their devices that might include a hidden payload such as a keystroke logger. If the NSA and FBI had thought that installation of keystroke loggers would be an approach that would work, Comey wouldn't be so interested in enlisting Apple's support in breaking iOS encryption. But such an approach makes little sense. It is like making firearms illegal. It only takes them away from law abiding citizens. The criminals would still be in possession of them. Besides, guns don't kill people, people kill people. Perhaps the pressure cooker bombs in Boston or the truck bomb used by Timothy McVay are less deadly because somehow they weren't firearms. In any case, the criminals would just use encryption software obtained from elsewhere. And let's watch the FBI try to brute force their way into files locked up with 448 bit encryption. All the while, the law abiding public loses their right to remain confidential. I have an ideal... let's reinvent the same product.. over and over and over, again! We can make it in different colors.. offer it in different sizes and tell our customers every time,"This changes everything." People are sheep and suckers - No one will notice!! Bravo Apple - because even with a back door to iOS, the simple fact is the government does not have the resources to compel each app on the App Store to open any encryption used to encrypt app data or even require the app to store data for their future use.  Failing that no one could stop a well financed terror org from making their own flavor of the latest Android phone.  It after all is open source.  It's high time our public officials understand technology and how it is changing the traditional approach they take in doing their jobs.  The answer for them is simple: you know who is communicating with each other via telecom records, what they say may not be at your finger tips but that is where modern police work (data mining, social media profiling, etc.) can get you to the same place.  Better yet how about setting up a terror honeypot on the dark web - would be so easy to tag and bag who you want and create a fear in them in not knowing who is really their friend.
