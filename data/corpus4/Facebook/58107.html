Verizon's Deal For AOL: Attacking Google And Facebook Is Not As Dumb As It Looks - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha The new strategy in the realm of media and technology is now crystal clear - it's called M&A. VZ just turned itself into an advertising power, leaving behind old enemies, while forging new ones. AOL is a deal VZ had to make, given that Verizon's bread-and-butter service bundles (telephone, Internet and pay-TV) are on the decline. The new strategy in the realm of media and technology is now crystal clear - it's called M&A. Companies with tons of cash and little growth have no choice but to spend for that growth. The only caveat? The deal has to make sense. This point was made several weeks ago , discussing the merits of quality content and how important it has become to advertisers. While I didn't predict telecommunication giant Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) would gobble up AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL ), I wasn't surprised by the announcement. And you shouldn't have been, either - that's if you've been paying attention. Dana Blankenhorn says AOL got the wrong buyer . Only time will tell. But this is a deal VZ needed. So it pounced on it . VZ has valuable assets that it can't use, including tons of valuable information about its consumers just sitting idle and collecting dust. Do you thing Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) or Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - two advertising behemoths - would have that problem? No. They would figure out ways to package all of that consumer data, which included spending habits and preferences, put a bow on it and sell it to advertisers who want to get more bang for their buck looking for predictive analysis on their target market. In that vein, this is what AOL will bring to VZ, which - by the way - just turned itself into an advertising power, especially in the realm of mobile. The all-cash deal valued at $4.4 billion or $50 per share may seem too pricey for AOL - who many consider a "has-been," but it makes sense. And it's not as risky as it looks given that VZ generated almost $12 billion in free cash flow last year. The way I see it, it's a worthwhile bet and signals a change in direction for VZ, who desperately craves a piece of the personal data market, which has become a goldmine for Google and Facebook. Plus AOL's recent investments in streaming video - suited for the mobile platform - is one less thing VZ has to worry about. Not to mention, this is another way VZ can leverage its FiOS television service. At the same time, AOL now gives VZ an edge over wireless rival AT&T (NYSE: T ), who's still betting on television subscribers with its $48 billion deal for DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ). And even then, VZ has a piece of that market with its FiOS television service. More importantly, AOL is a deal VZ had to make, given that Verizon's bread-and-butter service bundles (telephone, Internet and pay-TV) are on the decline. Revenue from those services are expected to climb just 3.2% this year. In 2014, that business posted sales of almost $130 billion, climbing more than 5% from 2013. As for 2016, analyst predict those services to grow at just 1.3%. So the pattern is clear. When it's all said and done, AOL has added life to VZ by bringing not only its sophisticated advertising platform, but also revenue streams to offset plummeting bundling sales. VZ is also waving goodbye to past rivals like AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and saying hello to new ones like Google and Facebook. Sure, these are more formidable competitors. But if VZ can prove it belongs in their company, its investors will be rewarded for it.
