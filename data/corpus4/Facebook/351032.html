My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale… You can only get it on Tidal. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 15, 2016 The new release remains exclusive to the musician-pushed streaming service, Tidal, and isn’t available for sale or for download. Well, if you want to “own” a copy, you can download it illegally . You can’t really ever own the album, though, since West continues to make changes to it. That raises an interesting question about all streaming services: would you pay $10 per month for access to an ever-changing version of your favorite album? When is a work of art considered “done”? Is it fair to ask fans to pay for a subscription so they can have continuing access to your work if it’s exclusive to only one streaming platform? We’re not sure what the answer is, but do know that you can listen to the track “Famous” on a variety of streaming services, and it’s not the original version that came out when the album was released.
