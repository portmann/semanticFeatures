Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog , In recent months, Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site. The new proposal by Facebook carries another risk for publishers: the loss of valuable consumer data. When readers click on an article, an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are, how often they visit and what else they have done on the web. And if Facebook pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace, those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic — a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers. Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors’, and over time readers might avoid those sites. - From the New York Times article:  Facebook May Host News Sites’ Content Last week, I came across an incredibly important article from the New York Times, which described Facebook’s plan to provide direct access to other websites’ content in exchange for some sort of advertising partnership. The implications of this are so huge that at this point I have far more questions than answers. Let’s start with a few excerpts from the article : With 1.4 billion users, the social media site has become a vital source of traffic for publishers looking to reach an increasingly fragmented audience glued to smartphones. In recent months, Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site. Such a plan would represent a leap of faith for news organizations accustomed to keeping their readers within their own ecosystems, as well as accumulating valuable data on them. Facebook has been trying to allay their fears, according to several of the people briefed on the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements. Facebook intends to begin testing the new format in the next several months, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The initial partners are expected to be The New York Times, BuzzFeed and National Geographic, although others may be added since discussions are continuing. The Times and Facebook are moving closer to a firm deal, one person said. Facebook has said publicly that it wants to make the experience of consuming content online more seamless. News articles on Facebook are currently linked to the publisher’s own website, and open in a web browser, typically taking about eight seconds to load. Facebook thinks that this is too much time, especially on a mobile device, and that when it comes to catching the roving eyeballs of readers, milliseconds matter. The Huffington Post and the business and economics website Quartz were also approached. Both also declined to discuss their involvement. Facebook declined to comment on its specific discussions with publishers. But the company noted that it had provided features to help publishers get better traction on Facebook, including tools unveiled in December that let them target their articles to specific groups of Facebook users, such as young women living in New York who like to travel. The new proposal by Facebook carries another risk for publishers: the loss of valuable consumer data. When readers click on an article, an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are, how often they visit and what else they have done on the web. And if Facebook pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace, those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic — a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers. Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors’, and over time readers might avoid those sites. And just as Facebook has changed its news feed to automatically play videos hosted directly on the site, giving them an advantage compared with videos hosted on YouTube, it could change the feed to give priority to articles hosted directly on its site. Let me try to address this the best I can from several different angles. First off, what’s the big picture plan here? As the number two ranked website in the world with 1.4 billion users, Facebook itself is already something like an alternative internet where a disturbing number of individuals spend a disproportionate amount of their time. The only thing that seems to make many of its users click away is content hosted on other people’s websites linked to from Facebook users. Other than this outside content, many FB users might never leave the site. While this is scary to someone like me, to Facebook it is an abomination. The company doesn’t want people to leave their site ever — for any reason. Hence the aggressive push to carry outside news content, and create a better positioned alternative web centrally controlled by it. This is a huge power play move.  Second, the New York Times righty asks the question concerning what will publishers get from Facebook for allowing their content to appear on the site seamlessly. Some sort of revenue share from advertisers seems to be an obvious angle, but perhaps there’s more. While Facebook isn’t a huge traffic driver for Liberty Blitzkrieg , it isn’t totally irrelevant either. For example, FB provided about 3% of the site’s traffic over the past 12 months. This is despite the fact that LBK doesn’t even have a Facebook page, and I’ve never shared a link through it. Even more impressive, Facebook drove more traffic to LBK over the same time period than Twitter, and I am very active on that platform. So I can only imagine how important FB is to website editors who actually use it. This brings me to a key point about leverage. It seems to me that Facebook has all the leverage in negotiations with content providers. If you’re a news website that refuses to join in this program, over time you might see your traffic evaporate compared to your competitors whose content will load seamlessly and be promoted by the FB algorithm. If a large percentage of your traffic is being generated by Facebook, can you really afford to lose this? One thing that FB might be willing to offer publishers in return other than advertising dollars, is increased access to their fan base. For example, when I try to figure out through Google analytics who specifically (or what page) on Facebook is sharing my work, I can’t easily do so. Clearly this information could prove very useful for networking purposes and could be quite valuable. Looking for some additional insight and words of wisdom, I asked the smartest tech/internet person I know for his opinion. It was more optimistic than I thought: Other than saying that I don’t really know how to predict what might or might not happen, and I sort of don’t care much because it is in the realm (for now at least) of stuff that I don’t read (mainstream news), on a site that I never see (Facebook). However, the one thing I wonder in terms of the viability of this is whether in the end it may drive people away from FB. Back in the day, probably when you weren’t so aware of the nascent net, there were two giant “services” on the Internet called Compuserve and America Online. They were each what you are thinking that Facebook is heading toward; exclusive, centralized portals to the whole net. They were also giant and successful at the time. Then people outside of them started doing things that were so much more creative and interesting. At the same time, in order to make everything fit inside their proprietary boxes and categories, they were making everything ever more standardized and boring. Then they just abruptly died. Given the enormity of what Facebook is trying to achieve, I have some obvious concerns. First, since all of the leverage seems to reside with Facebook, I fear they are likely to get the better part of any deal by wide margin. Second, if they succeed in this push, this single company’s ability to control access to news and what is trending and deemed important by a huge section of humanity will be extraordinary.

The MSM is dying.  Facebook has plateued.  However the risk is great to both parties.  What happens when users hijack the message?   And how do they control feedback?   You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

YOU have been given a voice.  Yes, this is all about control of the 'message'. They are loosing control, this is one option they've chosen and they'll attempt to vilify any and all alternate sources.

I can't remember the username or password or email account that I made up the last time I was forced to use it so I just make up another one. Which I promptly forget again because I never use it. When you hear your teenage kids say, "Facebook?? Facebook SUCKS" you know it's over for them. MSM want's to funnel their feces through FB? Hey - I'm all for it. More power to them. I would rather have ALL the knuckle-draggers self-confined to their own little cage somewhere on the periphery of the internet than wandering around loose and showing up on worthwhile sites. Like I would ever even bother to make up yet another fake account on Facebook to read somethign like the NYT, WSJ, WaPo, Bussiness Insider, etc., etc., etc. Sun, 03/29/2015 - 22:41 | 5940777 bag holder This sounds exactly like America Online back in the 90s.

Others, who figure out that their typical sources of media are being throttled will seek out those sources outside the facebook site and it might cause them to think twice about how much time they spend there or whether FB really has anything to offer. For FB I'm in the same camp as the Internet guru, I think it could end up biting FB in the ass...in the end.

Sun, 03/29/2015 - 23:05 | 5940826 OldPhart Mon, 03/30/2015 - 01:09 | 5940992 TheReplacement Good for you, I suppose.  I can't be bothered with Facebook for the simple reason I can't be bothered with Facebook, or MySpace before that (anyone remember MySpace?) or AOL before that.  When you speak to people, face to face, you can better judge if they heard you or if they were listening. All the same, it doesn't seem likely to matter.  Have you contemplated just how much you do not and cannot know?  The whole thing is mindboggling in scale and scope and the intricate webs of alliances and deceit is beyond comprehension. And that is the good news.  It is too complex.  Everything is too complex.  People fashion TPTB as some sort of continuation of the Nazis of old and even further back.  Yes, this does seem to be the case.  However, the Nazis used slave labor to build complex weapons systems that were too heavy for a lot of ground that needed to be fought over, mechanically unreliable, too complex to manufacture in mass quantities quickly, and required extensive training for an ever dwindling number of soldiers capable of learning to use the systems while being loyal and contientious (they impressed captured soldiers from one front to fight on another against a different enemy).  Does that sounds familiar?  How many Abrams and Apaches can we churn out?  Can an Abrams get everywhere it might need to go?  Those fields in Donbass looked awfully muddy.  Just how fast can we make these tanks now that our auto industry is just about gonesky?  How much effort does it take to maintain and supply the Abrams and Apache?  Do any Chinese components go into that tank or helo?  How about software from other countries?  How much does it cost, how long does it take, and what are the requirements for a tanker or helo crew?  We have plenty of people who can read, write and speak english and, for sure, they are totally, like, loyal and everything, right?  Care to compare the monetary or financial systems?  How about police and surviellance?  Regulations and social justice?  Fanaticisms?  Fear/loathing of the other? Mon, 03/30/2015 - 01:46 | 5941031 bunnyswanson Sharing links and making observations is hardly talking to each other.  And if the FBI is reading our news feeds, then they should realize that only a fool would not object to the real news.  Remember, when the number of people in the demonstrations reaches 1 million, the cops change sides.  When the cops change sides, it's over for the couple thousand at the top of this pyramid made from blood, sweat and tears of 4 generations.  The end is going to be the same for Americans.  I am a Canadian in America.  And I strongly feel that every american no matter their income is going to be answering to the Chinese govt officials by the time they wrap this up.  Americans are going to be responsible for the debt their politicians racked up.  Just like Greece.  Elimination of the middle class is not something to take lying down if you care at all about humanity and what our actions today will do to future humans on this planet.  China is not a nice country. Mon, 03/30/2015 - 02:24 | 5941065 bunnyswanson What is there to know?  Father was given an ambassorship by Canadian govt in his industry (mining) when he was needed to do a complex job during a deep freeze and broken water main (ice filled mine shaft).  During that trip from Sudbury, in Johnstown, PA, a mining accident occurred resulting in a bucket of several tons of muck falling 500 feet down a shaft onto the heads of 2 men, one of whom had 11 children and who was also the superintendent of the drilling company sinking the shaft.  My father was in Pittsburgh when it happened.  The coal miners refused to go down the hole.  They called and asked my father, who did.  http://www.camgenpa.com/news/1965TD.htmlÂ  He sautered the bucket back onto the same crane and went down numerous times, but when it came time to bring up the deceased drillers, the company boss decided he had the courage, and the media coverage was called in.  My dad was devastated.  But the company offered him the job of the superintendent and gave him and his family life long visas.  He traveled to other countries and left my us in a very small town.  Mother decided to spend her time at the bar.  The towns people raised me, fed me, let me sleep there, took me to doctor, stores, and never made me feel badly about my fractured family and empty home.  They were Polish, Slovadian, Filipino, Italian, and back in 1965, the people were very kind, hard working, honest and private.  I know enough that I have gratitude toward the Americans for keeping me from going where I should have gone considering the situation.  They showed me love.  And I plan on doing what I can to see to it that these people are not punished for what their govt and big money interests have done in their name.  They do not deserve this. Mon, 03/30/2015 - 04:17 | 5941112 bunnyswanson There is no hero who is going to come and save the day.  If the global community turns its back on your country when the real reason for combat equipment and enough ammo to wipe out the entire population, the surveillance and the FEMA camps, the gloves will come off and the Rich Kid on the Block will be put in his place with the techniques used by the US soldiers, deemed torture.  With the bankers and the manipulation going on going unreported by MSM everywhere, FB is the only choice.  Huffpo may have been once but that quickly changed when AH joined AOL.  ZH commentors who down vote me and yet scream on these threads condemnation must be in the library because boys it is the same fucking thing. Mon, 03/30/2015 - 03:11 | 5941084 bunnyswanson Re: Chinese - I just happened to a little bit as I was a roommate of a youg Chinese woman who married her way into America (to a Mormon missionary).  She came from Utah after, in a matter of months, her husband left her.  She was crying on her American boss' shoulder shortly thereafter and allowed him to set her up in an apartment completely furnished.  It did not work out, she said, because he expected her to sleep with him.  It was not in her plans.  She roomed with me after getting a job as an exporter at a produce operation.  I watched her, in 6 months, set up 2 export businesses and take her company's client's file and start her own exporting operation, with the 2 separate businesses bidding against each other.  She had the state of mind that she could do whatever she wanted her, that the people in this country owe her, because of her govt's generosity.  She displayed contempt toward Americans, and had no qualms in stating so.  She was the daughter of a military man who was forced to work in the fields and not pursue his talent (art).  One child policy has created little emperors and princesses.  I can't say for sure, as I've never visited the site. Based on what I've gleaned contextually from people talking/writing about it, it appears to be a holding pen for human cattle. Mon, 03/30/2015 - 00:09 | 5940925 COSMOS Time to switch and put them back where they started.  I hear young people are moving to instagram.  That is a start.
