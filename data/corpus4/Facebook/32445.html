Ceglia loses bid to revive Facebook lawsuit, block criminal case | Reuters NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday rejected the fugitive Paul Ceglia's effort to revive his civil lawsuit against Facebook Inc  and founder Mark Zuckerberg seeking a big stake in the social media company, and to halt a separate criminal prosecution for fraud. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Facebook and Zuckerberg had established by clear and convincing evidence that a 2003 contract that Ceglia claimed entitled him to a 50 percent Facebook stake was forged. It also said Ceglia failed to make a "clear showing" that the government's criminal case against him arising from that contract should be dismissed.
