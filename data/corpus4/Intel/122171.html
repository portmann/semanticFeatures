Could Apple Be An Angel Customer For AMD? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 20, 2015 10:14 AM ET  |  About: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) , AAPL , Includes: INTC , SSNLF , TSM by: Mark Hibben AMD lost money again in Q2, and revised previous guidance to a money losing second half. AMD's semi-custom business has become a lifeline, as Intel continues to take share in the PC market. Increasingly, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) is living hand-to-mouth, surviving on the semi-custom devices commissioned by its Angel Customers. Angel Customers pay AMD cash upfront to cover the non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs that other semiconductor houses absorb as part of normal operating expenses. Following the earnings call on July 16, it occurred to me that collaboration on a semi-custom Intel Architecture SOC would be a win-win for both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and AMD. For all we know, such a collaboration may already be underway. In my AMD earnings preview article , I had expressed my skepticism regarding the guidance that AMD gave at their Analyst Day meeting for a return to profitability in the second half of the year. I was particularly interested to see if AMD would stick to this guidance in the conference call . About the only surprise in the call was how quickly AMD backed away from the guidance. CFO Devinder Kumar blurted it out in his prepared remarks: "Due to the recent change in the PC market outlook, our goal of second half profitability has been pushed out." AMD does expect revenue to rise for Q3 to about $998 million, up 6% from this quarter's $942 million. This will be due largely to a seasonal increase to support game consoles, as well as the new products that AMD is introducing, Carrizo architecture processors and R9 Fury graphics cards. However, this will represent a 30% y/y decline in Q3, a slight improvement from the Q2 35% y/y decline. AMD's gross margins continue to erode. Last year, AMD's already low gross margin stood at 35%. This year, it's down to 25%. In contrast, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) gross margin for Q2 was 62.5%. Intel's much greater gross margin demonstrates its near-monopoly power in the market for Intel Architecture processors. AMD's operating loss of $137 resided primarily in Computing and Graphics Segment (CGS) which posted a $147 million loss. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (EESC) managed to eke out a small $27 million profit. EESC has now become the mainstay of AMD, producing most of the revenue and all of the profit. AMD announced a third semi-custom design start for Q2 to go with the two other wins from last year. AMD indicated that the first two have lifetime revenue value of $1 billion each while the latest is in the $200-500 million range. The console and other semi-custom wins, which at first seemed merely a supplement to the CGS business, have become vital to the company's survival. It is against the financial backdrop of AMD's Q2 and 2H guidance that a possible involvement by Apple needs to be understood. AMD, while in somewhat dire straits financially, nevertheless possesses technology of value to Apple (and other PC makers as well). In both graphics processing and in Intel Architecture processors, Apple has an interest. Apple also has an interest in ensuring that AMD doesn't go under, thereby leaving Intel with an absolute monopoly in Intel Architecture processors, on which Apple depends for its Mac computer line. Macs are already expensive, and an Intel monopoly would only make them more expensive. In addition to the negative incentives, there are many positive incentives. Apple has found that there are benefits to designing its own ARM processors for its iOS devices. Among those benefits, one of the most important is that Apple is able to incorporate only the functionality that it needs to support its mobile devices. When buying a commodity Intel processor for its Macs, the situation is very different. Designers of commodity processors tend to build in numerous interfaces and functions in a "one size fits all" approach. Often, the interfaces and functions supplied by Intel in its chips go unused in Apple products. This was brought home to me by the recent release of the new MacBook with Retina Display, which uses the Intel Core M. The Core M is designed as a general purpose PC processor with the usual interfaces for hard drives, USB, etc. as shown in the diagram below ( courtesy Anandtech ): The key takeaway from the chart is that Apple isn't using a lot of that stuff. Instead of the Serial ATA (hard drive or SSD) controller, Apple has its own proprietary flash memory controller, as detailed in the iFixit teardown . Apple has used the new USB C port as the sole interface for the MacBook, rather than USB 2 or 3. If Apple commissioned a semi-custom processor from AMD, it could do away with the surplusage of Intel, and spec exactly what it wants in terms of CPU and graphics capability. Intel's SOCs continue to be a little light on graphics capability. In recent leaked benchmarks for Carrizo graphics, it outperformed Intel Iris Pro graphics by a factor of 3. In addition, AMD advertises that it can bring proprietary customer IP onto the semi-custom chip as well. So, in this case, AMD could integrate Apple's flash memory controller. AMD would probably not have been a viable candidate for Apple if it weren't for the fact that 14-16 nm FinFET is now a reality at Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). Even if the new processes aren't quite as good as Intel, they're probably good enough to support the performance requirements of Apple MacBooks. Apple highlighted the latest MacBook as the "future of the notebook," indicating that future Apple notebooks will dispense with cooling fans. This means that Apple would be looking for a post Carrizo (probably Zen based) design, fabricated on 14 nm, that would also not require a fan. This is probably within the capability of AMD starting in 2016. The most important benefit to Apple would be getting a processor for about half of what Intel charges for the Core M ( listed at $281 for lots of 1000 ). This would go a long way towards achieving the goal I discussed in my latest article on the Mac of reducing the cost of the MacBook without compromising quality. This would greatly expand the market for the Mac, as I discussed in Apple's Laptop Opportunity . Apple sells about 4-5 million Macs, most of them laptops, every quarter, so there's a significant opportunity for AMD. If only 1/5 of those Macs were equipped with AMD processors, that would add about $100 million to AMD's top line every quarter. And that's just for starters. AMD could expand their presence in the Mac lineup, as well as earn prestige for being in one of the most desirable notebook computers. I believe the chances of a collaboration are good. Apple is clearly motivated to reduce the cost of its notebooks, while improving the performance of the fanless type of notebook that will become a staple of the Mac line-up. Clearly, AMD is motivated to place themselves at Apple's disposal. At the very least, I'm sure AMD has pitched this to Apple. Even if Apple doesn't take them up on this, the semi-custom approach may win converts among other PC manufacturers looking to differentiate their products. Of course, there may be other semi-custom wins in the server category as well. If AMD can't beat Intel in the commodity market, it can at least carve out a niche as a supplier of semi-custom processors for laptops and other Intel Architecture computers. Based on the number of semi-custom wins alone, it's fair to say that AMD has moved beyond game consoles. This is probably the only future that AMD has, but it is at least a future in which AMD can begin to grow again. For this reason, I see 2016 as a potential watershed year for the company. It may be the year that AMD finally abandons the commodity PC market and fully embraces its role as a custom processor designer for hire. In that role, AMD may be a much smaller company, but it will also be a much more profitable company.
