Intel Still Shut Out Of Mobile - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Last quarter, Intel folded its PC Client and Mobile Communications groups into a new Client Computing division. In effect, Intel may bury its mobile losses within its new Client Computing division. Smart analysts should not be fooled by this sleight of hand. For its latest quarter, Intel (NYSE: INTC ) classified its businesses according to Client Computing, Data Center, Internet of Things, Software and Services and Other groups. The Client Computing Group then included chip sales to power desktop, two-in-one, tablet and smartphone machines. In effect, Intel has simply folded its old Mobile and Communications Group into the PC Client unit. Smart analysts, however, will not be fooled by this accounting sleight of hand. Mobile, after several years of false starts, is still an albatross on Intel's bottom line. Intel is a vertically integrated semiconductor company that designs, manufactures and markets its own chips. The integrated Intel strategy stands in stark contrast to the more so specialized wings of the highly complex semiconductor industry. Beyond Intel, major chip players would include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ). Taken together, these companies form the backbone of the iOS and Android ecosystems, where the chip sets are designed around ARM architecture before being mass-produced in Asian factories, on the cheap. Intel's vertically integrated business model, of course, has been highly capital intensive, especially in terms of research and development costs. For 2014, Intel reported $11.5 billion in R&D spending, or 20.6% of $55.6 billion in total revenue. On the statement of cash flows, Intel accounted for $7.4 billion in depreciation charges after having directed $10.1 billion in cash toward buying up property, plant and equipment. The massive scale of the Intel operation dwarfs that of arch-rival ARM, which does not own any foundries but instead collects royalties on intellectual property. ARM, at a relatively diminutive $25 billion in market capitalization, may still boast that its technologies have been installed within more than 95% of U.S. smartphones in circulation. The nimble ARM has proven itself to be better equipped to serve a mobile market where cooler temperatures and battery power are more so at a premium rather than raw processing power. According to Economics 101, Intel must sell premium product at significant volume in order to leverage its staggering fix costs to turn real profits. For several years running, Intel has supplied high-end computers and servers with the most powerful chips on the market. Last year, the PC Client ($34.7 billion) and Data Center ($14.4 billion) groups combined to drive $49.1 billion, or 88%, of company revenue. Further analysis would reveal that Intel gets a huge chunk of its business from three customers, in Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), Dell and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). At the same time, Mobile and Communications posted $202 million in 2014 net revenue, which was literally a rounding era at Intel. Intel does appear somewhat desperate to barge its way into the mobile, with the PC market being very much mature, if not locked into irreversible decline. Last April, research firm Garter released ugly estimates that the PC market contracted by 5.2% through Q1 2015. The Google Android and Apple iOS ecosystems, again, still dominate the mobile market. According to comScore, Android (52.2%) and Apple (43.1%) platforms combined to take 95.3% of the U.S. smartphone subscriber base through the first calendar quarter of 2014. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) actually lost 90 basis points in share through this time frame. The mobile chip market, beneath this structure, also branches off into two separate wings, with ARM as the central focal point. Apple A-Series chips power iOS devices, obviously, while Qualcomm Snapdragon chips drive premium Android, BlackBerry and even Windows mobile machines. A-Series and Snapdragon chips are both designed around ARM architecture before being mass-produced at Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor foundries. Intel, again, has remained largely shut out of mobile after several false starts. At this point, Intel rhetoric comes off as a broken record as the company has literally repackaged its failing mobile chip line beneath different code words in Bay Trail, Cherry Trail and SoFIA. Last March, Intel unveiled its Atom x3, x5 and x7 chips at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. For years, Intel has hitched its wagon to the apparent expansion of the "two-in-one" market. To gain traction, Intel may even sell select chips as loss leaders after doling out liberal rebates to original equipment manufacturers. Intel now lists out only five separate smartphones powered by its mobile chip technology. These five handsets do include the ASUS ZenFone, Etisalat E-20, Lenovo K900, Motorola RAZR I and Safaricom Yolo, which are each available throughout the developing world. For now, Intel has been left to rely upon the Microsoft Surface for any hope of breaking into the mobile market. Microsoft pitches the Surface as "the tablet that can replace your laptop." The Surface, however, has lagged significantly far behind the Galaxy, iPad and MacBook after this awkward attempt to be all things to all people. Intel, again, reported $202 million in 2014 total net sales out of its Mobile and Communications Group. This unit has been steadily deteriorating as it generated $1.8 billion in revenue as recently as 2012. By 2014, however, Intel Mobile and Communications had racked up a staggering $4.2 billion in losses. Alternatively, the PC Client Group posted $14.6 billion in operating profits off $34.7 billion in total net sales through 2014. Going forward, these old figures may help in comparisons, with Intel working to stuff Mobile and Communications losses within the dominant PC Client Group. Intel did close out its latest quarter with $12.8 billion in total revenue on the books. Of this amount, the newly minted Client Computing Group brought forth $7.4 billion in Q1 2015 total net sales to the table. Last year, this Client Computing Group accounted for $8.1 billion in quarterly revenue, or $7.9 billion and $156 million in total net sales, between the old PC Client and Mobile segments, respectively. A triangulation of the recent data may confirm that Intel is struggling to close sales in mobile while also staring down a rapidly contracting PC market. In all, Intel year-over-year comparisons for revenue and net income have been all but flat, with servers remaining the lone source of growth. Last quarter, Intel reported $12.8 billion in revenue and $2 billion in net income. Intel improved its top and bottom lines by a mere $17 million and $8 million, respectively, between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015. On June 17, 2015, Intel shares closed out the trading session at $31.95. At these levels, Intel shares last traded hands at more than 13 times trailing earnings. This is too steep of a price to pay for weak mobile chip sales and flat-lining net income out of Intel.
