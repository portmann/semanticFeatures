What To Expect From Intel's Knights Landing - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Knights Landing is hitting the market, while Knights Hill will come in 2017-2018. This new Xeon Phi adopts MCDRAM on package and enhanced Silvermont cores which are completely Haswell binary compatible. It is able to work in standalone mode. Knights Landing is offered in both socketed version and PCI-E version, a very welcome solution for HPC. Nvidia has various good technology to implement on its next offer. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) will have its first Knights Landing commercial systems ready by the end of 2015. It is known that the Xeon Phi solutions have been quite successful. Indeed, they power various supercomputers around the world, and they can drive high synergies with "traditional" Xeon CPUs (moreover, with Haswell EP). Knights Corner surely was a satisfactory accelerator card, but Intel's new generation will set new standards for what concerns the programming easiness, in conjunction with the synergy between CPUs and accelerator cards. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) will obviously provide new Tesla solutions, exploiting the new Pascal architecture in 2016 and Volta in 2017 . Pascal will be a great boost compared to the previous generation. Meanwhile, Intel is providing features that make Knights Landing a very viable solution for HPC and servers. In any case, both Intel and Nvidia will get new revenues and profits from the HPC and server markets, since every platform has different advantages, and the need of accelerator cards or similar products is constantly rising. This series of features, in conjunction with the familiarity with x86 code, made Xeon Phi programming much easier in comparison to competitors. Xeon Phi have been adopted indeed in 34 of the last 3 years' TOP500 supercomputers entries or updates (June 2015), while Nvidia Tesla cards have been adopted in 36 supercomputers during the last 3 years. Given that Intel is a "newbie" in HPC accelerator cards, this achievement is relevant and successful. Knights Corner is powered by 60+ cores set around 1.2-1.3 GHz with x86 instructions. In addition, it has a TDP around 300W per PCI-E card. It is noteworthy that Knights Corner Xeon Phi powers the Thiane 2 - the most powerful supercomputer nowadays - a quite remarkable achievement for Intel. It must be noted that the x86 code familiarity permitted to provide a lot of virtualization programs to run Knights Corner through MMX/SSE and unlimited access memory, without any deep code change. Xeon Phi is generally high-performing in those not extremely parallelized applications, which are still the vast majority of present programs nowadays in the HPC field. Besides, the Haswell EP CPUs co-accelerated by Xeon Phi provide a very consistent boost to the entire platform. Talking about Knights Landing, things get more interesting. First, it is powered by FP and vector-enhanced Silvermont cores, which incorporate additional AVX units that are able to perform AVX-512F operations. There are two AVX units per core, and each core is 4 threads capable. The maximum TDP will be set at 200W (215W with integrated fabric) - more than 1/3rd reduction. This new solution provides 3.0 TFLOPS in double-precision and 6.0 TFLOPS in single-precision. I know that these mere numbers look just comparable to actual Nvidia Tesla solutions (+40% 32 bit / +110% 64 bit compared to K40 (single GPU) and -30% 32 bit / +3% 64 bit compared to K80 (dual GPU) ), but this is not the only specific where we must focus, since they are useless numbers if taken alone. Additionally, we must remember that Knights Landing elaborates 3 times FLOPS of what Knights Corner was able to do, and therefore, the lower theoretical power has not been of any hindrance to Xeon Phi's success. For what concerns the memory specifics, Knights Landing will exploit a technology similar to HBM: it is called MCDRAM, and it is a variant of the Hybrid Memory Cube, researched in partnership with Micron. This memory will be stacked up onto the CPU package, it will provide 16 GB of memory with a bandwidth around 500 GB/sec, which is a consistent bandwidth boost, and it will directly substitute the L3 Cache, leaving the L2 cache around 36 MB. Anyway, the first thing that could be a real game changer is the enhanced Silvermont adoption. This move makes any Haswell-compatible binary suitable to be run under a Xeon Phi unit (every Haswell instruction set but TSX), providing even better code compatibility and programming easiness compared to the past. Given that the easy software approach has been a major aspect for Knights Corner's success, this move is quite understandable and suitable. Moreover, these chips will be built using the Intel 14nm technology node, which has obviously reached a very good yield factor, given that Knights Landing will provide all the 72 projected cores (while Intel could achieve only 61 cores exploiting the 22nm node with Knights Corner). Since Xeon Phi will be essentially Silvermont-based, it means that any program could still run using traditional instruction sets, even if it does not exploit the AVX 512 units. This architecture structure enables another feature: these Xeon Phi can run on their own, without any other CPU commanding them, and doing it with Haswell-compatible binaries is an added value highly welcomed by programmers. Considering the high computational potential inside these chips, Intel decided to improve even the network fabric, partially integrating them onto the Xeon Phi chips. This move permits to achieve a great reduction in power consumption, adding lower latencies and massive improvements in bandwidth between Phi cards and nodes. However, this migration is only partial with Knights Landing, because the whole network fabric (Omni-Path) will be fully integrated in the successive generation. In any case, boosts like +200% in peak rate, +360% in HFI message rate, -40% in switch latency, and a bandwidth of 100 GB/s in conjunction with a very fine cost control will be something noteworthy of attention in the server and HPC segments. As already stated, Knights Landing will be powered by beefed-up Silvermont cores, which are binary-compatible to the Haswell architecture: this aspect implies a very high compatibility grade, in conjunction with very low code adjustments for already existing programs. In addition, the various Open MP, Open CL, Open AAC and various GCC and Intel compilers are going to be quite more efficient and effective, given the Haswell architecture synergies. Furthermore, Knights Landing is able to run without an external CPU commanding it. This implies the most important choice that Intel has made with this product, that is a three form-factor offer: Xeon Phi will be offered as a PCI-E card, as a standalone socketed CPU and as a standalone socketed CPU with integrated fabric. This means that the socketed route virtually cuts off any intrinsic PCI-E latency and bottleneck issue, while it is possible to run any kind of program/code with little code effort. The synergy between the Haswell-compatible architecture, the capacity to run in standalone mode (freeing a lot of bandwidth) and the addition of MCDRAM modules on the central CPU package will permit programmers to exploit this architecture in a very peculiar and effective way. But most of all, the chance to run the PCI-E card in standalone mode without any heavy code effort is something extremely important and unique. We must remember that since the Xeon Phi removes the PCI-E bottlenecks using QuickPath, it means that it will exploit NUMA capabilities, that is sharing memory with all other Xeon processors and making possible a fully comprehensive workload. The old Knights Corner has been welcomed due to the programming easiness. Now, things will get greatly simpler and quite more powerful, because the effective power which programmers will be able to "extract" from these solutions is essentially higher than the mere FLOPS upgrade. If programming easiness has been the major factor of Knights Corner's success, Knights Landing is destined to do even better. Nvidia will not remain idle, for sure. It is going to introduce Tesla Pascal in 2016 and Tesla Volta in 2017. Tesla Pascal will introduce a new architecture with 14nm node, and it will adopt HBM 2.0 to reach roughly 1 TB/sec of bandwidth, which doubles the new Xeon Phi (but the socketed version is able to access even the system memory, and there is the chance to see MCDRAM with a double bus). For what concerns the TFLOPS power, Nvidia starts from very good 32-bit FLOPS, but 64-bit FLOPS are quite disappointing (for what concerns the Maxwell architecture), which means that the most part of the node reduction will be eaten up by the augmented FP 64 units, aiming to reach half of the FP 32 FLOPS. So, what could we expect? Personally, I expect something around 6-8 TFLOPS in single-precision and 3-4 TFLOPS in double-precision per GPU - a result which would set a single Pascal chip 25% faster than Knights Landing. Given Knights Corner's success with its programming capacity, this kind of theoretical TFLOPS advantage will hardly translate into effective advantages (since the majority of apps is not "painfully" parallelized), but things will be quite different once Nvidia releases the Volta architecture in 2017, providing additional boosts and architectural refinements. But this is not all from Nvidia. Pascal will introduce NVLink, which will act like Intel's QuickPath. It is practically an enhanced proprietary PCI-E that will be faster than PCI-E 4.0, and it will provide high bandwidth between Tesla cards, GPUs and the CPU. The issue here is that motherboards will have to be built in an appropriate way, and at the moment, this is officially supported only by IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), which implies potential production scalability problems. In any case, it is an interesting and needed technology for Nvidia. It is clear that the new Tesla Pascal will be a very good PCI-E card, but we will have to see how the deeply enhanced Xeon Phi Haswell compatibility will be important in programming and adoption, in conjunction with the three-form factor and the much higher flexibility. For what concerns Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), things are more fascinating. AMD may provide new server/HPC PCI-E cards in future, but it seems that it is concentrating over CPUs and APUs in the short term. It will implement internal data fabric to avoid latency between CPU and GPU, and it will add HBM modules onto the package, which will interface to GPU and then CPU through data fabric. We can say that AMD is going through a route more similar to Intel, since it is both a CPU and GPU designer on a server/desktop/laptop level. However, now, there is only a rumor about an APU with 4 TFLOPS (more likely single-precision, in my opinion) with a potential TDP of 95W. For what concerns the HPC segment, things are still unknown at the moment, and it is too hard to delineate the future offer. The only known rumors state that server ZEN CPU will come in late 2016, while ZEN APUs will come in 2017. The only guess that is possible to make is about PCI-E cards, which will generally be comparable to future Tesla solutions: if the Fire cards provide double-precision FLOPS as half of single-precision FLOPS, we could expect something roughly around 8 TFLOPS 32 bits and 4 TFLOPS 64 bits, while desktop cards will likely push more the 32-bit units. There are also EHP rumors, but those are set for what we are going to see around 2020, and they are very imprecise rumors. Another issue that I see here is that AMD uses an LPP node, which is suitable for mobile and smartphones frequencies/TDPs, but it is not the best choice for desktop SoCs/CPUs, and is even worse for enterprise products. Intel is pushing hard in the HPC and server/workstation field, where Knights Landing is a consistent and relevant upgrade from various points of view. FLOPS power has doubled, the fabric has been integrated, the architecture is now binary-compatible to Haswell, the TDP has been reduced roughly by 30%, every unit can act on its own without any CPU commanding it and it is offered both in socketed version and PCI-E version. Nvidia will likely release a good offer too, since its actual Tesla architecture is dated to 2012. The green Santa Clara company will probably continue to suffer a programmability and compatibility problem compared to Intel solutions, but it has some new features that could be compelling and highly welcomed. In addition, Nvidia has already a contract to implement its NVlink technology in various motherboards (IBM). For what concerns supercomputer deals , it is already known that Nvidia has a deal to power two IBM Power9 supercomputers in 2017, called Summit and Sierra. Sierra will be a >100 PFLOPS, while Summit will be between 150 and 300 PFLOPS. These supercomputers will probably be powered by the future Tesla Volta cards. Talking about Intel, Knights Landing will power the Cori phase II (>30 PFLOPS) in 2016, the Theta (8.5 PFLOPS) in 2016 and it is being implemented in the Trinity supercomputer (42 PFLOPS). Trinity is peculiar, since it will exploit Knights Landing in both the socketed and PCI-E card form-factor. The third-generation Xeon Phi, Knights Hill, will power the Aurora supercomputer (180+ PFLOPS) in 2018 instead. The takeaway is that both Intel and Nvidia will probably be "winners", since the HPC field it is growing fast and the exascale computing run is pacing steady. Given the architectural difference, where Intel is x86-compatible and keen to not extremely parallelized programs, while Nvidia is keen to extremely parallelized programs, Intel may strike more deals, since the majority of HPC programs are not painfully parallelized. More than 50 system providers will provide server offers with Knights Landing in both socketed and PCI-E card form-factor, including all the major OEMs. Anyway, these kind of supercomputer deals are set to amounts of hundreds of million dollars per deal - a very good revenue source for both Intel and Nvidia. Given the actual scenario and stock price, Intel is still a very solid investment for the long term, and it will be interesting to see if it will be able to catch up in the ultra-mobile sector too. Intel is worthy of a Buy even at these levels, while Nvidia is a Hold. It is better to wait for Nvidia to go down below $25 before making any additional entry position. A retracing is likely to happen, given the latest spikes and upgrades. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
