Intel: Preparing For Bad News - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha IDC's Q2 PC shipment estimate was worse than expected. We'll get quarterly results from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) on Wednesday afternoon. Unfortunately for investors, the PC industry appears to be quite weak again, and warnings have come in fast and furious. Intel analysts continue to lower their estimates, and the expectation seems to be that the company will reduce its 2015 forecast this week. Today, the key question seems to be not if we'll receive bad news from Intel, but how much bad news will we get? There weren't a lot of high hopes for Q2. The stronger dollar has resulted in higher PC prices overseas, hurting demand. Also, we saw a bump this time last year due to the end of Windows XP support, sending quarterly comparison figures higher. Add in the fact that Windows 10 is about to launch, and inventory levels are being reduced. IDC is estimating that PC sales fell 11.8% year over year in Q2, about a percentage point worse than originally thought. Gartner is a little less pessimistic, only calling for a 9.5% decline. For the full year, both research firms are looking for low to mid single digit PC sales declines. Expectations for Intel cratered after the company's big Q1 warning back in March. At that point, analysts were looking for 4.3% revenue growth this year and 3.0% EPS growth. Estimates came down, and at the company's Q1 report , Intel guided to "approximately flat" revenues for 2015. In addition to the negative estimate out of IDC, we've seen a number of negative reports from other players in the space, detailed below: June 25th: Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) falls after miss and weak guidance . July 9th: Intel slumps after QLogic (NASDAQ: QLGC ) issues Q2 warning . With so many warnings coming from the space, it probably is not a surprise that Intel estimates have come down. As I mentioned in my previous article on the name, the average revenue estimate was below the company's Q2 revenue guidance midpoint for $13.2 billion. As of Sunday, analysts have become even more negative, with the average Q2 estimate now at $13.07 billion. That's the lowest point that I've seen. Analysts also expect a 4 cent decline in EPS from the prior year period, which isn't too surprising given the expectation for a 5.5% decline in Y/Y revenues. I think the more important part of this week's report will be Intel's full year forecast. Management usually doesn't give numerical guidance for revenues, using words instead. So if the company does decide to reduce its yearly forecast, I'll be looking for something like "low single digit revenue decline" or "mid single digit revenue decline". The chart below shows how much the 2015 analyst revenue estimate average has come down since the Q1 warning. Intel analysts are now looking for revenues to decline by 1.7% this year, or almost $1 billion. It is clear that analysts are looking for Intel to reduce its 2015 forecast this year, because I wouldn't call a nearly $1 billion sales decline to mesh with guidance for "approximately flat" revenues. On the EPS front, analysts are looking for $2.11, down from $2.31 last year. Management will have plenty of questions to answer on the conference call, especially after the surprising recent executive shakeup , which included the departure of CFO Renee James. With the expectation that revenues will be lower than previously forecast, I'm interested to see how much Intel can cut costs. The company has an ongoing restructuring program, and the capex forecast was slashed a few months ago. Intel wants to save every penny possible, given its pending purchase of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) that will cost somewhere around $13 billion. Hopefully for the company, interest rates will stay fairly low, given the expectation for the Altera deal to be heavily financed with debt. When Intel reports this week, there is an expectation that we'll get some bad news. The key question is how much? Analysts expect revenues this year to decline by about 1.7%, basically meaning that Intel is expected to lower its revenue forecast. The Q2 data points we've seen have not been pretty, and a number of names have already warned. On the positive side, Intel shares have come down a bit, so I figure a good chunk of this weakness is priced in. As I mentioned in my previous article, the stock's valuation at less than 14 times expected EPS is rather fair, and the dividend yield is now above 3.29%. I'll be back after earnings to discuss Intel's Q2 report.
