Intel/Micron: 3D NAND And SSDs About To Explode - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The JV between Intel and Micron, "IMFT," concentrating on NAND and non-volatile memories, has been doing well and is about to explode (in the best sense of the word). August has a number of key dates for this JV and its technologies. Wall Street's sellside analysts are too busy looking at the wings on the fly on their windshields. They aren't looking down the road at the big picture when it comes to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ). They are concerned about the death of the PC, the tax rate and inventories in the case of Intel. They are concerned with a supposed Chinese bid, the death of the PC, and a Samsung yet-to-be-built fab in the case of Micron. One key area they are not currently writing about is one of the biggest near-term profit and revenue drivers: 3D NAND and SSDs built on this technology coming out of the IM Flash Technologies joint venture between the two companies. Refresher Course: How big is this SSD thing? Many will remember that these beans were spilled by Rob Crooke at the Intel Investor Day on November 20, 2014 . I don't remember a single Wall Street analyst report which focused on this crystal clear road sign in blazing neon. Here's slide 58 from that Investor Day: As slide-ware, investor-day-speak goes, this is pretty good: the star is November 2014 and they show us this market will be 50% penetrated by ~2018. But the real beef is in Crooke's remarks at about minute 1:32. There he states that the SSD industry has grown from $0 in 2008 to $13 billion in 2014 and is only 20% penetrated. Lets see. $13 billion/20% = $65 billion total addressable market. And what has IMFT done differently? Brian M. Krzanich, Intel Chief Executive Officer, reminded us there was something different in the IMFT recipe in these remarks from their recent earnings call : 3D NAND is looking quite good. From cost, yield and performance, I don't think we've gone public with much of those numbers right now. But what we have said is that 3D NAND, especially with the architectural choices that Micron and Intel chose, we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over their competitors, and those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process. (Author's emphasis added) We know one main architectural difference is Intel/Micron's adoption of a time tested floating gate technology vs. the charge trap selected by Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and SanDisk/Toshiba. And while there are many devotees of the chargetrap approach I think I will line up with Brian Krzanich, CEO of the largest chip company in the world, Micron and SA's own Russ Fischer, all favoring the floating gate approach. We won't know the results of this battle for quite a while and need to have IMFT floating gate parts in the wild which can be benchmarked and beat up. This will be a tech battle and press release frenzy that will out do the Edison vs. Tesla, DC vs. AC, Betamax vs. VHS, TDMA vs, CDMA battles of yesteryear. Here's Russ on charge trap vs. floating gate: Here's where it gets a little interesting. We know that the four 3D NAND suppliers are using different approaches to the technology. The biggest difference is that Intel/Micron picked floating gate as the storage element while Samsung and, apparently, everyone else chose a charge trap technology which is an easier technology to implement in a 3D structure. In recent analyst presentations by Micron management there have been hints that not all is well with the charge trap technology used or planned to be used by ... everyone but Intel and Micron. In a recent Jefferies presentation Kipp Bedard, VP of Investor Relations, mentioned that the Samsung charge trap is so leaky that a thumb drive full of pictures stored in a desk drawer might come up blank in six months. You can listen for yourself here at about minute 20. Now, Kipp has been around this business since Christ was a corporal and isn't likely to throw this kind of stuff out unless it's true because payback is really tough. What are the mileposts for which we should watch? August is going to be a terribly busy month and we are likely to get a whole lot more than a peek at what is going on with IMFT's 3D NAND and new non-volatile memory: Flash Memory Summit 8/11-8/13. I'll bet the talk by Darren Thomas Micron Analyst Day 8/14. I'm betting that Micron is about ready to hand some good news to their shareholders. Intel Developer Forum , 8/18 - 8/20. I think Intel will tell us why they have added persistent memory instructions like CLWB and PCOMMIT. I bet we see something new on persistent memory. United States Bankruptcy Court hearing in re: Energy Conversion Devices , 8/26. In his excellent article and comments thereto, Stephen Breezy makes the case that the ultimate resolution of the Energy Conversion Devices bankruptcy is critical to the rollout of PCM or phase change memory. This oft delayed case has a critical hearing on closing the case scheduled. Conclusions. The SSD opportunity will grow from $13 billion in 2014 to $32.5 billion in 2018 per the remarks of Rob Crooke cited above. Let me go way out on a limb here and theorize that the Intel/Micron approach will prove to be significantly better than Samsung's, which are already having problems with heat and random erasures in existing SSDs and may be lagging in 3D density. I believe there is a chance IMFT could secure half of the market when it is 50% penetrated in 2018. One-fourth to Micron for an additional $8 billion in revenue. One-fourth to Intel for an additional $8 billion in revenue. Make that $16 billion each when the market is fully penetrated.
