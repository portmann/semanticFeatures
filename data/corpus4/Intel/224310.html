Why Intel Is Better Positioned Than Qualcomm - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha While it's true that Qualcomm will have a better modem than Intel in 2016, the practicality of a faster modem has been mitigated due to network-specific constraints. Aside from better marketability there isn't a legitimate reason for packaging a faster modem. In other words, the uplink/downlink speeds of Qualcomm's upcoming modem is overkill. This exposes a weakness in Qualcomm's business model as Intel can simply price more competitively to gain modem designs over the next 12-month period. Furthermore, Qualcomm has shown a pattern of declining 4G LTE modem share over the past two years, and this pattern is unlikely to change going forward. However, green shoots are starting to form at Intel as the company has demonstrated a pattern of stabilization in the PC segment and growth in servers and mobile. For the most part, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock price has continued to rally over the past couple months. Some of this is driven by the momentum that leads up to the end-of-year shareholder meeting. Analysts, really look forward to this event because management shares a lot more insight into company earnings and its cost structure at the end of year shareholder meeting. For the most part though, I can get a basic sense for why investors are starting to get a lot more optimistic as the company has demonstrated that it has been able to gain some mobile share and may be on the cusp of winning key modem designs with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). While, rumors are just rumors, there's no denying that the company could compete with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) with an inferior modem design assuming they adjust their pricing. After all, unlike PCs where the CPU is the most expensive component, the modem is the most expensive piece of silicon inside of a smartphone. Assuming Intel prices its modem low enough Apple will likely bite. After all, I don't anticipate a noticeable difference in average uplink and downlink speeds due to the lack of network capacity to accommodate for higher average data speeds within the United States. The upcoming 9x45 MDM series performance improvement doesn't seem as significant when compared to the 9x35 MDM series. After all, Qualcomm states that the average data down link is 450 mbps whereas data up link is 100 mbps, the uplink speed improves by 2x when transitioning from the prior generation. However, these are peak speeds, which means that this is the maximum amount of data packets that the modem processor can realistically handle. However, current network providers never come anywhere near close to the packet processing capabilities of current modems due to cost constraints. The density of mobile stations would need to increase considerably to drive network wide improvements in average speed, but because telecoms are highly price competitive, they've lowered data pricing, which has pressured bandwidth on all of the major telecoms due to higher data usage. When looking strictly at the United States, the network is the biggest bottleneck to wireless data transfer rates, and not the modems within smartphone handsets. In other words, you could package an older modem from two to three generations ago, and you would not see speeds that are significantly slower. My Samsung Galaxy S3 has slower uplink and downlink speeds to my MacBook Pro, but when running speed benchmarks on the same Wi-Fi both modems produce the same results. The internet service provider is the bottleneck, and not the modems. Hence Apple could get away with packaging an inferior modem without any noticeable impact to the user experience as the Intel XMM 7460 modem is expected to top out at 300/50 mbps downlink/uplink, which is well above the average network speed. Hence, Intel doesn't need to provide the best-in-class modem, but rather the least expensive 4G LTE modem that can keep pace with average network speeds for the foreseeable two to three-year period. When looking over Intel's mobile market share, there has been a consistent trend in market share/sales improvement. The volumes have been nominal, but there's no denying that Qualcomm is starting to lose its grip of LTE Baseband unit market share, which is what contributed to the drastic decline in its valuation. While performance is a key aspect of winning designs, it seems OEMs are far more sensitive to pricing because having faster modems doesn't really amount to anything. There's no pressing need to package faster modems, and much of the growth is in the low-end where consumers could easily scrape by with basic 4G LTE designs. With the exception of Apple, everyone else is operating on razor thin margins, and not implementing higher cost components whenever necessary seems to be the path to the least resistance. We saw the same pattern emerge in the PC OEM space in the mid 2000s as Dell and HP focused on providing the key components that drive performance, but would often skimp on power supply units and chipset expandability. In an effort to lower cost at the mid to entry level, Dell would ship out PCs with 250W power supply units, cheap commodity RAM sticks and motherboards without any expandability. Now anyone who followed computing back in the mid-2000s knows that a good motherboard and power supply unit can extend the life of a PC considerably as you could switch out components as they become dated, but the OEMs didn't care. Just like the mobile OEMs of today will begin cutting corners whenever possible to preserve margins and remain somewhat competitive. So where does this leave Qualcomm? Well, it's going to have to price down its SKUs and leverage its global volume and key supplier relationships to price aggressively. But that really hasn't resonated with shareholders as gross margins have been pressured due to a variety of reasons. On the QTL side operating metrics weakened due to lower royalty rates in China, but on the QCT side it was lower pricing on slowing volumes. Hence, the only real reason for buying Qualcomm is due to its low valuation when compared to the average market valuation. There's no denying that balance sheet metrics have been strong and various efforts to appease shareholders through higher buyback authorization have put a floor underneath QCOM stock. The competitive dynamics of the space haven't been good for Qualcomm, and given how forward looking markets are, it's no wonder Intel is gaining momentum. There are fewer holes to Intel's business model, and while growth is limited in terms of PC units there has been a lot of momentum in higher margin categories. Also, Intel has demonstrated that it can at least sustain a healthy growth rate and once PCs bottom out the growth trajectory seems appealing given its relatively low valuation (14.6 times earnings). Therefore, Intel remains the better choice between the two. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
