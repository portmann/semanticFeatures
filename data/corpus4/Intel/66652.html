Intel: Samsung Is Working On A Tablet With An Atom X5 Processor And 4GB Of RAM - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Geekbench 3 test results reveals the Samsung Chopin LTE Android 5.1 tablet uses the new 14-nanometer Atom x5-Z8500 processor. The Samsung Chopin LTE Android tablet has 4GB of RAM, which should make it great for multitasking and gaming. Samsung is still the world's top vendor of Android tablets and smartphones. Intel is wise to try and win the full backing of Samsung. A benchmark test result on Primate Labs' Geekbench 3 page revealed that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has an Android 5.1 tablet with an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Cherry Trail Atom x5-Z8500 processor. The Samsung "Chopin LTE" Android tablet also comes with around 4GB of RAM, which convinces me that it will be a premium tablet that could compete with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Air 2. The impressive Geekbench 3 benchmark scores of the Samsung Chopin LTE tablet is on par with the $549 Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface 3 Windows 8.1 tablet, which uses an Intel Atom x7-Z8700 processor and 4GB of RAM . Microsoft and Samsung are now imitating the example set first by ASUSTeK's ( OTC:ASUUY ) use of 4GB RAM inside an Android phablet. I expect Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) to also release a more expensive (4GB RAM and Intel Cherry Atom x5 version) of its amazing N1 Android tablet. After a successful debut in China, Nokia is now selling the Intel Atom BayTrail-powered, 2GB RAM-equipped N1 tablet for $270 in Taiwan. The support of Samsung is a very important future tailwind for Intel's new Cherry Trail mobile application processors. Samsung remains the top vendor of Android tablets. The company managed to sell 9 million tablets during the 1Q 2015 period. Samsung Android tablets greatly outsell the competing Android tablets from Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) and ASUSTeK. During the 1Q 2015 period, Lenovo only managed to sell 2.5 million tablets, while Asus sold 1.9 million. Samsung is therefore Intel's best hope for its new 14-nanometer Cherry Trail tablet application processors. Avast has confirmed that ASUSTeK's upcoming ZenPad tablets will come pre-installed with Avast's Mobile Security app, and will also use the Atom x3 processor. However, the ZenPad 7 Android tablet might just be another product that will receive a $3 per unit subsidy from Intel. The premium vibe of the Samsung Chopin LTE and Microsoft Surface 3 compels me to believe that Intel won't be subsidizing them. Samsung has the marketing budget to theoretically sell 5 million to 10 million units of Intel Atom x5-powered Android or Windows 10 tablets annually. Intel's huge operating losses on its mobile chips could go down if Samsung really releases a $400 or $500 Intel-powered tablet that will compete with the iPad Air and Surface 3. Instead of subsiding 20 million cheap Atom x3-powered Android tablets with $3 each, Intel will likely gain $3 or more for every premium tablet that Samsung and Microsoft will sell. The bigger picture also includes the possibility of Samsung countering the global threat of the $299 Asus ZenFone 2 with a $300 Galaxy phone also equipped an Intel Atom Cherry Trail processor and 4GB of RAM. The $555 Samsung Galaxy A7 phablet uses the overheating Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). It is high time for Samsung to also try the non-overheating Intel Bay Trail Atom Z3580 SoC used by Asus for the ZenFone 2. Samsung is still the runaway leader in smartphone shipments. Unfortunately, overheating issues on some mid-range Galaxy smartphones is bad for the company's reputation. The potential benefit of Intel-powered smartphones from Samsung is substantial. If we use TrendForce's data, Samsung shipped out more than 80.8 million smartphones during the first three months of 2015. Asus is confident of selling 25 million ZenFone 2 handsets this year. However, Samsung has a much bigger advertising budget, wider carrier support, and a vast global distribution channel than Asus. Samsung could also deliver at least 25 million Intel Atom-powered smartphones. Samsung's decision to try the Atom x5-Z8500 SoC for its Chopin LTE Android 5.1 tablet could lead to the company also using x86 Atom mobile processors for some future Galaxy smartphones. The total addressable market of smartphone processors is much bigger than that of tablet processors. According to IDC's latest quarterly report, the smartphone remains the fastest-growing category until 2019. Smartphone sales have a 5-year CAGR of 8.5% - twice higher than that of tablets/2-in-1s. INTC is a Buy . The company is gaining wider industry support for its x86 Atom mobile processors, and yet, it still has lower P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios than its peers in the Technology sector and the Semiconductor industry.
