Intel restructures new products group - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Apr 29 2015, 04:01 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is reorganizing its operations responsible for helping move the company into new products, establishing what it calls the new technology group, which will combine a number of R&D efforts into a single organization. The change will shift around a number of key executives, including Mike Bell, who formerly carried out those operations in the company's new devices group and led the chip maker's push into wearable devices. Personally..  given INTC's lack of true performance in Mobile and new products..  I can't blame Kryzanich for shaking things up.  What was, wasn't working.  I'm sure some good people will be impacted.  But INTC needs to fix it's ills. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
