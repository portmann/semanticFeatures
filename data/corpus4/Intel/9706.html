Intel: Mistakes And Opportunities - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disappointment is widespread that Intel management did not accurately forecast declining desk top PC sales. Intel is a complicated beast of a company with many inter-related and complementary platforms. Intel now has a clear strategy to take advantage of the more mobile computing made possible by the advancement and evolution of Moore's law. More focus is needed on partnering with PC OEMs to market current products and surprise us with new product launches. Disappointment is widespread that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) management did not accurately forecast a decline in desk top sales to the tune of $900m in a quarter (some sales drop was also related to reduced inventories of laptop products). I look forward to hearing more about this decline and steps to address the decline at the April 14 Intel earnings conference call. When I first got involved in Intel (mid 2014), I quickly realized that Intel is a complicated beast of a company. The list of products, divisions and platforms is huge. Getting comfortable with Intel took awhile. As I studied Intel I began to understand its current structure and strategy. Basically Intel provides technology end to end from the data center, to PCs, to phones, to wearables, to IoT. All of these platforms build on each other and support each other. All use Intel's IP across multiple platforms. All use Intel's fabs across all platforms. The IP developed for one platform is used in other platforms. The fab technology is used across all platforms. This multiple platform use of IP and fabs provides huge economies of scale. Each of the platforms support the other platforms. For example, the breadth of the fab use across all platforms reduces R&D and production costs for new nodes...for all platforms. Another example, increased sales in IoT products will support lower unit costs in data centers as well as greater demand for data center capacity. The multiple platform IP and fabs not only support lower costs, the multiple platform IP and fabs also support increased demand for Intel products. Some of that demand is caused by increased need for computing and storage and some results from better technology and lower costs (as costs decrease and technology improve new products create greater demand for more new products). In 2014, Intel Data Center Group (DCG) sales accounted for 47% of Intel's profits. Given the 15% plus growth in DCG growth and the reduced desk top sales, DCG now probably accounts for 50% of all Intel's profits. These DCG profits (now and in the future) would not be possible without PCs, phones, wearables and IoT. I have read many people writing that other companies have their sights on data center sales and that other companies have products targeted at data center sales. When I target shoot with a rifle, setting my sights on a bull's eye or targeting my gun on a bull's eye does not come close to guaranteeing that I will shoot even near the target. It takes many years of practice to be an expert at hitting your mark. Intel has many years of experience in meeting the changing needs of data centers. Some competition is good at keeping Intel on its toes and keeping regulators away while assuring Intel customers that Intel is providing good value to data centers. Intel Now Making up for Missing Mobile Yes, Intel missed that Moore's Law (Intel) is driving and allowing computing to be more mobile. Intel is now focused on mobile (laptops, phones, wearables, IoT, etc. and servicing the needs created by these mobile devices with data center offerings). Intel has identified 2015 as the year to develop broad mobile IP that will be used across all platforms. Intel's Skylake will also focus on taking advantage of the mobility allowed by Moore's Law advancement and evolution. Some people don't think Moore's Law should be called a law. It is actually an observation that is commonly referred to as a law because it has been shown to be true over and over even as it evolves to refer more generally to the observation that advancements in technology are quickly replaced by new technology that is smaller, less expensive and higher performance. Intel has done a great job of looking where they want to go and then going there. This forward looking skill is seen in their product development. I continue to watch for more such developments. I want to be surprised when a product is ready to go and I want the competition to be surprised when the product is ready to launch. One such launch that I want to be a surprise is the sale of Skylake computers with Windows 10. Stronger Marketing Partnerships with Intel PC OEMs However, looking where Intel wants to go and taking steps to get there is not so evident in the marketing of their current product line. A lot more can be done to manage this Intel beast in the area of marketing current products for increased sales. For example, Intel's smaller, lower power use chips allow laptops to be smaller, lighter and have longer lasting batteries with fewer wires to connect to other devices. These advancements result in real tangible benefits to businesses and incredible opportunities to market new laptops to businesses. Increased marketing partnerships with OEMs would be a great step to increasing laptop sales today. This marketing could highlight the best use of Intel's current products. This marketing partnership with PC OEMs could also be used to make sure that PC OEMs provide high quality products from the start of a new Intel product line. I realize that in the past I have said that if I felt the need to tell Intel how to run the company, I would not be invested in Intel. However, since I am invested in Intel and Intel slipped up with their desk top PC forecasting, I feel the need to share my thoughts with Intel management: put more emphasis on partnering with PC OEMs to market current products and surprise us with new product launches. Some of you may be following my investing drama. Here's a brief update. I started investing in the stock market in 2013 with a $100k Roth account. I became bored with stocks so I focused on options as a faster way to reach my financial goals of accumulating $4m to retire and travel. I found short term options were too risky, so I honed in on long term options...sometimes referred to as LEAPS. I coined the phrase: LEAPS for Fun and Profit. I have experienced many huge swings in my $100k Roth account including: $100k to $69k to $250k to $200k to $600k to $109k to $650k to $300k to $855k to $170k to $250k (current status). You get the idea. Right now the account is focused on Intel and RiteAid (NYSE: RAD ). RiteAid is currently driving the increases. Nearly all of this account is invested in Jan 2016 call options which I plan to sell way before January 2016. Approximately 5,000 Intel option contracts are held in this account. Most at $40 and $45 strike. While some have chosen to exit Intel options and possibly re-enter later this year, I retain my options based on my research related to Intel strategies and implementation. A month ago I thought of my position in Intel options as sitting comfortably on a four legged chair. The four legs of this Intel chair were: increased DCG sales/profits, increased sales/profits with Skylake/Windows 10, lower mobile losses and earnings exceeding guidance every quarter in 2015. With the fourth leg broken, I am now balanced uncomfortably on a three legged chair still sitting on my options. (click to enlarge) The last half of the year will build steam since the lowest quarter of the year is the first quarter and the peak is the fourth quarter...along with the prospect of increased PC sales with Skylake and Windows 10. From Intel's Annual Report: Seasonal Trends. Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. To get above $40 by January 2016 will require a significant increase in earnings. With a P/E (Price to Earnings ratio) of 14 Intel would need annual earnings of about $2.85 to reach $40. $3 earnings and a P/E of 15 would get Intel to $45. Analyst annual earnings estimates for Intel dropped from $2.38 to $2.14. Intel guidance on April 7 will be critical. If Intel still guides to 5% annual growth in sales then earnings of $2.50 are easily doable. To reach earnings of $2.85, Intel would need to beat their own guidance by 14%. This is possible if they beat guidance for the last three quarters of the year. Lots of numbers and reduced hope, but still hopeful. At the Intel earnings conference call on April 14 I will be listening for updates on my four legged Intel chair. Are the remaining three legs intact? Is Intel quickly regrowing its fourth leg like a sea star regrows its limbs? Or will I end up sitting on a two legged chair ? Studies have found that sitting for longer than four hours increases a person's risk of chronic illness, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease. This chair is not meant to be sat in for long periods, just a couple of hours at a time. The chair creates a slight discomfort, as the user has to keep shifting position to keep it stable.
