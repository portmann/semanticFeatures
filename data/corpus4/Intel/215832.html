Intel's Memory Push Is Huge For Its Data Center Business - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel announced that it will invest up to $5.5 billion in its Dalian, China fab over the next 3-5 years for producing SSDs. This is a huge development for the company's data center business, as its long-term goal is to become a complete provider of data center solutions. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced last week that it will invest up to $5.5 billion into its Dalian, China wafer fabrication facility to transform it to a production base of leading-edge non-volatile memory. The facility, which has been in operation since 2010, currently manufactures Intel's 65nm chipsets for laptops, PCs and servers. Earlier this year, the company announced that in collaboration with Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ), it will develop 3D NAND flash memory chips based on the 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technologies. Many industry observers are speculating that Intel's recent move can prove to be a threat to Micron, with chipzilla possibly lowering its reliance on the JV with Micron. Needham downgraded Micron to "Hold" from "Strong Buy", stating : Intel currently holds about 2.7% market share in NAND versus Micron's 16.5%. While details are still emerging as to Intel's plans, its focus on the nonvolatile memory market leaves us feeling that the pricing and supply/demand environment could come under pressure. Yes, certainly. It's true that Intel currently has a small share in the NAND market, but it is aiming at grabbing a bigger slice from competitors like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ), SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) and even its partner Micron. In a previous article , I analyzed how SanDisk's enterprise SSD products were poised to drive its growth and share price. Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk will certainly strengthen its enterprise SSD product line, but Intel is silently emerging as a tough competitor for the leading players in today's enterprise SSD market. The revamp of Intel's Dalian, China facility is a significant step in that direction. For Intel, the NAND market is very important for its data center business. The company's long-term goal is to become a complete provider of data center solutions beyond server chips, such as fabric, silicon photonics and non-volatile memory. Combined with its core x86 server chip revenue, these solutions have the potential to grow Intel's overall data center revenue at a much higher CAGR than the general expectation. With the company having huge unutilized fab (wafer fabrication facility) capacity, expanding its non-volatile memory business certainly makes sense. In fact, it can't afford not to be in the SSD game. Intel can't afford not to be in the SSD market In today's era of software-defined storage, processors and SSDs remain tightly coupled in a server's memory-CPU channel, wherein SSDs are used as server accelerators. Keeping cache and memory, including NAND chips, closely tied in a server's memory-CPU channel results in optimal performance as long as SSDs are used as server accelerators. Intel makes / will make lots of money by selling commodity server chips, but by selling application-specific SSDs along with these chips, the semiconductor giant can generate huge additional revenue. How can it afford not to do that, with its huge unutilized capacity in fabs? When SSDs are used exclusively for storage purpose, they might be kept elsewhere outside the server. In such cases, processors are irrelevant. However, Intel is aiming at redefining the boundary between memory and storage, which, in essence, means that SSDs will act as either memory or storage or both, depending on the situation. Although processors are irrelevant here, Intel's SSDs will see greater demand than that of competitors due the x86 platform compatibility. In a virtualized environment, software assumes significant role, and as I have said repetitively in my previous articles, Intel is investing huge money in developing a standardized software ecosystem for data centers. Such a software ecosystem will strengthen the platform compatibility, leading to more demand for Intel's NAND products. Altera acquisition will boost Intel's NAND chip business Altera's FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) are widely used in enterprise SSD systems. Intel's plan is to make advanced server chips leveraging Altera's innovative FPGA architecture. The company will certainly take advantage of Altera's FPGA architecture in building its NAND chips as well. Intel and Micron, via their JV known as Intel Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT), are in the process of making 3D XPoint chips that would be capable to access data 1000x faster than currently available NAND chips. Intel is also planning to introduce NVMe (non-volatile memory express) infrastructure for XPoint. Altera's newly developed storage reference design based on its Arria 10 SoCs can double the life of NAND chips, according to a recent report . The Altera acquisition will help Intel develop super-fast 3D NAND chips with improved longevity. Intel said it is aggressively working on bringing its 3D XPoint-based Optane technology-supported SSDs to the marketplace, possibly as early as in next year. Micron now seems to be more of a competitor for Intel than a partner. Replacing spinning disk drives with high-density NAND chips helps data centers mitigate critical challenges, to a certain extent, for improved I/O performance. Since NAND chips are capable of delivering fast writing performance at a significantly lower cost per bit, data centers are fast adopting them. Although the future of storage still lies in hybrid systems comprising of flash and spinning disk, Intel's NVMe-accessed 3D NAND chips might alter the equation in favor of flash. That's why I believe the company's memory push in the form of investing up to $5.5 billion to its Dalian, China facility in phases is a huge development for its data center business.
