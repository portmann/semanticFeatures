Intel To Slump In 2016, Thrive In 2018 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Reasons for Intel's slump in 2016: PC is good enough, smartphone is the new tech, the 3D XPoint Osborne effect, various promises of better tech to come, investments in future tech, a floundering economy. Reasons for it thriving in 2018: PC is so much better, super-smart phone, 3D XPoint spurs new processor purchases, new tech arrives (autonomous devices drive IoT and DC), new tech too good to pass up. It is a rainy day in the mountains. I'm inside at my very old PC, contemplating the timing of the future for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). More and more news reports are supporting the notion that Intel will continue to slump in 2016. Tech promised by Intel management in prior years is not ready for mainstream world markets. The economy continues to teeter back and forth. Intel is making many investments in future tech, and the Osborne effect is alive and kicking back. My PC is ancient. Because of the teetering economy, I continue to wait for that promised new tech that is not quite here yet. This economy means that many people have a higher bar for spending money on a new PC. For now, my iPhone satisfies my craving for new tech. The new tech that is not quite here includes wireless docking (sure, it is here for tech nerds... we need it for the masses), wireless charging (same thing), no more passwords (same thing), and natural interface (if Siri were my personal assistant, I'd fire her). This new tech takes time to catch on and become mainstream. A shift to increasing PC sales requires hugely faster compute ability, along with good reasons for why we need that faster compute ability. I can see these faster speeds coming, along with reasons for needing faster compute ability. I am going to wait for either the economy to get better, for the PC to be so much easier to use or for the need for faster compute ability to be more compelling. Sure, there are lots of people and companies that will continue to buy a PC to meet their needs. PCs are still a huge part of Intel's business, and PC demand is not going to fall off a cliff. But it will take significant improvements in compute ability and compelling compute needs before the slowing of PC sales turns around. It used to be that the PC improvements from year to year were so great that buying a new PC was a necessary event every few years. Not so now. Now, my PC can do what I need it to do, and the grass is greener in the future. In the future, I will buy a new PC. Sales will continue to drop in 2016. Like many people, I enjoy new tech. A PC is not cutting it anymore to give me my new tech high. My iPhone is the go-to source for a new tech high. Intel continues to work on getting into the broader mobile movement, but is not significantly in the smartphone craze. Intel is making many investments in future tech. These include 10 nm silicon, IoT, wearables, Network Function Virtualization, 3D XPoint, super-smart phones and autonomous devices. All of these investments are necessary and appropriate for the future of Intel. However, they are a drag on profits, especially when sales are slumping. I have estimated that the company invests about $30 billion a year in new tech. This includes R&D, facilities to build new tech and employee stock options to encourage new tech. The Osborne effect is a term referring to the unintended consequences of a company's pre-announcement made either unaware of the risks involved or when the timing is misjudged, which ends up having a negative impact on sales of the current product. There is no question that the Osborne effect had huge consequences for Osborne Computer Corp. as a company (bankruptcy). The impact on Intel sales are much more subtle, but it is there. We see this in people waiting to buy a PC until new tech arrives. We are now seeing this effect in the data center as companies delay new processor purchases waiting for SkyLake, and then waiting for 3D XPoint. The teetering economy amplifies the impact. In a booming economy, people and companies are more likely to buy new tech and not think about waiting for the next advancement. However, in a weak economy, the Osborne effect becomes another excuse to wait. Do I need to elaborate? The economy continues to flounder and teeter back and forth. Will it sink? The future is uncertain. The result is that our purchasing of new tech is subdued. This does not rhyme as well as the Zager and Evans chorus lyrics, but it is a lot sooner than the year 2525... and Intel's survival through 2018 is not a question. PC Improvements and the Super-Smart Phone By 2018, the PC should successfully have wireless docking, wireless charging, no need for remembering passwords, should truly be a personal assistant with natural interfaces, and we should be able to carry the PC brains in our pocket. The PC and smartphone are moving in the same direction from opposite ends of the size spectrum. Smartphones started small and are now getting bigger and more compute-powerful. PCs are getting smaller and less power-hungry. The convergence of these two devices will be pretty evident in 2018. I call this device the super-smart phone. Will the PC side get a bigger market share than the mobile phone side as compute power becomes more important in handheld devices? Will the higher compute power of the Intel system be able to compete against lower power use of ARM? The answer to this is complicated and depends on many factors, including how fast silicon technology develops, how fast software develops, how fast the maker world develops compelling applications, how fast autonomous devices gain acceptance, and how fast Big Data Analytics and High Performance Computing permeate societal improvements. Not only will 3D XPoint generate new profits for Intel, but the new tech is best used by new processors. Achieving 1,000 times faster access to huge amounts of data is a compelling reason to buy 3D XPoint and the new processors needed to support 3D XPoint. Intel is leading the movement to replace single-purpose processors in the telephone industry with general purpose processors accelerated and customized on the fly by FPGA technology. This revolution will be in full swing in 2018, as this technology will be a critical part of achieving 5G by the end of the decade. NPV will be a $10 billion-plus business for Intel. Autonomous devices could become a $10 billion business for the company as more and more devices need the superfast computing ability that Intel provides. The company is also gearing up to integrate right into the silicon processor the IP needs for autonomous devices. By 2018, the new tech in mainstream computing devices will be too good to pass up. From easy to way cool to incredibly useful to essential to compete, the reasons to buy new tech will be compelling and mainstream. Going low in stock is not to be sought after as it is in Limbo competitions. Then again, maybe buying put options would be a way to profit from Intel going low. The stock touched $25 briefly in 2015, and I expect INTC to reach $25 again sometime in 2016 as revenues, and especially earnings, continue to drop. I expect this low point to be reached sometime between April and October. Doom and gloom for 2016 and huge profits for 2018. What about 2017? What happens to Intel stock in 2017 (and the last half of 2016) will likely be a function of the economy. If the economy strengthens and becomes more certain, INTC could surge ahead on the promise of new tech late in 2016 or in 2017. If the economy continues to flounder and teeter, then late 2017 or 2018 will see higher Intel sales and profits. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
