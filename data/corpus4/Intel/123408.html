How Intel Doubles In Size From Here - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel might be the most important company in the world. The 10 nm pushout is a juke move by Intel. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is composed of two primary businesses - the Client Computing business (PCs) and the Data Center business (server chips). All other Intel businesses, if combined, would be in bankruptcy. Critics of Intel point out that the client computing segment is declining and seem to imply that the end point is zero. In fact, the client computing business is about $35 billion in revenue, sporting a 75% gross margin. The client computing business has, as Jack Rivkin says , made Intel the most important company in the world. PCs have funded Moore's Law at Intel for 35 years. Moore's Law, in turn, has driven progress, in all its forms, in the semiconductor business. Without the manic progress of Moore's Law the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone would not be possible, as well as most other high technology gadgets. Personal computing has stimulated the growth of the Internet (data traffic), which in turn made high performance servers (PC chips on steroids) necessary, hence the second major Intel business - the Data Center Business. This is a $15 billion 90% gross margin, rapidly growing business supplying an array of unbelievably complex and high performance computer processing chips to support all the data generated by the fruits of Moore's Law everywhere. Intel is further criticized for missing the mobile business opportunity. Intel certainly did miss the shift from simple cell phones to the much more complex smartphones in use today. Intel, at the time, was dealing with very high and increasing complexity in microprocessors for client and server applications while the cell phone industry was increasing complexity from a very low level to levels that could support today's smart functions. That these two efforts didn't connect is very understandable. So, the Intel we see today is made up of $50 billion worth of incredibly profitable business and $5 billion of small or unprofitable businesses. How does Intel double its revenue from here? As I see it, there are only two semiconductor businesses of sufficient scale and process sophistication to be of interest to Intel. One is the storage business and the other is the "missed" mobile business. The Intel/Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) joint venture in non-volatile memory has produced what appears to be an impressive solution to 3D NAND memory to be used in solid state drives (SSD). The NAND based SSD opportunity is said to be a $65 billion business that's only 20% penetrated at this point. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is the first supplier to enter production on 3D NAND and has been ramping production for the past year. Recent industry whispers would indicate that Samsung is having difficulties with their approach to 3D NAND. The highest density device available from Samsung is a 128Gb TLC part while the first device from Intel/Micron will be a 384Gb chip, three times the Samsung capacity. In answer to a question during the recent earnings conference call no less than the CEO of Intel, Brian Krzanich, said, "But what we have said is that 3D NAND, especially with the architectural choices that Micron and Intel chose, we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over their competitors, and those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process." If Samsung is in trouble with 3D NAND and with Hynix and SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) (both claim to be using charge trap approaches) nowhere in sight for production of 3D NAND, Intel and Micron could divide the $65 billion SSD business that promises to develop over the next 3-5 years. Picking through a variety of documents and the great SA article by Stephen Breezy on recent Intel patent applications we can see that the Intel/Micron joint venture is getting ready to launch "new non-volatile memory." You might wonder, "Why a new NV memory when you have this wonderful 3D NAND beginning a production ramp?" The answer is that this nonvolatile memory is actually a Random Access Memory (RAM). This is expected to be a replacement for both on-chip cache SRAM and system DRAM. A comment in Breezy's article points out that the proposed Phase Change Memory/w Switch (PCMS) is "significantly cheap and denser" than DRAM. If PCMS is cheaper and denser than DRAM it will be much, much cheaper and denser than SRAM, which now takes up over half of the silicon area in state of the art mobile SoCs. NV RAM used in mobile application processors and as a replacement for DRAM system memory will allow much lower power levels and associated longer battery life in any mobile device. Process node is no longer as important for mobile devices as it was 2-3 nodes ago. It's all about power consumption now and, of course, package heat (might ask Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) about that). So NV RAM used in mobile devices is the "compelling feature" that could get Intel virtually all the mobile chip business as new designs replace old designs. The mobile business of interest to Intel is the AP, LTE chip and the DRAM that would become PCMS. A very rough estimate of the total mobile business of interest for Intel could be as high as $60 billion. I view this a maddening "juke"* by Intel for the foundries that are trapped into spending like drunken sailors. As the lithography nodes get more difficult and expensive it really makes sense to run the nodes longer over three chips rather than two chips per node. If Moore's observation is basically about cheaper transistors, there may be better ways to get the desired density and cost. 3D NAND for memory is a good example. In 3D NAND the lithography is relaxed while the vertical direction is exploited. As a little side note here, in order to exploit the vertical direction, etching technology becomes more important than lithography technology. High aspect ratio etching is very difficult to do with perfectly straight sides. Finfet technology requires mastery of etching technology. You can see the progress made by Intel from first generation finfet to second generation finfet. The fins in the first generation were trapezoidal - in the second generation the fin sides have almost no slope. It seems that progress in finfet etching leads to progress in etching the 3D structures in the new NAND process. There is already a vertical layer increase and a lithographic shrink in the roadmap for the Intel/Micron 3D NAND. At the end of those advances (2-3 years), the original 384Gb chip will become 1152Gb chip, or the equivalent of a 144GB single chip SSD. I find that amazing. In the example above, the new NV RAM memory cell will be as effective in reducing cost as a traditional lithographic shrink would be. A significant reduction in power also will come with that new memory cell. So, a dash to 10nm is no longer necessary or even desirable. For Intel a new tick, tock, tock cycle will reduce capex and associated depreciation by about a third. The part of R&D that is expensed capital purchases should also decline by a third. Both of these enable more of that gross profit to appear at the bottom line. Moore's Law can live on as advances in exotic materials or mastery of 3D technology. As the cost of design for complex custom chips at the bleeding edge of technology increases, field programmable technology makes more sense than ever before. Moving the design load to the customer improves cost and time to market while allowing Intel to produce a small number of high function and high quality FPGA SKUs. Since the interconnect fabric of FPGAs has always been SRAM, I think we will see some effort to replace those SRAM cells with PCMS cells discussed above. The FPGAs would become non-volatile, much smaller and still retain their ability to be re-programmed or programmed on the fly. Again, from Brian Krzanich during the earnings conference call: "Finally, integrating Altera's world-class technology with Intel architecture in the high-growth data center and Internet of Things market segments will create new product categories and capabilities." Now where did that come from? IoT parts will be of limited capability - can Intel be thinking of including a section of FPGA in these simple, cheap parts in order to transfer the design load to the customer and allowing for some serious custom design of low volume IoT devices? What if these sections were to use the PCMS memory cells as the FPGA interconnect fabric? The result will be tiny cheap power sipping chips of amazing flexibility and capability with surprisingly high gross margin to Intel. Maybe all this is why Intel is willing to pay an absolute ton of money for Altera. If FPGA blocks appear in nearly everything that Intel makes, the buy price for the company might look very reasonable in a few years. China's Tsinghau Unigroup is reputed to have made a $21/share offer to buy Micron. As a joint venture partner with Micron in some very important emerging memory technology, Intel would have a keen interest in how this comes out. It is hard to believe that Intel would want China as a partner in this technology. However, the fact is that Intel actually invested $1.5 billion into Unigroup last year. Uncle Sam might have an opinion on a China takeover of the only remaining western hemisphere memory manufacturer. Obviously, Micron shareholders will have to vote on any takeover. Since Intel is the only entity outside of Micron to know what is going on in the JV, they might choose to make an 11th hour offer to buy Micron in a stock swap. If the 3D NAND and NV RAM are as important as I think they are, no price would be too high to pay for Micron. There are a lot of moving parts in Intel right now. There is a cluster of meetings and presentations happening during the month of August that simply must flesh out information on the new memory initiatives. While Micron would be a buy for many reasons, Intel will wind up the end beneficiary of any of these new technologies and is, therefore, a strong buy at these low levels.
