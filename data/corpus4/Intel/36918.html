Intel Is Mispriced And Positioned For IoT Growth - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Analysts and investors still tie Intel's value to the PC market. This ignores the larger macro environment, which is shifting toward IoT. IoT will be larger than the PC market. Intel benefits from IoT adoption through embedded chip sales and increased server demand due to data growth. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is currently mispriced as analysts still tie the company's value primarily to PC sales and have failed to account for Intel's positioning in the Internet of Things ((IoT)) market. Looking at the larger macro environment, it's clear that IoT represents a far larger addressable market than the PC industry. This will likely be Intel's primary driver of growth in the future, and the company is positioned to benefit on two fronts. First, Intel's IoT Group provides embedded processors for smart devices. This allows them to benefit directly from IoT growth. Second, as exponentially more connected devices come online there will be a greater volume of data being produced. This will drive growth in the server market, which Intel currently has cornered. Many investors and analysts expressed concerns over the drop in Intel's Client Computing Group , where revenue fell 16% from Q4, and 8% year-over-year. Despite this large drop however, Intel's revenue remained flat year-over-year, primarily due to the rise in Data Center Group revenue (servers) and Internet of Things revenue (embedded chips). Instead of a sign of trouble, this quarter is a testament to Intel's success in establishing themselves in the IoT industry and diversifying their core business. The explosion of sensors in consumer goods and business machines will be a pivotal force in the tech industry over the next decade. Because we're in the early days of IoT growth - most Americans don't own even one wearable device yet, not to mention a connected appliance - the market is still extremely fluid. Intel has given themselves two ways to benefit from this trend. One is directly through their new IoT Group. This used to be the embedded division, which is primarily what it still provides - embedded processors for smart devices. Because most of these processors are variants on Intel's PC units, there's not much direct R&D expense here. This will eventually shift, as the PC business continues to slowly decline and wearables becomes a larger market. This should be a subtle, ongoing process however and is likely to balance itself out. Right now, Intel's IoT Group accounts for a relatively small percentage of their total revenue ($533 million last quarter), but is growing steadily (up 11% year-over-year). Given current trends, there is strong reason to believe this will eventually be a core component of Intel's business. Cisco has estimated that the IoT industry will be worth approximately $14 trillion by 2020, which gives a sense of just how large the potential market is. For comparison, worldwide PC revenue in 2020 is projected at roughly $600 billion . Such estimates should always be taken loosely, but they illustrate the overarching trend - PCs have a defined market and little room for growth, while the IoT market is vast and expanding. Intel is also betting aggressively on emerging trends within the IoT space. The latest example of this is their partnership with Ingenico Group to create secure mobile tablets targeted at retailers who need to upgrade their payment terminals for the upcoming EMV credit-card switch. Intel is often portrayed as dependent on the PC-industry, but doesn't receive enough credit for consistently expanding into new areas and pursuing alternative ventures. The second part of Intel's IoT positioning is their server business, which Intel accounts for as the Data Center Group. Revenues here increased 19% year-over-year to hit $3.7B for the quarter. Intel's dominance in the server chip market so far has enabled them to achieve extremely high margins on this division. The increase in sales here (and the decrease in the lower margin PC business) likely accounts for the increase in gross margin year-over-year from 59.6% to 60.5%. There are a few looming challenges for Intel's dominance in this market segment - notably IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - but it's unlikely that these companies will be able to make a significant dent in Intel's market share anytime soon. These details are relevant because as the IoT market expands, there will be exponentially more data being produced around the world. Wearable fitness trackers, thermostats, smart watches, appliances, and more (not to mention the vast area of business-facing IoT applications) will produce a constant stream of data. This information will have to be analyzed, stored, and accessed. More data means a greater need for servers, which means sales for Intel. Even accounting for lower server margins due to increased competition, Intel is positioned for success as the IoT market begins to truly take off over the next few years. The volume of data being created, and the greater demand for servers, should make up for any immediate margin loss. When these macro trends within the tech industry are taken into account, it shows significant potential upside for investors. Due to analysts' hesitation over declining PC sales, Intel's shares are currently cheap and the company is trading at a pretty conservative P/E multiple - especially compared to competitors such as ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) or Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ). Based on their market positioning and the projected growth of the IoT industry, investors should strongly consider Intel.
