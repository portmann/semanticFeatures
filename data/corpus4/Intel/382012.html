Intel has at least 25% upside - Barron's - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Apr 17 2016, 08:42 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reports on Tuesday post-market. Barron's suggests investors who don't already own Intel stay clear until after the call, then buy. Its case: The two things that will get Intel out of its long rut: i) For the server business to outstrip the PC one (already happening). ii) Earnings need to stabilize at Client Computing (last year they fell 21%). Barron's notes Intel can grow its smartphone-chip sales quickly from a small base. CEO Brian Krzanich has identified the data-center business, Internet of Things, and innovative memory technologies (which combine for 60% of Intel's operating profit) as key areas for growth. Credit Suisse has a $40 target on the stock, implying 25% upside, plus the dividend. Barron's says Intel could hit $48 (50% upside) by summer of 2018.
