Intel to secure EU okay for $16.7 billion Altera deal: sources | Reuters Shadows are cast near an Intel logo at the Intel booth during the 2015 Computex exhibition at the TWTC Nangang exhibition hall in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2015. BRUSSELS U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp is set to get the go-ahead from EU antitrust regulators for its $16.7 billion offer for Altera Corp, its largest ever deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The world No. 1 chipmaker is looking to Altera to reinforce its portfolio of higher-margin chips used in data centers and to focus on chips for cars, watches and other devices in a future  "Internet of Things". The highly fragmented chip industry has seen a wave of consolidation this year as companies beef up their capabilities and try to squeeze more technologies onto chips in response to demand for integrated suppliers. The European Commission will clear the deal without requiring concessions from Intel as it does not see any competition issues, the people said. A decision is scheduled by Oct. 14. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy did not immediately reply to an email for comment. Altera makes programmable chips used to speed up web searches and update social networks, among other uses. The Commission is now reviewing Avago Technologies' $37 billion offer for Broadcom Corp, the biggest ever deal in the sector.
