Learn more about PRO » Storage and OTN spending are proving volatile, but PMC-Sierra is well-placed to benefit from a Grantley-driven storage cycle, greater SSD adoption, and upcoming OTN deployments. PMC-Sierra is a high-performance niche specialist and that could appeal to several chip companies looking for defensible high-margin product revenues. Today's valuation already seems reasonable by discounted free cash flow, but the expected margin leverage can support an EV/revenue multiple that puts the stock in the mid-$9's. These aren't the best of times for the storage and carrier hardware industries, but PMC-Sierra (NASDAQ: PMCS ) is looking to leverage new product introductions, the move toward software-defined networking in the data center, and a capex shift toward optical transport networking (or OTN) equipment to drive a meaningful upturn in revenue and further leverage in margins. Mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit FCF growth can support today's stock price and the company's margins do argue for a higher revenue multiple than today's level. It's also worth noting that acquisition activity has picked up in the chip space and PMC-Sierra would fit in with multiple suitors that have the wherewithal to make a deal. I don't see a large discount to fair value here, but the company has a legitimate opportunity to gain share in multiple markets and the company is still of a size where a few extra points of market share can drive meaningful extra value. PMC-Sierra has a legitimate opportunity to drive meaningful revenue growth from the migration to 12G SAS controllers alongside the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Grantley server upswing and adoption of the company's SSD controllers, but that's not going to be a seamless process. Likewise with the transition toward OTN spending and PMC-Sierra's processors. Revenue rose 5% yoy in the first quarter (and fell 3% sequentially), led by the storage business which grew 11% yoy, even though this was hardly a banner quarter for large customers like EMC (NYSE: EMC ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ). Optical was weaker, though (down 4% yoy), and PMC-Sierra saw a lot of the same weakness that undermined many chip companies with significant exposure to carrier spending. For the very near term at least, those challenges will remain. Like so many of its peers (though notably not rival Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM )), PMC-Sierra guided down for the second quarter. The magnitude of the revision wasn't as bad (about 3% versus a peer average closer to 5%), but the range was rather wide (down 4% to up 4% relative to Q1) and there are risks that the inventory correction in storage could drag on for a few more quarters and/or that second half spending on OTN equipment doesn't pick up as hoped. PMC-Sierra has multiple opportunity to grab share from Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ), Intel, and Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL ) in the storage space and leverage a meaningful upgrade cycle driven by Intel's Grantley chips. PMC-Sierra's storage business has historically tracked the performance of Intel's Data Center Group pretty closely, so I'd keep an eye on Intel's performance as a bellwether for PMC-Sierra's prospects. PMC-Sierra already holds significant share in controllers, but management thinks that the migration to 12G SAS could add 10 points of market share. There's certainly a valid question as to whether that comes quickly (say in the next couple of years) or is a more extended process, and Avago isn't going to surrender ground easily. Flash controllers are likewise an opportunity for incremental revenue growth in the storage market. The company has recruited three hyperscale data center customers and that should leave the company in good shape to register good growth later this year, into 2016, and beyond. Given that PMC-Sierra's SSD controller business is aimed at the high end of the market, I like the company's prospects for good margins and defensible market share gains. PMC-Sierra didn't really cover itself in glory in the 40G market, but the company's OTN processors look better-placed for 100G. To be sure, management is not shy about expecting big things from this business, as they are targeting 40% share on the back of greater carrier commitments to OTN equipment. PMC-Sierra has scored numerous design wins, but that's only part of the battle. The company has a lot writing on actual deployments by Chinese carriers and domestic carriers like Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and communication capex orders can be frustratingly inconsistent and unpredictable. That's particularly true here of late with AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon reconsidering their capex plans in light of a move toward more regulation over broadband services. PMC-Sierra has been a very willing acquirer over the years, but may itself become a target in the not-so-distant future. This company tends to focus on high-spec niche markets and the end result is that it's not easy to swap out its products for rival offerings. While that forces the company to spend considerable sums on R&D and commit to long development timelines, it also supports strong gross margins (in excess of 70%). High-margin products with high-end capabilities and defensible market shares are appealing and I believe PMC-Sierra could be an appealing acquisition option for a range of companies, including Intel, Broadcom, Marvell, and Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ). Broadcom has publicly indicated that it is no longer pursuing large-scale M&A, but management has also said that they wouldn't rule out the right sort of deal and PMC-Sierra would make a certain amount of sense (as it would for Intel as well). What would make PMC-Sierra consider a sale? Should the storage and OTN spending cycles prove lumpier or longer than presently hoped, that could lead to pressure on management to deliver more immediate satisfaction to shareholders. I'd also note that product development is getting more and more expensive in the chip space, with many chip companies struggling to generate gross profit growth on par with R&D spending growth (Broadcom being one of the few to generally do so). A sale at an attractive premium would be one way for management to sidestep that looming problem, and a larger acquirer could look to leverage some R&D synergies and cost savings. Today's share price already seems to contemplate "mid-high" single-digit annualized revenue growth and a roughly five-point improvement in sustained FCF margins. That level of performance is not out of the question if management hits its targets with the 12G SAS and OTN opportunities, and I won't dismiss the possibility of outperformance (from these businesses as well as other opportunities like a new radio head product). I'd also note that the shares can move up to about $9.50 before trading at an EV/revenue multiple commensurate with the level of expected operating margins. All of that said, I don't see major undervaluation here. There aren't many cheap semiconductor stocks today (or at least not outside of "cheap for a reason") and there is operational upside here, but I'd want a better price given the risk of a longer wait for the storage and OTN opportunities to blossom.
