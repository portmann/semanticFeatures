Is Intel Trying To Hide Its Mobile Troubles? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has changed its financial reporting structure again. Mobile group is being merged with PC group. After the bell on Monday, we received some interesting news from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). The company announced that it would be changing its financial reporting structure beginning with the release of its Q1 2015 report. Normally, this news wouldn't have been that big, but it basically represents a 180-degree turn from what Intel did just a year earlier. In this article, I look at the latest news and see if the chip giant is trying to hide its mobile troubles. When Intel announced Q4 2013 earnings , the company had five reporting operating segments: PC Client Group, Data Center Group, Other Intel architecture operating segments, Software and services operating segments, and All other. Just a few months later, prior to the Q1 2014 report, the company announced that it was changing its financial reporting structure . At this time, the company announced a new operating segment, the Mobile and Communications Group. This segment included the Phone Group, Tablet Group, and Multi-Comm, all of which were previously in the Other IA operating segment. In the April 2014 release, the company stated the following: The company will revise the presentation of its operating segments to reflect changes in our organizational model, which are aligned with our critical objectives. Intel fell behind in the tablet race, and has been working to play catch up in recent years. The Mobile Group has seen some terrible results lately, reporting a $4.2 billion operating loss in 2014 after a $3.15 billion operating loss a year earlier. The group reported a paltry $202 million in revenues last year after nearly $1.4 billion in 2013. While the tablet and smartphone space is a large one that Intel can't ignore, many wonder if the company is wasting too much money trying to get its foot in the door. Intel did ship 46 million tablet chips in 2014, above its 40 million goal, but the losses did pile up. The hope for this year was that Intel could reduce its mobile segment operating losses by $800 million. That gets me to the company's most recent announcement, where Intel has decided to again change its financial reporting structure. The following statements are from the press release announcing the news: The company will revise the presentation of its operating segments to reflect the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group to create the Client Computing Group. The new group was created to address all aspects of the client computing market segment and utilize Intel's intellectual property to offer compelling customer solutions. Actual results will be reported with the first-quarter earnings report. At that time, Intel will also provide commentary on the company's goal to improve mobile profitability by $800 million in 2015. There are two key points to think about here. The first part is the smaller one, and that's the goal to improve mobile profitability by $800 million this year. One has to wonder if the company is failing to meet that goal, because I would think if Intel was ahead of the goal it wouldn't have changed its reporting structure. Even though the segment would still be showing losses, I would think the company would want to highlight progress being made. Intel did warn about Q1 revenues, so it is possible that results in the segment are not coming in as expected. The second part is the more major one in my opinion, and that is the thought process about the Mobile Group in general. By merging the segment with the PC Client Group, Intel can essentially hide its massive losses for the segment. In 2014, the PC Client Group had more than $14.6 billion in operating profits, and almost $35 billion in revenues. The Mobile Group's revenues last year would be almost a rounding error in this new segment, although the operating loss would be a bit more meaningful. While Intel is going to provide an update on the $800 million goal at the Q1 report, what happens at reports after that? The company may not discuss the matter again, and may not answer any analyst questions on the issue. I recently applauded Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) for its decision to become more transparent with the investment community. In that sense, I am a little disappointed with Intel's decision to merge these two business segments and become less transparent. If the mobile segment is doing poorly, it will be an unwelcome sign for Intel bulls. Just last month, I noted how Intel shares had rallied on a rumor of a potential Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) win to get a modem into an iPhone in 2016. Those that are fans of the chip giant were looking for the mobile segment to become a major revenue driver for Intel in the next couple of years. If that were to be the case, you would think the segment would have its own line in Intel's results, not merged in with a much larger PC group. Of course, Intel may decide to change its reporting segments again next year. In the end, Intel's recent financial reporting structure change leaves some interesting questions to be answered. It was just a year ago that the company broke out the Mobile and Communications Group in its results. Now, that segment has been merged into a new segment that includes the massive PC segment. Intel will provide an update on its $800 million mobile profitability improvement goal at its upcoming earnings report. One must wonder if that news will be negative, especially after the recent revenue warning. I'm a big fan of companies being more transparent with the investment community. Unfortunately, Intel is doing just the opposite here with a segment that is supposed to be very important moving forward. Source: Is Intel Trying To Hide Its Mobile Troubles?
