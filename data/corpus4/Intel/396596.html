Intel Starts To Face Reality - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has announced that it's discontinuing its Atom tablet and smartphone processors. This is not mere tactical retreat, but a true capitulation in the mobile space. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) announcement that it is discontinuing Atom processors for smartphones and tablets appears to have taken many by surprise. This decision was inevitable, but it's only the first step and the easier one. The much more difficult decision will be about where Intel goes from here. Those who have been following my coverage on Intel will know that I've been warning about Intel's retreat from the mobile space ever since its Investor Meeting back in November. By the time of Intel's 2015 Q4 earnings report in January, what had been merely retreat had become a full fledged mobile device capitulation in my view. At the time, I wrote: Theoretically, Intel still plans to move SoFIA (now fabricated by TSMC on a 28 nm process) to its own 14 nm process this year. I frankly doubt that Intel will bother. There is no market for it. By the time that Intel reported its 2016 Q1 earnings, it was becoming clear that major changes were approaching. An outsider and former executive with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Murthy Renduchintala, had been brought in to oversee Client Computing and IoT . Kirk Skaugen, head of the Client Computing Group, and Doug Davis, head of IoT Group, were made his direct reports. Shortly after, it was announced that Skaugen and Davis were leaving the company. When you peel back the PR spin, it becomes fairly obvious that these long-time Intel executives were no longer happy. What wasn't clear was what exactly they were unhappy about. But there were indications. At the Q1 conference call , Krzanich stated that Murthy was in charge of a comprehensive review of Intel products. There can be little doubt that the decision regarding the Atom X series (X3 SoFIA, X5 and X7) as well as the decision to pull the plug on the next generation Broxton Atoms was an output of Murthy's review. There have been a number of articles written concerning the decision, such as Patrick Moorhead's piece in Forbes and contributor Bruce Burnworth's article here on SA . What seems to be missing from these articles is any substantial consideration of why Intel made the decisions they did. Even now, there seems to be a reluctance, especially by Intel bulls, to acknowledge that the products failed. In light of the decision, that can be taken as a given. The more important question is why they failed, which no one seems to want to talk about. Intel's statements, which have been made in various forms since the Investor Meeting, that it is "shifting priorities" don't really constitute an answer to the question. They are merely descriptions of Intel's response to the situation. The answer to this question is really critical to evaluating Intel's response and ultimately Intel's value as an investment. But it isn't really a difficult question to answer, assuming one can achieve a modicum of emotional detachment. Fundamentally, the products were uncompetitive in the marketplace. Why weren't they competitive? For a long time, Intel bulls have extolled the virtues of Intel's technical prowess. They have asserted that Intel processors were the equal of any processor based on the ARM architecture licensed by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ). This is perhaps arguable, but let's accept it as true. If we accept that Intel mobile processors were not technically disadvantaged, then there is only one way in which they could fail to be market competitive, and that's based on cost. And this has been my fundamental premise for quite a while, going back to when Intel first instituted its "contra revenue" subsidies on tablet processors starting in 2014. The fact that "contra revenue" was even necessary was a huge clue, as was the subsequent huge loss of the Mobile and Communications Group of $4.2 billion in 2014. At the time, there were any number of rationalizations for the losses being offered by Intel bulls. I opted for the simplest explanation , that Intel's x86 architecture simply wasn't cost competitive with ARM. And I dared to suggest that Intel's strategy was a waste of time, and that it needed to come up to speed in designing ARM architecture processors. I'd like to take the opportunity to offer some observations about methodology. I'm sure it's clear to traditional journalists that I often violate journalistic convention. As a blogger, I have a little more freedom in that regard, which I enthusiastically exploit. Journalists are generally constrained to report facts which they have been able to verify with direct sources. In financial reporting, there's a dearth of high quality facts. Intel's decision regarding its mobile devices has probably been known within the company for some time, but only recently could be reported as fact. Such high quality facts are a comparative rarity. On the other hand, the Internet provides an abundance of low-quality data. Rumors, speculation, aberrant analyses, spin doctoring by spokespersons. In this context of often conflicting information, almost any point of view can be supported with relevant "facts." Doubtless there will be Intel bulls who will assert that the accuracy of my prognostications is mere luck and the product of my hostile attitude toward Intel. Invariably, when people disagree with my viewpoint, some negative emotional bias on my part is asserted. But I don't just write articles to grind an ax or promote a particular stock. This is getting the process backwards. What I do is sift through the huge pile of data, both high and low quality, to arrive at a picture of what's really going on in a particular company. That mental picture that I form is often at odds with conventional wisdom, prevailing views in the media, as well as the PR mouthpieces of the companies involved. The accuracy of the assessments about Intel that I made a couple of years ago was not the product of luck. While the analysis and conclusions that I offer may often be in contravention to traditional journalism, the accuracy of those conclusions has often been born out by subsequent events. Intel is a case in point. The implications of the lack of cost competitiveness with ARM extend far beyond the mobile space. If Intel couldn't be competitive in mobile against ARM processors, why does it think it will have any better luck against ARM processors in the data center or the Internet of Things? There's an obvious answer there, one the Intel bulls aren't going to like. Intel's decision to pull the plug on its Atom mobile processors is just the easy first step of the process. As I pointed out in "Intel's Choice: Retrenchment Or Transformation," Intel has to make a very fundamental decision about processor architecture - continue x86 or pursue ARM. The discontinuance of the Atoms is common to either branch in this decision nexus. Which branch Intel will opt for is critical. If Intel chooses retrenchment with x86 in its datacenter and IoT businesses, then Intel is doomed to a slow painful death. If Intel chooses ARM, it still has an uphill battle ahead of it. The baton of technical leadership has already passed to the companies that design their own unique ARM architecture processors: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Qualcomm, and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Intel will have to work hard to catch up to them. I don't regard retrenchment as a foregone conclusion, especially since an ex-Qualcomm man with experience in the ARM world appears to be in charge of this decision process. Until we hear more about this decision, I regard Intel as a hold. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, QCOM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
