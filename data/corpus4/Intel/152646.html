Intel And Micron: More On Memory - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha 3DXP will be a major product line in two years. 3D NAND is more important for the immediate future. A couple of weeks ago Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) treated us to a joint introduction of a new memory technology called 3D Cross Point memory. The new memory is to be built in the IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technologies) fab in Lehi, Utah. The memory is being promoted as a big deal. Micron's CEO, Mark Durcan, feels that 3DXP (a new acronym) will be a major product category for Micron by 2018. He specifically mentioned that it would be half the size of Micron's DRAM business. That would make it one-third of total Micron sales, or about $6 billion by that time. There is a lot of speculation on what 3DXP is, where it fits, and how much it should cost, etc. So, it's probably time to take a look at computing memory hierarchy and try to make some sense out of all this. Allow me to insert this before I begin: In the early days, Intel was formed as a memory company to make SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). The company's strategy was to use microprocessors as the leverage product to obtain a customer's memory business. Hold that thought. A computer system uses different kinds of memory for different things. At the top of the hierarchy is SRAM used as very high-speed cache memory. The story of cache memory is that a statistically small number of pieces of data and instructions make up the majority of use in a computer. So, rather than stuff this data a long ways away, the computer sticks it in the nearby fast cache memory where it can be retrieved quickly and re-used, thus increasing overall performance of the system. SRAM cache memory started out on the mother board of early computers and was supplied by third party memory manufacturers such as Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ: CY ) and Integrated Device Technology (NASDAQ: IDTI ). As systems become more complex, Intel began making the SRAM chips, first mounted on the mother board and then mounted near the CPU chip inside the CPU package. Finally, Intel integrated the SRAM cache onto the CPU chip. Does this begin to shed some light on the importance of having memory near the compute element? SRAM cache has grown to the point that it makes up over half the area of the CPU chip. The bit size of the cache is small (MB range), so this small memory size costs the computer buyer over $50, by far the costliest memory per bit in the overall hierarchy. Cache is extremely fast, nonvolatile, large (six transistor cell) and expensive. At this point in time you can consider that SRAM cache bits are half of Intel's CPU sales, or about $20 billion. Who would have thought that? Next in the hierarchy is DRAM. DRAM is fast, much cheaper than SRAM, volatile and klutzy to use, but it has infinite endurance and has been the prime technology used for computer main memory for the past 40 years. It's interesting to note that Intel is building, in their fabs, an embedded DRAM chip for the higher end client CPU chips (128MB). That is the first footprint in the sand on the way to grabbing the client DRAM business, maybe using 3DXP to do it. Finally, we come up with storage memory. The prime characteristics of storage are that it be non-volatile and cheap. HDDs (Hard Disc Drive) have served this purpose for decades. Recently the benefits of NAND-based SSDs (Solid State Drive) have driven their adoption in both enterprise and client systems. This trend will continue until full adoption of SSDs is achieved in an estimated $65 billion market. So, there we have it. Oops, I left 3DXP out. There must be a place for it, isn't there? Just teasing. Of course there is a place for it. Intel and Micron refer to 3DXP as "Storage Class Memory" (SCM)) so if it is going to be used as "storage," it better be non-volatile, which it is. Also, it better be cheap, and we think it's sort of cheap. If "memory" (system memory) is distinct from storage, 3DXP should be fast and must be random access if it's to be used as system memory, and it is. So the logical first case use will be between DRAM and storage (NAND) at a price that's lower that DRAM but higher than NAND based SSDs. Some DRAM will be needed since the 3DXP technology does not have infinite endurance. Remember the embedded DRAM I mentioned above? So let's look at the relative price (example: if a NAND bit costs 1 penny, then a DRAM bit would cost 17 pennies) of the technologies - I'm going to turn the order upside down for my convenience: Things get more fuzzy from here. The above representation for a typical client computer with a 256GB SSD, 4GB of DRAM and much less than a GB of SRAM. The first use case is likely to be in data centers where the attributes of 3DXP will be much more valuable and the cost of SSD storage is much higher due to very stringent requirements. The big difference above comes in the price of SSD between client and server. I'm using $1.60 per GB for server SSDs. Remember the thought to hold from above? Intel was right - microprocessors do leverage the memory business. In this case the SRAM business. No one even thinks about it since it's integrated into the fabric of the processor. Intel owns the SRAM business lock, stock and barrel. In a few years the same will be said about FPGAs integrated onto XEON chips. The computing business is a memory business. Intel is in the memory business with both feet, in all technologies. They only left the DRAM business for a while. The server memory business is potentially a $30 billion business to Intel and the way they will bring that home is with SSDs that have a mix of 3DXP and 3D NAND. Nobody will be able to compete with that kind of a product. I think that 3DXP will find a home in client and mobile as well because it will give power benefits out of proportion to its cost. While Micron is involved, the prime benefits accrue to Intel since they have the adjacent businesses to leverage and bury the memory business to the exclusion of all comers. Intel is the more powerful buy here. Next: cost, price and margins for 3DXP and 3D NAND. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
