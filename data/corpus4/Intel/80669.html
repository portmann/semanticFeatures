Can Intel Follow Texas Instruments' Example Of Reducing Capex Over Time? - Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) | Seeking Alpha Intel paid dearly for Altera at a $17 billion acquisition price. Texas Instruments is a model for capex reduction and return-of-capital by a semiconductor company. $10 billion annual capex load of INTC starting to come down, if only by a little. Intel has to move away from capital-intensive fab business. Another alternative title to this article could be, "Was the Altra (NASDAQ: ALTR ) acquisition the catalyst to reduce Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) capital intensity, and follow the Texas Instruments example ?" The Seeking Alpha editors like a catchy title for readers, but it is hard to flush out in a pithy or catchy sentence the concept of how Texas Instruments could be the model or example for Intel's capex reduction. Although Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) had a rough Q1 '15, with an inventory build that resulted in lower guidance for Q2 '15 and for the full year, the integrated circuit semiconductor company has done a great job since the halcyon days of the semi's in the late 1990's, both reducing capex and generating consistent earnings and cash-flow growth. (In a brief interview with TXN's investor relations department after I had written the majority of this article, TXN stopped building CMOS internally (see article here ) in the early 2000's, and then exited the wireless biz, with the CMOS business (as I understood it), subbed out to the foundries. TXN now uses analog factories which can be used 30 - 40 years, versus the higher tech fabs which Intel employs that need to be quickly replaced, within 3 - 5 years.) For Intel, it has been a different story as I wrote here in the last few months. INTC has had a tough time navigating the secular growth era of the 1990's and early 2000's, as their fortunes are still tied to the PC (although that is diminishing), as their incredible competitive advantage has become a bit of an albatross - Intel is still spending $10 billion a year on fab construction. Here is a quick comparison of "Texan's" capex history as a percentage of cash-flow, compared to Intel's capex history as a percentage of cash-flow: (Capex and cash-flow figures are calendar year dollars) If readers are wondering if this is financial analysis navel-gazing, the end product of this analysis is that free-cash-flow, which is the available excess capital that can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, is a function of a company's capital intensity and thus "capex" requirements. Here is the next table readers might find interesting, in terms of free-cash-flow generation and the return of capital to shareholders for both companies: Capital returned is the combination of dividends and share repurchases returned to the shareholder % - how much capital is being returned via dividends and share repo's versus free-cash-flow generated Source: balance sheet data, internal spreadsheet as stated on earnings reports and 10-Q's PPE is estimated market value of property, plant and equipment (PPE) as of year-end balance sheet. So what is the point of all this ? TXN has cut their balance sheet in half over the last 15 years while INTC has doubled the size of theirs, which explains the substantial capex burden INTC bears relative to TXN and thus helps explain TXN's substantial return of capital. While INTC paid a lot for ALTR, ALTR's "fabless" architecture is the key to the deal in my opinion. INTC invested in a less capital-intensive business as evidenced by ALTR's capex being less roughly 5% - 10% of ALTR's cash-flow from operations the last 3 - 4 years. While ALTR's cash-flow is still just a small portion of INTC's enormous cash-flow and free-cash-flow, INTC now has a less capital intensive segment to utilize. That being said ALTR's free-cash-flow in 2014 was just 5% of Intel's free-cash-flow. Was paying $17 - $18 billion worth it for ALTR ? (To be frank, there is much about the electrical engineering of semiconductors I do not understand. PLD's (programmable logic devices), FPGA's (field programmable gate array's) are all Greek to me. Just show me the numbers and the growth or lack thereof. ) Summary / Conclusion: my own opinion is that Intel needs to reduce its capital intensity over time, particularly when their so called "moat" or sustainable competitive advantage is their fab prowess in a secular low growth segment like microprocessors for PC's. The ALTR acquisition seems geared to help grow the Data Center segment which is now 30% of Intel's revenue, but 65% of Intel's total operating income. I thought it would happen by now, but I was hoping that Intel would be able to gradually reduce its capex requirement over time. Maybe the ALTR acquisition is the genesis of that change. Trading at 7(x) cash-flow and at a 15(x) p.e for expected EPS growth over the next three years of 3%, INTC has been a frustrating position. Having written about this capex issue with Intel a few times ( here and here ), I recently applied the same concept to WalMart and Home Depot here . The relationship to capex and cash-flow is indicative of a company's and sector's capital intensity and the ability to transform or reduce that capital intensity over time as Texas Instruments did and Home Depot did quite successfully, can reap huge rewards for shareholders. Technically a trade below the 2015 low of $29.31 for INTC wouldn't be good. Here is one final table for readers: For the 15-year period from q1, 2000 through q4, 2014, Texas Instruments generated $45 billion in cash-flow from just $12.7 billion in capex, while Intel generated $197 billion in cash-flow on roughly $93 billion in capex, even though both companies averaged mid-single-digit revenue growth for the 15-year period.

I've always been a believer that an incredible sustainable competitive advantage in one era, can be an incredible weakness when Schumpeter's "creative destruction" hits (i.e. Josef Schumpeter, the Austrian economist that first coined the term creative destruction), as it did the major tech giants in the early 2000's.
