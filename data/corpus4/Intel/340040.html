Intel: There For The Next Big Thing(s) - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is making investments in new tech such as 3D image processing, autonomous algorithms, big data analytics and 5G communications. The next big thing is likely to be devices that operate autonomously such as drones, augmented reality headsets, cars/planes/trucks, robots, people, satellites, microbots - anything that moves. These devices will need to see, be seen/tracked, know what is expected and determine appropriate responses all with universally strong communication. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has lost lots of shine as its new ideas have not yet shown they can grow into revenue and profit - currently this new tech is classified as expenses and losses. Phones, modems, drones ... are so far expenses and losses. However, Intel's investments in new tech are essential from the standpoint that the new tech keeps Intel relevant in today's advancing tech world. If they did not make these investments, revenue would decline for sure. Intel has repeatedly stated the next big tech thing is not known, but they want to be there when it happens. To be there when it happens requires significant investments in a wide variety of areas. Intel needs to be ready to support the next big tech thing with relevant hardware and software. The most likely breakthrough areas will involve devices that see, understand and respond (Real Sense combined with Big Data and small, powerful, power sipping processors with FPGA features that adjust on the fly and 5G strong communication everywhere). Think autonomous robotics, drones, cars, microbots, satellites ... Connection to the Internet with autonomous guidance (think collision avoidance) will at some point be required for anything that moves in public spaces. Sure this new tech stuff will take years to develop, market and produce profits. Do not count on significant revenues and profits from autonomous devices in 2016 or 2017. The R&D costs will initially likely exceed any revenues during the next two years. Intel is building an entire platform for these autonomous devices. They will be using IP developed or purchased for one are in multiple other areas within the autonomous device platform. This platform includes the following components: Powerful computing ability that can handle multiple complex calculations effortlessly. Intel already has strong capabilities in this area with its Skylake and soon Kabylake processors. 10nm and 7nm processors will be even more well suited for the task. Small system on a chip to provide the necessary computing, graphics, communication in a small package. Curie is a good example of Intel making processors with communications smaller and smaller. More work is needed in the SOC area with better graphics, processing and modems. Combining memory into such an SOC would be huge. Real Sense 3D image processing is a critical component of any autonomous platform. Intel is developing smaller and more powerful Real Sense devices. As these devices get smaller and more powerful they will be found in many devices that need to be aware of and understand their surroundings. Power sipping processors, sensors, Real Sense, memory, modems will be critical for devices that move around autonomously. Intel has made great progress in reducing power needs and is committed to research into ways to have devices harvest power from their environment. There is much work to be done in this area still. FPGA features in a processor will be a key component of this platform. Pattern recognition algorithms are constantly improving and need to have the ability to be modified in the field. Intel's work to combine Intel CPUs and FPGAs will be critical for this platform to succeed. Big Data Analytics will be critical to inform autonomous devices regarding what they see so that the device can instantly determine the appropriate response. Intel's work to make Big Data Analytics more accessible is critical to having devices determine the appropriate response to the multitude of objects it will see with Real Sense image processing. Finally 5G will be critical to provide for near instantaneous movement of complex 3D image processing data from an autonomous device to the cloud and back again with understanding of the images and appropriate responses. Intel's work with numerous companies to create the 5G system is a critical component of this autonomous device platform. Drones: Nearly four million commercial drones are expected to sell this year, rising to 16 million a year by 2020, according to a new report by Juniper Research . (in 2013 the estimate was 30,000 total drones in existence by 2020) Satellites: Currently 600 in space. By 2020 more than 500 launched per year (including micro satellites - 2014 estimate) We are talking about hundreds of millions of likely autonomous devices per year by 2020 with a market in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year by 2020. These estimates are likely low as the number of autonomous devices will likely dramatically increase as the technology gets smaller, more reliable and less expensive.
