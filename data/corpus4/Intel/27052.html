Intel Earnings: 2 Metrics Management Will Have To Answer For - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The diminution in the PC client business is baked into the share price. Investors will focus more on mobile losses and cash burn. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is set to announce quarterly earnings after-hours on Tuesday. Analysts expect revenue of $12.9 billion and EPS of $0.41. The revenue estimate assumes a 12% decline sequentially. Below are the company's historical financial results: The expected decline in sales of the PC client group is well known. The following are two other key metrics investors should focus on: Last quarter Intel's mobile & communications division had contra-revenue of $6 million and an operating loss of $1.1 billion. If Intel's mobile strategy works it could offset revenue losses from its PC client group. In 2014 The company placed chips in 46 million tablets. Recent rumors suggest its XMM 7360 4G baseband modem will be inside the 2016 iPhone 6 in certain emerging markets - a big coup assuming the rumors are true. The question remains, "Can Intel's mobile operations turn a profit?" Management has declared it will raise mobile revenue while wringing out $800 million in costs. During the earnings call, I expect investors to ascertain how credible management is at executing its mobile strategy. The company is expected to use a new financial reporting structure where it combines the operations for chips for personal computers with the operations of chips for mobile devices. Whether the new reporting structure is an attempt to obfuscate revenue and/or losses in its mobile division remains to be seen. Either way, expect analysts to drill down on mobile operating losses. If its operating losses continue, Intel's mobile strategy may have an expiration date. The company's mobile losses, dividends and stock buybacks have taken a toll on cash flow. In 2012 the company generated positive cash flow of $3.4 billion. However, the company experienced cash burn of $2.8 billion in 2013 and $3.1 billion in 2014. Part of that cash burn has been driven by stock buybacks and dividends which totaled $15 billion in 2014. That said, cash on hand declined from $5.7 billion to $2.6 billion at the end of the year. Total liquid assets (cash, short-term investments and trading assets) declined from $20 billion in 2013 to $14 billion at year-end. That is a long-winded way of saying that a few more $3 billion hits to cash could create a financial strain. Before it gets to that level, either Intel's mobile strategy, dividend pay-outs or buybacks may have to be shuttered. Dividend pay-outs have consistently been about 4.4 billion. The dividend is important for yield hungry investors in the current low interest rate environment. Cutting the dividend would be disastrous and would signal that the company is in serious trouble financially. The dividend would be the last to go, if at all. The growth of mobile devices has encroached on desktop PC use, and this trend will continue. To stem losses, Intel may need to increase prices of its mobile chips, sacrificing market share. That said, I do not see the company shuttering its mobile operations any time soon. Intel bought back nearly $11 billion in stock in 2014. INTC is up over 20% over the past 12 months, yet 17% off the 52 week high set in Q4 2014. If worse comes to worst, Intel would most likely end its buyback program first. Longs shouldn't fret though, if the stock continues to decline or if the general market pulls back, there will be ample opportunity to buy more shares at a lower price. Revenue declines in the PC client unit are baked into the share price. Investors should now focus on how well Intel is executing its mobile strategy and managing cash flow.
