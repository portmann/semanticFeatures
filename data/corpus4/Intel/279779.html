Altera Wasn't Cheap, But Intel's Management Deserves Benefit Of The Doubt - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. There's no way to call the Altera purchase cheap, and shareholders have a right to ask questions about Intel's historical deal execution. That said, under Krzanich, Intel seems to be taking a different approach - they are transparent about past missteps and seemingly heading in the right direction now. With the acquisition of Altera now officially closed, it's a time for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) shareholders to reflect on the past as they look to the future. Altera was not a cheap deal by any measure, and Intel's previous M&A (think McAfee) hasn't exactly driven great shareholder returns. That said, management's strategic plan seems to make sense, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt rather than calling the price unjustifiable. Before we get to Altera, I think it's worth noting the different "tone" under which this transaction took place. There have been significant reorganizations at Intel since Krzanich took the reins, ultimately concluding in the departure of multiple key executives . Perhaps most notable was second-in-command Renee James, the architect of the McAfee deal. Recent commentary by Krzanich, such as that at the Credit Suisse conference, acknowledges shareholders' right to be concerned over the Altera transaction, specifically mentioning poor execution on McAfee. Here and elsewhere, Krzanich has been brutally honest about the company's historical failings: for example, he talked about the importance of paying more attention to IoT applications and how concerned he was when he discovered makers and researchers at universities (in other words, the future inventors of technology) were working on ARM rather than x86. Recent scenario analyses presented by CFO Stacy Smith suggests that the company is now more realistic about the future of PCs (a topic which both Intel management and bullish investors, me included, were consistently too optimistic about). Some investors might view this as standard issue "let's throw former management under the bus." And perhaps there's some of this at play. But I think the more important half of the equation is that Intel management clearly doesn't have their head in the sand, and the decisions they're making are within the context of continued PC weakness as well as weak historical M&A execution. In other words, they're not glossing over the big questions - they're addressing them head on. Anyway, back to Altera: While the company's original discussion noted that this would be accretive to FCF and non-GAAP EPS, that's a bit facile because obviously deploying capital to purchase a profitable enterprise is going to increase FCF - this is comparing returns to a baseline of zero (what you're earning from cash in the bank, even with the recent Fed decision). Given relative valuations, deploying $16B into share repurchases would likely have been equally (if not more) immediately accretive to 2016 numbers. But this belies the potential strategic value of Altera - Intel believes that having first-to-node FPGAs will allow them to gain market share with cloud (and other) customers with specific workloads. The long-term goal is really to continue to steal share from ASICs - Intel has already been selling Xeons into traditional ASIC applications for years, of course, but certain more specialized workloads would benefit from FPGAs co-packaged with Xeons (not to mention potential applications in the IoT group). There should be both revenue and margin synergies over time, along with the intangible value of continuing to eat more share in data centers (and keep competitors' grubby fingers out). Post-Acquisition, Intel Not Cheap, But Not Expensive Either Altera was a fairly large bite, but Intel is still looking to return to cash-neutral by late 2016, demonstrating the strength of their cash flow generation. That leaves the multiple seemingly fair without baking in any revenue or cost synergies from Altera. Looking out, it's worth noting that with each passing year, the relatively larger proportion of operating profit and revenue from DCG will help boost enterprise-wide revenue growth, and continued reduction of mobile losses (and perhaps eventual profitability) will help boost consolidated margins. As I've discussed previously , I'm not an Intel shareholder today for the simple reason that in the mid-$30s I don't believe the stock offers the sort of substantial excess return potential it did when it traded in the low $20s (at which time I was a shareholder). That said, most people don't use a hurdle rate nearly as high as mine, and I think the stock looks reasonable here in light of the broader market. Intel continues to be tremendously cash flow generative, management is cognizant of (and transparent about) the ongoing challenges in PCs, and despite multiple years of promises by the ARM crowd, we have yet to see Intel's DCG dominance challenged by cheap ARM chips. If I were running a diversified large-cap mutual fund, Intel would probably be above-weight - capital returns will likely continue to be generous, I believe disruption risk is lower than many investors assume, and the long-term growth rate might be higher. That's not fantastic, but in this market, it's seemingly enough to make Intel a decent long idea. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
