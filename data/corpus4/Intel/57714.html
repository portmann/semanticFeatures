ETF Hub May 12 2015, 19:33 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is partnering with programmable ASIC maker eASIC ( EASI - recently filed for an IPO) to create custom Xeon CPU products that (per the companies) can deliver up to 2x the performance acceleration of a solution using an FPGA for programmability. Web/cloud service providers (major buyers of custom Xeon parts) are targeted, as are security and big data/analytics workloads. eASIC, whose customers include Seagate, Ericsson, and Huawei, argues ASICs designed by its clients deliver the programmability, development cost, and deployment time advantages of FPGAs (to a large extent, at least), while maintaining the size, unit cost, performance, and power draw advantages of standard ASICs. 60%-120% and 50%-80% performance and power advantages are respectively claimed over comparable FPGAs. The alliance could act as a hedge against reported acquisition target Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), whom Intel has partnered with to create solutions that put a Xeon CPU and Altera FPGA in the same package. Web/cloud providers looking to use FPGAs to accelerate algorithm processing are among the intended clients. For those interested, eASIC filed its latest IPO prospectus last week. The company had 2014 revenue of $67.4M (+126% Y/Y), and a net loss of $1.1M. As of March 31, eASIC had enabled over 200 custom IC designs and shipped over 21M chips. Interesting news. I suspect Intel still wants Altera. They could have bought EASI, but instead let it go to IPO. I see this as a shot across Altera's bow. Wouldn't surprise me if Intel plays hardball on price with Altera after being rejected, now that ALTR's big shareholders want to sell. In any case, it appears that Intel sees opportunity in FPGA's/ASICs. My sense is that Intel wants FPGAs AND custom chips. Each fills a different need. Each has a big market going forward in Data Centers. Maybe Intel and eASIC could not agree on a price.  Maybe eASIC wanted or needed to go to IPO to see what the market would bring.  Maybe the investors in eASIC required the company to go to IPO to get a market value. Maybe Intel will buy eASIC through the IPO?
