Apple: The New ARMs Race - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Nov. 13, 2015  2:43 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: ARMH , INTC , LGEAF , QCOM , SSNLF , TSM by: Mark Hibben Samsung has announced the Exynos 8 smartphone processor, which takes the competition with Apple to a new level. Apple's other main mobile device competitors are joining Samsung in designing their own custom mobile device processors. The paradigm shift in the semiconductor industry that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) initiated with its custom system on chips (SOCs) based on ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ) technology has reached a critical new phase. Apple's success in mobile devices has inspired its competition to follow Apple's lead. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Huawei, and LG ( OTC:LGEAF ) are all designing their own custom SOCs. The paradigm shift is making commodity processor producers increasingly irrelevant. When I first began talking a couple of years ago about the paradigm shift that Apple's custom SOCs represented, this was met with considerable skepticism and hostility by supporters and investors of the major semiconductor companies such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). It was assumed that commodity processors would inevitably take over the mobile device industry, as they had the PC industry. The early skepticism was understandable. The business model represented by the PC was attractive for semiconductor makers. As a merchant vendor of semiconductors to OEM PC makers, the commodity semiconductor company could profit from the competition among the OEMs with little care for which OEM might eventually triumph. When Apple announced its first A4 SOC for the original iPad, it was only natural to view this as an aberration. The real proof of the importance of the paradigm shift has only begun to emerge in the last year, as Apple's arch rival Samsung fielded a brace of premium smartphones featuring its own custom designed Exynos 7420 processor. The 7420 featured a 64-bit, 8 CPU core design based on 4 ARM Cortex-A57 CPUs mated with 4 Cortex-A53s. This is ARM's so-called big.little design in which the CPU switches as needed between the A57 cores for higher performance, or the A53 cores for low power operation. Even this move was greeted as an aberration by Qualcomm's supporters, who continued to persist in the belief that the commodity semiconductor model would triumph in the end, and that Samsung would adopt a Qualcomm processor for its next-generation Galaxy S7. With the announcement of the Samsung Exynos 8 series processor, any hope for a return by Qualcomm to the Galaxy now lies in utter ruin. What Samsung is doing is exactly what I predicted when the Exynos 7420 appeared in the Galaxy S6. Having embraced the custom SOC paradigm in order to be more competitive with Apple, there was no turning back. Samsung has now been joined by most of Apple's major competitors. Huawei has had its own wholly-owned subsidiary, HiSilicon, designing custom ARM processors for some time. The latest in the series, the Kirin 950, is expected to power the next generation of premium Huawei devices. In addition, LG is rumored to be working on its own second-generation custom SOC, referred to as the Nuclun 2, which will feature ARM Cortex-A72 CPU cores. We're seeing a process where the entire mobile device industry is following in Apple's wake. It's a tremendous validation of the decision Steve Jobs made years ago to invest in SOC design and development. It's easy to lose the big picture ramifications of the moves by Apple's competitors. Daniel Eran Dilger was so busy trashing Samsung and trying to prove how superior Apple is (why is that even necessary at this point?), that he completely missed the significance of the Exynos 8. The Exynos 8 is the first time any Apple competitor has gone beyond just using ARM CPU designs to using a self-developed CPU design. The Exynos 8 will use a similar 8-core configuration as its 7420 predecessor, but the more powerful 4 of the CPUs, which had been ARM designs, will be replaced by proprietary Samsung designs. Apple has been designing its own CPU cores for years. AAPL was able to get the drop on the smartphone industry by introducing its own 64-bit processor, the A7 in the iPhone 5s, and there wouldn't be a competing 64-bit processor for almost a year. This is one of the advantages of doing a deeper custom SOC design. The other key advantage is that the custom CPU can be higher performance than the generic ARM designs. There had been rumors of a Samsung SOC with custom CPUs, dubbed Mongoose for some time, but I was a little surprised by the Samsung Exynos 8 announcement. I had expected Samsung to keep using ARM designs for at least another product cycle. The Exynos 8 takes the competition in ARM SOC design to a whole new level. Among the mobile device makers, there will now be a new ARMs race to achieve custom CPU designs. Even as recently as last March, when I wrote Apple: Becoming A Semiconductor Powerhouse , I received many skeptical comments. At the time, I pointed out that the A8x of the iPad Air 2 offered comparable performance to the Intel Core M-5Y70, an observation that was widely derided by Intel fans. Now this theme is being taken up and expanded upon. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company has noted that the even more powerful A9x in the iPad Pro surpasses the performance of the Intel Core M processor used in the 12-inch MacBook and compares favorably to the Core i5 in the base MacBook Air. Samsung's following in Apple's lead only demonstrates how Apple has seized the initiative in semiconductor design and innovation. The impact of that is to make the mobile aspirations of Intel increasingly irrelevant. As I pointed out recently , Apple's new A9 processor in the iPhone 6s is already better than the Atom X7 tablet processor. Intel's ambitions of getting into smartphones are rapidly receding in the rear view mirror of the major smartphone manufacturers. They all know that the key to future success will be custom ARM SOCs, not Intel Inside. Even the commodity ARM processor makers are threatened by the new ARMs race. Companies such as Qualcomm are in nearly as much danger of becoming irrelevant as Intel is. Qualcomm is currently looking for adjacent markets such as IoT, but it needs a totally new business model. Should Apple's investors be concerned about the increased imitation of Apple by Samsung and other AAPL competitors? Not at all. Apple is on its third generation of self-designed 64-bit CPU in the A9. Apple's performance still appears to be better in single-core Geekbench scores than the new Exynos 8. This tends to translate into real world performance advantages as demonstrated by other benchmarks more rooted in real-world tasks such as Web page loading, data encryption, etc. Also, Apple has a profound advantage by controlling both the operating system and the SOC design. Control of the OS allows AAPL to fully exploit its CPU design in a way that using Android doesn't allow for Apple's competitors. Apple has been doing exactly what it needs to do to win the new ARMs race. Apple has hugely expanded R&D in the past few years. In calendar 2012 Q4, R&D spending was about $1 billion. By the most recent (fiscal Q4) quarter, R&D had doubled to $2.22 billion. And Apple can put its huge cash reserves to good use in other ways, such as investing in capital equipment for its chip-making partner TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). Part of my recent caution about Apple was due to the expectation of its competitors fielding new custom ARM SOCs. Now that the world has gotten a better look at these competing SOCs, I'm much less concerned about them. I remain long Apple and consider it a Buy.
