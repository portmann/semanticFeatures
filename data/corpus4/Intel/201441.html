Qualcomm's Quixotic Quest - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Last week, Qualcomm announced an ARM-based server processor. ARM processors have much to offer in terms of energy efficiency and potentially lower cost in high volume production. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has launched a pre-production Server Development Platform which features a 24-core ARM processor for data center applications. QCOM becomes just the latest company to try to field an ARM processor to challenge the dominance of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in the Data Center. This challenge is probably doomed to failure. Readers who are familiar with my past articles on Intel ( Intel Has Become The BlackBerry of Semiconductors ) will know that I'm not a big fan of INTC's current management. Furthermore, from a pure technology standpoint, I think ARM-based servers are a good idea. But even with these biases, there's no denying Intel's dominance of the data center. In Intel's 2015 Q3 earnings report , the Data Center Group is the real bright spot, posting y/y revenue growth of 12% to $4.14 billion, and operating profit growth of 9.3% y/y to $2.127 billion. I wish that an ARM processor vendor could challenge Intel in the data center, but I just can't bring myself to believe that it's possible. This really has nothing to do with the technical merits of ARM processors vs. Intel Architecture (x86) processors. A recent article on SA by Alpha Max provides an excellent rundown of the technical issues regarding data center adoption of ARM processors. SA contributor Alcaraz Research has applauded the move by Qualcomm to challenge Intel. Neither article really addresses the fundamental question of why Intel has become so dominant in servers and why current attempts have proved more or less futile. There are already commercially available and very technically credible ARM server processors available from Applied Micro (NASDAQ: AMCC ), the X-Gene processor family , and from Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ), the Thunder X family . AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) has the Opteron A1100 (Seattle) chip available to developers. The world doesn't want for ARM server chips. But the world does seem to want for a market for ARM server chips. Applied Micro and Cavium are financial basket cases that both posted losses in the June quarter. And AMD? I'm not sure that even a hugely successful Seattle would be able to save AMD. I doubt that the financial difficulties these companies are facing are due merely to the length of time it takes to get their chips certified for data center use, although that's undoubtedly a factor. The difficulty getting these chips adopted really speaks to the fundamental business advantage that Intel currently enjoys in the data center. Scale #1: Engineering Scale. Intel is able to leverage its engineering of its main stream PC chips in order to reduce the engineering cost of server chips. Intel's current Xeon E5 and E7 , Xeon servers, which are really INTC's data center work horses use Haswell CPU cores originally targeted to the mainstream PC market. The difference is that Xeon chips contain a lot more Haswell cores as well as other features to increase reliability and support virtualization. Cavium and Applied Micro don't have the benefit of a large consumer market for their chips in order to dilute the engineering cost of developing their chips. Qualcomm is different in this respect, so it potentially mitigates this advantage for Intel. Scale #2: Production Scale. Intel has huge production scale and capability, as well as experience producing the Haswell architecture (22-nm FinFET node). Haswell, by virtue of being a mature production node, provides the lowest cost production approach for INTC for its server chips, and probably the lowest cost production in the industry. Once again, Intel can leverage its production of mainstream PC chips to reduce costs of its server chips. This is an advantage that no other manufacturer has been able to touch. Intel plans to move Xeon to Broadwell in 2016, once again maintaining both its process (14-nm FinFET) and production cost advantages. Scale #3: Market Scale. INTC's dominance of the server market, as highlighted in this recent IDC market survey , represents tremendous inertia in Intel's favor. The operating systems, software stacks, knowledge base and IT experience are already there for Intel. Its managers know that they can upgrade hardware or expand their server capacity in full confidence that their current platforms will continue to work. Adopting a new processor architecture means learning curve, software re-certification, and integration snafus galore. Small companies and startups especially will be reluctant to undertake this battle, when the Intel alternative is easier and less costly. And this really brings me to why ARM processors aren't more competitive. In mobile devices, I've argued that ARM processors have a cost advantage compared to Intel. INTC doesn't have any scale advantage in mobile, and the ARM architecture is simpler and lower cost to manufacture on a per chip basis. In servers, the ARM cost advantage gets swamped by total cost of ownership (TCO) considerations. The manufacturing cost advantage doesn't even exist for Applied Micro or Cavium since they haven't got the scale. It might exist for Qualcomm, but once again, TCO is going to favor the status quo. Alcaraz has argued that Qualcomm is rich enough to challenge Intel, but INTC has the deeper pockets. Intel also has a thriving and profitable business that it is in its best interests to protect. In the contra revenue scheme for mobile devices , Intel has demonstrated that it is willing to take a near-term loss if it's in its interest to do so. What would Intel do if its interests were genuinely threatened in the Data Center? It's contra revenue, with a vengeance. Intel can afford to cut prices significantly, without even having to post a loss, since it has considerable profit to burn through. Intel can afford to starve any competitor out, including Qualcomm. When I see tech company managements grasping at straws like this, I think, short opportunity. I'm not quite willing to go that far with Qualcomm yet. Qualcomm has indicated a willingness to spin off its hardware unit and become an R&D licensing outfit. I still consider that the best option. QCOM has also suggested that it could return as Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) first choice for the next Galaxy smart phone, and this possibility cannot be ruled out. Since mid-summer, there have certainly been plenty of rumors about Samsung choosing the Snapdragon 820 for the Galaxy S7. I personally doubt Samsung will do this, but I'll admit to a certain amount of doubt. If Qualcomm gets back on the Galaxy, it probably doesn't matter that its server efforts are a waste of time, the company will be making plenty of money anyway. QCOM has scheduled its September-quarter earnings call a little later than normal for November 4, possibly because it expects to get a decision from Samsung by then. So, I see the earnings call as a potential watershed for Qualcomm, and I'm holding off making any recommendations until then.
