Crypto-Wars Escalate: Congress Plans Bill To Force Companies To Comply With Decryption Orders | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Seemingly angered at the temerity of Apple's Tim Cook's defense of individual's privacy and security, Congress has escalated the 'crypto-wars' that are dividing Washington and Silcon Valley. In its most directly totalitarian move yet, WSJ reports that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) is working on a proposal that would create criminal penalties for companies that don’t comply with court orders to decipher encrypted communications. It seems Edward Snowden was right, The FBI is creating a world where citizens rely on Apple to defend their right, rather than the other way around. Liberty Blitzkrieg's Mike Krieger provides some much-needed background in the escalation of the crypto-wars. The feds, and the FBI in particular, have been very vocal for a long time now about the desire to destroy strong encryption, i.e., the ability of citizens to communicate privately. A year ago, I wrote the following in the post,  By Demanding Backdoors to Encryption, U.S. Government is Undermining Global Freedom and Security : One of the biggest debates happening at the intersection of technology and privacy at the moment revolves around the U.S. government’s fear that the American peasantry may gain access to strong encryption in order to protect their private communications. Naturally, this isn’t something Big Brother wants to see, and the “solution” proposed by the status quo revolves around forcing technology companies to provide a way for the state to have access to all secure communications when they deem it necessary. Many technology experts have come out strongly against this plan. Leaving aside the potential civil liberties implications of giving the lawless maniacs in political control such power, there’s the notion that if you create access for one group of entitled people, you weaken overall security. Not to mention the fact that if the U.S. claims the right to such privileged access, all other countries will demand the same in return, thus undermining global privacy rights and technology safeguards. We are already seeing this play out in embarrassing fashion. Once again highlighting American hypocrisy and shortsightedness, as well as demonstrating that the U.S. government does’t actually stand for anything, other than the notion that “might means right.” Sad. And today's decision by Tim Cook not to comply with the government's latest demands confirms what Edward Snowden noted on Twitter: The @FBI is creating a world where citizens rely on #Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around. https://t.co/vdjB6CuB7k Krieger adds that Tim Cook deserves tremendous credit for the courage to come out and so aggressively and publicly denounce what the FBI is trying to do.   If he hadn’t decided to publicly challenge the court order and write a detailed treatise on precisely why, the American citizenry would be left completely in the dark. This would be an unethical and unacceptable position. Second, this case could very well be headed up to higher courts. The greatest risk in these sorts of cases revolves around judicial ignorance when it comes to technology issues. The government knows all too well that most judges are clueless when it comes to tech, and that all they have to do is scaremonger with the word “terrorism” and judges will almost always default to the government position. Cook’s very public stance will at least shine some light on the issue and hopefully fuel robust, intelligent public debate which could inform judges ahead of being presented with technology related cases they don’t really understand. Which is perhaps why Congress is escalating the situation, as The Wall Street Journal reports , Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) is working on a proposal that would create criminal penalties for companies that don’t comply with court orders to decipher encrypted communications, four people familiar with the matter said, potentially escalating an issue that is dividing Washington and Silicon Valley. Mr. Burr hasn’t finalized plans for how legislation would be designed, and several people familiar with the process said there hasn’t been an agreement among any other lawmakers to pursue criminal penalties. It’s also unclear whether Mr. Burr could marshal bipartisan support on such an issue during an election year that has divided Washington in recent months. The bill could be written in a way that modifies the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, a 1994 law that compels telecommunications companies to construct their systems so they can comply with court orders. Mr. Burr has spent months pressuring technology companies to work more closely with law enforcement and others to prevent encryption tools from being used to plan and carry out crimes. He warned technology firms that they need to consider changing their “business model” in the wake of the widening use of encrypted communications. Read that last sentence again!! Since the scale of criminal penalty could be anything - as opposed to the 'cost of doing business' fines associated with the US banking system - this theoretically forces tech companies to comply, no matter what. The critical question then, once again, as Mike Krieger concludes, is: Do we really want to sacrifice overall privacy and security in order to get information from one person’s phone? Or what about the following question posed by cryptography professor Matthew Green: If the US government dictating iPhone encryption design sounds ok to you, ask yourself how you'll feel when China demands the same.

Proposed by then-Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , the amendment affects churches and other nonprofit organizations with 501(c) tax exemptions. [1] In recent years the Alliance Defending Freedom has attempted to challenge the Johnson Amendment through the Pulpit  Freedom Initiative, which urges church pastors to violate the statute in  protest. The ADF contends that the amendment violates First Amendment rights. [2] Organizations recognized under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code  are subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political  activities and risk loss of tax exempt status if violated. [3] Specifically, they are prohibited from conducting political campaign activities to intervene in elections to public office.

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:06 | 7205191 MrBoompi I'll tell you why this whole affair stinks.  First of all, the San Bernardino shooting was a flase flag attack.  They don't need any information from any phone as they already know the two dead Muslims had nothing to do with it.  Second, this drama makes it seem like the US government could not hack newer iPhones.  I find this very hard to believe.  I do believe they want a much faster way around the encryption though and I think this is the real impetus here.  Apple could have easily been on board with this scam, since they are now seen as knights in white armor as big defenders of our privacy.  Now we see Congress immediately jumping on board, the same Congress who can't fill a seat on the SC for a year.  It stinks. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:12 | 7205218 Mr. Universe Ok, let's go with false flag. Perhaps there is some info on that phone that someone doesn't want the FBI to have. Who knows who that might be, someone from the Justice dept., NSA, CIA, might be pretty embarassing. Somehow I just don't see little Timmy standing up for "liberty and justice for all". Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:45 | 7205363 in4mayshun No, Timmy Cook doesn't care about privacy. He is playing his role as villain for the time being. Now congress has the ammunition they need to pass a law forcing EVERY company to build in back doors. Bravo Tim Cook, you deserve an Oscar.

Not to get all technical on your ass here Grupenfurher Burr but Apple is not a "telecommuincations company". Its a device maker, you know like a toaster. They don't make the electricity that powers the toaster, they make the ummm...toasters.  Much like Verizon doesn't make Samsung or i-shit, they CARRY the stuff to the "toaster". Or are you of the same statist mindset that all you fucktards are of mind of up there in DC where you think you can can take any previous law passed for one express purpose and expand it to include any other? I just need to know before I start my petition drive for everyone having to buy an AK47 or face a fine/tax/penalty for the "common good". Thu, 02/18/2016 - 19:42 | 7205075 CaptainDanite As a software developer for the past 3+ decades, one axiom of my trade is: "Make it idiot proof ... and they'll make a better idiot." I am inclined to believe that a similar (albeit inverse) principle holds true when it comes to the government's nascent attempts to ban cash, as well as force companies such as Apple to give the FBI/NSA/etc. the key to all private communications. People are infinitely resourceful and inventive. If totalitarian-minded bureaucrats attempted to exert themselves in America much more than they already have, and an oppressive government attempted to impose its will on the people by force, they would fail. There are just not enough of them compared to the rest of us. And, notwithstanding the desires of those who might like to impose a tyranny, I simply don't believe they have the raw power nor the organizational cohesion and wherewithal sufficient to pull it off. They might succeed in Balkanizing the United States, but they would never succeed in imposing totalitarian control over the entire country. Even if they had the whole of the American military circa 2003 -- at its imperial peak -- it wouldn't be enough to suppress all of the United States. Not even a tenth of it. They couldn't even subjugate the freaking quasi-stone-age Afghans to their will after fifteen years and trillions of dollars. Furthermore, Americans are not Russians, or Chinese, or even Europeans for that matter. We have no cultural history of submission to totalitarian oppression. But we do have a cultural history of technological innovation and unfettered commerce. So let them attempt to use our own private communications against us, and take tangible media of exchange out of our hands. They will fail, and spectacularly so, and the revolution they foment will eventually engulf all of them in its flames. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 21:00 | 7205423 Faeriedust Essentially correct.  The problem is that a major current of American culture derives from Scots and Irish transported here from Britain as indentured criminals, usually condemned for the crime of being not-English in land that the English wanted to confiscate. The lower/working/peasant class (the "cohees") in this country started out as guerilla insurgents from Day 1.  American BEGAN in rebellion against totalitarian authority, and despite mass migration from submissive Germany, the strain of rebelliousness is fundamental to our culture.  Some of us are more and some less, but the sheer masses of Americans are pre-primed devious resistance fighters, just waiting for a chance to practice their myths. Give them a GOOD excuse to start fighting instead of just playing pirate, and there isn't a power in the world strong enough, or most important, numerous enough, to beat them down. Good gods, we have federal laws and databases in every state hooked up to force errant dads to pay child support, and you probably know how well THAT works.  I personally know 2 dads-on-the-lam, one who grabbed the kid and went invisible, and one who simply switched to cash-only jobs.  And I'm not exactly the most social person in the world.  If they can't crack that relatively simple problem, there's no way they can handle anything more complicated. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 19:49 | 7205083 OutaTime43 Theres a BIG difference between decrypting one phone and giving the FBI the tools to do so.  The order has Apple giving them the tools (develop software, etc.) to do it to ANY phone. That's where we need to draw the line. Apple needs to take it to the supreme court. By then, we'll have a differnet slant on the court towards privacy and away from the police state. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 19:45 | 7205087 Maxter Is it possible to encrypt files in such a way that you can unlock it with 2 different keys?  One for the real files and one for a bunch of useless files? > X file encrypted with first key then change file extension and then encrypt it again with different key...changing the file extension is optional. 1) create a problem (import maleable islamic shooters) Thu, 02/18/2016 - 19:50 | 7205099 Kirk2NCC1701 1. Move their HQ outside the US, to avoid prosecution by Feral Judges 2. Allow for 3rd party Encryption Apps to PRE-ENCRYPT all Tx (transmit) and Rx (receive) data. Servers for said 3rd parties are somewhere on the Global Cloud.  I'm sure that guys like Simon Black have some suggestions of best places. We have our Constitutional Right to Privacy in our correspondence, no matter its form or medium.  It is NOT our job or the companies' job to allow Big Brother to snoop w/o a Warrant.   If this 'impedes' their ability to do their job, then maybe they need to compensate this by other means (e.g. more human intel, or not bomb & droned the shit out of other countries), rather than rely on looking inside our underwear by sneaky means.   And maybe Trump is right:  That we need to review and restrict the ADMISSION of cultural and racial groups, known for their Extremist activities.  It's what the FBI did in the 50s and 60s (regarding Communism), until they opened the Immigration floodgates, and let every scumbag in, under some bleeding-heart excuse. All they have to do, is the same kind of profiling and monitoring of the WAHHABIST extremist sect (as a virulent subset of Islam), which originates from Saudi Arabia.  As such, they are technically not picking on Muslims, but only on a small, radicalized and dangerous subset/sect, which deserves scrutiny like any other extremist Sect. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:24 | 7205260 redd_green They want us all to give up every god damn freedom so that they can "protect us".   The hell with that, I'll protect my own damn self.   The government can go to hell.  Every damn one of them. The fight with Apple is a coordinated effort aired on all the Propaganda channels with only one point of view. Surrender or be crushed. If they pass this we should all throw away our phones. Will never happen but a mass boycott would show them. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:00 | 7205158 Goldilocks http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/isis-encrypted-com... Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:04 | 7205181 me or you Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:26 | 7205249 dexter_morgan - does the FBI have a properly executed search warrant? - allegedly Apple has honored this type of request at least 70 times in the recent past, so what is different about this one? If the FBI has a proper warrant, how can they expect to get away with not cooperating? If they don't, then job well done by Apple. But, that still leaves the question of why they cooperated before, but refuse to do so now? Do they sell a lot of iPhones in the middle east? Did they have a sudden epiphany about privacy? Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:28 | 7205277 redd_green Its not about breaking into a phone, or getting internet record access.  ALl companies bend over forward and backward to do that, even without any warrant.  The issue is about forcing Apple (and would be others as well), to put a back door into their operating systems that 'law enforcement' can use at any time,  to break into any device.  Warrant or not.   That's the shit they are after now.  So, as someone mentioned already:  you will need 3rd party encryption of everything you own.    The gubmint has got to figure out how to "protect us" without putting everyone in jail.  Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:42 | 7205349 dexter_morgan Ah, back to the old Algore Clipper chip that was attempted to be foisted upon us back in the 1980's. More things change, more they stay the same. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:46 | 7205368 Faeriedust And they only need it for Apple.  For everyone else, they already GOT a backdoor in Windows8 and above.  Which is why I have Windows7, which had to be specially hacked onto my computer which came loaded with 8. But that's also why a lot of foreign governments and entire regions refuse to upgrade beyond Windows 7. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:27 | 7205270 Savvy It's a good-cop bad-cop game the FBI and Apple are playing. They both want your info, one will take it with force and the other coerce it with trust. They're both cops. Don't play. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 20:33 | 7205307 Bennie Noakes The US government has clearly lost the data security wars. Hackers have no problem getting IRS info on millions of taxpayers. And easily obtain employment info on millions of US government employees. But the US government cannot hack one iPhone? I think the US gov probably had no trouble hacking the iPhone, but they don't want to divulge that they can break into any device with just a few keystrokes. And Apple would probably like everyone to think that it's iToys are impenetrable. So the US and Apple make a big public show which serves both their interests by fooling Apple customers into thinking their iData cannot be accessed without a court order. Apple's devices might even be the least secure, so the gov hopes this charade will get security conscious people to switch to them.
