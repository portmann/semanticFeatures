I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. China is attempting to dominate the semiconductor smartphone supply chain through M&A activity. China is attempting to dominate the LCD smartphone supply chain through M&A activity. China has already decimated competition for rare earth elements and solar industries in the past decade and a similar scenario may take place in the semiconductor and LCD smartphone supply. Through a series of clever, systematic manipulations China now owns the rare earth element market and the solar market. China is now moving to dominate the smartphone/Apple semiconductor (NASDAQ: AAPL ) supply chain and liquid crystal display (LCD) market. I noted in a June 2, 2015, Seeking Alpha article entitled "Mainland China's Integrated Circuit Production Lost Ground In Meeting Domestic Demand," despite massive investments in China's semiconductor industry, production is making minimal impact on meeting growing demand. ( here ) While China's IC production increased 12.4% in 2014, IC demand for insertion into consumer and mobile devices increased 20.0%. The significant supply demand deficit of ICs continues to expand (Figure 1). The red line is for ICs made in China, irrespective of whether they were made by domestic manufacturers or foreign companies in China, such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Samsung, SK Hynix, Toshiba or Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) (the top 5). The blue line is for imports only, and includes ICs made by the top 5 and others, above but not in their plants in China. The "National Guideline for Development of the IC Industry" program, unveiled in June 2014, is designed to accelerate China's efforts in several areas, such as 14nm FinFETs, advanced packaging, MEMS and memory. China created a $19.3 billion fund, which will be used to invest in its domestic IC firms. Over the next decade, local municipalities and private equity firms could spend $100 billion across China's IC sector. The "Made in China 2025" program, initiated in May 2015, is to upgrade and increase the domestic content of components in 10 key areas-information technology, robotics, aerospace, shipping, railways, energy systems and vehicles, power equipment, materials, medicine and agricultural machinery. However, it faces strong entry barriers in terms of technology and innovation as well as strong competition in a maturing industry. Hence, the country resorted to acquiring companies in the United States and Taiwan as well as inviting semiconductor companies from across the globe to build fabs in the mainland. Bernstein senior analyst Mark Li said in a report on Monday. 05 January, 2016 (here) "The country is interested in all parts of the semiconductor supply chain and is keen to leverage its ample capital supply to elevate the capabilities of its domestic industry quickly." Chinese manufacturers use memory devices in most electronic devices but the country has no home-grown memory manufacturer. XMC based in Hubai is a foundry and functions to make chips for other companies. XMC produces NOR on a foundry basis for Spansion, now part of Cypress. Spansion and XMC also are working on 3D NAND. SK Hynix has been manufacturing DRAMs in China for a number of years. And in 2014 Samsung began ramping up its new 300mm fab in Xi'an, China, which is expected to produce 3D NAND. Intel announced in October 2015 that its China fab will be converted from the production of 65nm chipsets to 3D NAND and 3D XPoint over the next few years. In March 2015, Uphill Investment Co., a group of Chinese investors led by Summitview Capital offered to buy Milpitas-based Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. (NASDAQ: ISSI ), for $639 million. ISSI is a U.S.-based, niche-oriented memory supplier. China-based Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. made an unsuccessful effort to acquire U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ). The United States rejected Tsinghua's offer to acquire Micron Technology over security concerns. Also, Micron acquired a 100% stake in Inotera (a joint DRAM venture in Taiwan between Nanya and Micron) to protect its IP from Chinese investors. In addition, Chinese legislators charged US-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) for antitrust issues. Tsinghua plans to plow more than $12 billion into a new memory-chip plant and acquisitions of semiconductor companies as the Chinese state-owned company continues a drive to build a globally competitive chip maker. Tsinghua will build a memory-chip factory and make further acquisitions through a newly acquired subsidiary, Tongfang Guoxin Electronics Co., according to a Tongfang Guoxin filing on the Shenzhen stock exchange in early November 2015. The filing that it will raise 80 billion Yuan ($12.6 billion) in a private placement. Tsinghua struck a deal for a $600 million stake in Taiwan's Powertech Technology Inc., a Taiwanese chip packaging and testing company. Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. In November 2015, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.,-based Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.,-based flash chip maker SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) for $19 billion. After being denied the opportunity to acquire Micron, the Chinese have set their sights on the semiconductor company since it will give them access to the 14nm FinFET technology. China-based Hua Capital Management, which manages the national semiconductor industry investment fund, has approached Advanced Technology Investment (ATIC), the owner of GlobalFoundries, for possible acquisition or cooperation, which was announced in September 2015. GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) with fabs in Singapore, Germany, and the U.S. oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer. Currently, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), which is the largest wafer foundry house situated in China, is only manufacturing 28nm chips. If the acquisition of GlobalFoundries is confirmed, then the semiconductor manufacturing company will gain access to the 14nm FinFET technology, allowing it leapfrog over TSMC, a company which is intending on jumping from 16nm FinFET to 10nm FinFET. China and the smartphone supply chain First of all, China already owns the Apple and smartphone supply chain, but several key semiconductors such as memory and logic are made by foreign suppliers. China has 334 Apple suppliers, compared to 131 in Japan and 73 in the U.S. China is now in the process of acquiring and/or attempting to acquire some of these companies. Let's take a closer look at the Apple supply chain and how it fits with the Chinese acquisition strategy. All this M&A activity really won't do much toward making China dominating the semiconductor market like it did the REE and solar industries (in this lifetime unless it takes over Taiwan). But there may be more than meets the eye. According to Investopedia, the 10 major companies tied to the Apple supply chain are here. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI ): provides the capacitive touch screen controllers for the iPhones and the Apple watch. It supplies these components from Ireland, the Philippines and U.S.-based facilities. Glu Mobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: GLUU ): is a major provider of iOS apps and mobile games. Jabil Circuit Inc. (NYSE: JBL ): Jabil's manufacturing facilities are based in China. It supplies phone casings for Apple. Micron Technology, Inc.: Micron and its subsidiary companies, like Elpida Memory, are based in multiple locations across the U.S., Taiwan, Singapore, China and Japan. They supply various memory modules like DRAM, LPDDR3 and LPDDR2 for Apple devices. These modules are used by smartphones and electronic devices to efficiently multitask and run various applications. The recent iPhone 6 uses LPDDR3, while the company is currently testing the next version LPDDR4, which is expected to be up to 60% faster and low on power consumption. Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd.: Murata is based in Kyoto, Japan, and supplies to Apple from manufacturing facilities spread across China, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia. Apple and Samsung are Murata's top two clients, procuring ceramic capacitors from the company. Nidec Corp.: The much anticipated Apple Watch comes with a special device called a taptic engine, which produces a sensation of being tapped on the wrist. Japan-based Nidec has emerged as the key supplier of this technology. Nidec was established in 1973 and is a global market leader in smartphone vibration motors. Qualcomm, Inc.: is known to supply multiple electronic components to Apple, including Envelope Power Tracker, Baseband Processor, Power Management module, and GSM/CDMA Receiver and Transceiver. These are various instruments used in the devices' power management systems and in mobile signaling. However, the most important component that is missing from the Apple's own A-chip processor is the cellular baseband modem. Qualcomm has filled this important space for Apple devices, offering the needed modem technology. Samsung: With three different subsidiaries - Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., and Samsung SDI. Co. Ltd. - which are located in four different countries (South Korea, China, the U.S. and the Philippines), Samsung is one of Apple's major suppliers. It supplies multiple components, including flash memory, which is used for storing data content, the mobile DRAM, used for multi-tasking various applications in devices, and the application processors which are responsible for controlling and keeping the whole device running. STMicroelectronics: supplies a low-powered, three-axis gyroscope and accelerometer to Apple, used to detect the orientation and altitude of a mobile device. Along with Apple, STM's top clients include BlackBerry, Nokia and Cisco. Texas Instruments, Inc.: TI serves Apple through its multiple facilities spread across Taiwan, the U.S., Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Germany and China. In the Apple Watch, TI is expected to provide the current operational amplification system, which in turn, contains 30 different components itself. For iPhones and iPads, it supplies the touchscreen controller, power management chip and a control device. As discussed above, Tsinghua Unigroup made an unsuccessful effort to acquire U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology, No. 4 on the above list. As I said above, Hua Capital Management has approached Advanced Technology Investment (ATIC), the owner of GlobalFoundries, for possible acquisition or cooperation. That will benefit SMIC China's largest foundry, which is currently under agreement to mass produce 14nm chips for Qualcomm, IMEC and Huawei in 2020. Qualcomm is No. 7 on the above list. However, SMIC can currently make only 28nm chips. Acquiring the GlobalFoundries technology will move it into 14nm capabilities in 2016. If the Chinese follow their same IP strategy, we can see a push for them to take business from Qualcomm in the intervening four years. Currently, GlobalFoundries manufactures the 14nm FinFET under a license from Samsung, which may throw a wrench into the acquisition. In what I think is an effort to block any acquisition by the Chinese (remember I said above Micron acquired a 100% stake in Inotera to protect its IP), Qualcomm announced in mid-January 2016 Samsung will be its sole supplier of its Snapdragon 820. here . Hua Capital Management also acquired smartphone camera sensor manufacturer OmniVision. The company, the second largest smartphone camera sensor maker in the world, competes with Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Samsung in the camera sensor market. According to my June 16 article in Seeking Alpha entitled "TFT-LCD Display And Equipment Markets Set For Downturn In 2015 " here . TFT-LCD (thin film transistor-liquid crystal display) market growth has been stymied by a slowdown in PC monitors, notebooks and tablets. 4K LCD TVs, smartphones and automotive displays are driving forces for the market but the display market is forecast to be flat to down in 2015. According to market research company IHS, "China is quickly adding capacity in all flat-panel display (FPD) manufacturing segments and is forecast to become the leading manufacturing region in the world for displays by 2018. Despite growing concerns of oversupply for the next several years in most parts of the display industry, there is still little evidence that Chinese makers are reconsidering or scaling back their ambitious expansion plans." The ongoing issue of LCD oversupply - worsened by China's aggressive investment in production capacity as well as high fab utilization - will continue well into 2016. The supply of large-area LCD is expected to be 14% greater than demand in 2016, up from 12% in 2015. Like the semiconductor industry, China must import LCDs to meet production needs in TVs, computer monitors and smartphones. China currently makes only about one-third of the panels it needs, with BOE Technology Group the leading producer of FPDs in China. Chinese display makers are expected to account for 27% of global LCD production in 2020, up from 16% in 2015, according to LG Display (NYSE: LPL ). BOE Technology saw its large-size panel shipments and consolidated revenues for 2015 increase 43% and 37% respectively. BOE's overall production capacity in 2016 will grow 24.6% - 28% for large-size panels (>10 inches) and 19% for small- to medium-size ones. By maintaining high levels of LCD production, the Chinese will have a negative impact on global LCD suppliers' profit margins, which include top 10 market leaders LG Display and Samsung Display ( OTC:SSNLF ) based in Korea, Innolux, CPT, and AU Optronics (NYSE: AUO ) based in Taiwan, and Sharp ( OTCPK:SHCAY ) and Panasonic based in Japan. LCDs compete with OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) for smartphones. It is estimated that 250,000 smartphones were shipped in 2015 with OLEDs, up from 210,000 in 2013. Apple uses a particularly high-quality LCD using LTPS (low temperature polysilicon) in its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. However, according to Nikkei Asian Review here , "Apple plans to introduce organic light-emitting diode displays for iPhones starting in 2018. South Korea's Samsung Electronics is currently the only company that can reliably mass-produce OLED smartphone screens. LG Display has a track record for producing OLEDs for television screens. Given this, the two companies will likely supply a large portion of Apple's displays." As shown in Table 1, Samsung is the predominant (practically only) smartphone manufacturer using OLEDs instead of LCDs, according to the OLED Association. The forecast shows that Apple will introduce OLEDs in 2018. Table 2 shows the percentage of smartphones incorporating OLEDs instead of LEDs. OLEDs will represent only 19% of all smartphones sold in 2016 and 29% sold in 2019. But this large number is highly skewed because of the Samsung smartphones and to a lesser extent Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) and Apple. The vast majority of smartphones, including iPhones, will be manufactured with LEDs. Hence according to my analysis, the rationale for attempted Chinese dominance in LEDs and perhaps a repeat of REE and solar markets. During the past 20 years there has been an explosion in demand for many items that require rare earth metals. China being China capitalized on its rich REE deposits and cheap labor to drive down prices to a point that nearly every mine outside China was forced to shut down because they couldn't compete on price. The ROW being the ROW allowed China to take away business because of cheap labor. In 2010, China cut export quotas for the minerals needed to make hybrid cars, and magnets for wind turbines, smartphones, computers and televisions by 72%. The result - at the end of 2010, the composite price of the REE oxides tripled. If that isn't enough, China dominates the critical supply chain. Rare earth materials require a number of processing stages before they can be used in an application: Â· Mining rare earth ore from the mineral deposit; Â· Separating the rare earth ore into individual rare earth oxides; Â· Refining the rare earth oxides into metals with different purity levels; Â· Forming the metals into rare earth alloys; and; Â· Manufacturing the alloys into components, such as permanent magnets, used in defense and commercial applications. Based on industry estimates, rebuilding a U.S. rare earth supply chain may take up to 15 years and is dependent on several factors, including securing capital investments in processing infrastructure, developing new technologies, and acquiring patents, which are currently held by international companies. I pointed out in a July 28, 2015 Seeking Alpha article entitled "Solar Is Hot, But Woe To Solar Equipment Suppliers," here , that seven out of the world's top ten manufacturers of solar panels are China-based companies, as shown in Table 3 below: In 2009, China manufactured 4.2 GW of solar panels, representing 37.2% of global production. In 2010, that percentage increased to 45.0%, about five times the capacity of the Hoover Dam. There was $41.8 billion in capital moving into the solar industry in 2010. The largest individual transactions were debt financing arrangements by the China Development Bank (Beijing, China), with recipients including LDK Solar Company, Ltd. ( OTCPK:LDKYQ ) for USD$8.9 billion, Suntech Power Holding Company Ltd. ( OTCPK:STPFQ ) for USD$7.33 billion and Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Ltd. for USD$5.3 billion. In March 2011, Linuo Group Co., another solar firm, said it had secured a 12 billion Yuan $1.8 billion) loan from CDB. The packages these enterprises receive include cash grants, tax benefits and low interest loans with the longest expiry date up to six years. China has long been the world's largest manufacturer or solar panels, and the industry famously used low-cost government loans to expand solar panel production dramatically, causing solar prices to hit their current historic lows. That strategy also led many Chinese solar manufacturers to crash and burn. China Development Bank, the state-owned policy bank created in 1994 to support the government's economic and infrastructure goals, had $687.8 billion in loans on its books at the end of 2010, more than twice as much as the World Bank. As Chinese factories cranked out panels, prices around the world fell. Between 2009 and 2011, the price of solar panels dropped from $2.79 to $1.59 per watt, pushing many American solar companies into bankruptcy. The list below is for 2012 alone. CSG (c-Si on glass) closed by Suntech G24i (DSCs) bankrupt in 2012, re-emerged as G24i Power with new investors Oelmaier (Germany inverters) insolvent, bought by agricultural supplier Lehner Agrar Q.Cells (c-Si) insolvent, acquired by South Korea's Hanwha Sharp (a-Si) backing away from a-Si, retiring 160 of its 320 megawatts in Japan Solon (c-Si) acquired by UAE's Microsol SolFocus layoffs, restructuring for sale Sunways (c-Si, inverters) bought by LDK, restructuring to focus on BIPV and storage The U.S. Commerce Department levied tariffs of more than 31 percent on imports of Chinese solar panels in May 2012. As exports shrank, the balance sheets of many Chinese companies began to bleed. A number of them went out of business. Â· Suntech Power, based in China, one of the world's largest solar panel makers with about 11,000 workers, filed for bankruptcy in March 2013. International creditors are still trying to recoup millions lent to the company. Â· In 2015, the Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, a Chinese company which is a world leader in the manufacture of solar products, said it swung to a net loss of 59.3 million Hong Kong dollars ($7.7 million) in the six months ended in June, compared with a net profit HK$1.68 billion in the same period last year. Â· In 2015, Yingli Green Energy was plagued by solvency fears and failed to make a full debt payment, but surged in October after announcing a partial payment of $110M. Yingli is discussing how to repay on $213M of outstanding notes, which are due in May 2016. The top global solar manufacturers - Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, Jinko Solar, JA Solar, and the top American Solar manufacturers First Solar and SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR ). The Chinese, through a calculated series of maneuvers, has managed to not only dominate the rare earth and solar industries but to practically eradicate nearly all the competition. I see a similar pattern in the LCD industry, with the Chinese focusing on the smartphone supply chain, but also with a focus on the lucrative TV market. In semiconductors, the Chinese are part of global M&A activity that reached monumental heights in 2015. But a strategic emphasis is on dominating the semiconductor smartphone market. Already China is the manufacturing center for smartphones, but semiconductors used in their assembly are manufactured by foreign companies. It is my assertion that the Chinese wish to change that. Therefore, investors in public companies need to consider those companies in the smartphone/Apple supply chain based on contracts they may receive. But in a greater extent, on those companies in the supply chain that may be acquisition targets by the Chinese.
