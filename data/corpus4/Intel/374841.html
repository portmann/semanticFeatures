Intel's Preferred Quality Supplier Award - Where's Applied Materials? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel's Preferred Quality Award lists two American companies - KLA-Tencor and Lam Research. Applied Materials, the largest semiconductor equipment vendor, is not on this year's list. Intel's increased capex should improve market share for KLA-Tencor, Lam Research and ASM International in 2016. A strong dollar in 2015 negatively impacted semiconductor equipment market shares of foreign companies but a stable exchange rate for 2016 will moderate this effect. On March 10, 2016, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced it recognized 27 companies with its 2015 Preferred Quality Supplier (PQS) award, which celebrates exceptional performance and continuous pursuit of excellence. ( here ) "The 2015 recipients exhibited extraordinary achievements across key focus areas of quality, cost, availability, technology, customer service, labor and ethics systems, and environmental sustainability." I've been analyzing the semiconductor equipment and material space since 1985, and I monitor these announcements yearly, as they are critical in projecting the outcome of a particular company from several standpoints: 1. Intel has one of the largest capex budgets yearly and is the largest semiconductor manufacturer. So, when equipment is purchased, it's in large volumes to meet company capacity expansion needs. 2. Intel is one of the leading companies with respect to technical innovation, so when the company makes technology purchases (as opposed to capacity purchases) for a new node or new device, the equipment needs to perform. 3. Intel has one of the most stringent qualification programs in the industry to qualify a piece of equipment or material in order to maintain its leadership as described in 2. 4. Suppliers that meet these requirements for Intel's award have developed a tool based on "quality, cost, availability, technology" to enable them to meet requirements of other semiconductor manufacturers and hence generate more income and market share. 5. This award serves as a sanity check against supplier claims of increasing market share, because these cannot be substantiated and "talk is cheap." There are more than 500 processing steps to make an integrated circuit, and Intel's Award covers suppliers across the spectrum of equipment and materials to meet its needs. I want to focus this article on processing equipment as opposed to test, packaging or materials for several reasons: 2. The only two American companies in its most recent awards are KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ: KLAC ) and Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX ). 3. There is the striking omission of Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ), which was last year's Supplier Award. This Supplier Award serves to reinforce an October 26, 2015, article I wrote in Seeking Alpha entitled "Making Sense of the Lam Research - KLA-Tencor Merger," here . I noted in this article and a previous one referencing Lam's acquisition of Novellus that LRCX was making moves to boost its competitiveness in the 3D device space. Clearly, Intel is in the 3D space and clearly, Intel made a purchase of KLAC and LRCX equipment, finding the quality so high that it gave the award to the two companies. In the article, I detailed market share for the process control sector (inspection, metrology) based on a report by The Information Network. I noted: "AMAT could have readily gained the upper hand in 3D against LRCX with its own acquisition of KLAC, but this is where egos get in the way. I pointed out in previous Seeking Alpha articles that AMAT's CEO Gary Dickerson was passed over for the top spot at KLAC when he worked there and then left to lead VSEA, which was acquired by AMAT a few years ago. The result, AMAT would never in a million years merge with KLAC - this is a merger, remember, not a hostile takeover - with Dickerson at the helm." If we look at the deposition - etch listing from Intel's Award List, there are three companies: ASM International (NASDAQ: ASMI ), LRCX and Hitachi High-Technologies. I wrote in an August 11, 2015, article entitled: "Winners and Losers in the Intel Micron 3D XPoint," here , that the winners would be LRCX and ASMI and AMAT would be a loser. I stated: "Key processes for 3D NAND are dielectric and tungsten deposition and dielectric etch. Analysis by The Information Network indicates that LRCX has more than a 50% share in dielectric etch compared to AMAT's 30%. In metal deposition, LRCX holds a commanding 70% share compared to 17% for AMAT. So, the real winner between the two companies in this sector is LRCX. The Information Network estimates that LRCX can generate $1.5 billion in revenue from 3D NAND over the next few years." LRCX is on the current list and AMAT is not. I pointed out in Intel's 3D devices that I suspect that atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be used due to the unique properties of this technique. ASMI is the dominant player in the ALD market. I also stated: "Another clue is that AMAT recently announced an ALD tool. I think the company was waiting for the AMAT-TEL merger because TEL is one of the leaders in ALD. Without TEL, I suspect AMAT wants to have a tool available for upcoming generations of XPoint. Besides TEL, another dominant player in ALD is ASM International." There is another player on Intel's list - Hitachi High-Technologies. According to a press release by the company here, Hitachi High-Technologies has been on Intel's list for the past 17 years. This is unprecedented and the only company on the list continuously for that period of time. Hitachi High-Technologies competes in the etch and process control space. I noted in an article in Seeking Alpha on December 9, 2014, entitled "Large Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturers Losing Market Share To Smaller Companies," here, that: "Hitachi High-Tech continues to impress. In the plasma etch sector of the semiconductor equipment market, the report estimates that the company will increase its share over competitors, exhibiting a growth of 36% in 2014 over 2013, compared to 20% growth for Lam Research and 16% for Applied Materials." My analysis begs the question - what's happening to AMAT? A February 19, 2016, article in Investor Business Daily quotes several analysts' perspectives on AMAT's recent quarterly conference call entitled "Applied Materials Loots Lam Share, But KLA Customer Heist Foiled." ( here ) "Applied Materials looks to have orders up substantially in the current quarter. It begs the question of whether there was some shift from Lam to Applied Materials in the current quarter." As I mentioned in item 5 above - this award serves as a sanity check against suppliers' claims of increasing market share, because these cannot be substantiated and "talk is cheap." In 2015, Intel cut back on its capex spending. An October 15, 2015, article in Electronics Weekly here noted "Intel has cut its capex forecast again - the fourth time this year - and it now stands at $7.3bn (plus or minus half a billion) down from the $10.3bn figure of late last year." We cannot be sure about AMAT's orders because they are a moving target and the semiconductor industry continues to have push-outs and pull-ins on equipment purchases based on market conditions and visibility. Perhaps AMAT benefited from increased orders from TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). With LRCX on Intel's Supplier List and not AMAT, the statement in the February 19 issue of IBD may be short-sided. "Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg says the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending fell 4% in 2015 vs. Applied Materials' 2% year-over-year growth in silicon systems. He models 3% silicon sales growth over 2016 vs. a 2% year-over-year increase in industry-wide WFE sales. Applied Materials, however, says equipment demand will be flat in 2016 vs. 2015." However, I pointed out in several articles in Seeking Alpha that the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacts revenues and market shares of foreign companies because market share is always converted to dollars. This concept is clearly presented in the April 16, 2014 article entitled, "The Semiconductor Equipment Market Really Didn't Decrease 14 Percent In 2013, Did It?" ( here ) 2015 was a repeat of 2013 with respect to a strong dollar. The dollar appreciated against the Yen and Euro to the tune of 14.4% and 19.8%, respectively. Thus, Japanese competitors to AMAT in the etch sector - Hitachi High-Technologies and Tokyo Electron - decreased in dollar revenues by 14.4% while the European competitor to AMAT in the deposition sector - ASMI - decreased in revenues by 19.8% in the conversion to market share. Thus, Weston Twigg's analysis that the "math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials" needs further analysis. My perspective based on the above is that ASMI, KLAC and LRCX will gain market share in 2016 based on capex spending increases and these companies' exposure to INTC. AMAT may have gained market share in 2015, but it is an illusion based upon dollar conversion for the sake of compiling market share.
