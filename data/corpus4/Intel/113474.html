Why Intel Shares Will Continue To Underperform The Market - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is currently an engine with five cylinders. However over the next 12 to 18 months only the Data Center cylinder is positioned to deliver any revenue or EPS power. Intel derives nearly 60% of its revenue from the PC client group segment, Data Centers account for almost 30%, Software as a Service (SaaS) 4% and IoT 4%. Intel has survived for years on the back of PC sales,. However this industry has been contracting since 2011 and its best days are in the rear view mirror. The real future for Intel and shareholders lies within the companyâ€™s IoT strategy and it will take at least 12 to 18 months for management to execute on its vision. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is desperately attempting to diversify its business away from PCs and into the Internet of Things IoT). Intel missed the smartphone revolution and although the company has some presence in this space mobile revenue only accounted for 0.4% of Intel's 2014 revenue. Intel derives nearly 60% of its revenue from the PC client group segment, Data Centers account for almost 30%, Software as a Service (SaaS) 4% and IoT 4%. Intel has survived for years on the back of PC sales. However this industry has been contracting since 2011 and its best days are in the rear view mirror. Intel's SaaS segment is a zero growth business line that only contributes 3 ½ cents of net come for every $1 in revenue. The lone bright spot within Intel's portfolio is Data Centers, which contribute 50 cents of net income for every $1 in revenue and are growing at a 20% annual clip. The charts below represent the last nine quarters of Intel's quarterly results as well as four of Intel's five business cylinders with revenue represented in billions of dollars. Mobile was excluded from the data below due to insignificant historical and current contributions to Intel. Additionally, I've broken out the SaaS and IoT business lines separately because they are so closely coupled in terms of revenue contributions and lack of growth. Images Sourced From Wall Street Forensics PC shipments topped 350m in 2012 and there is zero likelihood that we will ever see shipments this high again. Over the past 3.5 years annual PC shipments have declined from 350m units to under 290m. IDC estimates that PC shipments will remain relatively flat over the next four years, which I believe is opportunistic at best. With less PC units shipped to spread manufacturing costs over, this will pressure Intel's ability maintain PC gross margins. Intel is currently an engine with five cylinders: PCs, Data Centers, IoT, SaaS and Mobile. However, for the next 12 to 18 months only the Data Center cylinder is positioned to deliver any significant power in terms of revenue or net income growth. The introduction of tablets in 2010 crushed PC industry sales and over the past few years the introduction of phablets (smartphones with screens greater than five inches) also have put a dent in PC demand. Over the next few years the introduction of smartglasses will provide additional headwind and challenges for PC manufacturers. Smartglasses will come equipped with similar specifications as smartphones, including processors, memory, cameras, sensors and memory. The real future for Intel and shareholders lies within the company's IoT strategy and it will take at least 12 to 18 months for management to execute on its vision. If Intel's progress over the last year is a telling sign of the future then the company's aspirations for growth are over. Over the past Intel's IoT business segment has only gone from 3.8% of total sales to 4.2% of sales within a 0% revenue growth environment. Intel's acquisition of Recon Instruments will help jump start IoT revenue but it's not enough to impact the bottom line until 2017. The mass adoption smartglasses will take a year or two to develop with the first wave of adoption coming from commercial customers. Recon's smartglasses are catered toward onsumer fitness and activities and fall outside of the initial wave of commercial smartglasses adopters. Intel is expected to land a design win inside Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Enterprise Edition (NYSE: EE ) smartglasses that should hit the market during the spring of 2016. However, Google's EE smartglasses for enterprise applications coupled with Recon's sporty smartglasses shipments will fail to deliver enough units to move Intel's IoT revenue numbers in 2016. Intel is currently an engine with five cylinders: PCs, Data Centers, IoT, SaaS and Mobile. However, over the next 12 to 18 months only the Data Center cylinder is positioned to deliver any significant power in terms of revenue or net income growth. Intel may be forced to over pay for acquisitions to grow the top line over the next 18 months, which would have a negative impact on gross margins. Intel's mobile business segment is essentially non-existent and there are no hopes for investors that it can contribute any meaningful revenue or net income over the next 18 months. Intel's SaaS business is barely treading water and should be spun off for cash if Intel cannot turn this segment around over the next 12 to 18 months. Intel's current IoT assets and business strategy will fail to contribute meaningful revenue or EPS over the next 18 months. Intel shares are currently trading near 52-week lows and I see no reason for shares to rebound over the coming 12 months. I expect shares to underperform the broader market over the next 12 month until the company show some real traction and promise growing its IoT division or makes an unforeseen splash within the mobile space. PC sales will continue to put pressure on gross margins and the ability of management to lower manufacturing costs to offset unit shipment declines.
