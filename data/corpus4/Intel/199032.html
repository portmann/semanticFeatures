Intel Q3 Earnings: Evidence Of Emerging Growth - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel earnings potential for Quarter 3 is uncertain with many emerging growth areas making slow progress. Growth areas that may start to emerge in the Q3 earnings report include: portable PCs, desktop PCs, cloud computing, network virtualization, new memory and mobile phones. I was planning to work on a more in-depth series on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) with other SA authors but my recent business/vacation trip to Germany resulted in a lot of catching up in various parts of my life. With Intel Earnings Announcement coming up quickly on Tuesday October 13 I will briefly review in this article my thoughts related to where Intel may be heading. (click to enlarge) Below I will comment on each of the six emerging growth areas that I see for Intel. Please share your thoughts in comments. It's clear from recent sales reports that portable PC sales are strong and growing. These include 2-in-1s and clam shells. The new processors announced in September will further fuel this growth. The growth in this area is likely muted due to delays in getting the new PCs to store shelves. Lots of great announcements but strong positive user experience after the processors are on shelves is needed to really grow this segment. Intel selling into the supply chain early may show up in Q3 sales. Primary sales still seem to be fifth generation processors (pre-Skylake). Strong growth in Q3 followed by even stronger growth in Q4 is likely. This is a $10 billion sales area for Intel. As such it's a scary area for sales. On the bad side, if desktop sales continue to fall, Intel still has $10 billion in revenue to loose. On the other hand, frequent upgrades of desktop units for workstations and gamers are essential for productivity and enjoyment. These groups upgrade their systems about every two years and the impact on Intel PC sales should not be underestimated. Intel admits they skipped an upgrade cycle for high-end desktop processor units and paid the price this year. This skip has a possible silver lining if the workstation and gamer buyers now jump in to buy desktop PCs with 6th generation processors. I will be listening for hints of such a boost in Q3 earnings. The cloud portion of Intel's Data Center has been a shinning star in earnings over the last year. The emerging growth portion of this market will be cloud computing with an emphasis on big data analytics. The cloud model has focused on a place to collect data from many sources. Ever larger amounts of big data are now available for analysis in a way that can benefit many areas including health, business and transportation. Big data analytics in the cloud will grow rapidly. Intel (with others in an open environment) has developed cloud-based computing to make computers much more efficient at processing large amounts of data and has increased utilization of data centers from 50% to over 80% utilization. This increase in efficiency and utilization has not slowed the demand for data center growth but has fueled this growth by making the processing of big data quicker and reducing the costs. Cloud computing sales are notoriously lumpy from quarter to quarter. Q1 was strong. Q2 not so strong. Q3 could go either way. This emerging market has a $10 billion per year potential for Intel. In the past single-purpose custom, expensive ASICs have dominated the telephone industry computers. Over the last five plus years, Intel has made large investments and huge progress in working with the industry to develop open software needed to allow lower cost general purpose processors to do the work of the expensive single purpose Telcon ASIC equipment. Essentially network virtualization replaces all of the network switches and special purpose equipment with software that virtually creates a network. General purpose processors can now do the work previously done by ASIC switches and other single-purpose processors. This emerging growth area is still small with huge potential. Intel's purchase of Altera is key to better meeting the needs of the telecom industry. FPGAs integrated into Intel processors will make Intel processors faster at meeting the specialized needs of the telecom industry at a price that will make moving from single purpose ASICs to general purpose processors with FPGAs a no-brainer. I will be listening for hints about progress in this area although big announcements are not likely to come until the Intel Investor Day in November. Much has been written on SA about Intel's new 3D XPoint memory and cost disruptive 3D NAND. Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) and Intel have jointly developed the new 3D XPoint class of memory and Intel seems to be better positioned to benefit from the advancement by combining the memory with Intel processors. This is especially true with regard to use of the new memory in DIMMs where the speed and lower cost will be a huge step forward in quickly processing Big Data for beneficial uses. SSD demand will grow quickly with both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. These products have not yet reached the market so the impact will not likely be seen in Q3 results. Intel has made much progress in the area of developing the IP (Intellectual Property) needed to gain market share in mobile phones. The latest Zenfone 2 is a great example of this progress. This emerging growth area for Intel will likely increase dramatically when Intel develops SOCs based on the Core M that accelerates the use of a mobile phone as a PC in conjunction with Windows 10 Continuum. In Q3 we will likely see a further reduction in losses associated with mobile phones/tablets as SOFIA numbers increase. The big gains in Intel mobile will come in 2016/2017. I would not be surprised to have Intel announce at the November Investor Day that in 2016 Intel will sell into over 100m mobile phones (with no contra revenue). He who lives by crystal ball... eats glass. This next week we will likely be dinning on very murky and unclear glass. The emerging and lumpy nature of Intel growth areas makes anticipation of quarterly earnings results difficult if not impossible. The long-term picture is bright with the various growth areas and I will be looking for hints at progress in these areas during the Q3 announcements and conference call on Tuesday. The rosy picture (special glasses required) is that Intel will beat anticipated earnings and set the stage for a stock price breakout above $35 after the Intel Investor Day announcements in November. Earnings below market anticipation Tuesday will make a breakout following Investor Day much more difficult. The safer investment approach is to watch carefully on Tuesday for positive results above market anticipation, then watch for a stock price increase at the end of Wednesday and opening higher Thursday morning. If an Intel price rise sticks on Thursday morning, a break out in October/November above $35 is likely. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
