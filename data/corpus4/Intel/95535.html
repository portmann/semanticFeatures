Apple And Intel: A Marriage Made In P-Code? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Apple's decision to require bitcode on WatchOS opens the door to processor independence. An Apple move to make bitcode mandatory for iOS apps would open the door for Intel to win the foundry business for the next generation of iPhone and iPad processors. The jury is still out on whether Intel is ready or willing to do what it takes to win the business. One of the ongoing hot discussions that has roiled the combined Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) investing community from time to time is the possibility that Intel's Foundry Division could land Apple's iOS-based processor business. The logic of the deal from the Intel investor's standpoint seems rock-solid and goes something like this: An Intel foundry win of the Apple SOC business would help validate x86 as a winning mobile SOC architecture. Apple is the premier brand in the mobile ecosystem with the bulk of the industry profits and enough unit share (roughly 15%) to represent a worthwhile target for Intel. Success with Apple in the mobile market will provide a profitable foundation for continuing innovation in low-power SOC technology that can provide a springboard for inroads into the IoT market. Apple's high-end design focus is ideally suited to utilize Intel's industry-leading FinFet process technology. Apple, all being equal, would like not to utilize its competitor Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) for its foundry services. TSMC (NYSE: TSM ), while formidable, may not be able to afford the level of innovation in advanced chip design that Intel can and thus represents a poor second option for Apple. Mix all these ingredients together and, voila, we have a match made in heaven for both Apple and Intel shareholders. The classic win-win. Apple gets the best technology and the brand leverage that goes with it. Intel wins on many levels. At the cost of reduced margins, Intel's foundry business has momentum and critical mass - its revenue and bottom line get a big boost and shareholders rejoice to see significant EPS gains. What's not to like? So here we are in mid 2015 and still no deal. What happened? Can anything still happen? Despite all the rhetoric on these SA boards and in other publications, we have to conclude at this point that more heat than light has been generated by the topic. The problem? Candidly, as much as Intel fans might think it was a great idea, all their speculation was totally untethered to any verifiable expression of interest on Apple's part. In a recent article in AppleInsider, author Daniel Eran Diger explored the beginnings of the fractured relationship between Intel and Apple. In 2005, speaking of Otellini: However, while Intel was interested in selling its new Core x86 chips to Apple for use in Macs (and developing the supporting chipsets for them), it wasn't interested in building mobile chips for Apple's iPhone, at least not at the price Apple wanted to pay and in the quantity Intel expected Apple to buy. Intel's former chief executive Paul Otellini revealed last year that he didn't believe his company would able to earn enough money building mobile chips for Apple's new iPhone to cover its development costs, largely because he couldn't imagine Apple selling iPhones in large quantities. Well, you win some and you lose some, right? Since then Intel has lost billions trying to gain a foothold in the mobile business and still trails Qualcomm with its Atom offerings. Apple did throw Intel a bone with its Mac business, (worth 20m units today) but other than that has gone its own way. And what a way that has been. With the growth of the iPhone over the years since 2007, Apple has built and developed world-class expertise in ARM architecture SOC design with its A-series of processors. Just recently the company extended that franchise with the S1 chip that powers the Apple Watch. Otellini's failure to see the potential for "large quantities" of Apple SOCs back in 2005 is now off by more than 300 million in 2015. The total potential worth of this processor business to Intel remains to be seen, but at the least it is high-single-digit billions. Perhaps even more important to Intel than the profit from the contract is the competitive value of taking it away from Samsung and TSMC. Whatever Intel's motivation and capability, there remains the issue of whether Apple has any interest in giving it to them. The risk/reward ratio at this stage looks daunting for Apple. After all there are hundreds of millions of customers using 1.4 million apps in the Apple App store, all of them written to an ARM architecture CPU of Apple's design, and all of them using compilers that generate binary that only works on ARM-architecture processors. If Apple were to move these apps to a system foundation based on the Intel x86 instruction set the operational risk would be massive. As it stands right now, all the applications would have to be recompiled, retested and resubmitted. Beyond that, the brilliant team of designers at Apple who have mastered the ARM instruction set and gone beyond generic ARM core facilities to design their own cores would have to learn what's in effect a new "language" (x86) for their chip design. How long would that learning curve be? Let's assume Apple can get beyond those concerns. Is Intel really ready for the foundry business prime time? Is its heart really in it? Can Apple trust Intel to deliver, or will Apple's business always be at the mercy of other, higher (data center!) priorities for Intel? Don't forget, Otellini may have had it wrong big time in the volume category, but he was right on about the relative price and profitability to Intel. Instead of selling a Core I5 for a Mac at a rumored price of roughly $200 Intel would be doing well to get $35 for the SOCs coming out of the foundry. (Current rumors have them at a cost of $25 - $30 for the A8 processors from TSMC). From a corporate gross margin goal of 55-61% it would be fortunate to achieve 35-40%. And what if something went wrong? Right now Apple has TSMC and Global Foundries for second sourcing Samsung. Would Intel allow a second source for their prized FinFet 10nm process? On the other hand, this isn't Apple's first rodeo. Remember PowerPC? Apple transitioned off that hardware architecture, and very successfully. Moreover, Apple has to be concerned about the potential of being trapped in an architecture that has run out of steam. And then there's this issue beyond technical capability and that's business viability. Don't ever forget that we are talking about immense, and rapidly increasing CapEx investments to stay in the uber-processor game. How big are the investments we are talking about? Samsung just invested $15 billion in their latest Fab, and while some of it will be dedicated to DRAM and NAND production, most of it is rumored to go to logic fabrication. Indeed, one of the arguments being advanced today by chip makers and analysts is that with the "slowing" of Moore's Law there's a need to invest in increasing amounts of CapEx for decreasing returns with each new bleeding-edge node. So much so that only a downstream business with unit volumes in the hundreds of millions can possibly justify it. We know Intel and Samsung will be around for big-time SOC fabrication - will TSMC ? Apple has to be concerned that it may be rapidly approaching a time where it has to choose one partner and stay with it, come good or ill. Would it really want that partner to be its arch competitor Samsung? There is a good reason Apple is not in any hurry to jump into bed with Intel. There may be a reason in the relatively near future. Doing the groundwork to make the move to Intel x86 will take time. All this preceding is meant to provide a little background for a recent (Sunday, June 14) discussion by the panel of " MacBreak Weekly " (#458) that was focused on Apple's WWDC (Worldwide Developer's Conference) announcements. The participants: Aaron Hillegass (AH), Big Nerd Ranch, Leo Laporte, (LL) host of "MacBreak Weekly," and Jason Snell (SixColors.com). I quote it at length because I think the arc of the conversation captures well the surprise and potential import of the information: AH - "Let me point out one more data point, which is byte code. So one of the things you'll submit to the App Store is now this intermediate representation - not fully compiled down to machine code…" AH - "A p-code sort of thing, and the idea is that then, in the future, Apple can ship whatever kind of processor they want…" LP - "Wait a second here - slow down captain! Do you mean that if I am going to submit something to the app store I have to submit it as binary, fully compiled code and as intermediate p-code -even though there's no use for that byte-code at this point. Is that true for all apps? AH - So they can swap processors out from under… JS - It could mean running apps on Mac… AH - … Yeah, running IoS App's on Mac… LP - Wow, I didn't know that. When did they start doing this?" AH - It was just announced yesterday. There's app thinning. You remember how you used to delete all of those libraries so you could update your iPhone to iOS 8? Well, it was a 4GB download, now it's about a Gigabyte download. And the way they are doing it is called app thinning. So right now, your app in that it has support for a lot of different architectures in it. (…32bit, 64bit, … and the like) Well now it can strip out the parts it doesn't need and bring down the "thin" app. LL - (…) This intermediate byte code thing could be huge! I don't think anybody has reported on (it). It's huge! Really significant meaning! There's something going there - Apple wouldn't require it if… The fact that they are requiring it NOW, is I think telling. Interesting! JS - They never want to be caught flat-footed again, to feel, like, oh no, we're falling behind and we're tied to this platform. They want to be agile… Hmm… Remember our list of impediments to any potential switch? This new requirement for developers could check box one. Let's spend some time and get to the bottom of this. First off, let's put the terminology in context. As we talk about this you'll see three terms, all of which mean basically the same thing. There's, "bytecode," "p-code," and then there's the term that Apple uses which is "bitcode." All of them refer to a software entity which sits between the high level code that the developer is using to implement the app - say Swift or Objective C - that compiles that code into a virtual machine language that's independent of hardware and that then can be compiled again by another program to allow (potentially) any physical machine to run the app. Bottom line, if you are Apple and don't want to be in a position that ties the company to a specific hardware platform, p-code is the way to do that. Freedom, agility, leverage - all these wonderful attributes flow from that "P" word. Hallelujah, hallelujah, free at last, free at last! Give me your tired, poor, your apps yearning to be free! This is from an Owen Williams' piece in TNW in which he interviews Apple developer on the import of p-code: He (the Apple developer) believes that if Apple suddenly switched to an Intel chip in the next iPhone, for example, it would require no work on his end to have his apps running on day one. Is that cool or what? Before we get too excited, let's take a moment and actually verify that this requirement for "bitcode" submission is Apple's official stance. Here's the quote from the Apple Development Manual . "Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program. Apps you upload to iTunes Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store. Including bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the store. Note: For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. If you provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to include bitcode. For watchOS apps, bitcode is required." OK. Turns out iOS apps are not (yet) in play. "Required" for watchOS apps, "default, but optional" for the iPhone and iPad apps on iOS 9. Why the distinction? Whatever the reason, the "default... but" language surely is a powerful incentive for developers to take the hint and submit bitcode. Owen Williams, writing on this topic for " TNW " speculates that there's some evidence that an outright requirement for OS X is in the offing: "There's one sticking point: as far as we know, bitcode isn't being supported for OS X apps yet - though we shouldn't disregard that Wendker, the person who announced the technology at WWDC, works on the OS X team." Netting this out, it certainly appears that something is afoot, and that it could have tremendous import for Intel in the relatively near future. I highly recommend Williams' article if you want to learn more about the potential impact of bitcode on developers, but for now let's move on to the potential implications for Intel and Apple. First off, all investors should know that this might not turn out well for Mother Intel. Requiring apps to be submitted in P-code is truly a walk down a forked road. As Williams speculates, it's quite possible that the first move Apple would make with its new-found freedom is to move FROM Intel to their own proprietary ARM processor for the Mac. That's a loss of roughly 20 million Intel processors per year - at an average of $200 cost per chip that's a cool $4B in revenue - maybe half of that in gross margin - which would result in roughly a $.40/share hit. Ouch! On the other hand, if Apple proceeds down the other fork, there's now a real opportunity for Intel to make the foundry sale of the new century. Can Intel pull it off? Who the heck knows? Intel has certainly shown no particular competence in the foundry business and many analysts still don't believe they know what they are doing. Maybe the size of the prize would concentrate their mind. Apple is projected to sell about 235 million iPhones this year and 75 million iPads. If we go with an estimate of 5 million Apple Watches this year the total comes to about 315 million total Apple SOCs. While unit growth is slowing in the smartphone business, Apple recently has been gaining share and will probably sell more units next year and the year after that. Let's round it to 325m a year in 2016 and estimate $35 a processor in average price to Apple. That's $11.3B in revenue and even at a sacrificial gross margin rate - say 35% - that much additional gross margin bumps the EPS needle $.82/share. Compare this with the total of $2.31/share Intel booked last year. Whatever the odds on Intel gaining the business, what would Apple get out of the deal? Intel, of course, touts their process prowess. Here's an Anandtech analysis from August of last year: Citing third-party journal articles for comparison, Intel claims that along with their typical lead in rolling out new nodes, as of the 14nm node they are going to have a multiple generation technical advantage. They expect that their 14nm node will offer significantly smaller feature sizes than competing 14nm nodes, allowing them to maintain consistent logic area scaling at a time when their competitors (i.e. TSMC) cannot. In the same article, they evaluate the claim: Thus for what it's worth the basic facts do appear to check out, but we would be the first to point out that there is more to semiconductor manufacturing than just logic area scaling. At least until Intel's competitors start shipping their FinFET products this is going to be speculative, and doesn't quantify how well those competing process nodes will perform. But then again, the fact that Intel is already on their second FinFET node when their competitors are still ramping up their first is no small feat. Since then, of course, Samsung has announced a 14nm-process win for this fall's Apple "A9," most probably to be produced in their Austin fab, and then in April, they announced their "10nm" process, which is rumored to be going into next year's "S" series phone. Intel, on the other hand, is remaining silent on their 10nm plans and schedule, though we certainly expect to hear more at their November Developer's conference at the latest. What are we to think of all this back and forth, claim and counter claim of process supremacy? For what it's worth, most technical experts give Intel the clear edge . For investors, all these vendor announcements and assertions are shrouded in the ever-present fog of war that envelops this fiendishly complex, expensive and risk-ridden technology. The only thing we know for sure is that technical superiority is not, by itself, a sufficient reason for Apple to choose Intel. Let's wrap this up. Right now only the watch apps have the bitcode submission requirement. Bitcode for iOS apps is "default, but optional." Mac OS doesn't yet support bitcode. In order for an Apple decision to move the iPhone and iPad business to Intel to be feasible, bitcode must become mandatory for iOS apps. In order for it to be feasible for Apple to move away from Intel on the Mac, bitcode must become a Mac OS facility and Mac developers must be required to make their apps bitcode compliant. Will Apple do this? If they do, can the Intel foundry win the Apple iOS processor business? Will it avoid losing the Mac business? The only thing we know for sure is that with the p-code submission requirement for app developers the business can be in play. We'll be waiting and watching for Apple policy to change regarding iOS and Mac OS. Personally, I have no doubt that the policy will change because it is so obviously in Apple's interest to do it.
