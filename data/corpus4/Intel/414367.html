IBM Challenged Intel's Memory Technology - International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) | Seeking Alpha IBM developed an advanced memory technology that can challenge Intel’s 3D XPoint technology. If IBM commercially exploits the technology, it can temporarily seize Intel’s market share. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has announced that its scientists have demonstrated a high-caliber data storing method using a relatively new memory technology, known as PCM (phase-change memory). Mainstream media is saying that IBM's memory technology can be a potential threat for Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 3D XPoint (pronounced crosspoint) technology in the long run. Intel, in association with Micron (NASDAQ: MU ), announced in 2015 that they developed 3D XPoint, a breakthrough memory technology which will become the new memory standard. Intel's XPoint-based Optane SSDs (solid-state drives) are due for release this year. Can IBM's new technology adversely affect Optane sales? In the long run, no. IBM Challenged Intel's 3D XPoint Technology If IBM plans to commercially exploit the PCM memory technology right away, Intel's Optane sales might suffer temporarily. IBM said that its research team has showed how to reliably store 3 bits of data per cell using PCM technology. PCM is a non-volatile RAM which uses a chalcogenide material to store data. Earlier IBM's scientists as well as scientists from other institutions showed that PCM can store 1 bit of data per cell. Dr. Haris Pozidis, manager of non-volatile memory research at IBM, said, "Reaching 3 bits per cell is a significant milestone because at this density the cost of PCM will be significantly less than DRAM and closer to flash." In light of Dr. Pozidis' comment, I believe IBM will kick off mass production of cost-effective and highly durable SSDs in a year or so, challenging Intel's 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs. With the new era of memory driven computing ushering in, there are definite use cases for both memory technologies, particularly in areas where either large memory capacity or high-speed storage is an absolute necessity, such as machine learning, genome sequencing and climate modeling, to name a few. In the long run, however, the superior technology will prevail. The moot question is which technology is superior? Although Intel is touting that XPoint is the biggest advancement in memory technology in the last 20 years, its memory cell stores a single bit of data compared to IBM's 3 bits. For accessing the memory cells, variations of voltages are applied in both technologies. In order to know which technology is superior, we need to solve the puzzle if XPoint is actually a variation of PCM. 3D XPoint can be either PCM-based or ReRAM-based (Resistive RAM), although Intel and Micron repeatedly said that XPoint isn't PCM-based. PCM uses a chalcogenide material and stores data by heating and cooling the chalcogenide material to switch between two phases, viz., amorphous-to-crystalline and crystalline-to-amorphous. ReRAM, on the other hand, works by creating defects on the thin oxide layer of a memristor. Intel said about XPoint, "The switching mechanism is via changes in resistance of the bulk material." This implies that XPoint isn't entirely PCM-based and might have similarities with non-filamentary ReRAM. IMFT (the JV between Intel and Micron to make flash memory) co-chair Guy Blalock admitted that 3D XPoint uses a chalcogenide material. If that's the case, it certainly has the characteristics of PCM. Now it will be easier to ascertain which technology is superior. Superiority should be defined in terms of competitive advantage. Given that both IBM and Intel use a chalcogenide material, the underlying technologies certainly have similarities. However, IMFT's cross-point cell architecture makes Intel's technology more competitive. What makes Intel's technology unique is its cross-point cell architecture. The architecture will not only allow Intel to place 128 billion memory cells in a 128 gigabit chip using a cross-point array, but also ensure that each of these memory cells can be accessed in parallel. This will result in reading and writing data at a phenomenal speed. Clearly, the cross-point cell architecture is Intel's competitive advantage. Although each memory cell will store 1 bit of data initially, the cross-point cell architecture will make Intel's upcoming Optane SSDs superior to NAND and DRAM in terms of cost and speed respectively. I am sure the memory cells will be able to store 3 bits of data in future, although further research is needed to achieve that. However, when that happens the SSDs will become far more cost-effective. The cross-point cell architecture is Intel's trump card. In 2015, Micron was granted a patent that enabled IMFT to commercialize the 3D XPoint technology. IBM is trying to challenge IMFT by placing more data in a cell and might be successful to seize Optane's market share to an extent. In the long run, though, Intel will become the market leader by developing a way to store more data in a cell. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
