ETF Hub Apr 16 2015, 18:34 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Two days after Intel cut its 2015 capex budget by $1.3B to $8.7B (+/- $500M), TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) has used its Q1 report to cut its 2015 capex budget by $1B to $10.5B-$11.5B. Co-CEO Mark Liu: "We think semiconductor industry growth this year has indeed adjusted down from 5% earlier to 4%. It’s really due to the macroeconomic situation around the world. The foundry growth rate will adjust down too. We’re looking at about 10%." CFO Lora Ho notes there's 90% commonality in equipment used by TSMC's 20nm process and its next-gen 16nm FinFET process (the focus of much of this year's spending). Co-CEO C.C. Wei states TSMC's 16nm ramp is going faster than expected thanks to improving yields; volume production is expected to start in Q3. The world's biggest foundry is still set to spend more on capex than it did in 2014 ($9.52B), something that can't be said for Intel. Samsung has been forecast by IC Insights to spend $11.3B on chip capex this year, as it ramps 14nm production and expands DRAM/NAND output. Chip equipment giant Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ) sold off in regular trading following the news. AMAT also briefly dropped in response to Intel's capex cut, but closed higher the next day amid a chip stock rally.
