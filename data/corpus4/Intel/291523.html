ETF Hub Jan 15 2016, 12:35 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor On a day the Nasdaq is off 4.1%, companies with strong PC exposure are seeing even bigger losses after Intel (down 9.2%) beat Q4 estimates and provided healthy 2016 sales guidance, but also reported a slowdown in server CPU sales growth and offered cautious earnings call remarks about Chinese demand and macro trends. Intel's Client Computing Group (provides PC/mobile CPUs) only saw a 1% Y/Y revenue drop in Q4 in the face of weak PC demand. However, volumes were down 16%, with desktop, notebook, and tablet CPU volumes respectively falling 9%, 10%, and 33%. A 17% increase in ASPs minimized Intel's revenue drop. Earlier this week, IDC and Gartner respectively estimated PC shipments  fell 10.6% and 8.3% Y/Y in Q4. The list of PC-related names seeing big losses includes Microsoft ( MSFT -4.8%), Nvidia ( NVDA -6.7%), AMD ( AMD -8.1%), HP Inc. ( HPQ -5.2%), Micron ( MU -8.9%), Seagate ( STX -6.4%), and Western Digital ( WDC -6.4%). AMD reports on Jan. 19, Microsoft and Western on Jan. 28, and Seagate on Jan. 29. In other Microsoft news, the company has carried out price cuts of up to 17% for Azure cloud computing services, following new price cuts from Amazon, and is reportedly looking to acquire Indian mobile ad network owner InMobi. Google was rumored to be in buyout talks with InMobi last year. AMD, meanwhile, has begun shipping its Opteron A1100 (Seattle) ARM server CPU. Seattle, first announced in 2013, sports up to eight 64-bit ARM Cortex A-57 CPU cores, and enters a market also targeted by AppliedMicro, Cavium, and Qualcomm. How many times can you sell off on the same news?  Traders are a joke.  HPQ at $10 a share.  AN insider bought a million at a few dollars higher. Apparently, daily, until every bit of margin debt has been called and every leveraged hedge fund position has been unwound.  Thankfully, my positions can't go below zero.  My sister says I can sleep on her couch, although it may be on the sidewalk.
