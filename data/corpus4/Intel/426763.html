Why AMD Is Not In A Hurry To Release Zen-Based Processors - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha I agree with Hibben’s thesis that a double-down effort on Intel’s x86 processors is going to cause more pain to AMD. Lisa Su has her own valid reasons why she is not in haste to release AMD’s first generation of 14-nm Zen processors. The weak PC market is a valid excuse to not release new processors now. Delaying Zen to 2017 will allow AMD to focus more resources on marketing affordable VR-ready Polaris GPUs. This will help it compete better against Nvidia. I agree with Hibben's idea that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) mobile retrenchment to focus on its x86 business is bad news for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). My old Intel article also has the same need-to-focus-on-x86-server-and-pc-market explanation why Krzanich decided to retreat from mobile processors. On the other hand, I do not think AMD's x86 business will die soon from Intel redoubling its focus on the PC market. The current status quo of Intel dominating on PC/server processors will continue. AMD's x86 business will also remain alive supplying its Carizzo and other 28nm processors to OEMs like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). Hibben's lucid explanations degrading AMD's recent other "weak" product launches are also valid. However, Lisa Su definitely has her own stronger reasons why she is not in a hurry to roll out the Zen-based processors, or high-end Polaris GPUs. My own take is that AMD is being prudent in withholding its full product pipeline. As an old PokerStars player, I understand the value of not playing your strongest cards early in the game. Yes, AMD is playing laggard or tight with its Zen-based processors and APUs (Accelerated Processing Units). Globalfoundries has been ready since November to produce AMD's 14-nm Zen-based processors. AMD recently received some cash from licensing its x86 server technology to Chinese folks. AMD can easily pay Globalfoundries to start churning out Zen processors in six-figure production volume. However, weak PC sales might be one of the reasons why AMD is being coy as to when will it really launch Zen-based processors. Digitimes' report also hinted that due to the weak PC market, Intel and AMD are not enthusiastic releasing new processors this year. Business 101 says it's best to avoid launching new products when there is weak general demand. I also believe that, for this year, AMD is more focused on regaining the market share in GPUs that it lost to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Selling a latest generation, Zen-based VR-ready Polaris GPU for $199 is pretty aggressive answer to Nvidia's $380 GTX 1070 . A delay in Zen processors as a means of focusing against Nvidia is certainly acceptable. Debt-laden AMD simply doesn't have the money to aggressively compete simultaneously against cash-rich Intel and Nvidia. AMD's rising stock might win more support if the company can get back to its Q2 2014 level of market share (almost 40%) in discreet GPUs. Unlike Intel , Nvidia has never been accused of dumping subsidized products to OEMs. AMD will likely find it easier to compete with Pascal GPUs since Nvidia is not notorious for discounting its OEM-bound video cards. AMD is better off focusing first on improving its market share on GPUs. Declining PC sales means Intel still has tons of 5th generation and 6th generation x86 processors. Releasing entry-level or mid-range Zen processors right now is not the best idea. Intel still has lots of Bay Trail and Cherry Trail PC-compatible Atom mobile processors. Yes, Intel's shelved SoFIA/Atom x3, x5, x7 mobile processors can be used inside 2-in-1 laptops and desktop computers . The current inventory of 14-nm Atom processors, not Apollo Lake, makes it undesirable for AMD to release entry-level Zen processors now. Intel can quickly dump these Atoms on its dozens of PC vendor partners to immediately diminish the Zen's chances of commercial success. Lisa Su is likely waiting for Intel to first dispose of its Atom processors before she even considers releasing Zen-based APUs. Most margins-conscious PC manufacturers will ignore AMD's Zen processors if Intel starts giving them dirt cheap Atom x5 or Atom x7 processors. This is the curse of AMD. Try as it may to create the best x86 processors, it is still the PC manufacturers who ultimately decide the fate of new AMD processors. On the other hand, it's a cat-and-mouse game between Intel and AMD. AMD might just surprise us later this year with a commercial-ready mid-range/high-end Zen processor. AMD's persistent disadvantage of having only 28-nm processors means the 14-nm Zen FX products might still come late this year. The 14-nm Zen is urgently needed to help AMD keep up with the higher-end Skylake and Apollo Lake processors of Intel. AMD customers HP and Lenovo sometimes still offer business laptops that do not contain Intel Inside. While AMD only revealed an upgraded Carizzo laptop processor at Computex Event, AMD Zen FX processors might still be launched by Q4 2016 . SemiAccurate's Computex-related article discussed that the Zen-based Summit Ridge processor is being sampled out now. The only important thing to consider now is that AMD's Zen processors are not vaporware. They are real products being tested by people. Investors should not feel too anxious about the delay in the release of Zen-based processors. AMD's management has its well thought out reasons for this. Maybe one year from now, other contributors here at Seeking Alpha will understand my explanation why Su has not yet released Zen CPUs. I am long INTC and NVDA. I do not have any bets on AMD, but I greatly appreciate that Lisa Su's recent moves helped the stock outperform its peers this year. Let us be patient and just wait for Lisa Su's next move. Do not short AMD just because of pessimistic articles. Do not go long AMD just because of this article too. Investigate AMD. It's a very risky stock handicapped by a persistent double-digit short interest. Make your own decision based on your calculated foresight - not based on the hindsight of other people.
