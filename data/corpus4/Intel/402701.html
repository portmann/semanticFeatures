Should Intel Consider More Debt For A Large Buyback? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Rising dividend yield means net cash flow savings. While shares of chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) initially rose after the company's Q1 earnings report , the rally didn't last long. Shares have declined more than two dollars from their post-earnings highs, losing the $30 level a few times last week. With shares pulling back, along with US interest rates remaining low, it seems like management may want to consider issuing more debt to fund a larger buyback program. Back in July 2015, Intel had a $7 billion debt offering to help fund its purchase of Altera. There were four parts to this issuance, ranging from 5 to 30 years. In the image below, you can see the size of each debt issue, its maturity, and corresponding interest rate. The weighted average cost of this debt came to 3.64%, and this was before subtracting out related tax savings. If we were to assume a 25% tax rate, around where Intel has been mostly in recent years, you're down to about 2.73% in annual interest expenses. I bring this up mainly because with Intel shares closing barely above $30 on Friday, the annual dividend yield was 3.46%. This assumes the current $1.04 rate continues, and the yield could be even higher if Intel raises its dividend early in 2017. Thus, if Intel was using the above debt to buy back shares, the company would actually realize a cash flow savings overall because it saves more on dividend payments than the cost of the debt's interest. To think about what interest rate(s) Intel would get on a similar debt deal today, there are three items to think about. The first is the company's overall situation, which I don't think has really changed since July. The PC business is weak, the Data Center Group is growing, and Intel is trying to make strides in mobile. Intel's long-term prospects are tied into how it can continue to evolve in this ever changing technological landscape. For the time being, Intel is going to produce annual revenues in the mid to high $50 billion area, with net income in the $10 billion to $12 billion area. There are two major financial items to think about, and the first is Intel's balance sheet. At the end of Q2 2015, Intel had a little more than $600 million in net cash (cash and short-term investments minus debt). At the end of Q1 2016, the company had swung to $10 billion plus in net debt, which makes sense given the large Altera purchase. Given Intel's cash flow situation, the company will head back toward a net zero position in the next year or two if it maintains its current dividend and limited buyback policy. A slightly weaker balance sheet, however, might cause some investors to demand more of a risk premium, meaning a higher interest rate. On the flip side, US interest rates have come down tremendously since that debt deal in late July. In the chart below, you can see how the 10-Year US Treasury yield has dipped by about 50 basis points since then and is currently at the lower end of its yearly range. We've also seen the 30-Year rate come down by about 30 basis points or so. This could lower Intel's overall rate. Intel had a weighted average interest rate of 3.64% back in July, but it seems likely that the number could come down into the 3.25% to 3.50% range now if we saw a similar debt issuance. Given the tax savings of debt, Intel might be close to an after-tax cost of around 2.50%, while the stock's annual dividend yield is almost 100 basis points higher than that (or more than 100 bps if you factor in a potential 2017 dividend raise). Given the recent dip in Intel shares as well as US interest rates, it seems like management should consider issuing debt for a more powerful buyback program. The company is in decent financial shape and cash flow savings can probably be achieved between the reduced dividend payments vs. the cost of debt. Such a program also would help the company's earnings per share, add another bidder to the market for shares, and maybe provide a signal from management that Intel is undervalued. Perhaps the company will decide it doesn't want to go too far into a net debt position, but given the current market environment I think management should at least consider the debt-for-buyback idea.
