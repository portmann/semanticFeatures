Intel Inside The $1,800 Tag Heuer Android Watch - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel supplies the processor inside the $1,800 TAG Heuer Android Watch. LVMH Tag Heuer will unveil its first Android Wear Smartwatch on November 9. The Intel-powered Swiss-made smart atch is much cheaper watch than Appleâ€™s $17,000 Watch Edition. Jean-Claude Biver, Chairman of Hublot and CEO of Tag Heuer told CNBC last month that his company's first ever Android Wear smart watch will cost $1,800 and it will be unveiled on November 9. Biver praised and thanked Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for popularizing luxury smart watches. He also admitted that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are the best partners to help Swiss watchmakers. Intel and Google teamed-up last March to help Tag Heuer create a rival luxury alternative against the Apple Watch. The much cheaper $1,800 Tag Heuer Android smart watch is now an imminent threat to Apple's very popular iOS watch. On another interview with CNBC yesterday, Biver also said Apple was a real disruptor but that its $10-$17k smartwatch will eventually become obsolete. This fighting words is based on his claim that only a Swiss-made mechanical watch is worth buying and owning for all eternity. He was merely pointing out that Apple's very pricey Edition watches might be a mistake for long-term ownership. I agree with Biver's assessment. The $1,800 Intel-powered Tag Heuer Android Watch is more reasonable for astute buyers. Tag Heuer and Hublot are subsidiaries of luxury goods giant LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTCPK: LVMHF ). Biver therefore clearly knows how to price/market luxury timepieces. LVMH has the retail stores, huge pool of loyal clients, and the brand power to really make a global-wide push for the Intel-powered Tag Heuer Android watch. This product's luxury price tag means Intel is supplying it with a high-margin processor. As of Q3 2015, Apple was estimated to have sold 5 million watches , most of which were likely the cheaper models . I expect Tag Heuer's industry-leading reputation to greatly boost the commercial success of its $1,800 smart watch. The people who snubbed the Apple Watch Edition might eventually settle for Tag Heuer's cheaper alternative. While cheaper Apple Watch models will outsell this product, there will be discriminating people who still favor the bragging rights of owning a Tag Heuer-branded smart watch. I opine that Apple still has a long way to go before the typical clients of LVMH/Louis Vuitton accept it as a real luxury brand. INTC is a Buy. This company has the expertise to make it big in watch application processors. Tag Heuer's act of trusting Intel for its first ever smartwatch says a lot. Contrary to its detractors' claims, Intel made a very energy efficient but powerful processor for a very discriminating Swiss client. This could encourage Android/Tizen smartwatch vendors like LG , Huawei, and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) to consider trusting Intel for their next-generation of connected watches. I am sure there are still millions of potential buyers that cannot afford the $1,800 price tag of the Tag Heuer Android watch. Low-cost specialist Huawei could perhaps use Intel's expertise/processors to help it create a $299 clone version of the Swiss-made watch. There is tangible future economic benefits for Intel to win the support of more watch makers. The market for luxury Swiss-made watches is obviously still smaller compared to the total addressable market of $300-and-below smartwatch products. Intel helped Android/Windows tablets create cheaper alternatives to the iPad. Intel also helped cheaper 2-in-1 touchscreen-friendly laptops that now compete against the MacBook. I appreciate it very much that Intel is now also helping formidable firms like LVMH create alternatives to the Apple Watch Edition. Fossil, a brand famous for affordable mechanical/automatic watches here in the Philippines, also recently announced its own Intel-powered smartwatch. I hope Timex, Fossil's main rival here in my country, will also release a more expensive (but Intel-powered version) of its Ironman One GPS smartwatch.
