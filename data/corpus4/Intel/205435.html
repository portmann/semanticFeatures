Intel Delivers, Expect Meaningful Upside By Year End - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel remains a solid play on semiconductor. The company proved resilient in the PCCG group and was able to reduce the negative impact from shipments due to the mix shift to higher-end components. I readjust my estimates to account for Altera, and believe that the inclusion of those earnings will result in high single-digit EPS growth for the current year. Data center lumpiness is typical during Q4, and long-term, the segment has legs for significant growth. For the most part, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) had an all-around pretty decent earnings report. Now, I know many of you would probably disagree with this, and that's fine. But, the change in guidance pertaining to the server segment was temporary for Q4, as the seasonal impact on data center-related spending does tend to slow down in Q4. However, the company does anticipate that the performance of the DCG will be resurgent going into the next year. The company reported revenue of $14.47 billion and EPS of $0.64. I guess the big surprise was the PC Client Group, as the company beat on sales expectation; the ASP mix improved due to gaming systems, which is hard to verify in third-party channel checks. However, it speaks to the overall strength of certain parts of the PC segment, which bodes well for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) earnings. Nvidia's earnings have yet to be announced, as high-end CPU units are complements to GPUs. Since gamers are running on new Intel architecture, which switched over to newer PCI Express lanes, the video card needs to be replaced too. So, there's going to be some strong replacement demand. On October 8, 2015, IDC came out with a report that stated : "Worldwide PC shipments totaled nearly 71.0 million units in the third quarter of 2015 (3Q15), according to the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker . This volume represented a year-on-year decline of -10.8% - slightly worse than projections for a decline of -9.2%." Intel reports that unit volumes fell by 19% year-over-year. However, the pricing improved by 15% year-over-year, which is what closed the revenue gap. I'm sure the other PC OEMs will report a substantial decline in PC shipments, as a result of declining PC demand. But there's enough evidence to suggest that further upstream weakness in demand could in fact impact PC OEMs. High-end core series CPU units are moving significant volume to offset a 19% decline in shipments, which indicates that high-end PC OEMs like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and enthusiast PC users were pretty busy in the past quarter. Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) offers some insight into the PC channel in one of its recent reports: "Current ODM data suggests that, C2H15 builds could be at the weakest level ever at down ~14% y/y vs. consumption down ~9% y/y) - however, implied h/h growth for builds in C2H is up ~5%, mostly in line with seasonal of ~4% h/h. Additionally, we would highlight that ODM units typically experience sequential growth approx. 200-300 bps above seasonal during the quarter of and the quarter following a major MSFT software update, respectively." They anticipate that further upstream inventory build seems highly probable. The analysts at Credit Suisse anticipate 4% half-over-half growth, and an incremental 200 to 300 basis point impact from Windows refresh, which adds 6% to 8% in terms of sequential comps for Intel. Intel has some flexibility with its revenue guidance for Q4, which is reflected in the +/- figure. The stock continues to rally higher, and I anticipate that upside will be limited to $35 over the next three months. Of course, there could be exceptions to this, assuming Intel has some surprises in store at its investor day conference in Q4 2015. I lowered my EPS estimate from $2.52 to $2.48 due to slightly worse revenue outlook, and a slower pace of share repurchases. However, my EPS estimate is higher than the consensus, because I included the impact from Altera into my revenue and earnings model. In prior quarterly earnings conference calls, Brian Krzanich mentioned that the impact from Altera could be included in Q4, so I took the liberty to include the impact from the Altera transaction. That being the case, the stock has some upside from current levels, as my current price target is $35.48. Slightly lower than my previous target, but not by too much. I anticipate that PC unit recovery will likely occur in Q4, but becomes much more pronounced throughout 2016. The client PC market bottoming out is highly dependent on whether the PC ecosystem is able to deliver on new technologies that leverage the platform-specific advantages of Windows 10. Of course, there are a lot of "what ifs" here, but for the most part, inventory build-up will likely resume in Q4 in response to stronger demand in the 2016 period. Of course, Intel recognizes the revenue on PC OEM build-up, so if Intel's Q4 is strong, PC OEMs will experience some strength in Q4, but are actually increasing inventory in anticipation of a stronger Q1 2016 when compared to prior-year comps. Inventory days for PCs are historically around 33 days, so it wouldn't be surprising to see Intel gain a bit of that inventory build-up towards December, as older inventory starts to clear out of the retail channel. Intel also mentioned that losses pertaining to mobile had narrowed in the prior quarter. Of course, the extent to which is hard to measure, because the transition away from MCG muddles the ability to make year-over-year comparisons. That being the case, management specifically stated that they're 75% of the way to reducing mobile losses by $200 million, which implies that mobile losses have been reduced by $150 million, but the annual burn is still around $850 million. Cost reductions are Q4-loaded, because the improvement to unit ASPs will follow a refresh in mobile chip SKUs. The development of cutting-edge chips, building the wafer capacity for the mobile SoCs, and the continued efforts to market Intel inside mobile all add up to significant costs. The contra-revenue impact subsided a little bit, as a result of releasing competitive parts, which reduces the need to price mobile components below the bill of materials. Furthermore, the company is on track to gain some mobile share in the mobile modem and app processor space, which I will go over in much more detail in a different article. Overall, I see some recovery in PC Client Group, continued strength in DCG, narrowing of losses in mobile, and blue skies for storage/memory and network virtualization. Intel remains a strong buy.
