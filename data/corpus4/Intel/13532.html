3 Large Technology Stocks Down Over 15% | Seeking Alpha Some market watchers have been disappointed that the S&P 500 Index has not declined 10%. The S&P 500 Index might not have suffered a 10% decline, but many of the components have. The S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA: SPY ) has moved steadily higher with minor shallow corrections. This has frustrated some traders and analysts wanting to see a 10% correction. What these traders and analysts have missed is the rolling nature of the correction. Classic stock pickers might have benefited from the correction (or increase) in individual issues. The index following crowd no so much. Three large technology stocks, included in a number of indexes, were selected to highlight stocks that have fallen by 10% or greater during the past year. There are many other stocks that have experienced sharp price declines. The issues are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) as shown in the chart below. The S&P 500 has experienced mild set-backs by comparison. When considering a stock investment the bonds are generally reviewed at the Finra website . Bond investors tend to worry about the payment of interest and principal. The following bonds differ but provide sufficent information to consider the common stock. IBM 5.875% due 11/29/2032 . The issue is rated AA- by Standard and Poor's. The recent price was $128.88 for a 3.643% yield. Microsoft 3.500% due 02/12/2035 . The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's. The recent price was $100.29 for a 3.479% yield. Intel 4.000% due 12/15/2032. The issue is rated A+ by Standard and Poor's. The recent price was $104.50 for a 3.652% yield. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was recently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, so for comparison purpose one of its bonds is considered. Apple 2.500% 02/09/2025. The issue is rated AA+ by Standard and Poor's. The recent price was $97.91 for a 2.743% yield. Return on assets have been under pressure. The dividend yield for IBM, Microsoft and Intel are shown in the chart below. The dividend yield have been increasing and is narrowing the gap with the bond yield. In addition the dividend yield is greater than the dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index as can be seen in the chart above. The trailing net income has been more mixed. Intel has seen a steady increase in trailing new income. Microsoft has seen stable to slightly lower net income. IBM's net income has dropped sharply. The decline in IBM's net income was greeted with a sharp decline in the stock price. The dividend yield continues to lag that of Microsoft and Intel. The S&P 500 Index offers an dividend income yield roughly equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. Income seeking investors have a dilemma. Invest in US Treasuries an earn a relatively low interest income or consider individual bond issues for higher interest income. Invest in an index like the S&P 500. Or invest in individual stock issues with a higher dividend yield and the potential for increased income. Long-term look at dividends paid since 2007 There is principal risk with both the bond and the stock approach should the investment need to be sold. However, the ability of the investment to generate a higher level of income favors an investment in stocks. Long-term look at price-earnings ratio. The recent sell-off in Microsoft, Intel and IBM might be a correction in a bull market or the beginning of a bear market. However, if the firms can maintain and or increase their dividend payment, then longer term investors might be rewarded for weathering the volatility of the shares. Microsoft and Intel have more equity relative to debt compared to IBM. Therefore, Microsoft and Intel might have a greater ability to maintain and or increase their dividend payments compared with IBM. Might the addition of Apple to the Dow Jones Industrial Average have pressured the stock price of IBM, Microsoft and Intel? If this is the case, then it could be an attractive entry point for income seeking investors. Though I would tend to steer clear of IBM and focus on Microsoft and Intel with the stronger balance sheet. However, if the price decline is more company specific then investors may wish to perform further research. On a relative price basis Microsoft and Intel might provide some value. Investors interested in the stocks might consider the sale of out of the money put options to generate income and possibly purchase the shares at lower than current prices. Microsoft puts have been sold in an attempt to add to the position. And Intel is being considered. Unfortunately, IBM doesn't look interesting at this time.
