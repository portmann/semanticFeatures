Intel Changing Its Reporting Structure Raises More Questions Than Answers - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Going forward, Intel will consolidate its PC group and its mobile group into a single reporting segment. However, this does not actually change the fundamental questions surrounding the viability of Intel's mobile strategy. Intel continues to lose billions of dollars in mobile. The company is targeting $800 million in increased mobile profits this year, without offering much in the way of specifics. Without a more concrete strategy to profitably enter the mobile space, I'm content to stay on the sidelines and not buy Intel just yet. Over the past few years, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has struggled to fight off criticism regarding its mobile strategy. As the world's largest semiconductor company, Intel dominates the personal computer industry. Indeed, the PC constitutes almost two-thirds of the company's total sales. Intel unquestionably has a leadership position in the PC market, and as a result, the company is highly profitable and generates strong cash flow. On the other hand, however, PC shipments aren't growing. And, because of its heavy reliance on PCs, that means Intel isn't growing much either. In fact, Intel's PC revenue was lower in 2014 than in 2012. Moreover, Intel's diluted EPS was lower in 2014 than in 2011. This underscores the problem Intel is facing in the smartphone era. Of course, the natural remedy to this should have been penetration into the mobile market, since it stands to reason that's where the growth is, and will remain so going forward. Throughout this challenging period, Intel management has maintained that it has a viable mobile plan. But this hasn't materialized, at least not in a meaningful way. Intel's mobile strategy essentially amounts to shipping high volumes of devices at a loss, which is unsustainable. The company recently announced it would change its reporting structure, to combine its mobile division with its much larger PC group. Intel's Concerning Mobile Strategy (Or Lack Thereof) The problems facing Intel's mobile ambitions are well documented. At the beginning of 2014, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich vowed to get Intel's chips into 40 million tablets by the end of the year, to finally demonstrate that Intel was more than a PC chip company. To be fair, Intel actually succeeded on its goal, and then some. Intel actually shipped 46 million tablets last year. But volume alone isn't the only concern. Profitability also matters, and in that regard, Intel's mobile strategy still misses the mark. Intel lost $4.2 billion in mobile last year, up 35% from a $3.1 billion loss in 2013. Intel only shipped as many tablets as it did because it offered device manufacturers massive cost concessions to take its chips. This practice created contra-revenue that destroyed profitability. Believe it or not, Intel's mobile segment actually produced negative revenue in the fourth quarter. Intel has spent a great deal of money without getting much in return. Cash on hand at the end of 2014 totaled $2.5 billion, down from nearly $8.5 billion in the span of two years. This is obviously a big problem, and what concerns me is that Intel hasn't adequately addressed it. The company maintains it can improve profitability by $800 million in its mobile operations this year, although it's unclear exactly how it will accomplish this. Intel's most recent announcement was that it will combine its PC and mobile operating segments going forward. From now on, Intel will report results for its Client Computing Group, in addition to its Data Centers and Internet of Things businesses. I'm not sure how this reorganization actually changes things. Intel's problems in mobile won't simply go away. On this topic, Intel has said that the structural change is due to the blending of PC and mobile computing in society. That may be true, but this move still seems more like an attempt to mask what's going on in the mobile division, to make it easier to evade investor scrutiny. I owned Intel shares for several years. I first bought in the low $20's, because at that time Intel traded for a very cheap valuation and was a 4% yielder. Intel rallied considerably, and I sold my shares for around $33 per share. I've been out of Intel for almost a year, and since I admire the company's strong business and its brand, I've been looking for an opportunity to get back in. However, the events that have unfolded over the past several months pertaining to Intel's growth strategy have compelled me to stay on the sidelines. The stock has run up, which has expanded its valuation and lowered its dividend yield, but its fundamentals have not improved all that much. In my opinion, Intel still doesn't have a convincing plan for entering the mobile space, and without that, it's hard to see how the company will return to meaningful growth. Intel shares have come down from its 52-week high in recent weeks, which leads me to believe the market is once again reconsidering Intel's growth strategy. Earnings are coming soon, and if the company disappoints, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock fall back below $30 per share. While Intel generates strong cash flow and offers a solid yield, I'm content to hold off from buying the stock until it either returns to its 52-week low, or it demonstrates it has a viable long-term mobile strategy.
