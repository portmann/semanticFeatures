Intel's Inventory Helped Create An EPS 'Beat' - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel reported earnings that "beat" by $.05 a share. Analysts pointed out the "beat" was greatly helped by the effective tax rate. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported earnings after the close on July 15th that "beat" street estimates by $.05 a share - $.55 vs. $.50 estimated, for Q2 2015. There was an article explaining that Intel made most of its "beat" from having an effective tax rate of only 9.3%. This got me interested in Intel, and I noticed Intel's inventory level also helped the company's earnings. (I gathered the data from ADVFN and Intel's 8-K SEC filing .) COGS= Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory Now, Intel reports COGS with depreciation added in on its report to the SEC. I simply subtracted depreciation from Intel's reported COGS to arrive at the COGS determined by Intel's beginning inventory, purchases made during the quarter, and level of the ending inventory. When the quarter starts, a company's COGS will be determined by the amount of purchases and ending inventory. An investor/analyst can determine the amount of purchases in each quarter by "backing" into the figure with algebra. Purchases = Ending Inventory + COGS - Beginning Inventory Let's look at the levels of Intel's inventory and purchases, compared with company sales, over time. I also have added the three components of total inventories - raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. Source: ADVFN, Intel's SEC filing and author's calculations One sees that Intel's ending inventory level is high, historically, since the last business cycle low. Intel does have some seasonality in its ending inventory, so here's a table showing the figures below. Intel is currently holding the second highest ending inventory/sales ratio since the last business cycle low. The high amount of inventory on Intel's balance sheet, in Q2 2012, did not reward investors for the rest of that year. Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President "... our prediction for Q2 was that inventory levels would be taken down fairly significantly, which is unusual in a Q2. What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but they're kind of at normal. And so what you're seeing now in Q3 is a little bit of a pipeline fill based on inventory levels that came down in Q2 against the backdrop of Q2s that normally would have inventory levels going up. So it's the same phenomenon of some shift of billings from Q2 to Q3. It's just much more muted than what we thought a quarter ago." Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) "... you said that your PC forecast has gone down from I guess 5% to down high single digits. One question on that is, on your inventory, have you adjusted your inventory to I guess increase the server products and decrease some of the PC processors? And can you give us a sense of where you expect inventory to trend in the second half of the year?" Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President "Sure. It's less driven by server and more driven by the mix of Skylake on 14-nanometer. And so what happened in Q2 is that, as you can see, dollars went up but units were down, and actually down a bit more than we had expected when we started the quarter. But the mix of the units that are in inventory have shifted from 22-nanometer products to 14-nanometer. And within 14-nanometer, we're starting to see the shift from Broadwell to Skylake. And so it's a more expensive product because it's brand new. It's also the newest product, which gives me a lot of comfort about what's sitting in inventory. As we play out through the rest of the year, what we expect to happen is that units will continue to come down from here. 14-nanometer comes down the cost curve, but the inventory shifts even more dramatically from Broadwell to Skylake. And so when I take those three trends into account, I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today, not dramatically different. But again, units will be down, dollars will be flat." Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President - "Remember last quarter what we were expecting was a substantial burn of inventory. And the way we articulated that, our belief was that customers would burn off inventory levels in advance of Windows 10 and then replenish inventory levels in the third quarter. What we actually saw was much more normal than that. We saw customers maintain inventory levels. I think their confidence in the overall PC market grew some as they worked through the quarter and got towards the end of the quarter. So I had articulated we have relatively normal inventory levels now. We expect relatively normal inventory levels in the third quarter. Historically, you see inventory build some in the third quarter in anticipation of the Q4 selling season." "...Q3 acknowledged that the revenue is at the higher end of the seasonal range. The point we were making earlier is we think the market is pretty seasonal, but we saw an unusual inventory depletion in Q2. We think some of that inventory fill has just shifted into Q3. So there's a little bit of a billing shift. It's not a lot. It's maybe a couple of points at the top line. Q4, I think you have to be a little careful with the math about implied. I think if you just assume - we've said on the call we're expecting Q4 to be roughly seasonal. And I think if you plug that in, you're still rounding to the number that I gave you for the year." An Intel executive said, "What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but they're kind of at normal" and "I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today, not dramatically different. But again, units will be down, dollars will be flat." Now, does the executive mean "normal" as a level, or a percentage of sales, or expected sales? Here's a table of the growth in ending inventory compared to Q1 for each year since 2009: Inventory Level Change from Q1 to Q2 One can surmise that Intel is betting on 14 nm chips to make this year's earnings; with "work in progress" inventory at an all-time high, both as a percentage as sales (shown in first chart) and nominally. Source: ADVFN and Intel's SEC Filing The question then becomes - how much did inventory sitting on the balance sheet, while purchases remained subdued, help Intel's earnings this quarter? I created this table so that the analyst/investor can decide for themselves what the appropriate level of inventory is for Intel, in their mind, and how it impacted earnings. However, don't forget about the effective tax rate being a "one off" low rate of 9.3% - don't think politicians will let that last. Historically, for the last five fiscal years , 2010-2014, one finds that the average effective tax rate is 26.3%. If one then does "pro forma" analysis to both the ending inventory level and tax rate, at the historical level of 26.3% vs. 9.3%, one comes up with the following table of EPS levels. Source: ADVFN, Intel SEC filing and author's calculations Intel's earnings forecast was $.50 a share going into the announcement. But, we see that if the average, historical tax rate was used, then Intel would have actually made only $.45 a share. A clean miss. One also can see how the "inventory switchover" from 22nm to 14nm chips helped Intel in this quarter. But has this high level of inventory only pulled a little bit forward some of Intel's earnings? Remember, "I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today, not dramatically different. But again, units will be down, dollars will be flat." And the formula for COGS: COGS= Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory I'm not planning to buy a new computer because of 14 nm chips or Windows 10. Maybe some high frequency traders and gamers will, but does the average Internet user really need a new computer? I think most consumers are more interested in the next Apple product or gaming app. The algorithmic trading machines bought Intel stock on the press release but savvy investors sold the stock to them. I expect investors wanting alpha will do the same in the future. P.S. Intel also had the lowest amount of "deferred income" on its balance sheet since Q2 2013 (Intel SEC filing and ADVFN).
