Intel: It Could Have Been Worse - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel betting on a better second half. After the bell on Tuesday, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported its first quarter earnings . The Q1 results were basically in line with lowered expectations after the company's March revenue warning. Management lowered its full year revenue and gross margin forecast, as the PC space is not performing as hoped. In this article, I look at some key takeaways from the company's report. Intel reported Q1 revenues of $12.781 billion, just below the $12.8 billion midpoint the company guided to with its Q1 revenue warning . Perhaps more interesting was the Q2 revenue midpoint of $13.2 billion. That figure was a bit below the $13.51 billion analysts were looking for. Don't forget, thanks to the warning, the Q2 average estimate had come down from $14.20 billion already. This basically sets up Intel as a second half of 2015 story. First quarter revenues were up a paltry $17 million, and the midpoint of the Q2 forecast implies a $630 million decline over the prior year period. Intel guided for full year revenues to be approximately flat, so to reach that point Intel would need more than $600 million in revenue growth in the second half of the year. One of the items I discussed in my earnings preview was the expected $800 million in mobile profitability improvement the company expects in 2015. Management did state it is on track to meet this goal this year, stating on the confrence call that it expects a majority of this improvement to occur in the back half of the year. Investors are hoping this second half story materializes, because Intel spent a lot of money in recent quarters to buy back shares at an average price approaching $35. If shares end up back in the high $20s, that buyback will look quite foolish. Intel's second largest revenue segment was already its biggest growth driver, but the PC decline only reinforces its importance. In fact, Intel's financial reporting structure change now highlights the Data Center Group even more. In Q1 2015, the DCG had the highest operating profit of any business segment. That's due to Intel merging its mobile group with the PC Client Group, causing the new Client Computing Group to absorb mobile's roughly $1 billion quarterly operating loss. The Data Center Group reported a 19% increase in revenues for Q1 over the prior year period. The rest of the company reported a roughly 6% revenue decline for the period. Management is still looking to grow revenues in the DCG in the mid teens for the near future, and that growth is certainly needed. Without it, Intel would be reporting more yearly revenue declines. If the group can achieve mid-teens revenue growth for the next few years, one analyst believes the segment could represent 40% of Intel's revenues by 2018. Analysts kept trying to bring up M&A on the conference call, but as expected those questions were shot down by management. Recent rumors about Intel acquiring Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) have many buzzing about Intel trying to make a big purchase to help future growth. There were a couple of interesting items in this quarterly report that might increase speculation of an Intel acquisition. First, the company slashed its capex budget for 2015 to $8.7 billion. This is a $1.3 billion cut from the prior forecast, and also would be the company's lowest capex level in a number of years. Management stated that the reduction was due to "increased reuse of capital on 14nm and the alignment of capacity with demand". Whether you believe management's wording or not, Intel is freeing up a bit of capital here. Additionally, the company slowed down its share repurchase plan tremendously in Q1. Just $750 million was spent to buyback shares in the first quarter, after about $8 billion during the second half of 2014. Cutting back on the buyback and capex will lead some to believe Intel is gearing up for a major acquisition, whether it be Altera or another firm. Intel shares rallied a bit on Wednesday, as it appears many were relieved that the report was not terrible. Yes, Intel did take down its revenue forecast as expected, and the gross margin forecast was reduced as well. However, the company is still guiding for flat revenues at this point. That is symbolic in the sense that management is not expecting a revenue decline. Net income and earnings per share will most likely decline, as increased costs pressure the bottom line. Intel's restructuring costs are also adding up, and you would like to see those evaporate before long. In terms of the PC space, the launch of Windows 10 later this year will be key for Intel's top line number. The PC industry is showing a decline right now, with the hopes that shipments will improve as the year progresses. If all goes well, Intel might be able to show revenue growth in 2015. Since the report could have been worse, Intel shares jumped on Wednesday. This relief rally helped the stock cross a couple of key points. First, by jumping above $32 a share, the annual dividend yield is now back below 3.00%. Additionally, shares broke above their 50-day moving average, as seen in the chart below. The next key technical line is the 200-day, which is another dollar plus from where shares closed Wednesday. Overall, Intel's report was generally in the ballpark of expectations. Because things could have been worse, shares rallied on the news. Q2 is set up to be a down period, and management expects a better second half of the year. Thanks to the new reporting structure, the Data Center segment will be the star of the show, offsetting weakness from the PC group. For investors looking for growth, Intel is not exactly where you want to be right now thanks to PC industry weakness. However, the stock offers a decent dividend right now and the company is buying back stock. It will be interesting to see if there is a large acquisition announced in the next few months, and to see how the launch of Windows 10 plays out.
