AMD's Financial Analyst Day: What Did We Learn? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD will not be releasing ANY 20nm parts, including GPUs and Project Skybridge processors. K12 will be delayed to 2017, but that's of little consequence. As many readers know, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) had their Financial Analyst meeting on May 6th, with a lot of important information given and many of their confusing strategies cleared up. Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation, including articles based on false charts. It's important to completely understand AMD's strategy, which would have made it obvious the chart was false (due to K12's positioning). Otherwise, it's very difficult to understand what's real, what isn't, and what's actually important. This also allows us to understand if their strategy is coherent and plausible. In many ways, the company has very nearly reversed itself from previous strategies due to the loss of the fabs as well changes in market dynamics. Some of this is due to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) change in focus, and much of it is due to the emergence of other very competent microprocessor designers. The AMD of the past was content to sell into the low-end of the market and fight on price. This was feasible with one competitor, Intel, and that competitor being relatively expensive. On top of this, AMD had fabs and it had massive expenses associated with them. As such, it had to move products in volume, and Intel was content to allow it. Of course, AMD has since spun off its fabs. Equally important, the market has fundamentally changed. So has AMD. Perhaps most significantly, the growth of smartphones and tablets has caused a shift in the market dynamics. Not only are there more opportunities, there are more competitors. These new devices also negatively impacted AMD's core business, the PC market. The shrinking of the PC market and the new competition also has caused Intel to become extremely aggressive in pricing its low-end parts. Since Intel has fabs that need to keep busy, and with the PC market shrinking, it seems very likely Intel will continue very aggressive pricing for the foreseeable future. Of course, those are mostly negative incentives that forced AMD to deprecate the low-end PC market. There also are positive influences, including Intel's recent "Core" releases not appreciably improving performance. Add to this the recent advances by AMD's fabrication partners and there's a real opportunity for AMD. Many will feel that AMD should compete in smartphones and low-end tablets because they are big markets. However, an unbiased view begs the question of what AMD could realistically bring to these markets that would give them an advantage over the crowded field of ARM processor manufacturers. That AMD is moving from the low-end to the high-end is unmistakable. Of course, the company was never entirely low-end, and will not be exclusively high-end, but the overall trajectory of the company is clearly following this course. Management has made this decision without having all the parts in place to do it. Clearly, this transition is perilous while the technology tries to catch up with the new market focus, with awkward and painful earnings part of transformation. It's imperative that one understand that AMD's strategy has changed dramatically. Their other decisions have to be judged on that context, not on the former reality. The meeting dispelled two important questions we had - whether the next generation GPUs will be 20nm, and what happened to Project Skybridge. The answer to the first question is no. Project Skybridge, always something I wasn't clear would provide real value, is dead. In both cases, they were sensible decisions. Skybridge was often misunderstood and only represented using the same socket for both ARM and x86. Dropping that, in itself, isn't a big deal, because having it wasn't a big deal. But, there are associated implications that are much more revealing. Perhaps more importantly is we will not see a 20nm ARM chip or Puma. Also, there's no mention of Puma successors, which could indicate the end of this heretofore very successful design. This is a very risky decision, if true, and could show the lack of development resources AMD has. However, this is not a certainty as it could be included in the "A-Series" Lisa Su spoke of, but this seems somewhat unlikely. It may be disappointing to many that AMD has stuck with the 28nm node for the 2015 GPUs. This probably also points to AMD's shrinking resources and being forced to make difficult decisions. Since the node will have a relatively short useful life as FinFets follow, the cost may not have justified the benefit. Either way, for 2015, High Bandwidth Memory will be the major new feature for AMD's high-end GPUs. FinFets will have to wait until 2016. Another sign of AMD's diminishing R&D budget showed up with the delay of K12, AMD's new ARM processor. This was originally intended for 2016, and has been pushed back to 2017, ostensibly to focus on Zen. Zen, an x86 processor, is clearly more important, and choosing it over K12 is a correct and obvious decision. However, that this decision had to be made at all shows a disturbing lack of resources. Other than that, moving K12 back to 2017 will have little impact on the company as the market for this processor is not developed, regardless of how competent it may prove to be. As time progresses, so should this market, although I believe more slowly than most are predicting. There were a few very positive indications from the management, at least from my perspective. It has been my contention for quite some time AMD has to take Intel on directly and compete on single-threaded performance. I also believed Zen will define the company far more materially than anything, and everything, else AMD does. The whole approach of avoiding Intel always seemed very misguided, and moving away from a market with 300 million units per year, with one competitor, even more so. Those days are over, thank goodness. Zen is clearly intending to take Intel on in performance, not avoid it. It does not apologize for CPU performance, while trying to convince the customer they really need GPU performance. As if to confirm its conviction, AMD will be releasing Zen first as a FX processor - not as an APU. As an FX processor, it will have to stand on its merits as a CPU, and management seems very confident it can. Many reading this will have the obvious point of view that AMD's position might be chest-pounding and fluff to push their product. However, if one contrasts that with the position of the company with the releases of Kaveri and Carizzo, the emphasis is completely different. For the latter two, AMD stressed either GPU performance, or power savings, but not CPU performance. With Zen, which Mark Papermaster says improves IPC by 40% compared to Excavator (Carizzo) is being described mainly by its performance. Also refreshing was AMD's new commitment to the server segment. This also indicates confidence in processor performance, because this segment is much less cost-sensitive and values performance and performance per watt highly. All in all, there was a lot of bad - going from abandoning 20nm products, including Skybridge and 2015 GPUs, as well as clear consequences of the reduction in R&D. Moving K12 back to 2017 is yet another face on that picture. Most alarming to me is the possibility the "cat" processor line is being abandoned, but that is not certain. All of that falls to nothing if Zen is a good processor, and AMD seems to be placing the proper emphasis on its importance, as well as confidence in it. As many have seen me say in my articles, the technology is what matters, and everything else is fluff. When Lisa Su said essentially the same thing, and when Mark Papermaster discussed how they greatly improved the cache and memory subsystem (two other areas I've hammered AMD on), I gained a lot more confidence that management was dead-on. I didn't want to see a Zen APU, at least not first, I wanted an FX, and got it. I didn't want to hear about Zen's performance per watt ad naseum, or HSA, I wanted to hear confidence in raw CPU performance. I got it. I didn't want to hear about building OEM relationships for more unit sales, but the importance of technology. I got it. After hearing so much nonsense for so long, and the improper emphasis on things that don't matter, I came out of this feeling much better about the company. And Zen. Which is pretty much the same thing, for now. Source: AMD's Financial Analyst Day: What Did We Learn? Disclosure: The author is long AMD.
