Microsoft: The Windows Smartphone Gets A New Lease On Life - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile features Continuum, which allows the phone to be docked for desktop use. The new HP Elite x3 puts more processing power behind Windows 10 Mobile. When Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) pulled the plug on the Surface 2 last year, it didn't quite abandon its Windows on ARM initiative. Microsoft continued to work on a phone version of Windows 10 that would run on ARM chips. Microsoft's Lumia 950 and 950 XL feature the new Windows 10 OS, but are rather unimpressive, underpowered phones. That all changes with the arrival of the HP (NYSE: HPQ ) Elite x3, powered by the new Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 820. I have at various times pointed to Microsoft's lack of presence in smartphones as an ongoing problem. The smartphone has become the most important personal computing device in many people's lives and, in emerging markets, may be the only one. As much as Microsoft bulls might like to forgive the right-off for the Lumia purchase, Microsoft's smartphone business has been a monumental failure. There have always been a number of obstacles to adoption of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems. Personally, I've always liked the OS and thought it superior to Android, but I've concluded that the tile based interface is off-putting to most consumers. It's just so busy and complicated, achieving remarkable data overload in such a compressed space. It's a computer geek's vision of a mobile operating system. And you know how us computer geeks love complexity. For some reason, Microsoft has never been willing to tone this down and has instead kept going in the opposite direction, squeezing in even more tiles of varying sizes. Until Microsoft realizes that most people are not as entranced by complexity as Microsoft is, the OS will always have a limited following. This, even more than the relative paucity of apps, is what's holding Microsoft back in smartphones. Many observers have already declared Windows 10 Mobile dead just based on apps. I'm not willing to do that. I see definite progress. The Windows app store continues to gain apps, and is now up to 669,000 . The ability to create Universal Windows apps that run on all Win10 platforms has made it easier for developers to create apps for Windows 10 Mobile. The killer app for Win10 Mobile is clearly Continuum, which allows the phone to be used in a desktop-like Win10 environment using a keyboard, monitor and mouse. It's still not quite full Windows, of course. It's Windows in the RT vein. You can't run legacy Windows software. You can't run much in the way of PC games. But you can run the Windows 10 Mobile version of Office. The ability to create Word, Powerpoint, and Excel documents in a desktop like environment hosted in a smartphone is no small achievement. Those of you who remember the Motorola Atrix 4G might be inclined to think that this is the same very hobbled desktop experience. It's kind of the same vision from a hardware standpoint, but Continuum offers so much more than the Atrix ever could. Until now, what has held Continuum back has been underpowered processors available on Windows 10 Mobile devices. Microsoft's own Lumia 950 and 950XL are powered by the Snapdragon 808 and 810 respectively. Now that Qualcomm has fielded the powerful Snapdragon 820 , built on the latest Samsung 14 nm FinFET process, the tech world is acknowledging how lousy Qualcomm's previous generation processors really were. The HP Elite x3 fixes that with the new Snap 820 processor , and now Continuum can be expected to work more smoothly and efficiently. Continuum isn't an ideal solution for those used to the power of a full Wintel desktop, but it greatly increases the TAM for Windows phone. The Elite x3 comes has an available dock that provides output for a monitor, ethernet port, and USB ports. It makes for a very tidy and convenient way to instantly convert the phone to a desktop system. There's also a notebook adapter that provides a screen, keyboard and battery while using the phone's processor. This points the way to a very likely future for consumer-level personal computing. Many consumers' home personal computing needs are addressed by Windows 10 Mobile Continuum capabilities as exemplified by the new Elite x3. It is also one of the least expensive Windows 10 personal computers one could buy, if you exclude peripherals. The significance of the Elite x3 is that no other smartphone or personal computing platform can match its capabilities. Not Android, not iOS. Sure you can plug an Android device into a monitor, and pair it with a keyboard and mouse. But you're still left with the Android home screen, and the limitations inherent in Android apps. Not really a desktop experience. The situation is even worse in iOS. For years, iPhone users have been able to display their screen output on a TV or monitor through an adapter cable or wirelessly via Airplay. This didn't really allow a desktop experience, however, because iOS forces the user to make all input through the phone touchscreen or a Bluetooth keyboard. The user is constantly forced to glance back and forth between the monitor and the iOS device. Pretty useless, except for watching videos. It's a shame, really, because iOS devices are quite powerful and come with a suite of office productivity apps from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Here, we see the wisdom of Microsoft's convergence approach and the stupidity of Apple's dogmatic refusal to embrace convergence. For year people have talked about this concept of a single mobile device that could serve all possible roles of smartphone, tablet and desktop. There have even been a few attempts such as the Atrix 4G. With the HP Elite x3 and Windows 10 Continuum, consumers now have a very credible realization of this vision. It's not perfect, but it's only going to get better as processors and operating systems improve. As I thought about the significance of the x3, I came to believe that this is really the future of the Windows PC, even more than Intel powered tablets and convertibles. It's fortunate for Microsoft and its OEM partners that this future is ARM based. It means that Microsoft now has a good opportunity to expand market share in smartphones. Undoubtedly, Microsoft's Lumia brand will be getting Snapdragon 820 upgrades soon. While the PC market does appear to have "stabilized", this is just a nice word for "stagnated". The true growth is in smartphones and smartphone-like devices. The power of high end smartphones is already well in excess of what most consumers do with them. The value proposition of Windows 10 Mobile is therefore very compelling: consumers get to take full advantage of the power of their device to do more, experience more. The new generation of Windows 10 Mobile devices, as exemplified by the Elite x3 can be expected to grow market share in smartphones. Whether this is enough to restore Microsoft to true growth remains to be seen. I continue to rate Microsoft a hold. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
