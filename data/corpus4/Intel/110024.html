A Sea Of Change At Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is building a presence within the wearable and connected devices front or the â€œdata collectorsâ€? by acting as an enabler of new technological offerings and as a device manufacturer. Intelâ€™s acquisition of Recon Instruments positions Intel on the top of the current wearable market food chain within the head-worn category. Intel launched Intel Capital in 1991 to invest in startups to enable new technological offerings, but Intel has become more aggressive acquiring companies instead of just maintaining a financial interest. As IoT continues to develop, Intel is in prime position to finally begin to bear fruit from its acquisition of McAfee in 2011 over the coming years. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has always been a critical cog as the engine powering PCs and servers, but a sea of change and opportunity is just around the corner. Intel launched Intel Capital in 1991 to invest in startups to enable new technological offerings to succeed with Intel inside. However, more recently, Intel has become more aggressive acquiring companies instead of just maintaining a vested financial interest. Intel recently purchased Recon Instruments, a sporty smartglasses manufacturer based in Vancouver, Canada. I recently published a Seeking Alpha article detailing Intel's investments and recent acquisitions within the augmented reality space. I believe Intel sees the potential to sell wearable devices as an opportunity to rapidly scale and leverage its IP and rapidly scale its IoT division. Intel missed the smartphone revolution, but is still fighting for its life to win new business, and currently boasts relationships with several smartphone manufacturers including ZTE, Huawei, Lenovo, and Motorola. On the tablet side, Intel was able to attach itself to 46m tablets giving it a presence in nearly 1 out of 5 tablets sold in 2014 with manufacturers including AARP, ASUS, Dell, HP, Fuhu, Lenovo and Samsung. In its December 2014 IoT Insights presentation , Intel lays out the current wearable market product placement in terms of performance, functionality and price. Within the wearable device market trackers are at the lowest price point and functionality and head-worn devices at the highest price point and functionality. Intel's acquisition of Recon Instruments positions Intel on the top of the current wearable market food chain within the head-worn category, and is a perfect position for Intel to leverage its IP to enhance head-worn device performance functionality, and eventually sell millions of Intel-branded smartglasses annually. Intel is also in a unique position to sell head-worn devices and control a lion's share of the processors to other emerging players in the smartglasses marketplace. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich recently made some changes at the top with key personnel as well as consolidating and streamlining Intel's strategy. One area that was impacted by the recent change was Intel Capital. Intel Capital was the blue chip's financing arm that was launched in 1991, and that has funded more than $11B into over 1,400 companies in 57 countries. Intel announced last week as part of the recent shakeup that Intel Capital will merge with the Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Transaction Group. The line between Intel Capital and Intel Corporate's role over the past several years has become blurred. Several companies that were initially funded by Intel Capital ended up being acquired by Intel Corporate. At the end of the day, Intel was able to present acquisition targets up to the M&A organization for final approval, but this former process appears inefficient due to the organizational structure. It makes a lot of sense to merge these organizations and focus on the portfolio of investments and decide up front within one committee whether to invest and divest or invest and acquire a company prior to funding each new investment. Additionally, what the Intel Capital organizational shift means to me is that Intel is very focused on growing and developing IoT hardware and software solutions. As a result, I expect Intel to continue to scoop up companies that enhance their existing footprint. Recent acquisitions of Altera and wearable devices maker Recon Instruments are prime examples of Intel's focus on IoT. If you look at the structure of Intel's IoT efforts, you begin to see synergy across the ecosystem and begin to fully understand Intel's most recent acquisitions of Recon and Altera. At the 5,000 foot level, IoT begins with wearable and connected devices that collect data and transmit data via Wi-Fi or other means to a central database that is housed on virtual servers (cloud) or traditional servers. The data is collected, secured/encrypted, catalogued and then analyzed through queries. The collected data ends up being stored and also acts as the foundation for various servicing options including software as a service (SaaS) and professional services (consulting, etc.). Intel is building a presence within the wearable and connected devices front or the "data collectors" by acting as an enabler of new technological offerings or in some cases as the manufacturer. Intel's acquisition of McAfee will become an integral part of Intel's soup to nuts IoT product offerings after Intel announced on July 1st that the Intel Security organization (formerly the independent McAfee division) was formally integrated under Intel's security general manager Chris Young. There is a strong appetite for the latest wearable and other connected devices by Fortune 100, but in addition to delivering tremendous benefits, they also present IT shops with tremendous security risks and concerns. Data breaches have been occurring all over the world, and it only takes one unsecured access point for hackers to inflict incredible damage to company's brands and financial well being. Security is one of the most important elements that inhibit or accelerate wearable and connected device adoption. Without question, Intel is on the forefront of being a leader enabler and producer of wearable devices. Intel is in a unique position to not only be the leading processor supplier to smartglasses manufacturers that will carry a healthy ASP and gross margins, but also be a key manufacturer of smartglasses. Additionally, as IoT continues to develop, Intel is in prime position to finally begin to bear fruit from its acquisition of McAfee in 2011 over the coming years. A new Intel is on the cusp of developing, a new Intel that will not only be the engine that powers wearable devices but the car that takes consumers on a ride of their lives.
