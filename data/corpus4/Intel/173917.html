Theoretical Intel And Micron Merger: The Window Of Opportunity Is Closing - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha By 2020, the bulk of Micron's revenue will come from technologies that it is jointly developing and manufacturing with Intel. Micron's absurdly low valuation, the lack of antitrust concerns over 3D NAND and XPoint market and the ideal anti-China political environment have created a fantastic opportunity for Intel to acquire Micron. This potential merger is probably just wild speculation on my part that is not backed up with a significant amount of evidence. On paper, an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) merger makes a lot of sense. Through Intel and Micron's IMFT joint venture, the two developed 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. These non-volatile memories have the potential to thrust these two semiconductor giants from laggards of the memory industry to the clear engineering leaders. With 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, Intel and Micron could have something special. In a previous Seeking Alpha article, I speculated that Micron's 3D XPoint could find a home in IMDB . By pairing DRAM with XPoint in a package, the endurance limitations of XPoint could be significantly mitigated and the overall cost of memory for IMDB could be reduced significantly. Russ Fischer of Seeking Alpha consistently seems to be overly bullish or bearish in his semiconductor positions (from my perspective). One thing he always does though is make me think and reevaluate, which I believe is the goal of writing on this site. He posted an article in August on this site that suggested an Intel CPU could be combined with 1 GB of DRAM and 16 GB of XPoint in a single package using EMIB. To put it in non-technical terms, there are significant potential synergies with packaging some combination of DRAM, 3D XPoint and 3D NAND and an Intel CPU. By my aggressive estimates, the bulk of Micron's revenue in 2020 and beyond will come from technologies that it is jointly developing and manufacturing with Intel. These technologies are 3D NAND and 3D XPoint (and potentially another yet to be announced non-volatile memory). I also believe there is a reasonably good chance that Intel and Micron's implementation of 3D NAND will give the duo the industry's highest bit density NAND that will scale well and allow the two partners to maintain a cost advantage over Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), SK Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) and SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) for many years to come. It also seems highly likely that Micron and Intel with XPoint are currently significantly ahead of Samsung and SK Hynix in developing a next-generation non-volatile memory. While the two companies are highly cooperative partners, they are still currently competitors. If 3D NAND and XPoint become as important and successful as I expect they will be by 2020, the odds of a DOJ (Department of Justice) and/or FTC (Federal Trade Commission) intervention in a potential merger between the two semiconductor leaders will likely be significantly higher in the future than they are now when these two technologies produce essentially no revenue for either firm. Micron and Intel could be successful in the future as separate entities. However, being partners in the design and manufacturing of 3D NAND and XPoint while at the same time potentially being adversaries in selling these products creates an uncomfortable dynamic. Toshiba ( OTCPK:TOSBF ) and SanDisk have proven it is possible to succeed with this sort of relationship, but ultimately, it just makes so much more sense for Intel and Micron to merge and create a single semiconductor giant. This new semiconductor company created by the merger could significantly increase its power and technological advantage over the industry. By controlling the entire world's supply of XPoint, Intel would prevent competitors from getting their hands on this cost efficient, non-volatile memory and create a package containing a CPU, DRAM and XPoint of their own. If Micron and Intel's 3D NAND is able to take the cost per bit leadership, as I expect in 2016, and maintain this lead for the foreseeable future, the two would only serve as competitors against each other on price (unless they are able to agree not to compete against each other in certain markets). As a single entity, they would be able to maximize their gross margins that they have earned from their superior NAND architecture. I will present my crazy conspiracy theory now. I believe it is possible that Tsinghua Unigroup, which Intel has a 20% stake in, made a bid for Micron at a price that the Chinese company realized had no chance of being accepted by Micron at the behest of Intel. The main purpose of this bid may have been to stir the political fear machine that wants people to believe China is evil and a takeover of Micron by a Chinese company would be a huge risk to national security. Senators Chuck Schumer and John McCain have publicly raised their concerns about Tsinghua Unigroup's "unsolicited" bid. With the US government fearing a potential Chinese acquisition of a strategically important company to the nation, Intel making a bid for Micron will seem like a white knight has come to save Micron from the hands of the enemy. What a noble gesture it would be for Intel to acquire Micron for the greater good! (Sarcasm intended in the previous sentence.) When two companies that are as large and as important as Intel and Micron are trying to merge, it is difficult to predict how the DOJ and FTC will act. Government agencies are not always rational. A merger of the two a few months ago may have sparked at least mild protest from both the DOJ and FTC. Congress (and other members of the government) may now urge regulators to look the other way and allow for Intel and Micron to merge to prevent the unacceptable possibility of a takeover from a Chinese company. With the current low valuation Micron is receiving in the market, it would be an opportunistic time for Intel to make an acquisition offer with a large premium in excess of 100% to the current $16.50/share Micron is trading at now. While I strongly believe that Micron is worth well over double its current price, there's a good chance Micron's shareholders would jump at the opportunity to seize immediate sizable gains. Of course, Intel's pending acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) adds a wrinkle to the timing equation of this theoretical deal. It is extremely unlikely Intel would attempt an acquisition of Micron until the Altera deal is complete. I believe the window for an Intel acquisition of Micron could close over the next 12-18 months, as the perfect storm of a low price on Micron's shares, the lack of antitrust concerns over 3D NAND and XPoint, and the ideal political environment for this deal are unlikely to last indefinitely. With or without an Intel acquisition, I believe Micron presents compelling value to long-term shareholders at this price level. Intel's shareholders probably won't be crying either if a deal happens.
