Apple: Does It Matter That iPad Pro Isn't A Notebook Replacement? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's CEO has claimed that iPad Pro could replace a PC for many users. Many have pointed to obvious exceptions, such as the inability to run some PC software available for Windows and Mac OS X. Recently, contributors to SA as well as other writers have taken issue with a statement by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook that iPad Pro could replace a notebook PC. Somehow, being able to replace a notebook has become the standard by which the iPad Pro is to be judged. But I doubt this really makes sense, especially for investors wanting to gauge the iPad Pro's market potential. It's important to note that Cook qualified his statement regarding the Pro in a recent interview with The Telegraph : Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones. So Cook wasn't trying to argue that the Pro could replace a laptop or desktop computer for everyone. He was simply making an observation that has already been true about the iPad for some time. For people with relatively undemanding computer needs such as checking email, web surfing, and watching videos, the iPad alone can meet their needs. Since its introduction, the iPad has gradually become more powerful, both in terms of processor hardware and in terms of iOS capability. So iPad's role has expanded, and the Pro just takes that a step further. iPad Pro features the A9X SOC, which is roughly comparable in capability to low-end Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core M processors (Skylake gen). The iPad Pro also features the true multitasking capability of iOS 9. The range of usage scenarios is therefore much greater, and yes, for many more people than before, the iPad Pro can replace a general purpose PC. At the same time, Cook's statements regarding convergence amount to an acknowledgement that iPad Pro is not a universal notebook or PC replacement. In another interview with independent.ie , Cook continued to reiterate his stance: We feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad. Because what that would wind up doing, or what we're worried would happen, is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants. So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You'd begin to compromise in different ways. Given Apple's position on the matter of convergence, I don't think it really makes sense to evaluate iPad Pro on the basis of it not being something Apple doesn't intend it to be. Yet this is essentially what Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Pitti does in Apple: iPad Pro Is A Bust . Pitti concludes: Apple's failed iPad Pro launch signifies a need to merge iOS and Mac OS X to create a product that runs the necessary applications to be a laptop replacement. Mr. Pitti's conclusion of failure seems a little premature. It's not at all clear that iPad Pro will not stem the decline in iPad sales this quarter. Most Pro models are now back-ordered approximately two weeks, indicating strong iPad demand. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted iPad Pro sales of 2.4-2.6 million units this quarter. The point of the iPad Pro is not to replace the PC, it's to expand the total addressable market of Apple's iPad series of products. It does that in much the same way iPhone 6 expanded the market for iPhone, by offering a larger screen and more powerful capabilities. I believe Kuo is being a tad conservative, but clearly supply/demand balance has not been achieved. I am sympathetic to Pitti's fundamental assertion that Apple should merge iOS and OS X. Sympathetic, but not in agreement. I've stated numerous times that I believe the process of convergence between tablet and personal computer is underway regardless of what Tim Cook or anyone else has to say about it. iOS 9 features numerous personal computer features such as multitasking and hints at more to come, such as cursor support (the track pad mode for the on-screen keyboard). I've also said that there's no fundamental point to maintaining separate PC and tablet operating systems in the long run. In my view, each of the three mobile OS providers is on its own unique path of convergence. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has chosen to base its converged platform on its PC OS. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) appears to want to place its bet on Android , which already provides desktop-like mouse and track pad support. I believe Apple's approach is to continually evolve iOS to be more and more capable, until it subsumes OS X, even as Apple maintains OS X and computers based on it as a separate product line. This has advantages and disadvantages. The key advantage is that iOS is a more modern platform than OS X. It's inherently more secure by virtue of requiring all apps to be dispensed through the Apple-controlled App Store. This also places significant limits on the type of third party APIs that developers can use, which also improves security as well as consistency of user experience. The key disadvantage is in software availability. This is really the fundamental criticism that reviewers have of the iPad Pro. Desktop apps such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Creative Cloud that are available in Mac OS X and Windows 10 simply aren't available on the Pro. Given the huge and growing ecosystem of iOS apps, I'm not convinced that this is as serious a limitation as is supposed. I expect software availability to improve over time for professional users. Either Adobe and other companies will fully port their PC apps, or other developers will swoop in to fill the gap. As an Apple developer and investor, I do wish Apple was a little less dogmatic on the issue of operating system purity. This is not a cause I find particularly inspiring. Mac OS X laptops could be easily endowed with touchscreens, and I'm certain that Mac OS X would do a better job supporting a touchscreen than Windows 10. This would give users the benefits of the touchscreen combined with access to apps not available in iOS. But it's clear that's not going to happen, and perhaps it doesn't need to in the long run. I believe Apple is much more interested in investing in iOS than Mac OS X, precisely because it is the more modern and secure platform, as well as the far more successful and lucrative platform. So the fact that iOS isn't yet the do-everything personal computing platform probably doesn't matter. It will get there eventually. The fact that iPad Pro isn't a PC replacement for everyone is kind of a red herring. The importance of the Pro is that it's the next step in the evolutionary process of iPad and iOS. I believe it's going to find a much larger market than many expect, and like iPhone 6, will unlock pent up demand for a larger screen iPad that has held back sales of iPad for the past couple of years. Supply constraints will undoubtedly limit sales for the December quarter. However, I expect those constraints to be relieved in calendar 2016 Q1, when I expect sales to exceed the December quarter significantly rather than subside as Kuo has predicted. I remain long Apple and continue to rate it a Buy. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
