Why Hasn't Micron Stock Responded To 3D XPoint? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha 3D XPoint is faster, denser and has greater endurance than NAND. However, Micron has very little incentive to move the pricing down and has limited sell-through capability into the enterprise. This implies that Micron might not be able to capitalize on the technology immediately despite having a final product. Furthermore, competition in stiffening in the 32-layer 3D NAND space, as Samsung is going to be on its second generation V-NAND in the August 2015 time frame. I reviewed the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) presentation yesterday, and for the most part, I thought 3D XPoint was one of those once in a decade "aha" moments for the PC. It's faster, denser and has greater endurance than NAND Flash. According to the Intel press release, it's 1,000 times faster than NAND, 10 times denser than conventional memory, and has 1,000 times the endurance. However, the new technology will take a couple of years to truly mature, and I see a narrow space in which there will be immediate adoption, which is in the data center. Because the memory access speeds are so fast, the high performance computing, i.e. super computers, will find the quicker read speeds pretty useful. However, conventional data centers can use a mix of faster and slower memory read and write speeds because some data is purely for storage and other data is used on a regular basis. So, the presentation that Intel and Micron put on talked a lot about the potential use cases. But I think that for those use cases to materialize there needs to be a wave of adoption from consumers in order for software designers to really invest the time and effort into creating those more powerful programs. In other words, it's not enough to have better technology. Intel and Micron need to develop a powerful business model that can quickly reach the mass market. This will be difficult, and quite frankly the time it will take to reach that massive adoption also will require Intel and Micron to disrupt their own cost structure a little bit. I think Intel and Micron might not have the incentive to take 3D XPoint and compete with themselves by pricing the product low enough so that it displaces demand for both DRAM and SSDs. They're going to maximize profitability, which makes sense from a business context, but it's certainly not going to render the remaining competitors bankrupt overnight. If you look at the stock price, there was an immediate 2% move to the upside following the announcement. However, the weak reaction more or less confirms my thought process. This new technology while powerful isn't going to immediately move the needle in terms of revenue or profitability. There's the ongoing issue of how this might or might not benefit Micron. I say this because Intel secures the wafers from the Utah facility at the cost of goods sold - they're not paying any more or any less than Micron for that same unit. However, Intel has a way more efficient channel to sell 3DXpoint than Micron, because Intel can also bundle servers CPUs, co-processors and even FPGAs. This means Intel can offer far more value than Micron can, because they can sell the remaining components for a lower price and in return generate more in total revenue than Micron can from a similar transaction. So, if anything, Intel is the bigger winner in the immediate short run as the company has a very strong relationship with the top cloud providers in the server space. In fact many of the top PC OEMs have built their PC manufacturing near various Intel fabs, which kind of explains how streamlined the process of integrating an Intel SKU is in comparison to Micron. That being the case, I'm not saying Micron won't generate value from this new memory technology. I just think that the stock price reflects how exposed the company could be to competitors like Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) while also having a very limited presence in data centers. Intel's DCG did pretty well, and a lot of that is driven by the growth in both SSDs and CPUs in the space. Not only are computing needs going up, but the same could be said for storage requirements. However, Micron tends to focus more on retail channels and might have better sell through to consumer PCs. However, we all know that the PC cycle is at its trough, and Micron along with the rest of the PC industry got hammered for being overly dependent on the cyclical nature of PCs. At this rate, a whole wave of computers will need to fall apart and break down before consumers are willing to replace their computers, and even then we're not even sure if they're going to buy another PC because they can consume a lot of content on tablets and gain access to a richer app library. So, if Intel really wants to strike a hammer on the entire industry it would sell 3DXpoint at a lower per GB rate than they sell SSDs, starving competitors by having a faster, cheaper, better and more reliable product. Over the short run it would ramp-up revenue, and it would mitigate the available resources for competitors to plough back into R&D. This strategy when taken to an extreme also would irritate shareholders who are looking for a steady dividend stream, so it's unlikely that Intel and Micron could capitalize very quickly on their first mover advantage. However, competitors wanting to catch up could find this to be extremely difficult because it's a fundamentally new technology. That being the case, there's going to be a lot of pressure on Intel to at least extend the length of their business relationship with Micron. How will they do that? I don't know, because they originally agreed on a call contract that Micron will use to buy back the remaining 49% stake in IMFT in 2018. This means that the breakthrough technology they had developed jointly has only limited value to Intel, or in finance speak, the terminal value of IMFT is limited. However, Micron also is at odds with this, because even if they can reap the full rewards after 2018, they're still not able to sell as effectively into the data center space for the next three years. Consumers aren't going to adopt this technology as quickly because they're going to buy at the low-end primarily, and if tablets are able to ship with the cheaper flash memory at 64GB at a sub $300 price point, then consumers are going to jump on that versus a really expensive PC with cutting edge memory and CPU. Furthermore, the difference in 3D XPoint isn't as wide when compared to NAND. That's because the logarithmic shrink in read speeds happens at the microsecond to nanosecond scale, which implies that today's applications aren't going to look that much more smoother. However, the transition from rotating disks to NAND flash went from microseconds to milliseconds, which is way more noticeable on a neurological level. In other words, 3DXpoint opens up a pathway for enthusiasts to brag about further future proofing their current PCs, which limits the market potential to PCs that are priced above $1,000. I'm not even sure if Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will release their mainstream MacBook line-up with this new technology, but I do anticipate Samsung's second generation 32-layer V-NAND chips to hit the market first and to be priced even more aggressively than Micron's SSDs. Sure, we could argue about the technological specifics all day, but there's no denying that Samsung tends to engage in price wars and has won much of the memory business over the years due to pricing alone. Therefore, the bigger theme for memory in 2016 is going to be NAND flash. PC OEMs will move further up the memory stack from 128GB to perhaps 512 GB to 1 TB storage options in response to cheaper pricing. This will be blamed on Samsung, as they've lowered their pricing throughout 2015 and will likely cut pricing even more aggressively as they further optimize their nodes for more efficiency and higher density. The price points for the upcoming SSDS to be released by Samsung are $125 to $290 for 120GB to 480 GB. I can already imagine Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with 480 GB of flash memory at a $2,000 price point. Perhaps the $2,500 model will come with 1TB of flash memory, especially if Apple passes on the cost savings to consumers. Also, this is the fastest growing mainstream enthusiast PC segment, and I don't think Micron will gain much traction in that specific space, as there's a lot of competition. Therefore, I'm not ready to say that Micron is an overnight buy. Sure, they've come up with a revolutionary technology, but they're not positioned yet to capitalize on it immediately. This will give competitors a window of opportunity to build up their own technological capabilities, which may result in Micron losing somewhat of an edge. I'm not pessimistic, but I'm not yet ready to recommend the stock to anybody at the present time.
