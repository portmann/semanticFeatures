Will Someone Take Fitbit Out Before It Falls? - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit shares are crashing and should fall below their first post-IPO trade. Fitbit is profitable, but still priced above its fundamentals. Full disclosure. I have a Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ). It's the version that gives me my heart rate. It's useful. It lets me know when meditation has succeeded in relaxing me. It lets me know when I'm going a little too hard on a workout. It even lets me know when I've gone a little long without sugar (my heart rate goes up while I grow tired). It is slowly helping me lose the weight I need to get out of the diabetes waiting room. But it's not a long-term relationship. The band is already coming apart from the covering, even though I'm careful about not wearing it in the water. Fitness trackers are, by their nature, disposable. That may also be true with fitness tracking stocks. Since coming public back in June, Fitbit has nearly done a round trip, and its recent crash (down almost 8% Thursday and another 7% overnight) should soon have it falling below the first post-IPO trade price. Is there any reason to catch this falling knife? The company was profitable in 2014, and in the first three quarters of this year has recorded net income of over $100 million on sales of nearly $1.15 billion. Still, there's a growing belief that fitness trackers are a fad, like pet rocks were 20 years ago, and that it will just become a function within a larger Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch ecosystem. The best reason to buy now might be Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ) buying Misfit, which makes a competing product, for $260 million. Fashion watch makers are deeply threatened by the Apple Watch. Tag Heuer has just gone after the Apple Watch directly with help from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The problem is there are other, cheaper places to play this, like Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ). Acquirers could thus come from several directions. Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) might be a perfect fit for Fitbit, as might Nike (NYSE: NKE ) - Fitbit seems to have cracked a market both want. Tech outfits Alphabet or Intel might want Fitbit's market expertise. Medical device companies might be able to quickly run a version of Fitbit past the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators for use in hospitals, hospices, and personal care. What's holding back speculation is the technology angle. Apple is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. They're in the market, they've taken the high end of it, and they're not planning on letting go of it. So do you buy Fitbit and hope it gets bought? Or do you wait until it has been driven down to a "reasonable" price multiple - 30 times this year's expected earnings of about $150 million comes to about $4.5 billion, which is another 30% below the current market cap of about $6.5 billion.
