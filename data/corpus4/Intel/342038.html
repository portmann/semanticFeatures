Intel And Apple: It's All About Perception - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Reports circulating of Intel getting a modem into iPhone. Over the last couple of years, there has been a lot of speculation about when chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will finally get into Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone. Recently, the chatter has perked up again with rumors of Intel getting a modem into an upcoming Apple smartphone. Until we actually see Intel inside of the iPhone, investors should remain lukewarm on the financial impact of Intel's mobile prospects although the headline might be enough to move the stock. The analyst at Cowen stated that supply chain evidence points to Apple using Intel's 7360 modem as a "second source for some SKUs of a forthcoming iPhone." The analyst continued by saying that Apple would likely test the waters with this product on a lower end phone or tablet first, likely aimed at non-US and non-Chinese geographies. If Intel could gain 25% of Apple modem volume, the chip giant could see a boost to EPS of $0.10 or more. That would equate to a little more than 4.1% of the adjusted earnings per share figure that analysts are looking for Intel to deliver this year, but would essentially double the company's EPS growth. Remember, Intel is likely to give multiple EPS figures this year as it adjusts for expenses coming from the Altera acquisition. While that headline EPS boost seems rather nice, I remain a bit skeptical that it would happen. First, the analyst stated that Intel needs 25% of Apple modem volume, but yet details how he only expects Intel to be contracted for certain models, aimed at certain regions, and most likely ones at the low end. Until Intel proves it has a top tier product here, it seems unlikely that Apple will give Intel a lot of business at first, especially not with its flagship phone(s). Additionally, with Intel trying desperately to get its foot in the door, I'm sure that the chip giant would be giving Apple a bit of a break on cost here. Remember those "contra-revenues" that Intel used to make inroads in the tablet business? They really hurt the company's profitability, and I figured we'd see something similar here. Don't forget, Intel's mobile efforts are included within the Client Computing Group, which is Intel's largest revenue segment, meaning any progress will be buried in the results. Before investors celebrate any potential Apple win, another analyst on the street recently threw cold water on the news. Stacy Rasgon stated the following when calling the reports extremely optimistic and perhaps unrealistic: As to what we think about the reports in question? Well, we do believe that Intel appears to be gunning for the socket, and the general idea that AAPL might want to second-source QCOM at some point seems plausible. However, for a variety of reasons Intel capturing 30-40% of AAPL's volume at this stage in the game seems extremely optimistic to us - to wit, Intel's offerings appear under-specced, they don't have CDMA, they are manufactured on a worse process node (raising the spectre of battery life), Intel's forward roadmap appears much worse that Qualcomm's, and Intel's track record on mobile execution remains extremely spotty. And such a large potential share loss appears inconsistent with Qualcomm's commentary on chipset margin trajectory (so we conclude that at least Qualcomm themselves do not foresee such a large loss forthcoming). It has been nearly a year now since we first heard rumors of Intel getting into the iPhone , and perhaps things are finally happening. However, the financial impact would seem to be limited, and I don't think Intel will see a dramatic benefit to earnings per share. Perhaps the more important part will be perception in terms of how investors see Intel's mobile efforts. With the chip giant being well behind in the tablet and smartphone race, losing billions of dollars a year, an Apple win should please shareholders. In the end, Intel needs to continue diversifying away from the PC business as one analyst recently stated that PCs are doing worse than expected so far this year.
