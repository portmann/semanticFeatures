Atom And Quark: Positioning Intel Beyond Wintel And Smartphones - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 21, 2015 12:42 PM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: ARMH , ATML , FSL , MCHP , NXP , QCOM , STM by: Robert Castellano Intel's Atom and Quark are positioning Intel to move beyond its Wintel legacy products. MCUs will play a dominant role in smart technology/IoT despite falling average selling prices. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom has had a storied past. Introduced in 2008, its primary use was for low-power netbooks. But netbooks, used primarily to surf the net, only lasted a few years until tablets entered the scene. I was never a proponent of Atom and wrote a series of articles in Seeking Alpha, pointing out that Intel was losing money on each Atom sold because the company was utilizing expensive fab space and equipment to commit to manufacturing these devices at the expense of significantly more expensive MPUs. A December 4, 2014, article in Seeking Alpha continued my argument, wherein the author noted that: For the past 18 months, Intel has lost roughly $7B in the development and selling of Atom into the mobile space." Now Atom will be snuffed out in the course of the next 18 months as the new 14nm Broadwell and Skylake processors are iterated in various die sizes hitting the extremes of price and performance." As usual, great executives at great companies adjust to adverse conditions. Just a few months later, in February 2015, Intel announced the Atom x3, x5 and x7 processors. According to Intel's website : This change will start with the next generation of processors. Intel Atom x3 processor provides basic but genuine Intel-level tablet, phablet and smartphone performance. Intel Atom x5 processor has more capabilities and features for people who want an even better experience, and the flagship Intel Atom x7 processor provides the highest level of performance and capabilities for the Intel Atom family. The Intel Atom processor is designed to provide the best battery life with great performance for tablets, phablets, smartphones and other mobile devices." Intel is positioning itself to move beyond the Wintel era and dreams of replacing ARM in mobile devices. I'm talking about really big markets, not the 300 million PCs or the 1.2 billion smartphones sold in 2014 and whether the Atom will be used in any of them going forward. I'm talking about IoT (Internet of Things) and wearables. According to Intel, fifty billion connected devices are expected by 2020. Yes, I know I'm speaking of volumes not revenues, and Intel makes significantly more money on PC and server sales. These represent 88% of sales, whereas IoT represents less than 4%. But that's the present, not the future, and Intel is thinking about the future. Besides, low-cost Atoms are only part of IoT, as shown in Figure 1 below: The low-cost Intel chips, which are the focus of this article, represent an integral part of Intel's IoT strategy, which will utilize higher cost, higher profit, and lower volume chips, including server chips. We also need to consider Intel's FPGAs from newly acquired Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) and other hardware and software platforms. Intel is looking at the big picture and future growth, not just a bunch of cheap Atom chip sales. On March 2, 2015, during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, one of the announcements Intel made was to introduce the Intel Atom x3 Processor Series, its first integrated communication platform. Formerly code named SoFIA, the Intel Atom x3 Processor Series is a low-cost SoC with 64-bit Intel Atom processor cores and integrated cellular baseband modem for smart or feature phones, phablets, and tablets. The SoC will be available in 4G LTE and 3G versions. At the heart of IoT systems is a processor unit that processes data and runs software stacks interfaced to a wireless device for connectivity. Advanced IoT sensor nodes consolidate sensor functions and use either an 8-bit MCU or a 32-bit device to run a small RF protocol stack. These features are incorporated in the X3-C3440 processor as shown in the high-level block diagram below." For IoT applications, RFID, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (including Bluetooth Low Energy), XBee, Zigbee, Z-Wave and Wireless M-Bus - and wired links - such as Ethernet, HomePlug, HomePNA, HomeGrid/G.hn and LonWorks - are used for short-range applications, primarily from the gateway to the smart device. According to a report from The Information Network,titled "Convergence of Semiconductors and Smart Technology - A Market Analysis", connectivity will represent 5% of ICs used in smart technology from the sensor node to the gateway. For longer-range and wide-area links, existing mobile networks currently use GSM, GPRS, 3G, LTE or WiMAX and satellite connections, which provide connectivity to the Internet and cloud services. Nodes and gateways must be designed to minimize power consumption, provide reliable and robust network connections and extend wireless connectivity range as far as possible. The big market for Intel and other IC suppliers for smart technology/IoT are MCUs and MPUs. Microcontroller sales in 2014 grew 6% to $15.8 billion - a record high - to be followed by increases of 5% and 9% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Shipments are also expected to post healthy gains, climbing 31% to 25.1 billion units in 2015, but the average selling price dropped 12%. This year, ASPs are expected to drop to about $0.65, but these are predominantly low-end MCUs used, for example, in smart cards and manufactured by Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP ) and Renasas. Smart technology/IoT devices will still contain a mixture of 8-bit and 32-bit MCUs for years to come. The latter is a market where Intel has an opportunity to penetrate against the likes of ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARMH ) MCUs manufactured by STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Atmel (NASDAQ: ATML ), and Freescale (NYSE: FSL ) - which will merge with NXP Semiconductors (NYSE: NXP ) - and Renesas with its Synergy Platform. The growth of smart technology/IoT will propel MCUs into edge devices and gateways, as chip suppliers enhance performance by putting greater integration on the chip, like wireless connectivity. Figure 3 below from Intel sums it up - MCUs will be ubiquitous in all facets of the IoT. Growth in MCUs for smart technology/IoT spreads across a variety of many applications, including cities, transport, health, homes/buildings, and industry. The greatest growth will be exhibited by homes/buildings with a CAGR of 35.8% between 2014 and 2020, according to the report from The Information Network, as shown in Figure 4 below. The Health sector of smart technology/IoT should exhibit strong growth, and many of the devices will be in the form of wearables. I wrote in a previous article in Seeking Alpha in January 2015 that the healthcare industry is one of the biggest opportunities for wearables. According to The Information Network's report, "Wearables: Electronics and Semiconductor Markets," the wearable market will bifurcate into two camps. Those with a wow factor will falter and go the way of the tablet, which we forecast to exhibit flat sales over the next several years. These devices include wearable cameras and sports/activity trackers. However, the other camp of wearables will grow strongly, focusing on the healthcare industry and smartwatches. The healthcare industry is one of the biggest opportunities for wearables, which will be used to provide data management and display systems, enabling doctors to handle the flood of electronic health data and access it when they need it - while examining a patient. Here again Intel has an opportunity with its Curie module, a button-sized computing module for wearable devices. It incorporates a 32-bit Intel Quark SoC, 384KB flash memory and 80KB SDRAM, a low-power integrated DSP sensor hub, Bluetooth LE chip, 6-axis sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope and a battery-charging circuitry. Intel's Quark SoC X1000 application processor is a 32-bit, single-core, single-thread, Intel Pentium processor instruction set architecture (ISA)-compatible, operating at speeds up to 400 MHz. Again, as with the MCUs for smart technology and higher upstream opportunities (higher performance chips in Figure 1), Intel is combining the wearable market with its strategy of interconnectivity. Intel is working hard developing this strategy, such as the acquisition of smartwatch maker Basis Science, and a partnership with Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ) to build more fashionable wearables. So far, it has been disappointing. Intel is thinking outside the box and long term with its IoT and wearable strategies. It is thinking about the future, as technology moves away from a Wintel-dominated legacy business. Investors need to think the same. They also need to put things in perspective. Intel is big and revenues in billions of dollars are thrown around quarterly. But even one billion dollars is huge. Microchip Technology ( MCHP ), for example, only sells MCUs sold $2 billion last fiscal year. Yes its stock is down 5% YTD, but Intel's is down 20%. In a recent article in Seeking Alpha, the author noted that: Investors need not tear down Intel's efforts in the IoT/wearable markets, because revenues won't be more than a few billion dollars.
