Intel-Powered Surface Book From Microsoft Is A Threat To Apple - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The Intel-powered Surface Book is going to give the MacBook Pro some serious competition. Apple selected Intel for its most expensive MacBook Pros. Microsoft also selected Intel chips for its first enterprise-worthy premium laptop. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) shares have recently been on the upswing. I hope that Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) launch of its first-ever enterprise-centric laptop will further fortify investors' faith in INTC. Microsoft is using 6th Generation Intel Skylake Core i5 and Core i7 for its Surface Book laptop/tablet hybrid. The $1,499-2,699 price range of the Surface Book makes it a clear threat to the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBook Pro. The Intel-powered Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 continue to threaten the sales of ARM-based iPads and the MacBook Air. Microsoft now wants to challenge Apple in the lucrative sector that made the MacBook Pro successful. Microsoft's ambition to become more vertically integrated (like Apple with its Mac computers) is a tailwind for Intel's already profitable desktop processor business. Microsoft and the Surface brand exude great quality and enterprise-level reliability. Please take time to watch the YouTube video to appreciate my prediction that the Surface Book will provide stiff competition to the MacBook Pro (and other very expensive laptops). Aside from its superior build quality, the Intel-powered Surface Book is a real innovative product that exposes the outdated design of the MacBook Pro. Unlike the $2k+ MacBook Pro, the cheapest $1,499 Surface Book has a touchscreen display that is also detachable for tablet mode usability. Creative professionals will find this touchscreen/stylus-friendly advantage of the Surface Book the killer excuse to abandon their MacBooks. Just look at the screenshot below - the Surface Book is the ultimate laptop for creative professionals. This Intel-powered, high-priced laptop/tablet can take advantage of the touchscreen optimizations of modern industry-standard software like Photoshop CC and Ableton Live. Enterprise clients are not stupid - they will appreciate the obvious savings in buying just the Surface Book. The MacBook Pro + iPad Pro combination will cost them more money to get the same level of productivity that the Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book already offers. Intel is the ultimate long-term winner over Microsoft's intensified campaign against the iPad and MacBook products of Apple. It supplies the processors for both the MacBook and Surface products. The future scenario is that Apple will have to eventually retool its MacBook lineup to match the pricing strategy of Microsoft. I expect Apple to eventually create Intel-powered iPads to make them relevant against the onslaught of sub-$200 Windows 10/Android tablets. Apple will also eventually have to buy the latest 6th Generation Intel processors inside its MacBook Pro/MacBook Air laptops. Last May's release of the MacBook Pro 2015 revealed it was still using the old Haswell Core i5 and Core i7 processors. I do not think Intel will give discounts on its latest Skylake Core processors like it would on older-generation chips. More investors will rally behind INTC if it focuses more on higher-margin processor sales rather than on discounted mobile Atom processors. The high-end Surface brand of computers is good for Intel. Microsoft's ambitious move with the Surface Book makes it a guaranteed volume buyer of the new Skylake processors. Nadella will probably not stop with laptops. There's the chance that Microsoft's vertical integration will also include a Surface All-in-One desktop computer product that could rival the iMac. Intel's desktop PC processor business will remain even more monopoly-like, especially among corporate buyers, once Microsoft starts acting like a high-margin PC vendor like Apple. Microsoft's continuing snub of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD ) CPU and GPU products only affirms my long-term bullish outlook for Intel. Intel is still cheaper when compared to its technology market peers, in spite of its almost-monopoly on Server/PC processors. The long-term calculated intrinsic value of INTC is still higher than its current price. The DCF-influenced valuation of X-Fin gives Intel a great 9-year future value, even just using an initial revenue growth of 2%.
