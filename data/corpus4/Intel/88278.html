What Could Spike In InvenSense Call Buying Mean? - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha Excessive September call buying implies that something is up with InvenSense. Big tech companies may be in the market for acquisitions in order to stem top line erosion. In early April I ignored excessive put buying in InvenSense, to my chagrin. InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) experienced unusual trading volume in its September call options, strike price $18; 7,264 contracts were traded. The underlying stock was up nearly 4% as 4 million shares changed hands, nearly three times the normal trading volume. According to optionMONSTER's Pete Najarian, the call volume during a down day for the general market was perplexing : Pete Najarian noted there has been heavy buying of September calls sporting an $18 strike price; over 7K contracts have been traded today. "Makes you scratch your head and wonder why," says Najarian, who is going long via shorter-term calls. INVN is down about 27% over the past 12 months, versus a 10% gain for the S&P 500 (SPX). The company has been dogged by declining gross margins ; the thesis that the company has sacrificed margins to court Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has created an overhang in the shares. I have recommended that investors avoid INVN given its declining margins and the potential loss of a large customer . For its most recent quarter Apple and Samsung represented a combined 61% of total revenue. That said, I too believe the excessive call volume is more than a coincidence. I took a small long position in some of the company's short-dated options; an event could be in the cards for the following reasons: InvenSense has been the subject of takeover rumors involving names like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The company's accelerometers, gyroscopes and microphones could be excellent additions to the product lines of these names. Coincidentally, Intel and Qualcomm are also experiencing stagnant to declining revenue growth. Intel's Client Computing segment , which houses its mobile operations, experienced an 8% Y/Y decline in revenue during its most recent quarter. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's revenue fell 3% sequentially due to a loss of Samsung business and a decline in its average sales price . Therefore, Intel, Qualcomm and other technology companies may be forced to be acquisitive simply to stem top-line erosion. Intel's recent acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) was a defensive move, in my opinion. INVN longs may be next to benefit when a big tech company wants get defensive. In early April I received the following cryptic message concerning INVN: Shock Exchange, would you have any insight into whether or not there is competition with INVN for accelerometers or OIS in the Galaxy S6? Evidently a lot of INVN puts were bought today, and a staggering amount over the past two days. I had been aware of reports of excessive put buying after a Chipworks teardown of the Samsung Galaxy S6 showed a touch screen controller from STMicroelectonics (NYSE: STM ); the short thesis was that InvenSense would have less share inside the S6 vis-a-vis the S5. I did not act on the news because I thought the downside had already been price into the stock. I have since gone back and forth with INVN longs whether STMicroelectronics had indeed taken share from INVN inside the S6. The stock has traded sideways ever since early April, buttressing the short case. Secondly, given that InvenSense is inside Apple and Samsung phones - the two global market share leaders - I expected forward revenue growth to offset declining margins. However, management guided that fiscal Q1 2016 revenue would be $100 - $105 million; this is practically flat compared to fiscal Q4 revenue of $99 million. I took this as further evidence that the company was losing share inside the Galaxy S6 to STMicroelectronics. In early April I ignored excessive put buying in INVN, to my chagrin. Monday I piggy-backed on excessive call buying. Something could be up. Source: What Could Spike In InvenSense Call Buying Mean? Disclosure: The author is long INVN.
