Intel Investor Meeting Part 3: Stalling Growth Engines - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha At the Investor Meeting Intel pointed to 3 key growth engines: data center, Internet of Things, and non-volatile memory. However, I expect growth in the data center and IoT areas to slow due to increased competition. In its Investor Meeting presentations, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) pointed to the Data Center Group (DCG) and Internet of Things Group (ITG) as engines of growth for the company. For DCG especially, Intel has high expectations for 2016 of revenue growth in the mid-teens and operating income growth in low double digits. However, both groups are about to run afoul of formidable competitors in 2016. DCG will encounter new more powerful and efficient Power Architecture servers from IBM (NYSE: IBM ). Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), with its mature and cost effective communications processors will stymie Intel's IoT ambitions. Year to date performance of DCG has been strong with revenue up 13% y/y and operating income up 11% y/y. CFO Stacy Smith presented Intel's projections for DCG of revenue growth in the mid-teens and operating income growth in the low double digits. Clearly, Intel sees no disruption of what is becoming an important profit center for the company. In Q3, DCG was second only to the Client Computing Group (NYSE: CCG ) in revenue at $4.140 billion (vs. $8.09 billion for CCG), and it was almost the equal of CCG in operating income at $2.127 billion. On Investor Day, DCG was the star of the show, being featured as the primary growth engine for Intel. With the exception of IBM's high end Z and Power servers, Intel has the server market to itself, and DCG growth is effectively market limited. Fortunately for Intel, growth of Cloud Services has dramatically increased even as the traditional enterprise server business has leveled off. The Investor Day presentation of Diane Bryant, head of the Data Center Group, highlighted the changing growth by end-user segment: Although cloud computing is growing at a 20% CAGR, it's not yet driving DCG growth at the same rate, since other segments are growing more slowly, and cloud is not yet at the point where it dominates DCG revenue. Given Intel's dominance of the server processor market, it was to be expected that Intel would make a status quo projection for growth in 2016. Is there something that could disrupt Intel DCG growth? I think there is, but it's not the usual suspect. It's not ARM. As I pointed out in my article on Qualcomm's ARM server , Intel continues to enjoy tremendous scale advantages compared to would be ARM server suppliers. Intel can leverage the R&D investments in the Client Computing Group by reusing CPU designs for its Xeon server processors. The client business also provides Intel with tremendous production scale. Intel's 14 nm process, regarded as the most advanced in the world, was developed in large part with the support of the ongoing client business. Most importantly, Intel enjoys market scale in that virtually all server software stacks are optimized to run on Intel. This creates tremendous inertia in favor of continuing to use Intel in the data center. In another article , I pointed out that a more potent threat will come from IBM in the form of its Power Architecture (descended from PowerPC) servers. Diane Bryant acknowledged during her presentation that IBM was trying to "move down market" with its OpenPower initiative. IBM created the OpenPower Foundation in order to encourage third parties to create Power Architecture processors, servers, and software. Anandtech recently reviewed a Power8 server system and found it deficient both in terms of its Linux operating system and in power consumption. I believe that IBM and the OpenPower Foundation will continue to mature the software stack. The Power8 processor is fabricated on a 20 nm non-FinFET process and would benefit from being moved to the Samsung/Global Foundries 14 nm FinFET process. These developments can be expected some time in 2016. The time phasing for when more competitive Power Architecture systems hit the market is open to question, but I believe that when they do, they will have a disruptive effect on Intel's DCG business. Probably the first noticeable effect will be a decline in operating income as Intel cuts prices in order to preserve market share. Although I believe that Qualcomm has little hope for its ARM server, it stands a much better chance of competing with Intel in the Internet of Things. Qualcomm has pointed to IoT as a growth area to be pursued, and in my view, it is much better positioned than Intel. Intel doesn't have the lock on IoT that it has on the data center. According to ARM's 2015 Q3 earnings presentation , ARM processors have more than 50% of the market for "Embedded Connectivity". Basically, this is an ARM embedded controller (low cost, low power) combined with on chip modems for WiFi and cellular communications. Qualcomm certainly has the communications part covered. While Intel is still working on developing its next gen standalone LTE modem, Qualcomm already offers a higher performing (X12 series) modem combined with the Snapdragon 820 system on chip (SOC). Qualcomm is one of the few ARM processor developers to successfully merge WiFi and cellular modems into its ARM SOCs. Qualcomm can mix and match modems and processors to meet the needs of particular markets and customers. In general, by virtue of ARM's low cost and low power architecture, it's a much better match for IoT than Intel Architecture. Both companies want this very badly, so I expect the fight to be protracted and bloody. For 2016 I expect ITG revenue growth to slow and operating income to decline again, as it is projected to do for 2015. I expect that Qualcomm will emerge victorious in the end, but not unscathed. My basic problem with Intel is its lack of adaptability (besides its lack of candor). Repeatedly we see Intel trying to make its markets and customers adapt to the needs of the company, rather than the other way around. Intel's mobile device strategy is more or less in ruins because of it. Yes, Intel makes tablet and phone processors, but nothing that's competitive with the best ARM devices. And it's not selling very many of them. Intel's lack of adaptability can be seen in the way it has coped with the paradigm shift away from commodity processors to the custom SOCs used by the industry leaders Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), and Huawei. Being on the wrong side of the paradigm shift is still Intel's biggest problem, and it's only going to get worse. Intel's reflexive response was to try to reassert the commodity model. That's what contra revenue was all about. Contra revenue failed because the industry leaders had grown too large and powerful, and because the new paradigm works so well. Partly in response, Intel has fallen back on the Wintel partnership, but this amounts to returning to its comfort zone in Windows PCs. And there's probably no growth to be had there. In servers, Intel has unquestioned dominance, but it's unlikely to last. IBM's OpenPower initiative is aimed squarely at commodity Intel servers. The other "engine of growth" in non-volatile memory is unlikely to generate sufficient revenue growth to compensate for decreased growth in DCG and further declines in CCG. And for 2016, that's basically what's in store for Intel. Intel projected overall revenue growth in mid-single digits, but this appears to assume continued growth of DCG in the projected mid-teens. I consider it likely that Intel's revenue will stagnate next year through a combination of slower than expected DCG growth and continued declines in CCG. I consider Intel a Sell.
