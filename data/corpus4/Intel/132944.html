XPoint From Micron And Intel: A Strategic Coup - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The new NVM product promises to be a revolutionary technology with far-reaching implications for the memory industry. Many questions remain regarding the financial impact of the technology. The announcement yesterday that the IMFT partners Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) would hold a joint press conference was hardly the stuff that might be celebrated as a public relations master stroke in some future Harvard Business School case study. More the opposite would be the case. With notice consisting of roughly 24 hours the link to the site promised an "update on the latest storage and memory technologies" for the press and analyst community. Be still my beating heart! Nevertheless, speculation among us folks that follow the two companies was running rampant at the news because we had been hearing rumors that the IM partners had a breakthrough NVM (non-volatile memory) product to announce. Indeed, Micron's memory roadmap from last year's Summer Analyst Conference had promised a "New Memory A Gen 1" would be in production in late 2015 so we were forewarned that it was on the table. Scott DeBoer (VP R&D) had even set expectations for us by promising that it would position in between DRAM and NAND in terms of speed, longevity and cost, and furthermore that it would it would be NVM. Could this be it? Turns out it was. So, no surprises, right? Wrong. This announcement, while missing many key details, still qualified as a magnitude 8.5 seismic shake of the terrain that has got to have every stakeholder in the memory and storage ecosystem reevaluating threats and opportunities in a dramatically altered memory technology landscape. This is big. Welcome to the new world, this is truly a game-changer. So what is "this?" As DeBoer stated last year, the technology just announced is a NVM chip. It is positioned as being roughly 1000x faster and more durable than NAND while being 10x DRAM's density. As the name implies, it is a 3D chip that in its initial product configuration is 2 layers yielding 128 Gb. That, however, was not the big news. What was unexpected is that the memory (per its name) is a cross-point memory that features novel materials technology that enables a unique switching mechanism caused by transforming the substance of the material itself to signal ones and zeros. (So much for the new improved PCM speculation that was the conventional wisdom before the presentation.) What's the big deal about that, you may ask? Just this - it's promised to be scalable both vertically (more layers) and horizontally (smaller chip dimensions). When this is accomplished, the chip will be still more dense, less costly and significantly faster, thereby opening up yet another tier of use cases that should lead to ever greater TAM (total addressable market) over time. In effect the IM partners are intimating that this new technology will eat greater and greater portions of the total memory market as time goes on. How fast will this happen? Rob Crooke (SVP-GM, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group) positioned the scalability challenges as akin to current memory node shrinks. If true, that would position new product cadence as somewhere in the once a year to once every two years pace. So what does this puppy cost? Again, no specifics - somewhere in between DRAM and NAND. Assuming it is roughly in the middle that would imply somewhere between $1.50 and $2.00/GB. Given the promised performance of the chip customers should be eager to pay that price to gain the application and use case performance improvement that will be obtainable from the product. Simply put, this memory will allow a whole new class of applications to become truly practicable that were only a dream before. The post below represents the typical headset of application designers when they sized up the very real benefits of in memory designs vs. the hard facts of the configuration limitations up to now. "Although we're leery of hopping on the 100 percent DRAM in-memory bandwagon, (the technology) when smartly deployed(...) could truly transform applications. When you eliminate the latency, you can embed complex analytics in-line with transactional applications, enable the running of more complex analytics, or make it feasible for users to run more what-if simulations to couch their decisions. Examples include transaction applications that differentiate how to fulfill orders from gold, silver, or bronze-level customers based on levels of services and cost of fulfillment. It could help mitigate risk when making operational or fiduciary decisions by allowing the running of more permutations of scenarios. It could also enhance Big Data analytics by tiering the more frequently used data (and logic) in memory. Whether to use DRAM or Flash will be a function of data volume and problem complexity. No longer will inclusion of storage tiers be simply a hardware platform design decision - it will become a configuration decision for application designers as well." - Tony Baer's OnStrategies blog. Boiled down, its message is, "we'd love to use all DRAM or at the very least DRAM and flash but we can't so storage tiering is a fact of life and is something all app designers have to get very serious about." With this announcement that headset is essentially obsolete. Things have gotten so much easier. Now a modicum of DRAM and however much NVM the application needs is the right answer. The new world has arrived and the sky is the limit. So what use cases are we looking at that will offer compelling value propositions for the new memory? Broadly stated, "big-data" applications that feature the like of HANA, Oracle DB 12c, IBM dashDB, Microsoft SQL Server "Hekaton", etc., will devour as much of the new memory as can be supplied. Another application area that will see its memory use explode is security-related applications like financial fraud detection, virus tracking and internet hacking. Face and voice recognition and genomic research also will get a big boost. Gaming is another. And these are just the tip of the iceberg as the IT community wraps its head around the possibilities that this new memory engenders. We could go on and on but let's agree that this is an exciting announcement that promises a potentially big payoff for both companies. The question is how big and how soon? First deliveries are not promised until "2016" - that's all the color we have on that for now. Bottom line, this is at best an intermediate term opportunity that might have a significant impact on Micron's fiscal Q3 and Intel's Q2 of 2016 - at the soonest. 2015 numbers will not be affected. The net of all this is that from a stock standpoint this is simply a momentum builder for 2015 that offers some feel good buzz for the companies because of its potential. With Micron's Summer Analyst Conference coming up in August along with the Flash Memory Summit and Intel's Developer's Forum we're almost sure to hear more about this new development. From a financial perspective, however, we'll almost surely have to wait until Micron and Intel's earnings concalls in January of next year before we will have some perspective on how much 3D XPoint will move the needle next year. What are the risks that all this speculation will turn out to be all we get? Is there a chance that this announcement is all sizzle and no steak? I seriously doubt that but we just don't know yet. There are so many questions we need to have answered before we can even begin to assess the financial impact of the announcement. Here's just a short list: Can the partners ramp up production rapidly in their jointly owned fab in Lehi, UT? What are the costs of the new chip? (If it's too close to DRAM that will severely limit the TAM.) What is the performance in the real world when reviewers and customers get their hands on it? What are the actual end products that are made with the chips? (Intel and Micron are working their own differing agendas with their products.) Will Intel get greater positive impact from the new product sooner because of their dominant position in the enterprise? Will the relative paucity of NVMe deployments put breaks on the dissemination of this memory? (It's too fast for SATA or SAS.) Once Lehi is fully converted to XPoint what's the next step in terms of a Fab home for the technology? Will the 3D NAND product be impacted? It's early for sure - there are problems and questions and concerns but don't forget that these are good problems to have. This should be fun to watch and very profitable in the 2016 and 2017 timeframe. Stay tuned. Source: XPoint From Micron And Intel: A Strategic Coup Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, MU.
