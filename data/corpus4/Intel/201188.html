Is Intel No Longer A PC Company? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel beat third-quarter EPS estimates, but the stock fell 3% at the open anyway. This could be because INTC continues to struggle in PCs, historically its main business. But that could be changing. The company's fastest-growing and most profitable operating segment is now data centers. For this reason, investors may want to change how they think of Intel and view INTC as predominantly a data center company. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) beat earnings expectations when the company released its Q3 report , but the stock was down more than 3% at the open on Wednesday. Investors don't appear too impressed with Intel's results, probably because the company still posted declines in revenue and earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. For most of its history, Intel's chips catered primarily to the PC industry. But global PC shipments are now declining by double-digit rates, and repeatedly poor performance in its core PC business continues to drag Intel down. Fortunately, INTC does have a high-growth business - data centers - that has the potential to be its most important business going forward. For this reason, it may be appropriate to no longer view Intel as a PC company. Investors have been hoping to see any sort of recovery in underlying PC demand, but operating conditions in the PC industry have continued to deteriorate throughout 2015. After a very weak start to the year, analysts widely attributed the declines in PC shipments over the first half of the year to the pending release of Windows 10. It was widely thought that PC sales would recover in the third quarter. Consumers and businesses who had postponed buying new PCs were supposedly going to boost PC shipments once the new Windows product hit store shelves. Unfortunately, poor PC sales continued in the third quarter. According to technology market research firm IDC, PC shipments fell 10.8% last quarter year over year. That figure widely missed analyst expectations, which called for a more modest 9.2% decline. Such an alarming deterioration in the PC this year is a real problem for Intel, which still derives about 58% of its revenue from its Client Computing Group, which is predominantly PCs. Of course, Intel's newly restructured reporting schedule has combined the PC business with the mobile business, although success in mobile continues to elude the company. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich had little to say about mobile on the conference call , except that the company remains on track to improve mobile profitability by $800 million this year. That sounds great, until investors recall Intel's mobile business lost a whopping $4.2 billion last year, so improving that by $800 million is hardly a cause for celebration. While the PC business continues to stagnate and the mobile business posting big losses, Intel desperately needs a catalyst. Thankfully for investors, INTC has a fantastic catalyst for growth on its hands in the form of its data centers business, which continues to impress both in terms of growth and profitability. Intel grew revenue in data centers by 12% last quarter year over year. Revenue in data centers hit a record $4.1 billion. This performance even beat the Internet of Things, which posted a solid 10% year-over-year revenue growth rate. Not only is the data centers business Intel's fastest-growing on a year-over-year basis, but it's also the company's most profitable by far. Operating profit grew 9% in data centers last quarter year over year. Meanwhile, operating profit in the Client Computing Group fell by 20% year over year. Intel realized a 51% operating profit margin in data centers compared to 28% for client computing and 26% in the Internet of Things. Margins are outstanding in data centers, and considering the huge problems Intel has had reversing massive losses in mobile, there is something to be said for profitability right now. Going forward, Intel could very well reap additional profits in data centers as a result of the $16 billion acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). Bringing in Altera presents an opportunity for Intel to expand its presence in field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, particularly in data centers. The transaction remains on track to close in the original six-to-nine month window provided by Intel management. Separately, the cloud is a forward catalyst for data centers. While Intel management expects a moderate slowdown in data center demand at the enterprise level, continued strength in the cloud fuels management's expectation for low-double-digit growth in data center revenue for the full year. It's difficult to come up with a buy thesis for Intel right now. The stock is cheap, at 13 times earnings, but it's cheap for a reason. Its flagship PC business is eroding, due to the continued structural shift in how people compute. The shift from desktops and laptops toward mobile devices like smartphones does not appear to be reversing anytime soon. And, Intel is still flailing in its efforts to meaningfully penetrate the mobile arena. That leaves Intel and its investors wanting for a catalyst. Fortunately, the Internet of Things, and more importantly, data centers could be just what investors are looking for. Intel's data center business is its highest-growing operating segment, and it also carries huge margins. For this reason, investors should keep more of their focus on what happens to data centers going forward and view any surprise recover in PC shipments as a nice bonus.
