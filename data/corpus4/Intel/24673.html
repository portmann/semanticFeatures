Intel Reportedly Ends Altera Talks, Why Did Altera Reject The Offer? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Uses free cash flow analysis to try and explain why Altera thought the price offered by Intel was too low. Provides complete free cash flow data for both companies. Describes why it's a shame that the deal did not go through as both companies seem to be a perfect fit. Intel reportedly ends Altera talks; shares fall I found this to be very interesting, so I decided to perform a free cash flow analysis on both companies and try to determine why Altera's management has supposedly rejected the offer. In this analysis, I will be using my free flow methodology in analyzing both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) and for those of you unfamiliar with that methodology, you can read my introduction on it by going HERE . The first step in our analysis requires us to analyze the free cash flow and price to free cash flow results for both companies: You can clearly see why Intel made a pure cash offer for Altera as Intel generated $10.22 billion in free cash flow TTM (Twelve Months Trailing). At the $54 price that Intel was offering for each share of Altera, I believe that Intel was offering a fair price (while not overpaying) at around 26 times Altera's price to free cash flow. I would imagine that Altera's board of directors were probably looking for around 30 times free cash flow or about $62 a share as the company did generate almost $1 billion in free cash flow in 2011 and may have wanted to factor that result into the price. The second step in our analysis is to analyze both companies' Owner's Cash Profits ratio, which is Y-Charts' version of Warren Buffett's equation "Owner-Earnings". The owner's cash profit ratios for both companies came in with a slight increase for Intel and slight decrease for Altera versus both companies' free cash flow numbers. But Altera's lower results for this ratio are not significant enough for us to change our opinion as to the $62 per share price that we believe Altera's management would have approved the deal. The free cash flow to equity ratio is a measure of how much cash can be paid to the equity shareholders of the company after all expenses, reinvestment and debt repayment. Since the Seeking Alpha breaking news article specifically mentioned that talks between the companies had been going on for months, Intel must have noticed that Altera's free cash flow to equity results dropped sharply into the red in 2014, as the chart above shows, and actually stayed negative for a while. Only recently did Altera's free cash flow to equity result finally come back from its deficit and thus improved its management's negotiating position. Now that we have the results for both companies on all three ratios that make up our free flow ratio, let us now crunch the numbers using TTM data. At the end of the table you will find each FRROIC result where, FRROIC = Free Flow Return on Invested Capital. FFROIC simply tells us how much free flow is generated for every one dollar of invested capital that each company employs. So as you can see Altera's FFROIC would have complemented Intel's very nicely. It's a shame that the companies decided to call off negotiations as both are high quality, well managed firms with a long history of outperformance and leadership in the industry in which they operate and in my opinion, Altera would have been a perfect fit for Intel.
