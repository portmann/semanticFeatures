Intel: Why I'm Skeptical Of Additional Upside - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Expected 2016 growth is not what it seems. Management has history of being too optimistic. Last time short interest was this low, shares collapsed in following months. We've seen a nice rally in Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) after some positive news at the company's Investor Meeting . Intel provided a decent 2016 forecast and raised its dividend, sending shares back to $35 again. Unfortunately for investors, I believe the stock is fully priced currently, and see a few factors that could limit upside in the coming quarters. Intel guided to mid-single digit revenue growth for next year, and we're starting to see analysts adjust their forecasts. Some have already hiked their numbers, with the current average estimate calling for 4.5% top line growth in 2016. That number is likely to go higher, because at least one current estimate calls for Intel revenues to decline next year, which right now seems unlikely. There are a few items to consider when examining this guidance, however. First, management detailed that this will be a 53-week fiscal year. The extra week, based on average forecasts for 2015, accounts for more than 40% of the expected dollar increase next year. Additionally, we've seen a number of recent years where Intel guided to decent future year revenues, only to cut those forecasts as the year went on. 2012 was a great example of this, and don't forget last year's investor meeting called for mid single digit revenue growth this year. That hasn't worked out, with analysts looking for Intel to report a 1.1% decline in revenues for 2015. The other large part of revenue growth comes from the Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) acquisition, which is a very expensive purchase. Based on current expectations, after subtracting out cash and debt, Intel is paying more than 7.5 times 2016 sales for Altera. Intel itself currently trades for less than 3 times expected 2016 sales, so you can see how much of a premium is being paid. Intel is hoping the Altera purchase will keep the Data Center Group's revenue growth in the mid teens for years to come. Over the last year or two, I've detailed the substantial decline in short interest for Intel. As seen in the chart below, more than 62.5% of shares short have been covered since the October 2013 peak. The mid-November update was the first time since May 2012 that we saw less than 100 million shares short. Source: NASDAQ Intel short interest page The last time we saw short interest this low, Intel shares peaked in the high $20s. The PC market deteroriated as 2012 progressed, short interest skyrocketed, and Intel shares fell nearly $10. With Intel's business being less PC reliant currently than it was a few years ago, I don't see that kind of fall happening right now. However, it is important to note that the number of shares outstanding for Intel is down about 5.5% since Q1 of 2012. With a lower float this time around, a jump of say 50 million shares short will have a larger impact on Intel stock than it did a few years ago. In the last three months, Intel shares are up almost 22%, while major competitor Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is down by 14%. I feel that the recent rally in Intel, including the post-Investor Day meeting jump, have basically priced in next year's progress. I'm just not convinced there is a ton of upside for Intel currently, and neither do analysts if you look at their opinions . The table below shows some key comparisons between the two. The analyst rating scale has a strong buy at 1.0 and a hold at 3.0. Qualcomm has a much higher dividend yield and is buying back a ton of shares right now. Even if I take down Qualcomm's average price target by 10% due to its lack of growth and current troubles, that name still has about 18% upside. At this point, the street sees Intel as fairly valued, and I pretty much agree when expectations are already high and the name has a history of disappointing. Intel shares have rallied since the Investor Meeting, putting the name at a level where I think the stock is very fairly valued. With the company getting most of its growth next year from the Altera purchase and an extra week in the calendar, the growth story is not very impressive. We've seen rosy forecasts from the name in recent years, only to see guidance cut during the year. With short interest at its lowest point in a couple of years, one piece of negative news could send shorts right back in. Qualcomm offers a higher dividend yield and stronger buyback, and analysts see Qualcomm with more potential upside. While I'm not arguing for a short position currently, I think investors looking to buy would be better off waiting until Intel is closer to one of its key moving averages, as seen below.
