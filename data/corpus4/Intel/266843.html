3 Reasons Why IBM Is A Better Investment Than Intel At Least For The Next Two Years - International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) | Seeking Alpha IBM’s stock is depressed compared to Intel’s stock. IBM’s conversion to cloud, analytics and services is almost complete. Both IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) are huge high-tech companies with market values well over $125B. Both companies have been developing new products that they hope will expand their sales and profits and conceivably they could both be successful. So why do I prefer IBM as an investment? It's because I think over the next two years IBM has a much better chance of both improving its profits and expanding its PE ratio enough to achieve at least a 50% gain in price. In Intel's case I think the next two years will not allow it time enough to generate substantial profits from new products due to the longer cycle for new technologies to take requisite market share. As for Intel's legacy products I see considerable competition arising in both desktop and server markets over the next two years. IBM's key financial ratios are subdued, Intel's are higher than historical values. This is a key reason for liking IBM. Based upon historical financial metrics IBM is undervalued at its current price of about $135. Intel on the other hand, at about $35, appears to be overvalued based upon historical averages. Now one could argue that is because Intel has a better defined future, but I think just the opposite. IBM's transition to services, analytics and the cloud are high-growth areas that will allow it to turn around in the next two years albeit after lower sales for 14 straight quarters. Intel does have some promising products in the pipeline such as 3D Xpoint but I question whether they will generate substantial sales and profit growth between now and the end of 2017. 2. IBM's Gross Margins (GM) will be expanding while Intel's will inevitably be lower. IBM has slowly been inching its GM up from 48% to 51% over the last few years. Intel, of course, is famous for its 60%-plus margins. But Intel's high margins come from huge capex and R&D spending compared to IBM's. IBM actually has had more free cash flow over the last four quarters - $14.2B to $12.2B. That makes IBM's price/free cash flow ratio 9.2 vs. Intel's 13.1. Over the next two years as IBM disgorges their hardware legacy charges and ramps up analytics, software and services the GM should continue to rise. Intel on the other hand is facing competition in 95% of their business provided by their semi-monopoly desktops and servers. ARM servers are coming, although slower than I surmised originally but certainly by 2017. Desktops will have some of their first competition in years with AMD's release of their new chip Zen in late 2016. IoT and mobile will continue to be low margin products for Intel because they are low margin products for everyone. For example Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) GM net of the license revenue is 43% (see 10K Page 36). And one of the major suppliers of IoT chips, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ), has a GM of less than 40%. So as mobile and IoT become a greater percentage of sales then Intel's GM will be going down. One possible exception is 3D Xpoint but I do not think it will be a significant percentage of sales in the next two years. And of course McAfee, Intel's woeful $7.7B software acquisition, should be a high margin product but has been plagued with a myriad of problems. In fact on Oct. 25th Intel announced it would no longer sell McAffee email SaaS and instead recommended customers purchase threat detection software Proofpoint. In a similar vein to GE as expressed in this article " 5 Reasons Why General Electric Has Much Bigger IoT Potential Than Intel Does" IBM has more potential for high-margin IoT sales via software, consulting, cloud and data analytics than Intel does. And like GE, but even more, so IBM already has a face-to-face relationship with many large organizations via its mainframes, software and services. Intel has that kind of relationship with only a few large organizations and it's not known for its cloud, consulting, software, analytics or services like IBM is. Therefore Intel's IoT revenue will be mainly hardware related via servers (more data means more servers) and perhaps some low margin chips. Intel's IoT group is increasing sales but at less than half the rate of the IoT market in general. For the first three quarters of 2015 compared to 2014 the IoT Group's sales are up 8% ($1.673B vs. $1.551B) but operating income was actually down 6% ($383M vs. $406M). For more on Intel's IoT potential see this article " Intel: Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future." Both IBM and Intel are cash flow machines and both have opportunities for increasing the value of their stock price. Both have big buybacks in place and both have several new products ramping up in the next two years. Both stocks could easily go up by 50% over the next two years but I think IBM with its depressed price and high-margin new products has the best chance.
