Best And Worst Q4'15: Information Technology ETFs, Mutual Funds And Key Holdings | Seeking Alpha The Information Technology sector ranks second in Q4'15. Based on an aggregation of ratings of 30 ETFs and 110 mutual funds. The Information Technology sector ranks second out of the ten sectors as detailed in our Q4'15 Sector Ratings for ETFs and Mutual Funds report. Last quarter , the Information Technology sector ranked second as well. It gets our Neutral rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of 30 ETFs and 110 mutual funds in the Information Technology sector. See a recap of our Q3'15 Sector Ratings here . Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst-rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector. Not all Information Technology sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 23 to 397). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings. Investors seeking exposure to the Information Technology sector should buy one of the Attractive-or-better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2. * Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity. Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity. The Fidelity Advisor Communications Equipment Fund (MUTF: FDMIX ) is excluded from Figure 2 because its total net assets are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums. The State Street SPDR Technology Select Sector Fund ETF (NYSEARCA: XLK ) is the top-rated Information Technology ETF and the Fidelity Select Computers Portfolio (MUTF: FDCPX ) is the top-rated Information Technology mutual fund. Both earn a Very Attractive rating. The First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA: FDN ) is the worst-rated Information Technology ETF and the Rydex Series Internet Fund (MUTF: RYINX ) is the worst-rated Information Technology mutual fund. Both earn a Very Dangerous rating. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) has long been one of our favorite stocks held by Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds. Intel earns a Very Attractive rating and is held by many of the top Information Technology ETFs including XLK and TDIV. Over the past decade, Intel has grown ( NOPAT ) by 6% compounded annually. The company earns a top quintile return on invested capital ( ROIC ) of 18% and has generated over $4.6 billion of free cash flow on a trailing-twelve-month (TTM) basis. The market has ignored the strength of Intel's business and shares are down 11% year-to-date. At its current price of $34/share, INTC has a price to economic book value ( PEBV ) ratio of 1.0. This ratio implies the market expects Intel's to never meaningfully grow NOPAT over its remaining corporate life. If Intel can grow NOPAT by just 5% compounded annually over the next decade , the stock is worth $45/share today - a 32% upside. Proofpoint (NASDAQ: PFPT ) is one of our least favorite stocks held by Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds and earns a Dangerous rating. Since 2012, Proofpoint's NOPAT has declined from -$19 million to -$61 million on a TTM basis. The company currently earns a bottom quintile -19% ROIC. However, rapid revenue growth has lifted shares of PFPT to levels that are unjustifiable by the business operations. To justify its current price of $68/share, Proofpoint must immediately achieve pre-tax margins of 6% (quite a jump from -25% in 2014) and grow revenue by 30% compounded annually for the next 17 years. I doubt many investors would be willing to bet that any company could achieve and sustain a turnaround in profits as grand as that implied by PFPT's current market price.
