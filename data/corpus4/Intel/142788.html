Micron: Fear, Uncertainty And Doubt - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha There appears to be a FUD campaign wagered against Micron. This will make a possible tender offer feel more appealing. Apple's iPad Pro is a likely flagship for the first 3D XPoint product. FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products. I learned of FUD nearly 20 years ago but I didn't realize the scope of its use until my 2012 article on Zillow . While I was very positive on Zillow (NASDAQ: Z ), the entire world suddenly turned negative on it. Analysts and the media painted a picture of fear, uncertainty and doubt. The impact on its share price was heartbreaking: I had made an extremely bullish call on Zillow at its high of $47. As a good chunk of the analysts and media turned bearish over the next couple of months, the stock plummeted after they " barely " beat their quarter. The stock was eventually cut in half from where I called it. I really felt like an idiot. But then the ownership list changed dramatically and the skies suddenly turned blue: analysts and the media all started to paint a rosy picture. And then stock marched to as high as $160. The news certainly isn't universally negative (rather than participate, some outlets just simply ignored it altogether ). But there's enough of it to lend some credence that the stock is currently priced appropriately. The folks at Barron's, for example, already have insider information as to the tremendous upside in Micron. But, now they're bearish all of a sudden. Funny how that happens. If Micron were IPO'ed today with just XPoint , HMC and Automata , it would command a much higher market cap than where it is now. I refuse to believe that the recent negativity is the result of ignorance - I think that there's something more going on here. If the latter is true, then Micron shareholders should know that they are likely better off turning down all offers until at least 2017 because it is quite apparent that few people can fathom the impact of XPoint. Allow me to go ahead and recap this impact: XPoint production rights are owned by IMFT . Micron has the right to buy out Intel's 49 percent IMFT share beginning in 2018. XPoint will displace most DRAM needs , some NAND in the short-term. While XPoint will be cheaper than DRAM, bit sales will increase disproportionally (e.g. - the average PC currently ships with between 4 and 8 Gbytes of RAM but the smallest XPoint chip is 16 Gbytes so people won't have a choice). Premium products will migrate to homogeneous cached XPoint, displacing NAND. Intel and Micron don't need to create demand: the product itself does this by increasing performance and power efficiency by several orders of magnitude. "Rewriting" the operating system is not required to take advantage of XPoint as the benefits can be implemented transparently at a hardware level. You can put this in yesterday's systems and capture most of the benefits immediately. Only small changes are required for full benefit. Micron owns the transistor-less Ovonic Threshold Switch IP which is a substantial advantage vs. the competition. Micron will become the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) of phase change memory, already having royalty-bearing agreements in place with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) through their Ovonyx subsidiary. The ability to instantaneously switch operating systems (Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) patent) is another benefit of having nonvolatile system memory. When I initially predicted XPoint back in June, I described this whole ordeal as a Paul Otellini work. And Paul Otellini was very fond of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and had played a major role in their conversion to Intel on the Mac line. Currently, Apple's tablet business is getting crushed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). That's because iOS is a toy compared to a real operating system like Windows or OSX. As a former Microsoft-hater, I didn't believe this until I took a stroll through the library at the local university - most of the students were using Surface product. Apple is holding the iPad Pro very closely . It would not surprise me that this is a result of its groundbreaking nature. If it includes XPoint and an Intel processor, then it will have the trivial capability to switch between iOS, OSX and Windows instantaneously. And Apple's customer base seemingly prefers paying substantial premiums. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
