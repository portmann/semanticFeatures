Apple says it plans to continue tapping U.S. and foreign debt markets to help fund capital returns. I think Apple just prove that China is really being hit harder than we thought. So much for Tim Cook's comments that China sales remained strong. China gov is shutting down Apple services and they want iphone source code but Apple is refusing. It's not easy to gain traction when you have the gov against you in a country like China Yes, the Chinese gov't is but Apple recently endorsed DJI, a Chinese startup that has taken a real leadership position in an emerging technology. I figured that such a move by someone who holds as much klout as Apple does may put the company in a better light in the eyes of the Chinese gov't. dont u feel like some people around here are like 4/5 years old kids at school to which you need to say A B C D E F .... and again A B C D E F.... Look at China -26%..  And those that said the China slowdown was overblown..  Wow!!  International sales make up 67% of revenue...  Their only growth vehicle is the services division which is great..  +20%..  No time to increase buyback.. Or it's the seasonal selling of iPhones. It's not the holidays. And they haven't upgraded the phone in a great way in 2 years iTunes is a dead business. App store relies on new sales of hardware plus recurring subs on apps that can easily migrate to Android. Apple care relies on new hardware sales. Apple Pay will never make any real money. Apple Music is the only one worth something and it faces a lot of competition. I wouldn't pay 10x for that services business. Keep in mind iPhone se came out towards the very end of the quarter, thus not reflecting the full iPhone sales picture. It's a very strong buy at 96. And you know that next earnings result is gonna be epic with the full iPhone se sales picture. Picked up a ton at 96 now. except the SE impacted in the very weak guidance so either sales of SE are terrible or they have cannibalised 6S sales. sorry but your nuts and you're going to loose a ton of money. Ask yourself this simple question--- 'what product (or major upgrade) will Apple release in the next year that will really move the needle?' . Keep in mind that MacRummours , Apple insider and all the rest are crawling over ever leak and that would be nothing-- The only slightly interesting thing was the home key going and being replaced by force touch and that was with the Iphone 8 coming out in 2017 and not having an iPhone 7. If you cant imagine or see on the grape vine a product moving the needle in the coming year you really shouldn't be sleeping well at night with all your money tied in Apple. Apple committed to return $75B more from now till 18'. Buying today at $425B you are getting 18% returned to you in 2 yrs at 11x... But I thought there weren't any SE customers because no one is buying it.  Can't have it both ways, partner. Oh--on CNBC, they just said it is dead. Melissa "Barrack Obama is the man" Lee looked ight into the camera and said it's dead. Where are all the Apple bulls tonight with their China won't affect Apple? now it is clear why I am seeing discount offers all.over the place on 6S. They can't sell them.... @Zed.... Still here. Apple wasn't the only tech with a slow quarter. GOOG, MSFT just to name a few. can't expect the best company to produce good numbers during a world slowdown. LOL. Why is this even a surprise. This is what happens when those "value investors" only focus on profitability with no attention paid to growth. One of the worst stock market fails ever and the small odd lot shareholders are once again left speechless and financially whacked. Apple guided for a bad quarter and they delivered one. The other major factor hurting margins was no new macs released. Been waiting for a new mac book pro and a Mac Pro for nearly a year. Those will likely come at wwdc in June if Intel has compelling chips to offer. All eyes will be on iphone7. If it indeed has a significantly better camera that will be my reason to upgrade. 603- do you think anyone, and I mean anyone, is affected by your ridiculous hyperbole? It's a slight miss. And they still made BILLIONS of dollars. Looked like another bullseye on their own guidance to me.  Maybe the analysts should be punished for getting it wrong yet again? I don't think people can count on the SE.  They didn't have the SE before.  Also in China with or without their slowing down, there are more options on phones.  Just look at huawei and Xiaomi, plus Samsung I really don't know where Tims confidence is coming from.  The Margin of iPhones being better than others are getting thinner and thinner, and it often does not justify the higher prices.
