Apple And TSMC: Strengthening Partnership For iPhone And Beyond - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha TSMC is ramping production of 16 nm FinFET processors for mobile devices, probably including the next iPhone. Apple will probably commit to full production by TSMC of its next generation A series processors by year's end. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) growing iPhone empire presents potential opportunities for investments in supplier companies. Investors should be cautious, however, as winning a place on the next iDevice is not a guarantee of huge profits. Among Apple's many suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM ) may be positioned to profit the most from the next iPhone, and beyond. As we approach the launch of the next iPhone (probably on September 9), we're seeing the usual process of rumors converging to a fairly close approximation of the truth. Leaks become more common as suppliers start production. Once production starts, many more people are privy to details of the next iPhone. Pictures of component parts and other production and design details begin to proliferate. Most of the details have been known for weeks: The 6S will feature an external design almost identical to the current iPhone 6, but will be strengthened to minimize bending. The display will be unchanged. The biggest physical changes are expected to be the addition of Force Touch and a new Apple system on chip (SOC) dubbed the A9. Opinions differ regarding the market advantage offered by Force Touch. Apple's Taptic Engine is a device similar to the vibrators found in smartphones except that it can deliver a distinct impulse through the screen that feels something like a button click. Combined with precise applied force measurement, Force Touch provides an element of tactile feedback that will be exclusive to iPhone. I believe that Force Touch will provide a positive discriminator, but perhaps is still lacking the killer app to make it essential. This may come in time as developers find novel ways to incorporate Force Touch into their apps. The A9 SOC is expected to be the first Apple SOC fabricated on an 14 nm scale FinFET process. Apple will only be the second smartphone company to feature this technology, after Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). The benefits of 14 nm are faster processors with lower power consumption. Some leaked results seem to confirm the expected performance improvement for the A9. What hasn't been clear is how production would be split for the new A9. Based on TSMC's Q1 guidance regarding their 16 nm FinFET production ramp, it didn't appear that TSMC would be able to support production of the initial batch of new iPhones that will go on sale in September. As of the Q2 earnings report in mid-July, TSMC has started the production ramp on 16 nm, but this is not in time to support the September iPhone launch. TSMC would have needed to be already in full production for that. Therefore, Samsung will get exclusive presence on the next iPhone when it debuts. iPhone teardowns start almost as soon as the new iPhone is released, so I expect those teardowns to show a Samsung fabricated A9. Samsung's win of the A9 production may be short lived, however. Apple is clearly motivated to reduce its dependence on Samsung. The on-going IP disputes with Samsung, as well as Samsung's early use of its 14 nm process to gain advantage for the Galaxy S6 mandate that Apple sever its ties with Samsung once and for all. How quickly Apple can transition to exclusive TSMC supply is unknown, but TSMC's guidance for Q3 provides an important clue. TSMC guided essentially flat on a year over year basis for Q3 revenue. That's actually remarkable given a number of factors. Last year, TSMC had exclusive production of the previous generation A8 and probably the A8X as well . If TSMC had lost that business to Samsung for 2H, I would expect them to be hurting a lot more in Q3. Especially because of declining sales for Qualcomm, and the concentration of upper tier smartphone sales in Samsung and Apple. TSMC's guidance indicates that they anticipate winning a lot of the A9 business. This will probably be paced only by TSMC's ability to ramp production. By next year, I expect Apple to be fully committed to TSMC for mobile SOC production, assuming TSMC's production ramp supports Apple's needs. TSMC was very bullish for 2016 FinFET production at the Q2 earnings conference, so I expect that TSMC will be able to ramp production sufficiently to meet the needs of Apple and other likely customers, such as AMD. By not competing with Apple, TSMC has cemented its position as a trusted supplier going forward. This makes TSMC one of the most attractive of Apple suppliers as an investment. TSMC is highly profitable, having a gross margin of 48.5% and operating margin of 37.5% in Q2. Y/y growth in revenue was 12% and EPS was 33% in Q2. In Q2, total revenue was $6.7 billion and operating income was $2.5 billion. Unlike so many commodity semiconductor makers these days, TSMC is not struggling to make a profit. One of the most interesting questions asked by any analyst at the TSMC Q2 earnings conference was asked by Dan Heyler of Bank of America Merill Lynch. He asked, . . . as you look at processors coming out today, 8-core, 10-core processors moving to 16 nanometer, Cortex 72 looks pretty much like a PC-level processor, I'm wondering what kind of computational opportunities are there for you to grow next year or as you look into the broader markets, with performance levels being as high as they are, we're now moving kind of out the smartphone era, much more into a compute capability, is that a growth opportunity? This echoes a long standing theme of mine that the trend of increasing capability of ARM processors would eventually make them suitable for applications beyond mobile, including general PC use and servers. We're already seeing some movement into the server space, but use in general purpose PCs has been limited to a few low end Chromebooks. This, of course, brings the ARM ecosystem into direct conflict with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), which Intel supporters tend to dismiss. But the fact that ARM foundries such as TSMC and Samsung are starting to close the process gap with Intel, combined with the increasing capability of ARM processor designs makes this conflict all but inevitable. My first question is on the computing opportunities. I think now TSMC seems to be narrowing the gap in the process technology and when should we see that the TSMC is ready to enter the notebook market? And also what is preventing TSMC to ARM server or even TSMC to enter the notebook market in large volume? Is that software or more of hardware? While TSMC management kind of ducked Heyler's question, Lu managed to get a more direct answer from Morris Chang, TSMC's Chairman: I think we are obviously very actively pursuing that market. . . Now of course we need a very capable partner as well as ARM. ARM we already have. ARM is a valuable -- has been a valuable partner for us for many years now. But in addition to ARM, we also will need a capable design company. And then the partners together, the three main ones, TSMC, ARM, the design company and many others that we have always had, the equipment people, etc., we think that we have a chance of becoming an important factor in that market. Hmm. Who could that very capable design partner be? Apple certainly fits the bill, doesn't it? Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
