Intel Becomes A Data Center Centric Semiconductor Company - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Data Center Group takes operating profit leadership. Client and Mobile to diminish in importance. The highlight of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q1 2015 earnings call along with the recent rumors of possible acquisitions of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: BCOM ) is the recognition by Wall St. that the company has made the long-term turn toward being a high growth, Data Center Centric company as mobile recedes in the background. CEO Brian Krzanich, just two years into his tenure, has made the most of his manufacturing background to prioritize Intel's investments around a business unit that revenue wise should exceed the client group within five years and possibly set up barriers that no ARM-based server competitor will be able to break into given the complexities of the whole server system design. Before Paul Otellini retired from Intel, he highlighted the double-digit growth that servers were experiencing due to the rise of data required to service the explosion of smart phones and tablets. Furthermore, he recognized that Intel made more profits with each additional server than they would capture in silicon in the mobile space. It went unappreciated by analysts and investors. Thus the investment in mobile had to continue until the company saved face by losing over $4B in 2014 in order to show the world Intel was serious. As mentioned in previous columns, the real solution to mobile for Intel was 14nm Broadwell that allowed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and others to design much lighter weight, fully functional PCs with over 10 hours of battery life at a reasonable price. Tablets have since withered at the hands of Intel's assault. While ASPs are down, mobile volume is up and margins in the Client Group remain strong based on the Broadwell die shrink and the elimination of AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and NVidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as a threat. Apple's new MacBook remains Intel, contrary to many ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) skeptics who imagined for years that a conversion was in the cards. Apple recognizes that corporates and professionals expect the Mac O/S with horsepower and will not risk brand destruction on the switch out of Intel for ARM. This means Intel's lock on the profitable PC market is ensured even if demand remains staid. Keep an eye on the 600MU of PCs that are over 4 years old. The attractiveness of sub-3-pound ultralight notebooks will drive growth. On the call Krzanich confirmed a strategy that I have outlined previously, which is that customers prefer to create a wide range of mobile PCs and tablets from one platform. More specifically, they are using Broadwell with its standard footprint and multiple price points in places that used to use Atom. Broadwell combined with alternative chipsets on one substrate is as effective as Atom in terms of physical size but much faster to market and more flexible in terms of cost and performance. More importantly it is much more in tune with fab loading and maximizing Broadwell's volume leading to ever lower costs. Some readers will squabble but Atom is dead (as Dead as Itanium was a decade before the burial). Rumors of acquiring Altera and Broadcom are circulating in the news for good reason. Intel is looking at a host of technologies, partnerships and companies that will set up high barriers to entry in the Data Center. Intel's leading process technology is best utilized in the server space where the value proposition is easily quantified in operations/watt or performance/watt. Every new generation of Moore's Law works in Intel's favor as it shows dramatic improvements and allows for price increases that offset lower Data Center power and cooling expenses. As Intel looks across the entire server platform, it realizes that ASPs and revenue can increase dramatically if it can closely couple memory and drives, thus reducing latencies in transactions. An acquisition of Altera could pay off if their Stratix FPGAs are moved forward to 10nm ahead of Xilinx and as a result dominate in the market for accelerators and the building of leading edge high speed networks. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and Huawai would be major customers. If an ARM player is to make inroads in the server space, they will need to create an ecosystem that is as competitive as Intel's. A key building block will be networking, which Broadcom is recognized as the leader. An acquisition of Broadcom by Intel would block any ARM processor player from making a run at Intel in the near term. Do the Feds understand that a monopoly move is in play? I doubt it and therefore am interested in how the mergers activity evolves for the rest of 2015. For now, Intel is in the drivers seat and we have not even been given a view on when 10nm rolls out. After the PC reset in Q1 2015, Growth is the outlook for Intel. Source: Intel Becomes A Data Center Centric Semiconductor Company Disclosure: The author is long AAPL, QQQ, QLD, TQQQ.
