Apple WWDC: Making IPad Truly 'The Computer For The Rest Of Us' - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple unveiled new multitasking capabilities for iPad in iOS 9. Based on testing the iOS 9 beta on a couple of iPads, multitasking appears to â€œjust workâ€?. With iOS 9, Apple has positioned the iPad to be what the Mac only aspired to, the â€œcomputer for the rest of usâ€?. iOS 9 did not turn out to be the incremental improvement that many were expecting prior to WWDC. Instead, it is an almost complete rebuild that is faster and more efficient, while adding a host of new capabilities. The most important new capability is multitasking, which takes advantage of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) leadership in 64-bit mobile processors. iOS 9 positions Apple to challenge Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for dominance of personal computing. My assessment of iOS 9 is based on direct experience using it for the past couple of days on a pair of iPads I keep for development and testing purposes, an iPad 2 and an iPad Mini 2. The most immediate evidence of the rebuilding of iOS is in the install size of the OS, which has shrunk from over 4 GB to about 2 GB in the beta. Apple is promising that this will be down to 1.3 GB by the time of the public release. The iPad 2 was never really very happy with iOS 8 and it seemed to get bogged down on even simple things such as web page loading. iOS 9 has given the iPad 2 a new lease on life, and the "it just works" feeling has returned. It appears that the issues many observed with Wi-Fi performance and the Safari browser have been resolved in 9. Not surprisingly, the new multitasking features of iOS 9 are unavailable on iPad 2. It appears that only Apple iPads running Apple's first and second gen 64-bit processors will get the benefit of multitasking. If anyone has any doubts about the value of 64-bit processors for mobile devices, these doubts should now be laid to rest. The iPad mini 2 has a retina display and an A7 64-bit processor, so I was able to test some multitasking on it. Multitasking in iOS 9 encompasses three features called Slide Over, Split View, and video Picture in Picture. Split View is only available on the iPad Air 2, which features what has been Apple's most powerful mobile processor, the A8x. Slide Over and Picture in Picture worked beautifully on the Mini 2. Apple has devised what is probably the most convenient UI mechanism to get into its multitasking mode: a simple swipe from the left edge of the screen. Picture in Picture worked surprisingly well on the Mini 2, which I didn't expect. Apple's intimate knowledge of its 64-bit processors, combined with long experience with building true 64-bit operating systems for them, has put Apple out in front of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android in multitasking. A recent article in Ars Technica demonstrated the state of multitasking in Google's next generation Android M, debuted at their recent IO developers conference . Unlike iOS 9, Ars Technica found that multitasking in M just didn't work. There are a host of other improvements that Apple has made, but let me just mention one of them that I found very intriguing, since it bears on iOS as a productivity platform. Android has long had mouse cursor capability for devices equipped with a track pad or an added on mouse. Likewise, Windows 8 has this built in. Why would you want this for a touchscreen device? Sometimes, it turns out to be the most convenient user input mechanism, especially when working with text. If you've tried to perform text selection or editing on a touchscreen, you know what I mean. Even though iPad has more than sufficient processing power to support editing text documents, and has numerous apps for that purpose, it's a cumbersome chore on the iPad that I only use for emergencies. Apple's new built in on screen keyboard tries to solve this by transforming into a track pad. Pressing two fingers on the keyboard puts it into track pad mode and a text insertion cursor appears on the screen, which can be moved using track pad mode anywhere on the screen. In this mode, I was able to select and edit blocks of text much more easily. Apple has resisted any form of "convergence" in its rather dogmatic anti-Windows 8 stance. But some convergence will be required to compete with Windows 10 tablets as productivity devices. Track pad mode may be a baby step in the direction of convergence, but some convergence is inevitable. As I pointed out in my WWDC preview article , multitasking on the iPad is another example of convergence, once again driven by competitive pressure from Windows tablets. This competitive pressure will only intensify with Windows 10, and new generations of Windows 10 tablets running Skylake Intel processors. After reflection, the conspicuous absence of multitasking for iPhone seems a little odd. Granted, split screen mode might be pretty useless for iPhone, but Slide Over and Picture in Picture would probably work just fine, certainly on the iPhone 6 Plus in landscape mode. The A8 processors in the latest iPhones would support these modes, just as the A7 does. Although it wasn't discussed at the conference, I believe these features will be coming to the next generation of iPhones, at least for the Plus size. This will give iPhone a huge advantage over Android smartphones and sustain iPhone's market share gains through the rest of the calendar year. Likewise, the rudimentary state of multitasking in Android M suggests that its deployment will significantly lag that of iOS 9, leaving Apple's next generation devices unchallenged during the crucial December quarter. I look for Apple's next generation iPads to pick up market share at the expense of Android tablets and finally post some y/y sales gains in the December quarter. How the next generation iPad, especially the much rumored 12+ inch iPad Pro will fare against Windows 10 tablets is a more difficult problem. iOS 9 multitasking closes an important gap that has existed. Well, almost closes, since Windows 10 will allow more than 2 apps to be open in split screen and will even support resizable Windows. How well an iPad or iPad Pro will do against Win10 tablets may come down to how well Apple's next generation processor, dubbed the A9, stacks up against Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Skylake. The A9 will feature the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) 14 nm process, so it will be much more competitive in terms of energy efficiency than Apple's processors have been up until now. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the A8X achieved rough performance parity with the base Core M found in Apple's MacBook with Retina Display. The A9 will have to do much better, since Skylake represents a redesign of the Broadwell microarchitecture, although it will still be fabricated on Intel's 14 nm node. The A7, being Apple's first 64-bit processor, represented a significant architectural advance over its previous ARM based processors, as well as a significant advance over the first generation generic 64-bit processor designs from ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) itself (Cortex A57). Apple will need a similar jump in performance to be competitive with Skylake, but it has demonstrated that it is capable of such advances. The competitive landscape for iPad has shifted dramatically in the past year. Android tablets are no longer the threat. Windows 10 is now the real threat to iPad, just as personal computing has become the real opportunity. A decisive battle looms between Apple and Microsoft in this important personal computing space. The battle will be decisive because tablets and phablets are becoming the personal computers "for the rest of us," assuming the role that the original Mac only aspired to. I wish I could say that the outcome of this battle is not in doubt, but it is. Source: Apple WWDC: Making IPad Truly 'The Computer For The Rest Of Us' Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
