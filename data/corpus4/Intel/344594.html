FBI Cancels Encryption Showdown With Apple After "3rd Party" Showed Them How To Unlock iPhone | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Following a mysterious "third party"'s willingness to show The FBI how to unlock San Bernardino killer Farook's iPhone, court records indicate that the US government wishes to cancel tomorrow's showdown with Apple, filing a motion to vacate the hearing. Hours after Tim Cook explcitly told the world (marketed) his firm would never sell out their privacy... "For many of us, the iPhone is an extension of ourselves," Cook said, according to USA Today. "We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy. We did not expect to be in this position, at odds with our own government. But we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country." "We will not shrink from this responsibility," he added. In case the message wasn’t clear enough, Apple’s music selection spoke for them. At the end of the event, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blasted through the venue. According to the memorandum, “On Sunday, March 20, 2016, an outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking Farook’s iPhone.” The third party and what the possible methods could be involved are both mysteries. Did Apple fold quietly behind the scenes? Is this how both sides save face with neither side appearing to have given an inch on their defense (or persecution) of personal liberty? Who knows, but if the US Government suddenly places an order for 1 million iPhone SEs, then we have our answer.

They don't even have to get into the phone.  They have to get into the data stream between the phone and wherever everything on it is backed up to.  We already know they divert every single telecom stream and record it, right at the hub.

I broke the story on ZH before anyone else did, by doing the right thing: citing a Source (RT) 2. Making a contribution like breaking a story on ZH gets you far less "credit" than a smart-ass one-liner.  Sometimes it's not so much of a Fight Club, but Amateur Hour for aspiring Standup Comedians.  Humor gets more points than insight or intel.   That tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about the breeding and IQ of the average blogger.  No wonder the Founding Fathers opted for a Republic, rather than a Democracy:  The masses can not be trusted to use their brains.  It feels like this also applies to the ZH masses, at times.

Green, a  computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the  research team."

That said I don't see what all it buys AAPL except cover. They get to say they had nothing to do with it, but the episode still ruins their claim of security. The only actors anyone cares about are the FBI, NSA, and the other TLAs. And turns out those guys can get in? That kinda ruins the whole story for anyone who actuallly follows this kind of thing. Not that any of us bought Apple's claim in the first place. Back-doors are easy, hard to detect and cheap. Apple annouces a secure phone initiative ... and 3 hours later gets a call from a nice person at the FBI. No fuss no muss. Mon, 03/21/2016 - 22:37 | 7344447 monad They get to present what they already had without explaining where they got it. Now and in the future make up anything they want. Election. Election. Election. Selection. Did Apple fold quietly behind the scenes? Is this how both sides save face with neither side appearing to have given an inch on their defense (or persecution) of personal liberty? Withdrawal of the legal action is based upon the public announcement that the phone security has been hacked.  That removes one of the reasons that some have used to justify the purchase.  The Apple "defense" of security was really all for show anyway.  Anything sent or received from the phone was in a NSA file anyway. http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/03/john-mcafee-better-prepare-to-ea... "he outlined the real technique that he'd use to crack the phone, and it turns out to be a super convenient "half hour job." McAfee only said it'd take three weeks because he didn't want to have to eat his shoe if a cold or flu interrupted him." Remember when it wasn't patriotic to oppose the Patriot Act.   Who's idea what that anyway?    Did anybody support the patriot act?    Mon, 03/21/2016 - 19:27 | 7343509 underman Mon, 03/21/2016 - 19:36 | 7343561 new game and you believe they weren't going to be spying anyway? and who is watching over these ultra high security secret operations? if you or I knew half of what our government was/is doing we would be appalled... Mon, 03/21/2016 - 19:54 | 7343639 roadhazard Mon, 03/21/2016 - 21:10 | 7344035 flaunt This is one thing people never seem to get through their thick skulls, the reason you don't give govt the benefit of the doubt is because you never know when a psycho like Obama will be in charge.  Even today people say things like, "well I'm glad they have body scanners in the aiport because... SECURITY!"  But the cognitive dissonance is alarming when the very same person acknowledges that the US government is purposely leaving the southern border unsecured and allowing criminals and illegal scum to run rampant inside our borders.  So you trust them with x-ray body scanners (they're safe, really, trust us) when they're not even taking basic measures to secure the borders.  Carry on.

There's just the odd throwback who are marginalized immediately now. The global system is in the last phases of wiping its bum of non-conformist conception and behavior. The ME psychos are putting up a feeble cultural 'resistance' but are in the process of being marginalized, sanitized or else destroyed, as well. 21st-century conformity and consensus is all the rage now. Just look at any social media, or any public institution or private for profit institution, school, or media outlet. It is as mandatorily conformist as Catholicism was in the 12th century. Only now it's for everyone. And whoever is not in the consensus is the enemy of reason, against sanity, and by the (re)definition, an enemy, an 'extremist', an enemy of the State. As if the State were more important than people, as they are, and have come to be, largely because of the actions of States. As far as the state is concerned they can just use the language of 'extremism', poliitical speeches and media to wipe out non-conformists and paint them as evil doers. They did the same thing in Queensland over the past couple of years about motorbike riders who belong to a motorbike riders 'club'. They were all branded 'bikie' clubs, lumped together and ascribed effective presumed criminal status. The QLD Government actually removed the freedom to associate for ordinary bike riders - a recognised basic 'human right' - removed by a legislative democratic parliamentry vote. This model will be applied everywhere, because they basically got away with doing it, the politicians and police simply beat-up this evil 'bikie' club boggieman out of all proportion and the public, or rather the mass media played it up and cheered them on all the way! The people just just let them do it! They did almost nothing. The politician who got away with it, the Premier, did so because there are actually bike clubs which are criminal organizations or have significant criminality in them, just like every other group of humans on earth. Guilt be mere association, and manufactured prejudice became normalized. Why? Because bikies are risk-taking non-conformists, who just might be bad people. They look all rough and tough so they must be bad people who will do every one home. Except most of them are just ex-military people who like to riding bikes. Gee maybe its the personality type that the military selects, that has something to do with that fact? So what to do? Oh, I know, let's treat them like criminals, whether they are or not. And that is what our treacherous government is doing, and is going to do. They will try this same trick wherever they want to. This is State-Power creation, and that power is to eliminate any non-conformist view that challenges popular prejudice, and all those prejudices are being tailored and manufactured to order, by political scumbags becoming leaders, cronies, and especially by our unethical senior police civil 'leaders'. They are betraying us all, as are the Parliaments, media and Courts. Those are the real extremists, those are the real threat to society and to the basic legitimacy of laws, governments, and social order. Those are the real domestic enemies. And this is not even the thin-end of the wedge any longer, this is the thick-end of the wedge going through, and no one even blinks, they dare not say no. They may get un-'Liked' on some bullshit gauge of what really matters and their non conformity logged and auto-classified.
