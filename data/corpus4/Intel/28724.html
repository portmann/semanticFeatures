Intel's Financial Outlook Indicates Q2 Will Beat Expectations - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha While the stock has underperformed in the first half of the year, the long-term growth story still has legs. The earnings results were roughly in-line, however, the financial outlook indicates that Q2 earnings will beat analyst estimates. While the full-year outlook wasn't exactly bad, it wasn't phenomenal either. With flat revenue and growth primarily propped up by the DCG, investors should anticipate Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) to stage a robust recovery toward the middle of CY 2015. Th outlook was a blowout this quarter, which is why the stock moved significantly higher in the after hours session. Intel could be undervalued, and with a competitive product stack starting to emerge in both mobile and storage solutions there's decent suspicion that top-line growth is within the cards over the foreseeable three years. Furthermore, Intel also retains an edge when it comes to chip designs, and is likely to build upon that with both 10nm technology and new chip designs in the foreseeable two-years. Earlier in Q1 2015, management indicated that both earnings and sales were likely to disappoint, which is what contributed to the early year sell off. Admittedly sell-side analysts remained relatively optimistic, with most reiterating their earlier stance, with the exception of JMP Securities Analyst Alex Gauna. Also, Cody Acree from Ascendiant remains bearish on Intel, so owning Intel doesn't come without some healthy dose of skepticism from some reputed analysts. I think there's enough infant business opportunities to drive growth in both top line and bottom line over the long run. Therefore, I believe there's a good risk to reward for investing into Intel at current levels. What was nice about Intel's earnings report was the growth in bottom line results, which was primarily driven by the reduction in tax rate and incremental increases in its OpEx structure. Sales remained flat for the fiscal year driven by better than expected server sales. The EPS figure met consensus expectations, so both the top line and bottom line were basically in-line with expectations. After plugging the outlook values provided by Intel's management into my spreadsheet, I anticipate revenue of $13.451 billion, gross margin beat of around 100 basis points, and operating expenses to come in-line with the outlook. The tax rate is particularly low in the upcoming fiscal quarter and will trend higher in the second half of the fiscal year. The effective tax rate is expected to be 20% and will jump back to 25% for the second half of the fiscal year. I anticipate share buybacks to slow down, perhaps $800 million in free cash flow will go toward buybacks. These assertions could change following the annual stock holders' meeting. The lower tax rate and production ramp will drive better yields (improving gross margins). These two factors drive my assertions of a beat on EPS for the upcoming fiscal quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Q2 FY 2015 is $.48. My EPS estimate is $0.60, which indicates that Intel's outlook beat consensus analyst earnings estimates for the second quarter by 25%. However, a more conservative scenario on gross margins may eventually play out as Intel is winding down capacity in older fabs and is putting the added capacity toward 14nm and 10nm. This puts some pressure on gross margins, which may indicate that my gross margin assertion could be a little aggressive. So if I operate on a 62% gross margin figure instead of the slightly more aggressive 63% gross margin figure, earnings per share will come in at $.58, which is still a major beat on consensus estimates for the next quarter. Admittedly, the revenue outlook wasn't as good, but going into the next FY, I anticipate sales to stabilize in PCCG, and growth in various businesses (data center, storage, mobile, and embedded systems) to drive top line. While Intel could have started the year better in traditional desktop and laptop computers, I'm fairly confident that an upgrade cycle could offer some stability in the holiday quarter. Furthermore, PC orders and demand could shift in the latter half of the year as management's foresight into the supply chain will most likely change three months prior to the beginning of the holiday quarter. There's the potential the launch of a new operating system paired with faster computing components will impact demand toward the end of the year. Overall, Intel seems extremely undervalued at 13.3 times earnings. The 3% dividend yield also sweetens the deal. Therefore, I reiterate my buy recommendation as the stock could easily outperform the returns of the S&P 500 toward the second half of the year.
