Microsoft Is Safe And Stable: Ignore Volatility, Buy The Dip - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft was hit by a spate of bad news which has put downward pressure on the stock. PC shipment forecasts, currency and piracy issues will negatively impact earnings and sales. Despite these risk factors, the business is heavily diversified and is likely to withstand these negative catalysts. Furthermore, the company has a fortress balance sheet and trades at a reasonable valuation in comparison to broader indices. Things don't look very good for the PC ecosystem as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) recently lowered its guidance. IDC revised estimates lower. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has yet to release Windows 10. And competing ecosystems are starting to gain more momentum. Based on all of this negativity it's not hard to imagine why investors are dumping Microsoft stock. I just think that the headlines have completely ignored what Microsoft is doing right and are underestimating the quality of Microsoft's earnings going forward. Therefore, I think investors should consider buying the stock while it's at lower levels as I anticipate FY 2016 will have much more momentum behind it due to stabilization in FX and momentum in the universal app ecosystem that's going to power Microsoft into a variety of devices. We further asked to make sure that the announcement means the following is technically possible: During this one-year period after Windows 10's launch, anyone can pirate Windows 7 or Windows 8.x and then upgrade to Windows 10 for free. "Correct; anyone in the world with a qualified device can upgrade a pirated copy of Windows to Windows 10," the Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to VentureBeat. When taking into consideration that people can take a illegitimate copy of Windows and upgrade into a legitimate and more recent version of Windows, investors have to account for a potential drop-off in licensing sales. Admittedly, chasing after the various users that actively break the terms and conditions of any OS licensing agreement would be a fruitless endeavor by Microsoft as litigation wouldn't yield much in the way of settlements as the people actively pirating copies of Microsoft don't have money to begin with, hence they steal older copies of Windows. What could Microsoft win in a court room from people who have no money to begin with? The OS-licensing business tends to perform better on the enterprise front, over the consumer, because enterprises are more responsive to legal liability. After all, if Microsoft were to litigate a mid-sized company for not licensing Windows, the mid-sized business will have to answer to a judge that will rule in favor of Microsoft. Hence Microsoft's enterprise division accounts for the majority of revenue and it will likely stay that way for the foreseeable future. Intel's recent comments which I will quote from SA Transcripts is a little alarming: Intel now expects Q1 revenue of $12.5B-$13.1B, below prior guidance of $13.2B-$14.2B and a $13.7B consensus. Gross margin guidance remains at 60% (+/- 2%), with lower volumes offset by higher ASPs. "All other expectations" have been withdrawn - that presumably includes full-year guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth. Guidance will be updated during Intel's April 14 Q1 report. The reduction in revenue outlook shouldn't come as any surprise as IDC recently lowered their estimates on PC market demand as well. Worldwide PC shipments will fall further than forecast this year as the strong U.S. dollar and the lack of new products threaten sales, researcher IDC said. Shipments will drop 4.9 percent in 2015 instead of the previous forecast for 3.3 percent decline, the Framingham, Massachusetts,-based research firm said in a statement Thursday. PC sellers bought more computers than anticipated in the last three months of 2014 to boost inventory before Microsoft Corp. started to scale back subsidies in early 2015, while the strong dollar is crimping PC exports, the researcher said. The key word from IDC was foreign exchange impacts and the lack of new products. That implies that the research firm is anticipating a minor reduction in shipments because Microsoft has yet to launch Windows 10, while currency exchange has strengthened the greenback against a basket of currency pairs. Given Microsoft, Intel, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) price products from the perspective of the dollar, the firm is likely responding to higher pricing on a currency adjusted basis in foreign markets. Following that rationale, Microsoft's international revenue will be negatively affected to a certain extent. Despite an underwhelming earnings outlook from the prior quarter, Microsoft looks a lot more attractive at current levels. And while many technical analysts would argue that a stock trading below the 200-day MA is a risky gamble, I think there's a reasonable likelihood of a pay-off when operating on a multi-year time frame. Source: Microsoft 2014 Annual Report If we look very closely, Microsoft's revenue from the PC operating system is only representative of 19.4% of revenue. So even if licensing revenue were to drop by 5%-10% year-over-year, the impact on sales would be $825 million to $1.68 billion. When taking into consideration Microsoft has many rapid growth businesses in enterprise services, hardware and Office 365 the impact on earnings is likely to be negligible. Furthermore, Microsoft isn't really all that expensive in comparison to the broader market. Microsoft trades at 17.3 times earnings and pays a 2.89% dividend yield, better than the 10-year U.S. treasury bond, without any significant risk of default, as the company has $85 billion in liquid assets on the balance sheet and $22.65 billion in debt. That's a pretty good ratio and is probably as safe if not safer to own than some foreign bonds. Also, let's not forget that Microsoft has a diversity of businesses, both domestically and internationally, which means it's not that exposed to certain business segments or geographic regions. Currently, the forward S&P 500 price target by Morgan Stanley is based on a 16.9 earnings multiple, Microsoft's forward P/E is 14.79, which is a little less expensive than the forecasted P/E for the S&P 500. Not only that, Microsoft carries considerably less risk and is trading at a bit of a discount in comparison to its earlier highs. I have high conviction that the stock is relatively cheap when taking into consideration the risk profile and forward looking growth estimates. Currently the consensus analyst estimate calls for a 9.10% reduction in EPS year-over-year, but it's entirely possible for Microsoft to beat those expectations as Microsoft isn't that reliant on the consumer PC business for revenue. Despite the challenging business environment facing Microsoft, the business is diversified enough to absorb issues pertaining to piracy, falling PC shipments and currency effects. Therefore, investors should look to buy Microsoft opportunistically at these lower levels as there's a high margin of safety to both top and bottom line. I anticipate a recovery in sales and earnings in FY 2016 as new products stabilization in FX will make for better looking comps and will also improve sentiment, which will drive multiple expansion in the next calendar/fiscal year.
