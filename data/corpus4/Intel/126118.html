Buying Apple: Consider The Scale Of The Potential Investment - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 23, 2015 12:14 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: BIDU , CSCO , HPQ , INTC , QCOM , SAP , TM , TSM by: Intrepid Investor "Growth of both mammals like elephants and corporations like Apple are limited by their size" - Mohnish Pabrai paraphrased and with the reference to Apple inserted. If you could own $0.7 trillion Apple or seven large-cap tech stocks worth $0.7 trillion, which would you prefer? Consider the potential scale of the investment. Millions of us love our Apple products, admire the company, and see no reason why it can't top a trillion, but consider the scale of that size of an investment. Mohnish Pabrai makes an eloquent case against investing in companies that become too large. He compares companies to mammals...nature seems to have imposed a size limit on mammals and companies alike. There have never been mammals much larger than an elephant, perhaps because mammals are warm-blooded and need energy to survive. It gets progressively more difficult for the heart to circulate blood to the extremities as a mammal grows bigger. Similarly, the top management of a large and growing corporation becomes progressively more removed from the multiplying touch points with customers, suppliers and partners. This reduces management effectiveness, eventually causing scale to become a disadvantage and providing competitors with an opportunity to beat the incumbent. Source: Mihaljevic, John (2013-08-01). The Manual of Ideas: The Proven Framework for Finding the Best Value Investments (p. 14). Wiley. Kindle Edition. Mihaljevic advises us "to focus attention on the relative scale of the potential investments (i.e. are there any elephants among them) rather than the size of our portfolio." He illustrates, placing elephant-sized Toyota (NYSE: TM ) at $99 billion on the right side of the table and seven smaller companies on the left: He continues: "Many of us inappropriately consider the scale of our portfolio ahead of the scale of potential investments" and will think "(I can) buy a tiny stake in one the above companies." He calls that the small-fish mind-set or Mind-Set A. In contrast, the mind-set of a chief capital allocator ("Mind-Set B") is this: "Do I really want to spend $99B to buy Toyota or would I rather, after further research, buy some or all seven of the companies on the left with my $99B and have money left over?" The lesson here is not primarily about diversification, it is about the scale of an investment - a purchase of a single share of TM is a big investment if that's all you can afford, because TM is a big company. I had to think about that for a while. John Mihaljevic's book has influenced my investing such that most stocks I own have market caps less than $10B. Apple is one of the exceptions. I decided to take Mihaljevic's example of Toyota above and substitute Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), market cap-weighting it against seven tech companies between $50B and $150B with an aggregate market cap of $0.7 trillion. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), SAP SE ADR (NYSE: SAP ), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) were selected consecutively from a list of tech companies ranked by market cap and were selected for no other reason than market cap. The purpose of this comparison is solely to get into Chief Allocator Mind-Set B ahead of further due diligence. Retained earnings as a simple measure of value creation over the life of a company. SA author Early Retiree put me on to this with his October 27, 2013, article called "IBM Is As Cheap As In April 2009." I have adopted this metric that comes right off the balance sheet into my valuations. Here are the retained earnings for both sides of the scales - the tech companies on the right side of the scale are in descending order of their market caps: Retained earnings are earnings left for investors or for re-investing after any dividends have been paid. Retained earnings are not an absolute measure of value remaining in the company, but the growth in market cap should eventually align with retained earnings, a statement attributed to Warren Buffett. Apple offers fewer retained earnings than the seven large caps in aggregate on the right side of the above table. Here is a graph showing Apple's market cap overlaid with retained earnings through Q2 of 2015 - separate scales: Except for year 2013, the market has added value at a rate proportional to the growth in Apple's retained earnings. Let's for a moment forget any due diligence we have already done on Apple or the seven companies on the other side of the balance and get into the capital allocator mindset. We have $0.7 trillion to invest. Are we going to consider buying Apple for that entire amount (the price tag would be enterprise value in that case, not market cap, but that's beside the point)? Or are we going to consider allocating that $0.7 trillion to some or all of the other seven? That would get us diversified into companies that are not yet the size of an elephant. When I force myself to think that way, I think I understand the market's reluctance to allocate a lot more to Apple's market cap. Remember what John Mihaljevic advises: Focus on the scale of the investment, not on the scale of your portfolio. That's hard to do - I didn't do that when I bought Apple - "oh, I just want a little piece of it." That's my small fish mindset.
