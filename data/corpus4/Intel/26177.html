Intel Now Has Something To Prove - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha PC and currency issues will be key items to examine. Update on mobile is important for future growth. After the bell on Tuesday afternoon, we'll get an important earnings report from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Hopes for another strong year from the company were seemingly destroyed when management issued a Q1 revenue warning in early March. While that means we have a better idea of where things will land on Tuesday, there are still a number of key questions to be answered. Intel blamed its lowered forecast on weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain. Management reduced the midpoint of its revenue forecast by $900 million to $12.8 billion. This has forced analysts to reduce their numbers for multiple periods, as seen in the table below. Some analysts have not revised their forecasts (the high estimate is over $14 billion), leaving the analyst average a little above Intel's midpoint. One of the key items I will listen for is the currency impact. As we all know, the dollar has been very strong lately. Management discussed challenging currency conditions in the warning, an issue not really discussed previously. Investors also want to know how weak the PC space is , because there are a lot of other companies that might be impacted by industry weakness. The PC Client Group accounts for a majority of Intel's revenues and operating profits. There was one bright spot in the warning, and that was commentary that the Data Center Group was performing as expected. It's nice to see the second most important segment doing well, but unfortunately it won't be able to compensate for a struggling PC segment. Intel is also expected to provide an update on its mobile situation with this report. I'm guessing that things are not going well, which is why management decided to again change its financial reporting structure . By merging the mobile segment into the PC group, Intel can essentially hide its large mobile operating losses, which were over $4 billion last year. Management originally guided to an $800 million improvement this year, but we'll see if that forecast changes. One item that might be overshadowed by the discussion of the PC and mobile businesses is the company's capital return plan. Intel has returned tens of billions to shareholders in recent years, but things haven't always gone as investors had hoped. Intel went a few years without a dividend raise, and now the buyback is an issue . Management went in and bought over $8 billion worth of shares in the second half of 2014, at an average price of about $34.54. I'm curious to hear how much was spent on the buyback in Q1, and what management will do going forward. Shares are now a couple of dollars below what the company paid in late 2014, so the buyback seems poorly timed at this point. With a number of acquisition rumors flying in recent weeks, investors might get a bit upset if management continues to overspend on shares when the company's cash could be used for another purpose. As you can expect, shares have not done well in recent months, especially with a big revenue warning. In the chart below, you will see how shares are near the lower end of their 6-month range, below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Those that rely on technicals would like to see the stock regain the 50-day line after earnings, but Intel will need to reassure investors for that to happen. The stock is yielding more than 3.00% currently thanks to its dividend, but a falling 50-day line could provide resistance. Just like two of the past three years, hopes were high for Intel when the year started, but expectations have dropped precipitously. That now gives the company something to prove going forward.
