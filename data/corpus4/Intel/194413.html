Microsoft Is Creating Havoc For Valve's Steam Machines - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Many feel that the Havoc Engine is for internal game development. I think Microsoft has something much more aggressive in mind. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) purchased the Havoc engine from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). For those not familiar, Havoc is not an actual turning pistons kind of physical engine, but rather the framework that numerous popular video games have been built on. The Havoc engine is primarily focused on creating a realistic physics simulation inside of these games. The other opinions I've read so far focus on the benefits to Microsoft's internal software development studios for the purposes of designing new games. I'm certain this will be a benefit, but I'm looking at this in a slightly different way. An area where Microsoft has an exploitable weakness Windows is still the operating system of choice for almost 92% of all PC users, this includes the number of people who use Macs as well. However, there are many choices out there for the types of hardware that people can construct their computers from. Motherboards, RAM, and graphics cards can be a nearly infinite number of combinations. Since the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft has sought to bring simplicity to this jungle of manufacturers. As has Intel. The two companies have helped develop standards across the hardware industry that have streamlined the functions and cost of PCs. It's still not perfect though. When comparing performance, many people have noted that game consoles, especially Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) Playstation 4, are capable of creating a very impressive experience in spite of using hardware that is several generations behind what is currently available as graphics hardware in the PC market. The advantage is in the lower cost of building consoles over PCs for games. Additionally, games that were simultaneously developed for PC and PS4/Xbox One have tended to have more glitches. Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) Batman: Arkham Knight was a classic example of the problems that programmers have faced trying to optimize the game on what should have been easily more powerful hardware. But even on cards that cost $600, the game would stutter and crash during dramatic moments. This happens because there are all those hardware possibilities with the PC market. But with consoles, every one of them has the exact same hardware in each box. Software programmers can optimize the code that they are writing knowing that the outcomes will be uniform across the board, and will not have as many problems with bugs. They call this "Writing to the metal" internally. The longer a console has been in the marketplace, the better programmers become at making it more efficient. Microsoft started to address this issue with DirectX a number of years ago. They started helping 3D hardware manufacturers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Radeon (NASDAQ: AMD ) create standards for what they were releasing. As the years passed, each of these companies was able to write closer and closer to the metal. Where we stand today in graphics hardware has essentially come down to one remaining standard: Physics. Nvidia has its own proprietary physics engine called "PhysX". They bought the rights years ago and they have been using hardware-accelerated physics since then. The Radeon cards have no such component, relying on most game designers to supply engines of their own. It helps keep the cost of their cards down and lets them focus on geometry rendering instead. Microsoft will likely be seeking to integrate the Havoc engine into a future update of DirectX. It would be for the purpose of optimizing the 3D performance on Windows hardware with less costly graphics cards, likely the sub $300 market. I strongly believe that their end goal with this is to allow Microsoft to sell set top computers with strong gaming performance. At the beginning of the year, I wrote an article titled " Steam Machines A Serious Threat To Sony, Microsoft's Video Games Divisions ". Microsoft apparently knew this as well already. Windows X is bringing functionality that combines the capabilities of the XBox One with PCs in general. I think that they are trying to split the user base, in the same way that Valve is trying to do with their Steam Machines. Microsoft is going to market a new sort of XBox, but that's not what it really is. While the hardware inside may not be "standard", the performance will be, and predictable. This new set top box will be sideways compatible with Xbox One and older Xbox 360 and classic Xbox games, but will also be upgradeable/scalable at the user's discretion for an even more impressive experience. People who want to save money can buy the Xbox One console. Gamers who want to have the best experience possible will buy one of these new machines. There is some additional evidence that supports this theory. At E3 in July this year, Microsoft announced backwards compatibility for the Xbox One, but through software. It allows the Xbox One to render older games created for the Xbox 360 at higher frame rates and cleaner resolutions. I believe that they intend to fully extend this capability to modern PC gamers as well. The same computers that are being built as Steam Machines will also be able to play Microsoft Windows games. They always had that capability in fact, but the Steam Machines use Valve's proprietary operating systems to operate that hardware. With a stronger physics engine in place, players might be less motivated to use Valve's SteamOS and just stick with the Windows that they already have. That certainly helps make operating all of their other applications more convenient. By adding this feature, Microsoft will allow more developers to write to the metal in a way they haven't been able to previously. Putting Havoc into the DirectX software will create a standard that will improve performance across the board. You will be able to purchase a high end, let's call them "Xbox Infinity" systems for now; for a smaller cost than an equivalent Steam Machine.
