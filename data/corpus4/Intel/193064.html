iOS 'Photoshop Fix' App Exposes The Inadequacy Of Apple's iPad Pro - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Adobeâ€™s new Photoshop Fix iOS app reminds me again how disappointed I am with the iPad Pro. ARM-based tablets will continue to remain as mere companion tools for laptop-using creative professionals. Adobe will never be able to port a useful iOS version of its amazing Photoshop CC software to any ARM-based iPads. I already made it clear before that an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Pro will find it hard to attract serious consideration from creative professionals because of its lack of an x86 processor. The argument that the iPad Pro cannot be justly compared to the Surface Pro 3 is invalid. These two expensive 2-in-1 tablet/notebooks are aimed toward the enterprise market. They are therefore worthy of evaluation against each other. By not using an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processor, Apple intentionally made the iPad Pro less usable/inferior than the much cheaper $499 Surface 3. Apple likes to differentiate its products to maximize the revenue it can extract from its customers. However, the iPad Pro's A9X processor is still inadequate for enterprise users who depend on x86 only software. Apple only wants MacBook-using professionals to buy the touchscreen iPad Pro as a companion tool - not as a replacement for Mac laptops. This greedy approach may not work well among corporate buyers who are on a fixed annual budget. The iPad Pro is useless for serious design jobs due to its non-compatibility with important industry standard software. It is just an expensive over-sized iPad that somehow covers up Apple's obvious refusal to release a touchscreen MacBook. The inadequacy or lack of enterprise-level usability of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is again highlighted by Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) latest iOS photo editing app, Photoshop Fix . While others are gushing over this new mobile app from Adobe, I find Photoshop Fix as a warning of how Apple intentionally crippled the iPad Pro. I still do freelance graphic design jobs and Photoshop Fix is another embarrassment for Adobe. It should stop releasing mobile apps that has the Photoshop name attached to it. Photoshop Fix, while better than Photoshop Express , is still a million light years away from delivering even 20% of the usability of the Mac OS X version of Photoshop CC. Just look at the screenshot below, Photoshop Fix's UI and tools are far from being truly satisfactory to creative professionals. The computational limitation of an ARM-based processor makes it impossible for Adobe to port real Photoshop CC features to the iPad Pro. One example of this limitation is Photoshop Fix's Healing Brush tool. Forcing complicated x86 features on an ARM-based device sometimes leads to annoying results. The Spot Heal tool of Photoshop Fix sometimes leaves a very noticeable artifact of the unwanted object that I tried to remove. This is also the same problem when using the Clone Stamp tool. On the other hand, sometimes the Heal and Clone Stamp tools do work like they are supposed to. They use pixel from nearby areas of the image to cover up/remove unwanted objects. However, occasional glitches are unacceptable to professional designers on a tight deadline. Try as it may, Adobe and other software developers, will never be able to create a 1:1 port of their x86 software for iOS devices. If only Apple would diverge from its habit of product differentiation, an Intel-powered iPad Pro would have been a must-have tool every creative professional would have paid anything to own. Product differentiation is not always suitable to all kinds of customers. There are millions of iLoyalists who will not mind buying two Apple products that are just essentially just one item in terms of purpose. However, there will be some discerning potential buyers that will see through and reject Apple's overzealous profiteering. In the long run, Apple will find it worthwhile to abandon its policy of never mixing iOS and Mac OS devices. The iPad Pro will find it hard to win in the enterprise market against the Surface Pro 3 and other Windows 10 touchscreen hybrid laptops. The $799 iPad Pro rightfully deserves to be upgraded beyond the limitations of ARM-based processors and iOS apps. I opine that it would be better for Apple in the long-run if it sacrifices the non-touchscreen MacBook in favor of a Mac OS X version of the iPad Pro. This enterprise-centric tablet only needs an Intel x86 processor to make it a real equalizer to the Surface Pro 3. The bigger risk now is that Apple will not only have semi-attractive iPad Pro, but it might also see its MacBook business decline from the rising popularity of the Surface. There are now cheaper copycat versions of the Surface Pro 3 already. The obvious advantage (and cost savings) of a real touchscreen tablet/notebook hybrid appeals to all consumers, not just corporate users. The current iPad Pro has a limited appeal. It is just a companion tool for the MacBook. It is an optional - not a necessary gadget for professionals. Ergo, the iPad Pro is unlikely to help reverse the declining sales of the iPad product line.
