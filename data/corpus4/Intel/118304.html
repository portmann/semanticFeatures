ETF Hub Jul 15 2015, 18:54 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor On Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Q2 CC ( webcast ), CEO Brian Krzanich stated his company doesn't plan to launch its first 10nm CPU platform until the second half of 2017. The platform, previously codenamed Cannonlake and more recently referred to as Ice Lake, was expected to arrive by late 2016 or early 2017. Krzanich: "The last two technology transitions have signaled that our cadence today is closer to 2½ years than two.” To hold users over between the its first 10nm chips and its 14nm Skylake CPUs ( due later this year ), Intel plans to roll out a 3rd-gen 14nm platform (codenamed Kaby Lake ) in 2016. The disclosure coincides with a $1B 2015 capex budget cut. On the bright side, Intel remains upbeat about server CPU division (DCG) sales - the company previously forecast a 15% CAGR for DCG through 2018 - and predicts Skylake and Windows 10 will drive a seasonal pickup in PC demand following a very rough Q1/Q2. Intel is now up 1.7% AH, giving back a large chunk of the initial gains seen on account of its Q2 beat (aided on the bottom line by a low tax rate) and better-than-expected guidance. That "beat" was due to the fact that they pay no tax and they bought back a lot of shares near all-time highs. Margin & revenue both also beat, and guidance for both was better than anticipated. Maybe mgmt simply did a great job of managing expectations, but gross margins and revenues did not beat based on reduced share count or tax Credits... Intel AH action has no bearing on where the stock is going. I can recall several times in the past few years where it rose or fell, only to be followed by a 20% rise or fall (in the opposite direction) in the weeks afterwards. May as well put off 10nm, give them time to engineer the architecture around Altera ... such as it is, I remain skeptical. Intel should move out 10nm to 2017 since 14nm was impacted by poor Windows 8 refresh waiting on Windows 10 ship! Why replace 14nm with 10nm when PC sales will not pick up until 2H 2015 & 1H 2016.  They're doing the right thing to squeeze ROI out of 14nm CAPEX. @techy. PC is becoming irrelevant in the INTC future projections. They are 3 trends which demand such an advance. 1. Server chips. 14nm is perfect for now, to sustain the growth with higher  margins. Tock cycle in the shorts face all day every day. (The lesser urgent of them all) 2. Mobile. 10nm is mandatory (#2 in urgency) ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
