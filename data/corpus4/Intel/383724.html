Apple updates retina MacBooks with new CPUs, faster storage, rose gold option (updated) - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apr 19 2016, 10:55 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Apple's ( AAPL -0.3%) ultra-thin 12" retina MacBooks ( launched a year ago) have been updated to include 1.1-1.3GHz. dual-core Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core M CPUs based on the chip giant's Skylake architecture, which was released last summer/fall. The original MacBooks used CPUs based on Intel's prior-gen Broadwell architecture. The Skylake chips come with an integrated GPU (the Intel HD 515) said to deliver up to 25% better graphics performance. Apple has also provided faster PCIe flash storage for its retina MacBooks, and promises an additional hour of battery life. A rose gold option has been added to go with existing gold, silver, and space grey options. The notebooks still sport an all-metal enclosure and Force Touch trackpad, and continues relying on a single USB Type-C port for power and data. A base model (1.1GHz. Core M3 CPU with Turbo Boost speeds of up to 2.2GHz. and 256GB of storage) still goes for $1,299, and a more powerful model (1.2GHz Core M5 CPU with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz., 512GB of storage) for $1,599. A Core M7 CPU is available via configure-to-order options. With a weak PC market weighing, Apple's Mac revenue fell 3% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $6.7B, with units dropping 4% to 5.3M. ASP rose to $1,270 from the prior quarter's $1,205. Update: Apple has also quietly made a small-but-notable update to the $999 base model for the 13" MacBook Air: It now comes with 8GB of RAM instead of 4GB. Will Macbook Pro or Air ever get touch screen? Waiting over a year for a new MacBook Pro.  AAPL is not innovating in the laptop space.  Touting a new color for your laptop is not a good sign.  HPQ and MSFT are innovating past AAPL in the laptop space. I have the same question, nothing new in MB Pro area for ages now. I was hoping for something new from the latest event but nada... It is about time. Always thought Apple was chintzy in offering certain hardware features, when you compare its offering with similarly priced windows based laptops. "... been updated to include 1.1-1.3GHz. dual-core Intel Core M CPUs based on the chip giant's Skylake architecture, which was released last summer/fall" Intel Core M Skylake CPU's are being used by Windows laptops since last year and these are for mobile computing not intended for power users like video editing and gaming.  No wonder Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey said that Apple doesn't make any computers powerful enough to run it. "That is up to Apple and if they ever release a good computer we will do it," Luckey tells ShackNews when asked about Mac support. "It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn’t match our recommended spec." It's doubtful that an underpowered laptop with minimal expansion capability and dog slow graphics is going to sell in high numbers. I know that I am not interested in the slightest. I might become interested when Apple releases a laptop with a discrete Nvidia GPU built on the TSMC 16 nm FF process. But if the laptop has poor battery life, I probably won't be interested given the likely release of the A10X this fall and the A11/A11X the year after. And an A11X with an OLED panel would definitely entice me to purchase another tablet. 1299 for a machine that might get 8 hrs of battery life with a single USB port, poor graphics performance, no pencil input with an inferior screen is a poor offering. It's a good thing that Apple has its mobile line of machines. Their desktop and laptop lines are pathetic. Not that the other manufacturers are any better. But when I would rather have a Galaxy tablet over a MacBook, it's saying a lot.
