Intel, Google Admit The OEM System Has Broken Down - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Technology giants can no longer depend on OEMs to generate demand. Back in the old "Wintel" days, where Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) hardware was married to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows software, key components had an ecosystem, a network of original equipment manufacturers or software developers would turn the basic offering of a giant corporation into something people could use and stores could sell. The OEMs took on manufacturing and marketing risk. The central company simply booked profits or backed an "ingredient brand" like Intel Inside under which they would pay part of the partners' marketing costs. This is raising costs, and risks, for major tech companies, which must now design and find ways to manufacture the products consumers buy and use. The new system was created Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), whose Macintosh lost out in the 1980s because it wouldn't relinquish control over the design, but has found in this century that it can get Chinese manufacturers to produce iPhones in any quantity, and keep the profits. Competitors are at sea in this new world. Microsoft has lost money for years on the Surface. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is finding its Android OEMs, like HTC, threatened with ruin. After trying, and failing, to produce its own phones with Motorola, it's now finding it has to put its brand on hardware with a TP-Link OnHub router that is doomed from the start because large ISPs such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) package WiFi with their interconnects "free" in order to control the resource. But it's Intel that faces the most problems in this new era. Once OEMs waited for its roadmap to deliver easy profits on vanilla hardware. Now the company is increasingly forced to put its own name on hardware, like a watch , in order to juice new markets it needs badly to succeed, like wearables and the Internet of Things. But this means more than just making stuff, or working with companies like Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ) to make stuff. It also means creating demand and navigating a changing media landscape. Again, it means new risks, like taking on a TV production, "America's Greatest Makers," that might fail for reasons completely unrelated to the Intel Curie hardware module it's boosting. In the new environment events like the Intel Developer Conference become less important as technical events and more important as marketing and negotiating opportunities. What matters happens behind the curtain, outside of public view, so investors should ignore the show and focus on sales figures. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, CMCSA, GOOGL.
