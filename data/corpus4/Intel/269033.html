Intel's Entry-Level Apollo Lake Processors Can Spoil AMD's 14nm Debut In 2016 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Thanks to GlobalFoundries 14nm FinFET process, AMD will finally release 14nm CPUs and GPUs next year. On the other hand, Intel’s upcoming entry-level 14nm Apollo Lake processors will again hurt AMD’s low-end/mid-range PC business in 2016. Apollo Lake processors will have Gen9 Intel HD graphics that have support for Ultra HD 4K video resolution and GPU hardware acceleration. After being stuck in 28nm process for so long, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) confirmed last month that it would release 14nm processors and GPUs next year. GlobalFoundries' 14nm FinFET technology will help AMD catch up with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in 2016. Intel-made 14nm processors were already in commercial products since September 2014 . INTC greatly outperformed AMD's stock over the past two years because of AMD's failure to keep up with Intel's rate of advancement in processor manufacturing/designs. This stock performance trend might still continue well into 2016 because of Intel's upcoming Apollo Lake processors. Without upgrading to 14nm, AMD may incur more unsold inventories of outdated 28nm chips. AMD had to write down $65 million over unsold processors during its recent quarterly earnings report. We all look forward to AMD's next-generation 14nm desktop/mobile processors. However, the Digitimes' report that Intel will release cheap Apollo Lake-based processors in mid-2016 spells trouble for the upcoming 14nm CPU/APU products of AMD. The 28nm Carizzo and Carizzo-L SoC from AMD this year were never competitive with Intel's 14nm Broadwell-U and Skylake processors. It is the reason why AMD had no choice but to skip 20nm and 16nm and go directly to 14nm so it could achieve parity with Intel. The 14nm Apollo Lake-based Intel processors will reportedly come with the new Gen9 HD graphics technology. Intel's Gen9 integrated GPU supports Ultra HD 4K (4096x2160) resolution and Hardware Acceleration for Media Editing. This is a very important equalizer to the often-better integrated Radeon GPUs of AMD processors. While many gamers will probably prefer cheap AMD Radeon-powered desktops, future Intel Apollo Lake-equipped PCs may win favor from creative professionals who want an Integrated GPU with Hardware Acceleration support for Photoshop or Premiere. The high-end $500 Skylake Core i7-6700K is the first product that uses the Integrated Gen9 GPU, the Intel HD 530. Intel's Generation 9 integrated GPU (IGP) now has a Multi Plane Overlay feature. This is similar to AMD Radeon's 3D rendering/video playback path adjustments technology used in the Carizzo SoC. I won't bother you with numerous technical improvements that Intel made for Gen9 GPU. What matters most is that DigiTimes is now claiming that Intel is coming up with cheap x86 processors that could compete with the built-in Radeon GPUs of AMD APUs. This enhanced GPU feature is important because PC manufacturers will then have little reason to support Radeon-powered APUs. A Gen9 Graphics-powered Apollo Lake CPU will make it possible for PC vendors like Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) to come up with decent sub-$300 computers. My point is that Intel's integrated GPUs are now good enough for most PC vendors. This is why Intel's IGP has helped it corner 72.8% share of the overall GPU industry . Thanks to widespread OEM support, Intel has more than 80% market share in desktop processor sales. Intel HD Graphics-equipped entry-level Intel CPUs are most likely beating sales of Radeon-powered APUs. Intel's Gen9 integrated GPUs might even be good enough for budget-constrained PC gamers. There are millions of PC buyers that cannot afford a Radeon or Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) graphics card. Going forward, there might be little need for people to buy $100-$300 Nvidia/Radeon GPUs. Intel is plotting to release sub-$150 Apollo Lake-based processors with an IGP that could play any modern PC games under low/medium graphic settings. As per the tests of Digital Trends, the Gen9 Intel HD 530 has a better 3DMark Benchmark score than AMD's Godavari A10-7870K APU . The Intel HD 530 is 21% faster than the excellent Radeon 7 integrated GPU of the A10-7870K. Like what the chart above revealed, the budget-friendly Apollo Lake could really eventually hurt the sales of sub-$150 budget APUs and discreet GPU products of AMD and Nvidia. The huge pool of buyers of low-end computers means there is money to be made in lower-margin Apollo Lake-based processors. Anything that will encourage people to keep on buying affordable desktop and laptops is good for Intel. I also see energy-efficient Apollo Lake processors getting inside sub-$300 2-in-1 tablet/notebook products next year. Unlike Intel, AMD has so far avoided the 2-in-1 notebook products. Investors should therefore include Intel (and not AMD) in their 2016 portfolio. Gen9 GPU-equipped Apollo Lake-based processors will help Intel erode AMD's market share in low-to-mid-range computers. Sad but true, it's the PC manufacturers, not the end-consumers, who actually decide which new x86 processor designs get to thrive or die. Yes, AMD will come up with great 14nm processors next year that have amazing benchmark scores . However, Intel's dominant influence over PC OEMs means AMD's 2016/2017 Zen products will probably again get weak industry support. Sad but true, PC OEMs who kowtow to Intel are slowly killing AMD's x86 PC processor business. Unless Dr. Lisa Su can persuade major PC vendors like Lenovo to support AMD's upcoming Zen-based processors, Intel will continue to enjoy 80%-90% market share in x86 CPU sales. Lastly, Intel's continuing improvement of its integrated graphics processing (IGP) technology also is a headwind for AMD's discreet Radeon GPU sales. Intel therefore is the safer bet for 2016 investing. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
