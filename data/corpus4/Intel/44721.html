Why Now May Be The Time To Buy Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel still has a below-market earnings multiple despite a sharp rise during 2014. CEO Brian Krzanich is fixing the problems with OEMs that bedeviled predecessors. I used to own Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) but I've been down on it for years now. Their problems in mobile, Chinese OEMs preferring anything to Intel chips, were obvious. The team of insiders, Brian Krzanich and Renee James, brought in to fix things seemed timid. I questioned the stock's momentum last year. First, the "Internet of Things," which I wrote about over a decade ago, is going to explode demand for chips of all kinds. Even before Krzanich became CEO, the company was moving firmly into lower and lower power designs, to cheaper and cheaper chips, which the IoT demands. Second, I was impressed by James' efforts to cater to the OEMs. It wasn't just her speech at Computex last year, but the company's follow-through, that I found impressive. Third, despite last year's run-up in the share price, they're still cheap as chips. You're paying 14 times earnings for a company that can take $1 in every $5 it brings in to the bottom line. Despite an incredibly capital intensive manufacturing process, barely $1 in every $6 of capital is subject to debt. The company delivers a steady and rising dividend, which, at current prices, yields 2.9%. How can you not like that? Of all the four companies that still make chips - Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ), and privately-held Global Foundries are the others - Intel has done the best over the last year. It's not depending entirely on its own branded product for sales, but it is looking for opportunities there. I thought for years Intel should split the foundries from the design, given what I call Moore's Second Law, which is that manufacturing costs rise in line with chip complexity. I now believe that when that time comes, Intel will know it, and if Krzanich sees the necessity, I believe he will do it. It's time for me to shut up about it. The latest re-arrangement of the deck chairs under Mike Bell focuses all of the company's research on new products, with an aim at shortening the time between discovery and OEMs delivering product. It tells me that the company understands the limits of its own brand name, and that Krzanich understands his is primarily an ingredient brand. Finally, there remains a lot of bearish sentiment around the stock. The company is deliberately downplaying the near term , which makes sense given the strength of the dollar. The company seems, at last, to have its eyes wide open concerning the broader economy, no longer relying on both Moore's Law and its own reputation to carry it forward. I made a lot of money on Intel during the 1990s, as its stock split repeatedly and kept gaining. This is not the same Intel. This is now an income stock, a safe stock, not a wide-eyed growth stock. But it's a stock that a conservative portfolio can buy, hold, and feel good about now. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
