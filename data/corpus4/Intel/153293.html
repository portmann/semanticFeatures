Intel And Asus Win Carrier Support For ZenFone Smartphones - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha AT&T has added the Asus ZenFone 2E Android phone to its GoPhone Prepaid program. Asustek is the first major OEM to release an Intel SoFIA-powered phablet, the ZenPad 7. Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) Chairman Jonney Shih has upgraded his strategy to sell more Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom-powered ZenFone 2 smartphones in the U.S. Mr. Shih previously said that the Asus ZenFone 2 could succeed in the U.S. even without the support of U.S. carriers . However, AT&T (NYSE: T ) probably liked the rising global success of the ZenFone brand, and has therefore added the ZenFone 2E Android smartphone to its GoPhone prepaid program . Carrier support is major positive factor when it comes to determining the market success of smartphones. This exclusive deal between Asus and AT&T could help Intel sell more mobile application processors. The ZenFone 2E is the most affordable (but still LTE-enabled version) version of the best-selling $299 ZenFone 2 . The ZenFone 2E has a solid build and still looks like the $299 version, but it comes with a less powerful CPU/GPU and less RAM/internal storage. The $120 price tag of the ZenFone 2E makes it the cheapest $100++ GoPhone handset from AT&T. It is much more affordable than the $180 Motorola Moto G GoPhone Edition and $171 LG ( OTC:LGEAF ) Xpression. Furthermore, the 5-inch AT&T GoPhone version uses the same dual-core 1.6 GHz Atom Z2560 processor, PowerVR SGX544MP GPU, and 1GB RAM as my old 7-inch Asus FonePad 7 phablet. The ZenFone 2E could also be a decent heavy-duty mobile gaming machine like the FonePad 7 is (which never overheats , even after 2 hours of continuous 3D gaming). The no-overheating-when-gaming feature is a distinguishing feature that could really help the ZenFone 2E perform better against other GoPhone handsets. The importance of the ZenFone 2E deal is that it could lead to AT&T also supporting the more expensive $199-299 variants of the Asus ZenFone 2. AT&T is a very prolific vendor of prepaid phones in the U.S. Asus remains the best friend of Intel when it comes to smartphone application processors. It is the first major OEM to release a SoFIA Atom X3-powered phablet for the global market. The $99.99 Asus ZenPad 7 is a 7-inch phablet with a 1.1 GHz quad-core Intel Atom x3-C3200 64-bit processor, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a Mali-450 MP4 GPU. The Asus ZenPad 7, like my FonePad 7, can serve as a dual-SIM mobile phone. The $100 ZenPad 7 will compete with extra-large ARM-based Android phones like Huawei's $320 MediaPad X1 and Acer's Iconia Tab 7 phablet. The very low price tag of the ZenPad 7 belies its decent hardware specs and excellent features. It actually has premium-like features, like a 8MP/2MP dual-camera system with Pixelmaster technology for great low-light photography. ZenPad 7 also touts DTS HD Cinematic surround audio and a Gorilla Glass 1 screen protection. I opine that If AT&T also starts selling its own variant of the $100 ZenTab 7, Intel-powered phablets might see stronger sales in America. In spite of the continuing decline in sales of tablets, more U.S. customers are actually buying/subscribing for cellular-enabled tablets. Cellular tablets or giant phablets have become the growth drivers for AT&T (and other U.S. carriers) this year. Due to weak demand for new phones, tablet sales accounted for all of AT&T's growth in Q2 2015, wherein the company achieved 600,000 postpaid cellular tablet subscriptions. During the same period, it lost 322,000 postpaid phone subscribers. My point is that larger phablets like the Intel-powered Asus ZenPad 7 are now the saving grace of the tablet industry. Unlike Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which still have a strong focus on selling WiFi-only tablets, Asus is smart enough to see that majority of consumers now favor the cellular tablet product. Asus is now the 4th-largest tablet vendor in Western Europe, but it is still an underappreciated brand in North America. It will be to the benefit of Intel if Asus also becomes the No. 4 tablet/phablet vendor in the U.S. Asus aims to sell 30 million ZenFone products this year. An AT&T-backed $120 ZenFone 2 with LTE and great gaming features should be attractive even to American buyers. Carrier backing is very important to Intel's future as regards mobile devices. Carrier support has helped LG Electronics become the 5th-largest vendor of smartphones in America, with 8% market share. Unfortunately, LG has yet to make a serious effort towards using Intel Atom CPUs inside its tablets or smartphone products. AT&T's support for an Intel-powered smartphone could go a long way in helping Asus penetrate the U.S. market. LG-branded phones are being distributed by the four largest carriers in America. Mr. Shih ought to outmaneuver LG and persuade the rivals of AT&T to also carry the ZenFone and ZenPad devices. The Asus-AT&T deal is another good reason why we all should keep our faith on Intel.
