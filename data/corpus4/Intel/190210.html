Why The Surface Signifies A Bright Future For Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's Surface now finds itself in a position of being at the forefront of laptop-tablet hybrid technology, with even Apple drawing design cues from them. Their strong position in the market regarding the new market for laptop-tablet hybrids will yield handsomely as the market comes to age. The innovation and design elements that went into the Surface tablet could signify a promising future for a new age of Microsoft innovative design, and consequently, sales. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has come a long way from being regarded as boring, and thought to constantly churn out slow, old, and unreliable products. Since 2009, they have rebounded not only in share price post-2008 crisis, but also quality of product. When they released Windows 7 to remedy much of the negativity Vista brought to the overall perception of Windows and Microsoft during July 22 of that year, they started their turnaround. The stock has more than doubled. Now, of course, we have been in a strong bull market since that time, but we should try to give credit where it's due, and Microsoft certainly deserves some. To me, they have been changing up the overall quality and form of their products, placing much more emphasis on design and user experience. Of course, they are still far from perfect, but it seems like what they are doing is paying off. Instead of being the boring company known to only cater toward boring corporate environments, they have actually been releasing cool stuff in recent years; things I could imagine people really wanting. Most notable recently is the Microsoft Surface line of laptop-tablet hybrids. I mean, it can't be denied. The thing is sexy. Unlike past iterations of Microsoft "innovation", such as the laughable Zune, this finally is something that is cool, useful, and something I can imagine much of the tech world actually using. But I think the Surface is not just a product line that Microsoft released which finally works. It signifies a bright new era of competitive Microsoft design, sales, and a strong position in a new form-factor of technology. As the Surface continues to cement itself as a worthy and formidable piece of hardware, investors may want to consider opening a position in Microsoft reap the various benefits it will bring. I can't believe I'm saying it myself, either. Microsoft, being "hip" and emulated by others? It seemed like it would never come. But that time, finally, truly has, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announcing the new iPad pro with strikingly similar hardware additions, such as the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. They both serve identical functions as the Surface Keyboard Cover and Pen, respectively. And in a way, the fact that Apple is going to release an addition to their iPad line which so closely resembles the Surface actually validates Microsoft's design philosophy. An interview with Ralf Groene, Microsoft's senior creative director and the lead designer of their surface, captures the essence of their motif very well. He says, We have people from very different flavors, people who are like classic and industrial designers, material designers, people with fashion design backgrounds, 3D modelers and it's a very diverse team. Quality does not only look it also sounds and feels. When you touch a keyboard and you hover with the Surface about a half an inch over it, it finds its home and it 'clicks' in. And the sound is the result of high quality parts 'clicking' together." He seems very knowledgeable and pragmatic about what it takes to create a beautifully designed product, and I really found it interesting how similar his description of "quality" is very similar to many of past Jony Ive's interviews when describing his respective Apple-designed products. Nonetheless, Groene has gotten other things right as well. In fact, in 2010 he was an instrumental key in releasing the Microsoft Arc Mouse, an accessory which has gained critical acclaim for its functional, lightweight, travel-friendly and minimalist design. All in all, when a company as well known and respected for its design such as Apple finds itself actually following in the path of Microsoft and adopting an important part of their form function towards their own product, it only speaks good things about what Microsoft has accomplished with the Surface, and hopefully what their design team can accomplish in the future. One of the core reasons behind Apple's recent success has been their impeccable design language, and the Surface has shown me that Microsoft is capable of achieving that as well. Microsoft will then be able to consequently reap similar rewards. The laptop-tablet hybrid market is catching on, and Microsoft is positioned well According to Eric Smith and Peter King, analysts at Strategy Analytics, in their August 13 report , By 2012, 2-in-1 Tablet growth will show a five-year compound average growth rate (C.A.G.R.) of 57 percent while Slate Tablet growth will amount to a 2 percent five-year C.A.G.R. Microsoft has legitimized the Windows-based Tablet with the Surface Pro 3 and the lower-cost Surface 3; in combination with the boom in 2-in-1 Tablet sales, Windows Tablet market share will reach 10% by the end of 2015." 2-in-1 tablets are expected to continually outpace tablet growth of a slate form factor in the near future. And the Surface will be able to take full advantage of this. Tablet and Touchscreen Strategies Service Director Peter King believes, The timing could not be better for 2-in-1 Tablets as Windows 10 makes the multi-mode computing experience smoother, Intel's Skylake processors hit the market at the end of 2015, and Windows Tablets have become more cost competitive with Android Tablets. Windows provides a familiar environment for traditional PC vendors to compete in the Tablet market and also gives CIOS a higher level of comfort when considering higher-end Tablets in the commercial setting." Basically, as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) hopefully continuously improves the power-cost and performance of their processors, hybrid tablets like the Surface will become increasingly more viable as a result. Because they are already running a familiar operating system for many enterprises, if they end up considering a newer tablet to further modernize their workflow, and I bet they will, then the Surface will be their first pick. If the Surface is the first choice for the rapidly growing amount of enterprises that will choose to eventually purchase 2-in-1 tablets, one can be sure that Microsoft will be in a formidable position in the market. Better design and the Surface means there will be better future sales for Microsoft in the future According to the aforementioned Ralf Groene, Microsoft's senior creative director, the future of the Surface will be similar to how the Volkswagen Golf attained stunning success. The Golf was initially loathed, but as people came to understand its utility (it was a hatchback) and versatility (you could fold the back seats down and expand the storage space), they grew to love it. And the Golf did indeed define a new car category." I think this will come true in the future. Although the Surface has not yet reached mass adoption and acclaim, it can do many things that people would feasibly need it for. Groene also says that Surface devices will continue to bridge the divide between personal and work, just as Windows does. They will continue to be premium devices, made of premium materials. They will be tools designed for getting the job done, not pure consumption devices, though people will of course also browse the Internet and perform other consumption activities too. Surface devices will continue to meet people's expectations-a USB port, for example, or video-out-even though these additions can hinder the purity of the design. They will continue to be designed to get out of the way and let the content that users are interacting with be the focus. Surface devices will also continue to focus on productivity. They will continue to work with a pen, and will continue to be very portable, to offer what Groene calls "schoolbagability." I agree with all of these principles that Microsoft aims to stick to, and it seems like their target market does too. It can't be denied; their numbers back it up. After their release of the Surface 3 and the Surface 3 Pro, their fantastic results have removed all doubt that the Surface is a potentially extremely lucrative product line that Microsoft should aim to further develop. In their recent Q4 results during the past July, Surface tablet revenues grew 117 percent to $888 million, driven by Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3, which were launched in June 2014 and May 2015, respectively. Full-year sales rose 65 percent to exceed $3.6 billion. In fiscal 2014, Surface sales hit $2.19 billion, up from 2013's less than $1 billion. Executive VP/chief financial officer Amy Hood said enterprise sales accelerated in the quarter and that Surface 3 sales were "particularly strong" to educational customers. "Our differentiated products, as well as improved discipline and execution, helped to improve gross margins by over $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal 15," she said. Said CEO Satya Nadella, "Surface is clearly a product where we've gotten the formula right, earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of our hardware portfolio." In their 10-K for their fiscal year of 2015, When considering that with the fact that Apple's iPad revenue fell 22% over the same time period, the strong growth and competition posed from the Surface is palpable. And this is all great, because although the Surface actually constitutes a relatively minor part of Microsoft's profits, increased outreach of it will bring consumers into the Microsoft ecosystem of software and cloud services. And those are huge profit generators. All in all, I think that the Surface shows a sign of a bright and positive future for Microsoft. I think that their design team really hit the ball out of the park with the creation of the Surface line of products, and I have little doubt that as time goes on it will gradually catch fire and attain mass outreach. The Surface is also an effective gateway for users to end up purchasing other Microsoft products such as Office 365 and of course, the Windows operating system. Therefore, it provides a strong catalyst for the case of stronger sales and outlook for Microsoft in the future in both company health and stock valuation.
