Tim Cook's Surprise Phone Call - Cramer's Mad Money (3/12/15) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 13, 2015  7:34 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , BA , CMG , CMG.B , ED , INTC , MAR , PXD by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Thursday, March 12. Cramer started the show by talking about the last 10 years he spent in educating investors. Commenting on the movement on Thursday, he said that investors have been gripped with currency fears. The fear is so much, that weak retail numbers prompted investors to buy, as they thought that weak numbers will discourage the Fed from raising interest rates. Even if the Fed gets it wrong and raises the rates, the market could see a 5-7% decline. He added that the Euro finally showed some strength against the dollar. When Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) gave a weak pre-announcement, the market ignored that news too and still went higher. This shocked Cramer. CEO interview - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple's CEO Tim Cook called in as a viewer to surprise Cramer on the 10th anniversary. Cook spoke about how the research kit is changing the way people look at healthcare, and almost 11,000 people have signed up with Apple for a cardiovascular study. Cook also commented on Apple Pay, mentioning that over 700,000 locations have started accepting it. As Cramer always talks about owning Apple and not trading it, Cook reminded how Apple has created immense wealth for shareholders. Cook said that innovation is at the center of the company. He agreed with Cramer that the future will be about connected devices, but healthcare is the most understated market and it is a big opportunity for Apple. Cramer said that we are in the middle of an aerospace cycle and the airlines are flush with cash on the back of lower oil price. He interviewed CEO James McNerney of Boeing to hear his views on the aerospace sector. "You have got to have a 20-year perspective on the market," said McNerney. He added, "the people that we compete with who don't take that long view; they don't satisfy customers as well. You have got a 25-year relationship with the customer after you sell them stuff." McNerney said he is not worried about people who think Boeing will not do well. He said, "We are going to win." He also mentioned the value Boeing has created for shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Commenting on production, he said, "Yes. We have doubled our production in the last five years. We are going to take it up another 30% over the next four years. Those plans are baked." Cramer asked the CEO if people would not want to buy efficient planes if the cost of oil keeps declining. McNerney answered in the negative saying, "I suppose you could talk yourself into them not needing fuel efficient planes if the price of oil was zero. Then I would buy that. But the facts are that a fifth of the outlay is for the new plane, and four-fifths is living with that plane for 20 years. The efficiency at almost any oil price really pays back for these guys." CEO interview - Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG ) The stock of Chipotle has run too much and many think that they have missed the boat. Cramer however thinks that the stock has a lot of life left in it and is still a long-term buy. He interviewed Co-CEO Montgomery Moran to find out more about the prospects of the company. Moran said that Chipotle's team are the reason for the company's success. He said that Chipotle does the right thing, picks the best tasting ingredients, and a team that believe in the mission of the company. This combination produces a good experience for the customers. He also mentioned the company's integrity and the decision to cut out a supplier who did not follow the company's protocol. Chipotle took a loss for that but they are more inclined to serve quality food. "We want our customers to know that we care more about where our food comes from than they probably do," he added. Consolidated Edison (NYSE: ED ): Cramer advised against buying this stock. Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR ): Cramer likes the stock and thinks that Marriott is a strong franchise. Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD ): Although Cramer thinks Pioneer is a great company, he cannot recommend it till oil comes back to $70.
