Does AMD Have A Viable Server Strategy? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Aug.  9, 2015 10:12 PM ET  |  About: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) , Includes: ALTR , INTC , QCOM , SSNLF , XLNX by: Alex Cho Rumors are surfacing of an AMD-branded FPGA. The design seems legitimate. However the FPGPA space is competitive, and it's highly unlikely that AMD will design a competitive chip to Altera or Xilinx. On the bright side, AMD seems to be making solid progress toward a 14-nm Zen family Opteron. If they can fit in both an architectural and node improvement, the CPU may keep up with Skylake performance wise. However, there have been numerous cases where AMD promises big but delivers nothing. Therefore, my primary buy case is based on a scenario in which AMD is acquired. A new rumor made the rounds, but this time I'm not exactly certain if it will help AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) shareholders much. According to IT World, reports are surfacing of AMD developing an FPGA, which is basically a field programmable array. It's sort of like an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in that the hardware development language is optimized to run certain lines of code more efficiently in comparison to a general purpose CPU. Furthermore an FPGA can be altered or "re-programmed," which optimizes the FPGA for a different set of algorithms, thus making the FPGA more multi-faceted in comparison to an ASIC. The problem I see with AMD attempting to enter into the FPGA market is the sheer competition and the ongoing consolidation of various semiconductors in the space. With Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) acquiring Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), it's only going to be a matter of time before Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) is then acquired by a different company, presumably Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) or Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). Therefore, AMD's efforts may amount to little more than "feel good" PR. Following the rumors of AMD's FPGA, the stock hasn't really reacted by much. The real upside to owning AMD doesn't really come from the products but whether a suitable acquirer will emerge. Altera's FPGAs, i.e. the Stratix 10, is going to be in volume production at 14nm. The Stratix 10 is the latest FPGA from Altera. And quite frankly, the performance of the Stratix 10 has improved quite considerably as the company mentions that it's the densest and most powerful FPGA they have designed yet. They've included more hyper registers into the routing elements to reduce the routing delay, and it will also have 5.5 million logic elements, which make it the densest and largest single chip package. Therefore, I'm not completely convinced in AMD's strategy to develop a FPGA. Perhaps, they're simply doing this out of desperation. After all, Intel's upcoming platform dubbed Purley will integrate FPGAs, Co-CPUs and CPUs into a single motherboard. The memory transfer rates, i.e. the bandwidth will also improve to accommodate for faster SSDs and 3D XPoint. This makes Intel's upcoming server platform the most comprehensive yet. AMD on the other hand has continued to slide in the server CPU space as the market share has declined into single digits. At this point, it's fair to assume that various vendors won't integrate Opterons even if a competitive FPGA were to emerge as the performance likely won't be on par with Intel's fully integrated platform, which comes with more bells and whistles than what AMD can hope to put together in a two- to three-year timeframe. On the bright side AMD's upcoming Zen-based Opterons are projected to gain a 40% performance improvement due to support for DDR4 memory, simultaneous multi-threading and also will include a high-bandwidth, low-latency cache system. The performance of the chip should improve, but I'm not exactly certain if it will catch up to Skylake. The Zen-based Opterons are expected to launch sometime in 2016, whereas Intel Skylake also will be released in 2016. My guess? Intel will release Skylake in the first half of 2016, whereas AMD will release Zen in the second half of 2016. It will take at least six months for AMD to build up a reasonable level of inventory and make architectural improvements in the tight time frame. AMD might keep-up with Intel in the server space on the CPU front, but reaching into FPGAs could be somewhat of a stretch given AMD's limited budget for R&D. I'm reiterating my buy recommendation on AMD, but that's only driven by broader industry consolidation. If AMD gets bought out, the stock will move by 25% to 75% in a short period of time. Therefore, buying low and selling high will likely work in this specific instance. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
