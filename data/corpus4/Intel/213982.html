Intel's Data Center Growth To Drive The Stock Significantly Higher - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel expects its annual data center group revenue growth will remain soft due to weaker than expected macro environment. I expect the company’s data center group revenue will grow at a CAGR in the high teens in the next five years. This will act as a huge boost for the company’s stock price, which could rise as much as 40% from the current level. In the just-reported third quarter, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) data center revenue grew 12% year-over-year, compared to 25% in the same quarter last year. However, the company now expects annual growth rate for data center and Internet of Things businesses will remain soft due to weaker macroeconomic environment. Intel's chief financial officer Stacy Smith said : Both the data center and 'Internet of Things' businesses will also exhibit strong growth. But the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower than expectations at the beginning of the year as a result of weaker-than-expected macroeconomic growth. We now expect the data center business to grow in the low-double-digits versus the prior forecast of approximately 15 percent. Anyways, I believe this is temporary and in the long run, i.e. the next five years, Intel's data center revenue will grow at a much faster pace. I expect Intel's share price to remain range-bound in the near term, and going into 2016 it will break out on the upside. I started buying Intel's shares post the third quarter earnings after exiting positions almost a year ago. I am planning to accumulate more shares during the rest of this year. Intel's primary growth driver: data center and cloud Smith noted that although the enterprise segment remained weak during the third quarter, the cloud segment was stronger than expected. Both data center and cloud businesses will fuel Intel's next round of growth. Intel expects that cloud adoption has tremendous room to grow from where it stands today (more about this later). The data center group (DCG) currently contributes less than 30% to the chipmaker's overall revenue, which could rise substantially in the next two years. Reuters recently reported , "The data center group comprised about 29 percent of the company's total revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Analysts expect the business to account for about 40 percent of the total by 2017." In the following section I will focus on how the company is preparing to grow its DCG revenue. A new report suggests that rising demand for data storage space coupled with the green data center initiative undertaken by several governments will ignite the global data center market to grow at a CAGR of 26.44% from $23.41 billion in 2014 to $95.66 billion in 2020. Intel is undoubtedly in the best position to benefit from this emerging trend, compared to other server chipmakers. In server terms, green data centers need chips with improved performance per watt ratios so that a given operating temperature could be maintained with less cooling efforts. Intel's introduction of Broadwell-based Xeon D SoC earlier this year is a tremendous achievement in this direction. AnandTech's Johan De Gelas, one of the most respected CPU experts, wrote about the Xeon D-1540: If you only look at the integer performance of a single Broadwell core, the improvement over the Haswell based core is close to boring. But the fact that Intel was able to combine 8 of them together with dual 10 Gbit, 4 USB 3.0 controllers, 6 SATA 3 controller and quite a bit more inside a SoC that needs less than 45 W makes it an amazing product. In fact we have not seen such massive improvements from one Intel generation to another since the launch of the Xeon 5500. The performance per watt of a Xeon D-1540 is 50% better than the Haswell based E3 (Xeon E3-1230L). Gelas expects that Intel will further improve the Xeon D line. Intel's recent acquisition of Altera will help the chipmaker improve not only the Xeon D line, but its entire range of data center chips. Altera is a server FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) maker, which is primarily used in networking and storage systems. Intel will incorporate Altera's technology into its server chips. As a result, the chips will become much more technologically advanced, leaving competitors' chips far behind. Clearly Intel is creating an unbeatable product line for tomorrow's data centers, and at the same time it is also creating a wide moat around its server chip business. I believe even if the macro environment doesn't improve significantly going forward, Intel would still be able to grow its data center revenue at a significant pace. In the worst case scenario, I expect the company's DCG compounded annual growth rate will hover around the current level of low double-digits. My base case is a CAGR in the high teens in the next five years. What would support the base case scenario? In order to grow revenue in high teens on a sustainable basis, developing products with advanced features, as mentioned above, isn't enough. Aside from developing an advanced product line, creating a market for the products is also very important. Intel's initiative of building a cloud infrastructure that would be able to take advantage of its future chips is very impressive, which I expect will support the base case scenario. I mentioned above that Intel expects that cloud adoption has tremendous room for growth from today's levels. Diane Bryant, senior VP and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, said that today half of the world's applications run on cloud infrastructure, and 85% of them will run in the cloud by 2020. As a part of the company's cloud infrastructure building initiative, Intel has joined hands with Rackspace Hosting (NYSE: RAX ) for creating an OpenStack Innovation Center at the Rackspace headquarters in San Antonio, where they will offer developers the opportunity to test and validate OpenStack code. "There will be a continued stream of investments that we will be making," Bryant said. Intel's DCG revenue was $4.1 billion in the third quarter. For full-year 2015, the company's DCG revenue should be around $16.3 billion. A CAGR growth of 18% will drive Intel's DCG revenue to $22.7 billion in 2017. If this represents 40% of the company's total revenue, as per analysts' expectations, the company's total revenue for 2017 should be around $57 billion, or $12 per share. With huge room for DCG revenue expansion in the subsequent years, I'll be comfortable with a price to sales multiple of 4x for Intel's stock, which will result in $48 per share in the next two years, a gain of almost 40% from the current level.
