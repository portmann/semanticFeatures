Apple Watch: Epic Dud? | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Smart money continues to maintain allocations or accumulate positions.

With Apple Watches still on back-order ( due to defective supply, not abundant demand ) and the sell-side confused as to whether it will be a great success (Morgan Stanley's exuberant extrapolation of Google searches) or a damp squib ( KGI cut estimates on demand slowing ), the latest projections from Slice Intelligence suggest things are definitely going so well for the world's largest gadget-maker. Things have tailed off dramatically... averaging under 30k per day being ordered (according to Slice Intelligence projections) Apple has taken orders for almost 2.5 million watches in the US through Monday, May 18, according to Slice’s projections, which are based on more than 14,000 online shoppers. More than half of those orders were placed on April 10, the first day Apple accepted watch pre-orders in the US and eight other countries, according to Slice. Perhaps, The Daily Mash's satirically-conjured man's perspective of his first day wearing the device is closer to home after all... He said: “I had it all planned out – not saying anything about it, but then somebody just notices and goes ‘is that the new Apple Watch?’. I would respond simply with a wry Clooney-esque smile and they would mouth the word ‘awesome’. “I explained that it was the brand new Apple Watch and they went ‘HAHAHA’ in a really deliberately hurtful way. The accounts assistant said it was the opposite of a fanny magnet and everyone cracked up. “Then everyone started pretending to talk into their watches, saying things like ‘come in KITT, I am a massive tosser, please help’.” By 10am Logan had removed the watch. He explained: “It wasn’t because people were being sarcastic, I just had a hot wrist, everyone gets a hot wrist sometimes.

I literally feel like Cartman tasting the tears of unfathomable sadness. Fri, 05/22/2015 - 17:49 | 6122994 James_Cole Aapl watch has quickly become highly irritating, talking to someone constantly glancing down at their phone is bad enough.. but glancing at wrist constantly, then fuckin with watch, then using phone to reply? Madness. Iâ€™m a big aapl fan but I hope this fails, I'm over the watch.  Fri, 05/22/2015 - 18:10 | 6123047 negative rates Fri, 05/22/2015 - 18:13 | 6123053 Say What Again Don't you love it when you're at a concert, getting into the groove, and the A$$h0le in front of you holds up his phone and watches the entire show through the 2" x 3" screen, so you can't even see the stage?!?!?  What should we do to these people? Fri, 05/22/2015 - 18:32 | 6123109 RafterManFMJ Well from what I've seen the screen stays off to conserve power until you raise your wrist to your eyes to read it.  It takes a second or so to come to life, where my Ecodrive has the information I need, instantly. Secondly, if it's not powered up it looks like you've got a black shiny square on your wrist.  Where's the fun, the appeal, of that? If you want to burn some cash on a tech watch that may prove useful, look at the fenix 3 sapphire.

Fri, 05/22/2015 - 18:31 | 6123108 Pet Rock Apple is one bad fad away from being the red headed step child of technology once again... And unless Steve Jobs froze his brain and they can figure out some way to bring him back it will be the final chapter of Apple...  Apple will be remembered as nothing more than a technological experiment in socialism.  Without an effective dictator telling people what to do - it all falls apart...

Paired with the Apple Watch, the rechargeable HD monocle, tentatively named the i<eye>, will be available in 3 models, Basic, Sport and the solid platinum Elite version. Accessory products will include fashion forward alternate eye patches to enhance the viewing experience. Early reports, however have indicated the new product has a limited battery life and a possible propensity for eye burn.

I just happened to catch a small story on one of those stupid daytime talk shows while waiting for my sandwich at lunch today. Someone is making a line of purses with Li-Ion bats inside so that women can charge their "devices" while on the go.

This is an early version.  Maybe bond and day traders don't necessarily understand tech stocks, huh? Right now it is priced to high for what it can actually do. Second>third gen will be a different story. Particularly  {my interest} micro holographic tech. What if your watch projected a head and neck image of the person you're talking to? Right now...  yea youre looking at an early peak.  Still, tech stocks are relative to other tech stocks.  Apl remains better positioned than just about everyone.  Lots to like about HTC too.  Samsung keeps being the most inventive in a lot of ways - but is giving people options they dont give much of a fuck about. https://medium.com/@paulcanetti/why-you-are-wrong-about-apple-watch-not-... I'd love to compare and contrast gains in the tech sector over the past 5 years with you unremittingly ignorant twats. Speak for yourself. Not anyone else.

Fri, 05/22/2015 - 17:21 | 6122914 economessed The new Garmin 225 seems to be a purpose-built watch that a serious runner will find value in.  Apple seemed to have built their gadget in search of a purpose. Fri, 05/22/2015 - 17:22 | 6122915 Bangin7GramRocks But if it was a new company named ABC Watch Inc. and they sold 2.5 million watches with an average price of $500, the company would be a Wall Street darling and worth $50 billion instantly. Let's have just a little perspective people. Serious question; why do people hate Apple so much? Actually interested. They make high quality products that people enjoy. Why so much hate? Should we start with their obnoxious self-aggrandizing attitude? Maybe their history of stealing everything they could get using their "my pockets are deeper than yours" legal strategy? How about their bought-and-paid-for political lobby protecting their anti-trust violations on selling their OS? Could their policy of making you pay mega-bucks for their proprietary hardware using old-fashioned Intel technology that should sell for half the price (but the desparate-for-attention-nerds will pay anything to tell themselves they are the superior beings on the planet), and making obsolete every piece of software you own useles when OSX came out? I got it - think it might be their ties to Google and the NSA? But I think the biggest reason is the arrogance of their product owners. They are the biggest bunch of self-righteous jerks on the planet with their better-and-more-intelligent-than-God attitude.
