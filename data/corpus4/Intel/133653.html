What The Intel-Micron Memory Chip Means - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Intel and Micron are drawing ever closer, and a merger may be in their future. The problem is Moore's Second Law, rising production costs driving down design profits. The announcement by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) of a 3D memory chip architecture drew a lot of hype this week. The 3DXPoint technology, dubbed Crosspoint, is more durable and faster than typical flash memory, and will retain data after being powered off. Intel and Micron have worked on designs for years, and the significance of the new announcement is that it draws them even closer together. Both stocks have been languishing this year. Intel is down 20% and Micron a whopping 41%. Both are being crippled by what I call "Moore's Second Law" - the notion that as chips get more complex the costs of producing them go up, and at the same rate. The technology has been teased for some years but samples are due to be released later this year, probably to data center operators like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to boost server performance. Still, Micron is in trouble. There's an oversupply of standard dynamic random access memory or DRAM right now , and the company remains vulnerable to a Chinese government takeover bid that would not go over well at all in conservative Idaho. Intel also is in trouble. The costs of producing microprocessors are dragging it down. It must justify the cost of new, ever-more expensive machinery on its own products, but buyers are no longer buying its multi-year roadmaps for new chip designs, preferring to have them customized and then custom produced. The foundry and design businesses are drifting ever-further apart. There is only one logical move to make in response to this, and it's one that Intel has stubbornly resisted. That is, a break-up of the company into two units, one design and one manufacturing. The whole may be kept out of Chinese hands by combining it with Micron's own manufacturing operations, so the first step in the process would involve Intel acquiring Micron. It's a doable deal. Micron has a market cap of $22 billion, Intel a market cap of $137 billion. Intel has just $12 billion in debt on $90 billion in assets - extraordinarily low for a chip foundry company - and could easily do a cash-and-stock deal based on the nearly $14 billion of cash and short-term securities it has on hand. The spin-off would leave all intellectual property in the hands of the design companies - that's the one you want to buy - while the foundry could load up on debt to make its balance sheet look more like that of rival Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ), which has a debt-to-asset ratio of about 20%. The Micron acquisition, and the foundry spin-off, would doubtless go through U.S. antitrust scrutiny, lasting as much as two years, during which it could be emphasized that the technology of chip production is vital to national security, which should keep China's hands off it, at least for a time. In time Intel lobbyists, and those from other tech companies, could say it may prove vital for the U.S. government itself to take a stake in the new production company in order to keep China away from it permanently, but that's another story we'll talk about another time. For now, expect a big boost in Micron on Intel takeover rumors, followed by a big boost in Intel following split-up rumors. Be prepared to sell Micron at the announcement for a profit and then take another look at the details before considering another move into Intel.
