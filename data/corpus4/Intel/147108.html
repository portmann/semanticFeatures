Rotten Apple: Former Leader Breaking Down | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! For 6 Â½ long years, we have been bombarded with the mythology known as â€œthe U.S. economic recoveryâ€? by the mainstream media.  Imagine running a rink company at the end of the roller skating fad in the 1980's. You know it is not going to survive for long. How do you operate your business? You milk it. Well, that's now... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! This is just a quick-hitter post on another former leader that is breaking down. As we have mentioned several times – in particular on July 22 and August 5 – the ever-thinning stock market rally is starting to lose the relatively few leaders still keeping it afloat. That July post noted the relative weakness in the equal-weight Nasdaq 100, even as the cap-weighted index remained near its highs. One reason was the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL), the largest stock in the index, and the entire U.S. market. When AAPL is moving higher, it can mask a lot of problems in the broader market. Unfortunately for bulls, AAPL is beginning to crack. It began on the day of the July post when it got crushed following its earnings release. It has since broken down more, recently dropping below its post-2009 UP trendline. As the chart indicates, we are using a logarithmic scale. AAPL prices held the trendline in 2013 and 2014 but broke below just last week. Yesterday, the stock tried to retake the trendline – but it failed miserably, losing over 5% today. For a market reasonably close to its 52-week high that has exhibited an almost unprecedented deterioration in breadth, it can ill-afford to lose the few leaders it has left – especially one rotten apple that just so happens to be the largest stock in the world.

Maybe apple should focus on R&D instead of social engineering and bending to the street.

Wed, 08/12/2015 - 09:05 | 6417853 B2u This is awesome.  I laugh at all the Apple lemmings.  AAPL was a great company with Steve Jobs but he is gone and the current CEO is nothing compared with Jobs. Its a music playing breast implant, developed after market research found women were tired of men just staring at their tits and not listening to them.

Unreal! Fundies, big banks, 95% of all â€œinvestorsâ€?, piling into AAPL; all gonna get rich as the stock goes to infinity and beyond! â€œHow goes Apple, so goes the markets and the entire world! A really sad commentary on humanityâ€¦totally driven by greed.  But, get them fearful and they will run like rats leaving a sinking ship. The Fed bankers know all this and that is why it is so important to talk happy talk all the time, â€œEconomic recovery is strong thanks to our QE!â€? â€œWe are your heroes! We saved all you little peopleâ€¦buy stocks! Warren is!â€?  There is no way out of this. Demand was driven forward again by loose credit. The lemmings obeyed and borrowed and bought crap from China. Finally, they are all tapped out, and the plunge begins (again). Millions of immigrants will accelerate the final collapse, not help prevent it. We are Greece, just a few years or months behind it. Free healthcare for all! Including illegals! Entitlements galore! Come get your EBT cards! Why work? Wouldn't that lower the cost of every thing it sells outside of China  and have little impact on the stuff it both makes and sells in China.

(Sounds like a Cadillac commericial). Maybe they can get Trace Adkins to do the voice over: "APPLE TOUGH"!
