AMD: This Intel Ankle-Biter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD’s new focus could lead to huge price gains by the end of 2017. AMD’s management team is concentrating on just a few profitable areas. The AMD-Intel performance gap is about to shrink substantially. On May 6, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) had an investors' day conference where it outlined its future direction for products and sales. During this presentation, it made several points that I think will lead to a bright and profitable future. In recent weeks, AMD's stock price has dropped to about $2.30/share giving it a market cap of only $1.8 billion. That's barely 1% of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) $155 billion market cap. In this article, I will review what was presented and why it will result in a whole new AMD in the next 2-3 years. I will also explain how this new concentrated focus should lead to substantial profits. 1. It is important to see what AMD is not going to do as well as what it is going to do. During this presentation, AMD CEO Lisa Su presented a 22-page outline of AMD's future plans. Page 12 was perhaps the most interesting in telling us in no uncertain terms what AMD was not going to invest in. As the following chart shows, AMD will be avoiding all the low-margin products that might look good for sales but not for profits. I agree 100%. Mark Papermaster is AMD's Chief Technology Officer, formerly from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). He outlined the three technical areas AMD will be concentrating on: x86 CPU cores or Zen, ARM cores or K12 (2017), and graphics enhancement. By far the most important one to my way of thinking is Zen, an all new x86 CPU that will be produced on 14nm FinFET just like Intel's Skylake, although it will probably be at least a year behind. The point is that AMD does not need to beat Intel with Zen, it only needs to narrow the performance gap and it will certainly do that. The key clause is this one: "Energy-efficient FinFET design scales from client to enterprise-class products." 3. Next up was Forrest Norrod, the General Manager of Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-custom Business Group. Norrod's group is the non-PC part of the business and within that the most important part is the enterprise. That's where the big margins are and where a lot of energy and dollars will be spent (I hope anyway). With Zen (and to a lesser extent K12 ARM in 2017), AMD will once more be able to challenge Intel's death grip on the data center business. 4. Last but not least was the presentation of CFO Devinder Kumar who had the difficult job of explaining how AMD is going to manage its limited cash flow over the next few years. The best point for me was Kumar saying any excess cash over $1 billion would be used to pay down debt, although there's none due until 2019. I also was surprised to see that in spite of all of AMD's myriad problems EBITDA has actually increased over the last three years. That's a very positive point. I highly recommend viewing all of the presentations from AMD's website ( here ). There's always a certain amount of song and tap dancing at these events but overall I thought it was well done. It is obvious that under new management there's an increase in focus and discipline. Product lines have been narrowed and priorities have been assigned. I'm fairly confident that the highest priority is the Zen development. This is the product that will drive profits and cash flow to new heights. Zen is designed to compete directly with the near-monopoly status of the Intel x86 product line both desktop and server. By producing it on a 14nm FinFET process, it will be AMD's first competitive CPU since perhaps the Athlon 64. Will it compete with Intel's highest performing products? I don't know - maybe not - but it will be competitive over a huge swath of what was formerly unassailable Intel country. Whereas right now AMD competes only in the bottom 20% or so of the desktop line Zen will conceivably make it competitive over the bottom 80% and maybe even higher. And in the server area it does not have any competitive product right now so it will certainly have access to a much higher percentage of enterprise sales than it does now. And believe me OEMs and other big CPU customers cannot wait to see Intel get some competition. Competition will drive prices down across the line so OEMs will be buying AMD's Zen products whenever and for whatever product they can. Even if desktop sales are flat or down slightly overall, I predict that AMD and Zen will increase AMD's market share. So how much of the x86 market will AMD need to be successful? Well, consider the fact that in 2014 $49.1 billion ($34.7 billion from PC Client and $14.4 billion from Datacenter ) of Intel's $55 billion revenue came from legacy x86 products. That's right, Intel is basically an x86 shop - it makes huge gross margins and almost all of its profits from the legacy x86 line. So if we assume Intel x86 sales go from $47 billion to $55 billion in 2017 and AMD only picks up a very modest 4% share from Intel, we are looking at $2.2 billion in incremental sales. For a small cap $5 billion revenue business like AMD that's a very large sales increase and a hardly noticeable sales loss for a behemoth like Intel. As the much smaller player in the x86 duopoly, AMD stands to benefit enormously by an enhanced competitive product like Zen. The following chart is somewhat conservative. It assumes only $7.5 billion in revenue in 2017 which allows for a $200 million loss in revenue from non-x86 products. The gross margin from CFO Kumar's presentation was from 36% to 40% so I used 36, 38 and 40. The SGA is 26% the lower end of Kumar's 26% to 30% because AMD has been very disciplined in the SGA area. AMD's decade-long problem has been execution and that is the biggest risk. It just does not deliver the products as described on time. 2017 is a long way away and cash flow could be a big problem between now and then if legacy products can't generate enough sales and/or margin to keep them cash flow positive. Take-or-pay contracts with Global Foundries could bite them like they did in 2012 when they had to pay $273 million. TSMC's (or a different contractor's) 14nm FinFET process does not produce a high enough yield to deliver Zen products in quantity. Sometimes we forget that AMD is a bit-player in the x86 CPU market. But it is a very profitable duopoly, though, right now only profitable for the big player Intel. Because of the distorted market shares the little guy can greatly improve the outcome by picking up just a small piece of the big guy's market. Zen is a product that can do that. At the current price of about $2.30, you should look at AMD as a long-term LEAP without an expiration date. The other advantage is AMD's price in 2017 is uncorrelated to the market and could be used as a hedge on a market downturn between now and then. On the other hand, nothing new or exciting is going to show up until at least the fourth quarter so you could probably wait until then to make an investment.
