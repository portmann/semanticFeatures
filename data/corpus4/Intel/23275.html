Prepare To Buy Intel Ahead Of Its Developer Forum In China - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel developer forums are used by Intel to announce new innovations that are likely to increase earnings over time. China's importance to the growth of Intel is increasing as the company's partners in China and the Chinese consumer market expands. Twice a year Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) puts on a developer forum to share with developers the latest road map to Intel technology. Intel encourages partners to develop new products using the latest Intel innovations. Often the information shared at these developer forums leads to insights into how Intel stock will perform over the next few months. The developer forum in the spring is held in Asia, often in China. The second and larger IDF is held in San Francisco in August/September. On April 8 and 9 the IDF will be held in Shenzhen, China. I was told that international press for the Shenzhen event was limited to ten spots so I do not expect a lot of coverage of this event outside of Asia. The keynote presentations will be available on Intel's website . Not many people are aware of the Shezhen event. The event presentations provide a unique advantage to astute investors by providing information not widely available to the public about new Intel products. Presentations with Valuable Insights Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO since 2013, will start with an overview of Intel's vision and strategy for the future of computing. Brian will likely focus on the big three: data centers (IoT and Big Data Analytics), 14nm/Skylake (including wireless docking and charging and Real Sense uses) and SOCs (low power applications from data center to smartphones) . Doug Fisher, General Manager of Intel's Software and Services Group will likely layout how China is the cornerstone of software innovation and collaboration with a focus on Intel's efforts to partner with Chinese companies to develop and implement software and services focused on the needs of China and products developed in partnership with Chinese companies. During the second day, Kirk Skaugen, General Manager of Intel's Client Computing Group will likely focus on China as the heart of Intel's PC, tablet and smartphone innovation in technology that better meets peoples needs for easy, low power, and lower cost. I expect to hear Kirk talk about the new releases coming from Intel in 2015 with a focus on products coming out of Intel's partnerships in China. These partnerships will play a key role in producing and selling PCs, tablets and smartphones with Intel inside. A focus will likely be on how these partnerships will reverse the sales slump in PCs that resulted in the recently revised downward Intel first quarter guidance due to slower than anticipated business desktop sales. will likely provide a presentation on how the future of data center development will be software defined. Opportunities for meeting the huge demand for processing, storage and communications associated with another 2 billion interconnections in 2015 will likely be described. Diane will likely continue to layout how Intel products are now available to help, with Chinese partners, meet all data center needs including processing, storage and communications. Finally, Doug Davis, General Manager of Intel's Internet of Things Group will focus on how Intel will work with its Chinese partners to connect and use 35 billion IoT devices in the next five years. IoT is a huge area for Intel to partner with numerous Chinese companies to develop and implement new technological innovations to better meet the needs of humanity. Recently Intel stock slumped with their revised guidance for the first quarter. Then the stock popped with news of a possible acquisition of Altera . The stock has generally been moving lower for the last three months. With positive news the stock moves higher indicating strong resiliency. The market is anxiously looking for more good information about Intel. Once this positive information is discovered by the analysts and public, buyers will swoop in and buy Intel stock sending the price higher. Quickly understanding the presentations included in the Shenzhen IDF will provide investors with a unique investing advantage. What each of the key speakers say will provides a basis for investing in Intel at the beginning of what is likely a long rise in stock price. Intel at the Shenzhen IDF15 will necessarily need to be cautious about focusing on Intel with an emphasis on working with Intel partners in China. However, Intel will provide information about Intel products to developers. This information will provide investors and analysts a basis that can be used to forecast a bright future for Intel during the rest of 2015. Information released at Shenzhen will lay the groundwork for clearer announcements at the Intel Q1 earnings conference call on April 14 and the Intel Annual Meeting on May 21. With IDF15 Shenzhen, Intel's Q1 call and Intel's annual meeting, good news will likely build showing a bright future for Intel during the last half of 2015. This growing body of good news will allow Intel stock price to continue to increase over the next few months in anticipation of increased earnings during the last half of 2015. Then in the last half of 2015, earnings will take over as the force driving Intel stock price higher. Don't wait for analysts to provide good news about Intel. Watch the Intel Shenzhen presentations yourself on April 8th and 9th and be prepared to buy Intel stock at currently low prices before Intel rises to beyond last year's $38/share price tag.
