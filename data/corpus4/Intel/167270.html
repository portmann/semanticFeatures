Will Intel Bankrupt AMD After All? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Intel's latest Skylake chips are a step ahead of last year's Broadwell, and no such response is found anywhere on AMD's roadmap. Many believe that Intel's innovation is on hiatus, but this is clearly false. AMD's lack of even remote competitiveness in the PC market is a big concern, especially for AMD's upcoming game changer, Zen, due next year. Thanks to last year's Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core M processors, notebooks could take a giant leap into ultra-thin form factors that were formerly exclusive to tablets. Although these chips took a step back in performance, speed enhancements over time let even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) adopt the chip in its new MacBook. The original MacBook Air revolutionized the notebook industry, including all of the Macs to follow, and I expect the same to occur with the new MacBook. Unfortunately, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) doesn't even remotely play a role in this evolution of form factors and is more absorbed in simply surviving on fumes. Expectedly, AMD has nothing of significance to compete with lately, but with former Apple chip experts Jim Keller and Raj Koduri now working for AMD (again), perhaps glory is just around the bend. But I'm still kind of curious - Does AMD have it in them? And if not, will Intel simply wipe them off the face of the semiconductor industry? Since AMD and Intel are the only x86 kids in town with the latter being far greater, it's clear why many believe Intel's innovation is lazily on hiatus, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The x86 PC market has been threatened by the rise of tablets and smartphones, and although it may only be AMD's intention to survive within this boundary, it's Intel's every intention to expand the architecture to thrive within the whole new generation of ultra-thin notebooks, tablets and smartphones. A few years ago, it was questionable whether or not it was possible. Even Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) decided on its own that the only way it could create a tablet PC was through an ARM-based OS. Thus came Windows 8 RT and the debut of the original Surface tablet running on an Nvidia-made (NASDAQ: NVDA ) ARM chip. Fast forward to today - ARM-based Windows has been trashed and Microsoft's Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3 both utilize Intel's painstaking efforts in creating ultra-thin form factors. According to Microsoft's recent earnings report, Surface Revenue grew by an outstanding 117% YOY thanks to the newest renditions, and with companies like Lenovo attempting to copy the Surface, we can only conclude that the tablet PC is here to stay. Last year, Broadwell's Core M was the evolution of x86 chips that even Apple was waiting for. It was the beginning of performance computing, ditching the fans to become passively cooled. Apple wasn't too interested in the first rendition of the Broadwell Core M due to the performance drawbacks that were made in order to achieve the design but after some speed enhancements, Apple happily obliged, using it for the ludicrously thin MacBook. Intel had succeeded. Apple didn't (or hasn't yet) gone to ARM and the x86 chip lives another generation. The story is very similar to the original MacBook and now all Intel has to do is improve performance and reduce power consumption, which is exactly what the latest Skylake's Core M is. On Intel's press release for the new Skylake processors, you will find that stats of the Core M are several times faster than several year-old systems, which is really meaningless. However, I did find in Gizmodo's writing that "Intel tells us that on average, you'll see 10% better performance, 30% better graphics performance, and an extra hour of battery life (while playing 1080P video) compared to last year's Broadwell chips." Aside from graphics, these enhancements are fairly ordinary. Some may see this as a chance for AMD, but AMD isn't even remotely present in this market. The only new presence that AMD has in the mobile market are the notebooks using its latest sixth generation Carrizo processors found within this list . Yes, all of those hunky notebooks are fatter, uglier, heavier and more expensive than Microsoft's Surface 3 tablet and roughly the cost of the Surface Pro 3 as well as the upcoming Lenovo Ideapad MIIX 700. The list appears to be growing, but I have no idea how anything there will sell, and if nothing sells, how will AMD launch its extremely anticipated Zen chip next year? AMD's competitive standpoint against Intel is far worse than I could have ever imagined. If it weren't for Rory Read and his intent on diversifying the chipmaker's product portfolio, AMD would undoubtedly be history. Fortunately, AMD has consoles, discreet graphics and embedded chips among other streams working in its favor, but the rapidly falling PC revenues still make up half of the company's income. I have a feeling that AMD will work some way around it and as an investor I hope it does, but with what magic tricks I don't know. Most of the articles I write on AMD are of a bullish nature and with a very small position. I'm deep down bullish for the company. With great risk comes great rewards (and loss). The industries AMD is involved in are worth hundreds of billions, so the upside is astronomical with future success. However, the end result is up in the air so anyone buying or shorting better be cautious. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMD. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
