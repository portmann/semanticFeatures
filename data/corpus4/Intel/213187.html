ETF Hub Oct 22 2015, 19:38 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor After several quarters of providing light guidance, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is singing a different tune today: The software giant has guided on its call for its three reporting segments to collectively post FQ2 revenue of $24.8B-$25.4B, in-line with a $25.1B consensus and likely sparking hopes of upside given Microsoft's history of guiding conservatively. Productivity & Business Processes is expected to see revenue of $6.6B-$6.7B, Intelligent Cloud $6.2B-$6.3B, and More Personal Computing $12B-$12.4B. Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on revenue growth, after having a 5% impact in FQ1. Though revenue fell 7% Y/Y in FQ1 due to PC weakness and cloud transition (pushes out revenue recognition), cloud subscription billings helped the unearned revenue balance (non-GAAP) rise 3% Y/Y (9% exc. forex) to $23.1B. The contracted but not billed balance was above $23.5B. Also: Bing, once a large cash sinkhole, is finally profitable . Search-related revenue topped $1B in FQ1, with search ad revenue (ex-TAC) rising 23% Y/Y. Windows 10/Cortana integration appears to be helping: Nearly 20% of the quarter's search revenue came from Windows 10 devices. Other details: 1) Office commercial product/services revenue fell 2% Y/Y thanks to the 365 transition. Office consumer revenue fell 13%. 2) Xbox Live monthly active users rose 28% to 39M. 3) Enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers more than doubled Y/Y to over 20K. 4) Windows volume license revenue fell 3% Y/Y, and Surface revenue fell 26% to $672M ahead of the Surface Pro 4 launch. Any word on HoloLens?  I hope they drop the price and make it affordable! This should help increase their revenues early 2016. Hololens is only available as a developer kit.  Basically that means programmers can buy the setup to try and figure out how to integrate the technology into a game or profession.  There will be lots of uses besides gaming.  But it will take time for the programmers to figure out how to integrate the technology into their systems. What this implies is that Microsoft is waiting for the next generation before it goes retail.  There are limitations to the system (narrow field of view).  My assumption is that this all has to do with the computer chips powering the device.  Intel and others simply can not manufacture a chip powerful and efficient to provide the horsepower to Hololens required capability for a gamer.
