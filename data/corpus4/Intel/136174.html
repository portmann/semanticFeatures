Micron: Not Selling Hot Dogs Anymore - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Very few understand the implications of 3D XPoint storage class memory (SCM). At least 80 percent of the DRAM market will be obsolesced by SCM like 3D XPoint. Prior to publication, I revised my last article thousands of times. Over the course of this lengthy process, I changed the analogy that I was drawing but neglected to update the title to reflect this. The article was supposed to have been entitled, "Micron: Not Selling Hot Dogs Anymore". In hindsight, the subsequently confusingly unrelated " Purple Swan " title was fortuitous in that it was symbolic of what happened: extremely few people understood the Earth-shaking, F5 tornado, cure-for-digital-cancer implications of the Micron (NASDAQ: MU )-Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) technology that I had highlighted. Now that Micron and Intel have formally announced the technology (with the awful name of "3D XPoint"), it is clear that the vast majority still cannot fathom its implications. To this end, I feel like I have another chance to explain how Micron will transition from selling commodity hot dogs into five-star, high-end cuisine. Because I didn't do a proper job the first time around, let me try to boil down Purple Swan into its essence: Probably on the order of 80 percent of today's DRAM consumption will dissolve over the next few years - perhaps sooner, depending on how aggressive they are with the rollout in addition to the speed at which other players react. To emphasize this point, let's revisit an Intel patent: Dynamic partial power down of memory-side cache in a 2-level memory hierarchy The focus of this approach is on providing performance with a relatively small amount of a relatively higher-speed memory such as DRAM while implementing the bulk of the system memory using significantly cheaper and denser non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM). Hundreds of billions of dollars annually are about to change direction as a direct result of XPoint but, yet, one can still buy Micron and Intel at phenomenal discounts. This is painfully unbelievable to me. Speculation is cheap so let's go back to the horse's mouth. Here's a new one from Intel: Method and system for providing instant responses to sleep state transitions with non-volatile random access memory With the use of the NVRAM, the platform can enter a powered-off sleep state in response to a request for entry into a powered sleep state. The difference in power consumption between the powered sleep state and the powered-off sleep state can be one or two orders of magnitude. On a mobile platform, this power saving can translate into a battery life in standby mode from a few days to a few hundreds of days. When you turn off the screen on your current cell phone, the CPU and memory are both instructed to enter into a "powered sleep state" - but they still draw nontrivial power in order to keep the volatile memory (DRAM and SRAM) alive. With XPoint, they just call the new Intel instruction WBINVD and then remove power to both CPU and memory. The system will resume instantly upon request from the baseband or the user. Mind you, the power efficiency aspect is just one of the many benefits of this new technology. Cost efficiencies from dramatically simplified packaging will be another benefit. With 8 bits in a byte, the announced 128Gbit chip works out to 16Gbytes. If you were to stack four of those chips on top of the eDRAM cache that is already present on some Intel processors, you wind up with a complete 64GB system-on-package. Just add some accessories, pop this into your favorite platform (phone, tablet, laptop, PC, server, gaming console, etc) and you're ready to go. And remember, there's no need for RAM or storage in this configuration as the cached XPoint can be partitioned to fulfill both functions. Allow me to revisit that first Intel patent as I think that everyone will better understand it at this point: In one embodiment, a notebook computer is configured with a near memory and a PCMS device which performs the role of both a far memory and a mass storage device (i.e., which is logically partitioned to perform these roles as shown in FIG. 3). When Intel released the Iris Pro, they disclosed the following regarding the cache: There's only a single size of eDRAM offered this generation: 128MB. Since it's a cache and not a buffer (and a giant one at that), Intel found that hit rate rarely dropped below 95%. It turns out that for current workloads, Intel didn't see much benefit beyond a 32MB eDRAM however it wanted the design to be future proof. Intel doubled the size to deal with any increases in game complexity, and doubled it again just to be sure. I believe the exact wording Intel's Tom Piazza used during his explanation of why 128MB was "go big or go home". It's very rare that we see Intel be so liberal with die area, which makes me think this 128MB design is going to stick around for a while. This wasn't "go big or go home". This was calculated. Intel designed this eDRAM cache for XPoint - not conventional DRAM. From Intel's documentation , we know that the read speeds on XPoint are actually better than DRAM (side note: the variable numbers are required to accommodate the slower performance with MLC and TLC ). With all writes going directly to the high-bandwidth eDRAM cache, a hybrid cached XPoint system is going to have better performance and lower cost than a conventional, DRAM-only system. Since I am one of them, I know that the pedants are about to point out that XPoint isn't as durable as DRAM and therefore isn't a suitable replacement. Thusly, I will point out that it doesn't need to be . Only the most high-performance applications will require DRAM-only main memory. Even the average server will use SCM for main memory. I don't believe that Micron has conventional 20 nanometer DRAM forthcoming - if they're smart, they're building wide-bus, high-bandwidth eDRAM cache memory (or this stuff , which is as fast as SRAM but as dense as DRAM). If they're real smart, they'll bundle this cache memory with XPoint and create a power-efficient, high-performance hybrid memory product . Perhaps this accounts for the bump in inventory. Regardless, the Micron-Intel rollout webcast proved to me that something is going on - things seem very harried and they produced more questions than answers . I can only think of a handful of reasons: As someone who lost a lot of money as an ECD shareholder, I am definitely biased. And I certainly have to respect defamation laws: if there's a good reason for all of the delays and secrecy, then Micron-Intel should simply tell us or at least publicly recognize that they can't tell us what is going on. Otherwise, speculation is appropriate in order to cover the bases from a risk perspective. In my previous article, I speculated that there may have been some nefarious activity in Micron's $12 million acquisition of ECD's 38.6 percent interest in Ovonyx . In 2011, I knew that ECD's phase change memory technology was very likely to displace DRAM and NAND - as did most of academia. Everyone was very excited. But the story unfolded like this: November 28, 2011: ECD appoints new CEO . February 28, 2012: Micron/Intel add emerging memory to their JV . August 7, 2012: Court grants Ovonyx sale to Micron . August 22, 2012: Testimony provided that ECD shopped Ovonyx to "22 potential strategic purchasers" which include Samsung, Rambus and Hynix. Marketing was done by Bridge Associates , who have not been in business for years . Investment banker was not put under oath; lawyer speaks on his behalf. January 17, 2013: Micron discusses "memory combinations" in the hybrid memory cube . Plans "full production" for late 2013 or early 2014. August 20, 2013: ECD bankruptcy closing adjourned from 9-25-2013 to 12-18-2013 . September 25, 2013: Micron schedules HMC volume production for "later in 2014". December 13, 2013: ECD bankruptcy adjourned to 3-9-2014 . Then again to 7-16-2014 . Then again to 9-10-2014 . Then again to 11-12-2014 . Then again to 1-14-2015 . Then again to 3-8-2015 . Then again to 6-17-2015 . Then again to 8-26-2015 . During the proposed sale of ECD's Ovonyx share, I lawyered-up because I felt that the purchase price was an insult. My attorney explained to me that "cherry picking" is simply an ingrained part of bankruptcy culture and the judge wouldn't care about my concerns that the marketing was conducted by a defunct firm that never had experience "specializing in the computer memory market". This attorney also explained to me that a bankruptcy is like an unreviewable calls in baseball: once the bankruptcy is closed, everything that transpired is not subject to review - because "this is how we've always done it". But, to reiterate, this is all speculation based on the delays of 20nm DRAM, 3D NAND and "New Memory A Gen 1" and the depressed share prices of Intel and Micron subsequent to announcing the Holy Grail of computing. The hybrid memory cube has still not reached volume production. The Automata processor has seen similar delays . Are the feds boiling the frog or is Micron just really bad at scheduling things? For reference, Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection about a month prior to ECD and emerged two years ago. I have no idea if any of the events on that timeline are related but, if they are, they should make a movie about it. The day after my last article was published, ECD's bankruptcy closing was again adjourned until August 26th. Nearly immediately, the Yahoo Message board for ECD was shut down. This is where shareholders were still actively discussing matters (sometimes dozens of posts per day). Was this all a coincidence? Perhaps Micron-Intel are being boiled by the feds and management have finally realized it. With no plans for conventional 20nm DRAM (and perhaps even 3D NAND), waning share prices and angry investors, it would be appropriate to expunge all things PCM, replace it with something else and move forward. This might explain why there were no specifics disclosed on XPoint: they're using some lesser memory element to satisfy the impending fed investigation (raid?) that will likely happen if any of this conjecture happens to be true. IBM recently contacted me in order to brief me on the "big news we will present later this year" - they've got PCM in the wings and have already discussed it as if a foregone conclusion. Disk retirements may actually be quicker than people expect with the invent of new technologies like Phase Change Memory which holds special potential here (the 3D stacked cells PCM will increase capacity significantly). More recently, I discovered from Samsung's patents that they're likely ready to go with PCM as well. What is going on here? If it is a foregone conclusion and everyone has the stuff, then why is it so quiet out here? There may be more importance in the "transistor-less" disclosure than anything else. As I have previously discussed, the implications of a nanoscale Ovonic Threshold Switch (which is used to replace the transistor as discussed in Purple Swan) are astronomical. Here's an Ovonyx patent application from 2008. Don't let the title fool you (it is an attempt to conceal the importance): Method and apparatus for thin film memory In an illustrative embodiment a layer of complementary thin film logic is formed on a substrate, which may be non-single-crystalline material, such as glass, ceramic, or fiberglass for example. The layer of complementary thin film logic may include asymmetric three terminal ovonic threshold switches which, after forming, are interconnected to produce a desired combination of devices that form complementary logic gates, combinatorial logic, sequential logic, latches, or address decoders, for example. In this illustrative embodiment, one or more layers of thin film memory, such as phase change memory, are formed on top of the layer of complementary thin film logic. Essentially, this invention enables the semiconductor industry to replace silicon with glass, ceramic or fiberglass - oodles cheaper. This technology is priceless and will quickly displace conventional fabrication methods - if it can be scaled to nanoscale levels. It is possible that the big players got together and decided that it wasn't worth bidding this technology to its true value - tens of billions or more. But that's just the only reason I can think of as to why Micron and Intel aren't trading significantly higher - conjecture.
