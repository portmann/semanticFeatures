Intel + Altera Is A Smart Move For The Smart Technology/IoT Market - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Jun.  7, 2015  8:44 PM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: ARMH , ATML , FSL , NXPI , STM , TXN by: Robert Castellano Intel's acquisition of Atmel goes beyond the datacenter business. The combination of Intel's Quark processor and an FPGA will be enhance the companies visibility for thousands of customers making an estimated 50 billion IoT devices in 2020. Back in January, I wrote an Instablog on Seeking Alpha that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) wasn't moving smart enough in the Internet of Things ((IoT)) space. I pointed out that microcontrollers (MCUs) provide local processing capability for the "real-time" embedded processing of most Smart Technology applications. I questioned Intel's strategy in Smart Technology, particularly since the company dropped out of the top 20 market leaders in 2008 and its Quark, announced in 2013, is an embedded system-on-a-chip ((SoC)) processor design intended for competition with ARM's (NASDAQ: ARMH ) Cortex M RISC-based processors, which are already found in wearable computing like Google Glass and Recon Jet and many mobile phones. MCUs, when incorporated with a sensor and a wireless connectivity chip into the design of a dumb gadget, turns them into smart products. For example, a toaster is just a dumb device that can only tell you if it's on or off According to Kaivan Karimi, VP and GM of Atmel Corporation's (NASDAQ: ATML ) Wireless Solutions business, via his company's blog : Design an MCU into a toaster oven with a user interface and you can control it in a more predictable and systematic manner. It now has become a "smart" toaster. Add the appropriate connectivity and you can now communicate and control that smart toaster remotely. And because these devices are sleeping most of the time, they benefit from the nonvolatile memory (FLASH) in many MCUs. When the power is off, the device's memory retains the content. I noted also that MCUs are being designed into Smart Technology by most manufacturers, although the majority are ARM based. Leading ARM licensees are Atmel, Freescale (NYSE: FSL ), NXP (NASDAQ: NXPI ), STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ), and Toshiba. Freescale has cut back on its ColdFire in favor of ARM. Keep in mind that a microprocessor (MPU) can be used in Smart Technology and are, in fact, used instead of MCUs in compute-intensive applications. It is estimated that 15% of all Smart Devices use an MPU. Back in mid-2014, Intel entered into a pilot program known as Smart Cities USA with the city of San Jose, CA, marking the company's first Smart City implementation in the U.S. The scalability of Intel architecture enables the intelligence and flexibility necessary for cities across the country to quickly deploy a range of smart city solutions for everything from air and water quality to traffic and parking management to communications systems and other city infrastructure. But here's where Intel got smart and I changed my thinking. They purchased Altera. Much of the buzz after the purchase focused on Intel's datacenter business. The acquisition would enable Intel to integrate Altera's FPGAs with its Xeon processor, enabling customers to magically upgrade the chips over time using software updates. Equally important, or perhaps more so, FPGAs will propel Intel into market leadership in Smart Technology/IoT. Two features of FPGAs are responsible. First, while discussions so far have focused on enabling Intel's high-end Xeon processors to operate at a 2x performance coupled with a decrease in cost, particularly when the CPU and FPGA are integrated in one package, we see Intel migrating the technology to the Quark for embedded applications. Intel could be a beneficiary of the acquisition by getting back into the lucrative embedded market for Smart Technology/IoT. At the same time, it could impede ARM's momentum in the SMART Technology/IoT market, since Altera markets SOCs using ARM's Cortex-A9 and Cortex-A53 IP. Finally, and most importantly, the FPGA provides greater flexibility and faster time-to-market for customers. Intel estimates that 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet of Things by 2020. There are thousands of manufacturers of devices that will be connected to Smart Technology/IoT, as diverse as thermostats, toasters, LED lighting, subway systems, traffic lights, water hydrants, and medical imaging systems. What's required is flexibility to incorporate a wide range of standard and user-defined I/O interfaces, as well as high-speed connectivity to simplify the conversion of simple devices to smart devices. The Quark-FPGA platform could be customizable for diverse algorithms and applications. Because of its programmability, the FPGA's logic can handle specific workloads, that can be reconfigured it the workload changes, such as a company upgrading its smart device. In Smart Technology/IoT, a microcontroller/processor is part of a sensor network that is capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network along with a transceiver and one or more sensors. An ultralow power MCU such as the Quark can have limited compute power in a wireless sensor nodes used in Smart Technology/IoT applications. The FPGA could be used to attain high performance at low power, such as processing digital signals while the microcontroller handles communication and control. The bottom line for investors is that Intel has positioned itself to sell its processors into the Smart Technology/IoT marketplace. According to The Information Network's report "Convergence of Semiconductors and Smart Technology - A Market Analysis," microcontrollers (MCUs) used in Smart Cities, Smart Homes, Smart Industry, Smart Health, and Smart Transport (a subset of the Internet of Things, represented just 10% of the overall MCU market in 2014. But in 2020, $10 billion in MCUs, representing 40% of the total market, will be used in these applications.
