Intel Will Beat Earnings - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel will release first quarter 2016 earnings Tuesday after the closing bell. Analysts are modeling softer EPS on a flat revenue compared to previous quarters. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will release first quarter 2016 earnings on Tuesday, April 19, after market close. On average, the analyst community estimates Intel's EPS will be $0.48 with revenue at $13.86 billion. I expect the company to beat analysts' estimates. In this article I share the basis of my expectation. In the first quarter of 2015, Intel's EPS came in at $0.41 on flat YoY revenue of $12.8 billion. Weak client computing group revenue driven by declining PC sales was responsible for flat YoY revenue. However, client computing group revenue was offset by meaningful YoY growth in datacenter, IoT and non-volatile memory revenue. I expect Intel's client computing group revenue in the first quarter will arrive at $8 billion, give or take $200 million or so, compared to $7.4 billion a year ago. Although Gartner and IDC reported that PC shipments were down globally in the first quarter of 2016, I expect that Intel's client computing group will remain relatively immune to this declining trend. Why? Intel now reports PC and mobile chip sales under the client computing group and growing mobile chip sales driven by Atom processors should partially offset declining PC chip sales. As a result, client computing group revenue may witness an early sign of stabilization. Intel spent billions in the past two years to expand its mobile footprint via introducing new Atom processors intended for tablets and smartphones. The processors remained well-received across the industry with OEMs like HP (NYSE: HPQ ), Lenovo and Dell embedding them in their mobile devices. In addition to tablets and smartphones, the low-cost Windows laptops, called cloudbooks, powered by Intel's Pentium and Celeron processors are also helping Intel sell low-power PC chips. And the sales volume may no be insignificant. I am encouraged by Intel's plan to release a new generation of Pentium and Celeron processors in the second half this year. These low-power chips, code-named Apollo Bay, will be used not only in cloudbooks, but in tablets as well. I believe Intel will introduce these Goldmont architecture-based Apollo Bay chips because such chips are seeing impressive adoption by OEMs. Apollo Bay will succeed Airmont architecture-based Braswell. In October last year during the third-quarter conference call Intel's chief financial officer Stacy Smith said : We now expect the data center business to grow in the low-double-digits versus the prior forecast of approximately 15 percent. Relative to our forecast at the beginning of the year, we are seeing a weaker enterprise segment being partially offset by a stronger-than-expected cloud segment. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Intel's datacenter group revenue was $4.3 billion, up 5% YoY. Intel's recent launch of the Broadwell-EP server platform will boost its datacenter group revenue from the second quarter. New cloud datacenter buildouts across the globe will help Intel sell the new server chips, namely the Xeon E5-2600 v4 processor family, in the coming quarters. In the first quarter though, I expect that Intel's existing server chips were enjoying the momentum that was built in 2015. The general expectation is that Intel's datacenter revenue growth will slow down to around 5% in the first quarter due to weaker macro conditions worldwide, particularly China. I believe datacenter revenue will see a strong YoY recovery due to favorable comps. In absolute terms it should be over $4.5 billion, primarily driven by continued hyperscale cloud deployments. In addition, continued on-premise deployments driven by on-going enterprise refresh cycle (although the cycle is approaching the end) should also have a positive impact on Intel's datacenter revenue. Other Groups: Should Get a Boost Driven by Altera Revenue Intel said it will change its financial reporting structure from the first quarter 2016 earnings release. It will report Altera's earnings in its new programmable solutions group. Revenue from its security software business will now be reported in a group called the Intel security group, and the software and services segment will be dropped. Further, the company will report revenue from its flash memory business in the nonvolatile memory solutions group. Revenue from Altera should be around $450 million, driven by continued momentum around the telecom and wireless industry. I expect that Intel's security software revenue will be impressive as a result of Intel Security's new strategy, which I discussed in a previous article . However, I don't expect Intel security group's revenue will cross $500 million just yet, given the business is evolving. Finally, the IoT group revenue should grow meaningfully YoY driven by Intel's introduction of a wide range of processors, including Quark, Atom, Core and Xeon. I expect the IoT group and the nonvolatile memory solutions group together should register between $850 million and $1 billion in revenue. Per my estimates, Intel should clock more than $14 billion in total revenue in first quarter 2016. Applying a net margin of 20% (average of last four quarters) on $14 billion revenue, I get an EPS of $0.59 for Intel. If Intel really beats analysts' estimates, the shares should rally. However, what happens next entirely depends on the general market condition. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
