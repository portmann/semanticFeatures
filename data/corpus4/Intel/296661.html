Intel Finally Admits Moore's Law Has Slowed, So Now What? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. A recent accounting change at Intel confirms management commentary over the past year that the cadence for new nodes is moving from 2 to 2.5 years. This could actually be beneficial for shareholders, as Intel can squeeze more chips out of existing capital equipment, benefiting cash flow. Intel's competitive position continues to be strong, as Moore's Law has historically operated on a longer cadence anyway, and these issues are not Intel-specific. When Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) reported earnings last week, there weren't too many surprises. DCG growth once again came in below the 15% number management keeps guiding to, but this has happened so many times before it's old hat by now. Commentary on weakness in China sent the stock down, but that's also not terribly surprising with what's going on over there. As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for the year. Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015. At many firms, a change in the economic life of manufacturing equipment would be a minor accounting detail. At Intel, on the other hand, it's hugely meaningful. I'm actually surprised it hasn't drawn more attention. Those who follow Intel are undoubtedly familiar with Moore's Law. Given the challenges Intel has experienced with 14nm, many have been questioning whether the traditional two-year "tick tock" cadence was sustainable. Indeed, last year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich telegraphed that the transition to 10nm would take 2.5 years as well, but the company was on the fence about whether the transitions would be on a 2 or 2.5 year basis as recently as December. At the Credit Suisse conference , Krzanich explained what's going on: The number of mask layers has more than doubled over the last five years so it takes longer to do developments, it takes longer to do defect reduction. So, that's what's happened here. I believe over the next five years lithography tools will start to catch up. We'll see whether it stays at two-and-a-half years or we can get it back to two years, we're going to keep pushing back to two years if we can. With the accounting change from 4 years to 5 years of depreciation, though, it is now officially Intel's position that the cadence has elongated from 24 months to 30. Stacy on the call last week: We did an in-depth analysis based on the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next. We talked about that at the beginning of 2015, and the third wave of products. And we completed our long-range planning in the fourth quarter, and that's what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence. From a direct financial standpoint, the change in depreciation will boost gross margins by a point in 2016. In the longer term, this likely means capex spending will be a smaller percentage of revenue, as Intel ekes more chips out of the same process node. This is actually great from a cash flow perspective. The question that many have raised is whether or not this signals an erosion of Intel's historical process technology lead over TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). I believe not, for three reasons. First, the challenges of 14, 10, and beyond are not Intel-specific - and the company's advantage includes many things (material science, 3D transistors, etc) in addition to just the headline nanomenter number. Second, if you take a little longer-term view of history, Moore's law has actually operated on a longer cadence over much of its history. As Krzanich explained at the Credit Suisse conference: The first thing, you said it John, Moore's Law is 50 years old and if you take a look at the history of Moore's Law, it's not spent much of its life at two-year cycles. Actually the majority of its life has been 2.5 years to 3 years. Sunlin Chou who used to run our TD department drove it to two years during a very unique opportunity, unique time when lithography tools were progressing quite nicely and that's when steppers really came into fashion and the wavelengths of light were going down nicely. Basically what's slowing down Moore's Law is two things right now. The EUV is late, it should have probably come in optimally some people argue at 22 nanometers, I actually argue probably at 32 nanometers out in that timeframe. That's really when we started to need EUV when we're multi patterning and what that does is it extends the length of the process. Third, I am quite fond of the following graphic from this 2011 McKinsey report : Intel has long been one of the few standouts in semiconductors. As I discussed in my last article , the tone has shifted under Krzanich. The company is keenly aware of the missteps that left it somewhat on the sidelines in mobile, and appears to be making investments in all the right areas to ensure that its competitive position remains strong. I continue to think Intel is well-managed, and a longer cadence for moving to new nodes may actually be beneficial for cash flow to shareholders. I don't own Intel today because I have better opportunities in small-caps that are less exposed to global economic ups and downs, but I continue to think the valuation here is reasonable relative to other large-caps (and certainly more attractive prospectively than something like IBM (NYSE: IBM ), which despite the cheap valuation, doesn't seem worth buying). At the right price, I'd be happy to be an Intel shareholder again. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
