Why Apple Still Leads In Mobile Devices Over Microsoft And Google - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's rivals Microsoft and Google continue to try to emulate Apple's integrated mobile device model. Apple mobile devices continue to be superior because Apple's design expertise is much deeper than its competitors. Now that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have all debuted their new mobile devices for the December quarter, it's time for investors to step back and assess their overall impact. While some may portray the new devices from Apple's competitors as "threats", Apple has continued to thrive and grow despite these threats which are introduced year after year. The reason for this is due to a fundamental structural difference Apple's competitors have yet to emulate. Both Google and Microsoft have amassed huge bases of users for their operating systems based on the commodity PC model. Microsoft still has a user base for Windows it claims is about 1.5 billion strong. Likewise, Google claims to have 1.3 billion Android users. Under the circumstances, one has to wonder why Apple's competitors field their own branded mobile devices. The answer of course is profitability. Selling mobile devices with Apple's unique hardware and operating systems turns out to be the best way to monetize Apple's operating systems. Apple is well known to reap most of the smartphone industry profits . Apple generally charges a premium for all its devices, and its mobile devices have become its main revenue source. Apple's revenue and profit now dwarf that of its competitors despite having fewer users for iOS and Mac OS X. The device events of Apple , Microsoft and Google have served to underscore that there's a missing element in Microsoft and Google devices that is present in Apple's mobile devices. This is the custom system on chip (SOC) that powers all iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, and iPods Touch. The lack of ability to design their own custom SOCs relegates the smartphones of Microsoft and Google to immediate second-tier status. Both Google and Microsoft based their "flagship" phones, the Nexus 6P and the Lumia 950 XL, on the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 810. I've pointed out that the 810 is about a year behind the latest A9 SOC in the iPhone 6s/6s Plus and about half as fast. Nevertheless, the commodity manufacturers had to use it because it was simply the best currently available "off the shelf". Rumors that the 810 suffers from overheating seemed to be confirmed by Microsoft's claim to use "tablet class" liquid cooling for its new Lumia phones. The fact that Microsoft did not put an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) SoFIA (now Atom X3) processor in its flagship phones also says a lot. Despite claims by ardent Intel supporters that Intel "could" build a competitive (with Apple) processor, they have yet to do so. Microsoft's decision to use Qualcomm ( QCOM ) must have been a difficult one in light of Windows 10 and its Continuum feature, which was demonstrated on the Lumia 950 XL. Microsoft showed how the 950 XL could support a desktop mode of Win 10 when docked with an external monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's a cool feature but of limited value since the phone can only run Universal apps that are compiled to run on the Qualcomm processor. The larger app ecosystem of Windows software is still off limits. This is basically the same situation that existed with Windows RT running on ARM-based Surface tablets. And Windows RT is now extinct. Continuum on an ARM-based Lumia phone continues to be a promise of future capability that is largely unfulfilled. Until it is, Microsoft's Windows 10 phones will be as undistinguished as their predecessors, and suffer the same fate of minuscule market share. Likewise, Google's Nexus phones have failed to achieve even the top-five status in IDC's market results, such as for the June quarter . Despite losing market share, Apple is still the dominant player in tablets, as IDC confirms for the June quarter. Apple had the largest tablet market share at 24.5%. As usual, Google's Nexus tablets don't even make the top 5 of IDC's survey, and neither do Microsoft's. At the Microsoft event, it was revealed that Surface is a $3.5 billion a year business, but this is hardly impressive. Apple still sells more than this in iPads every quarter . Once again, the use of commodity processors hurts the offerings from both Google and Microsoft. Google's Nexus 9 uses the Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Tegra K1 Denver. This is a very respectable tablet processor, but the Nexus 9 still tests out behind the iPad Air 2 in most benchmarks, as an Anandtech review shows. Microsoft has gone a different route with the Surface Pro series, now updated with the Surface Pro 4. By using Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, Microsoft guarantees that the tablets will have the best performance as well as full backward compatibility with Windows software. The cost is bulk and heft. The Surface Pro 4 weighs 1.69 pounds vs. 1.57 pounds for the iPad Pro, despite the iPad Pro's larger 12.9-inch screen. The Surface Pro 4 is also thicker at 8.45 mm vs. the iPad Pro's 6.9 mm. Surface Pro 4 requires a cooling fan, while the iPad Pro does not. Surface Pro 4 uses the latest Intel Skylake processors, so it should be a pretty fast machine in i5 and i7 form. Given the early results of the A9 processor in the iPhone 6s , the A9X in the iPad Pro should be pretty fast as well. When iPad Pro goes on sale in November, the world may discover that Apple has built an SOC to rival even the mighty Intel Core iX series processors. But even with that, I would concede that the Surface Pro 4 is the better general purpose personal computer, by virtue of running Win10. Does that mean that Surface Pro 4 will sell better than iPad Pro? Probably not. As a tablet, the Surface Pro 4 is a little too heavy, while as a laptop replacement, it's still a little underpowered. Some may be disappointed that the iPad Pro is not a better general purpose personal computer or better able to run applications available for Windows or Mac OS X. This has always been true of iOS devices, yet iOS has thrived nevertheless. iOS apps have allowed the iOS ecosystem to thrive in its own right, and iPad Pro is clearly intended to give iOS developers a better platform to create compelling apps, rather than serve as a replacement for the laptop. Apple doesn't need for Windows and Mac OS X developers to port their apps to iOS, although they're welcome to do so. The developer community for iOS is now so large and profitable that virtually every target market is being served within the iOS ecosystem. Legacy PC developers such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) are not really needed for iOS to flourish. This is illustrated by the situation with iPad in the enterprise. iPad still commands a huge 64% market share, according to Good Technology . Is this because iPad serves as a substitute for Windows or Mac OS X systems? No. It's because enterprises are deploying them to run apps in situations where the use of the tablet form factor is a true advantage. An example of this is the flight charts that United Airlines pilots use. Most of the uses for iPad in the enterprise involve special purpose apps developed by third parties or by the enterprises themselves. This has been the focus of the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) partnership as well. This highlights the advantages of stability and security offered by iOS, as well as the ease of developing apps using the free development environment Apple makes available. Every year when Apple's competitors field a new set of mobile devices, Apple bears assert that these constitute a grave threat to Apple's leadership position. It has become a tried and true formula. And who can really take issue with the literal use of the word threat, since it only speaks to possible rather than certain outcomes? Apple will always face competitive threats. That's the nature of a free market. Investors deserve to hear more from analysts than the mere fact that a threat exists, since this is a trivial observation. What is the extent of the threat posed to Apple by its competitors' mobile devices? The threat is not market share, since neither Google nor Microsoft have significant market share currently. Neither Google nor Microsoft are likely to gain significant market share in mobile devices, since these devices are inherently undistinguished commodity devices and don't represent significant advances from previous devices that also failed to gain market share. The only other way in which Apple could be threatened is in profitability. Once again, Apple's position as a premium mobile device provider is not really under threat. The past few years have demonstrated that commodity devices simply cannot threaten Apple's premium devices, because they lack the hardware and software discriminators that would be necessary.
