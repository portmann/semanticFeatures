Intel And The Cloud - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has led a financing round for an enterprise version of Open Stack cloud software. The investment shows that Intel's software interests remain proprietary. This is a good dividend play at current prices, just don't expect growth. Most tech giants take what they have as a given, and are looking for growth in cloud, devices, or both. This is true for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), which has regularly failed to sell chips to device makers but has enjoyed success this decade as a commodity chip supplier to cloud data centers, most of which standardize on its x86 architecture. It's a nice business, but a mature one, and Intel - like any tech company worth considering - always wants more. At Wednesday's opening price of $27.52, Intel sports a fat yield of 3.4%, which looks nice against the 10-year bond rate of 2.2%. That dividend has been stable for several years, having gone to 23 cents in 2012 and 24 cents this year. The company hands back less than half its earnings in dividends, thanks to fat margins that reach for, and sometimes exceed, 25%. The dividend is secure. One thing I've written regularly here is that hardware has become software, and that hardware companies are, on the whole, writing proprietary software into their chips and paying someone to make the design. Intel is unique in that it makes its own designs, and I have been critical of that, feeling it could be a more profitable fab if it were separated from manufacturing, and a more responsive designer as well. But I'm not going to re-litigate the point here. Instead, I'm going to point to a $100 million investment Intel Capital recently made into Mirantis as an example of its continuing problems. The deal is aimed at increasing adoption of Open Stack, an open source cloud infrastructure, among enterprises, which is a good thing. But it's being made through a small company that Intel's investment can control. Jonathan Davidson of Intel defends the investment in a blog post saying that enterprises find Open Stack too complex, too distant from enterprise applications, and think it takes too much time to set up. By bringing big venture capital partners to Mirantis, analysts say that Intel makes "a strong move" into the cloud. It is, in fact, nothing of the sort, because Open Stack is open source software. Intel could write these new features itself and contribute them if it wanted Open Stack to succeed. What working with Mirantis can do for Intel is only fork Open Stack, creating an "enterprise" version for sale which competes directly with versions written by Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) and others. What Intel is doing here is not in Open Stack's best interest, then, but in Intel's best interest. It still, after all these years, doesn't view open source - in which development costs are shared among all players - with anything but suspicion. If it can't exercise control, directly or indirectly, Intel doesn't really want to play. This need for control has been Intel's problem for over a decade now, ever since the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Wintel monopoly showed signs of cracking. As a software outfit, Intel remains proprietary. Wintel at least showed an open side, a shared responsibility. Until Intel's software operations become truly open, it will remain what it is, a no-growth dividend payer rather than the growth company it sees itself as. There are horses for courses and if you want to be a dividend investor you can buy Intel today with confidence. It's a bargain at $28. But it's not going to break through its late-2014 highs until it does what growing companies do today, which is work and play well with others. A break-up would force that change, but it's not going to happen. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
