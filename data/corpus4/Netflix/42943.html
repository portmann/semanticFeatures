Shopping Guide - How to Share Your Amazon Prime Account | Debt RoundUp Did you know you can share your Amazon Prime account benefits with up to four family members? Â This is an unknown benefit ofÂ  Amazon Prime that many don’t know. Â This is why I’m sharing this in my new guides series. Welcome to this shopping guide where I show you how to share your Amazon Prime benefits with other people. For those who don’t know, Amazon Prime is a membership service from Amazon.com . Â This service provides members with free two-day shipping, along with access to Kindle lending library Â and Amazon Instant Video . Â  I am an Amazon Prime member and have been for some time. I got in when they were charging $79 per year, but they have just increased the price to $99 per year. Â Depending on how much you buy on Amazon, this could be a great service for you. Â While the benefits of Amazon Prime are great, you can also share those benefits with family members. Â There are some caveats, but here they are. If you want to save money while shopping at Amazon, check out my 5 little known ways to keep money in your pocket . Amazon easily allows you to share you Prime account benefits. Â They do have two stipulations with regards to this process though. Â Here they are. Only the two-day shipping benefit can be shared. Â  Amazon Instant Video and Kindle lending library Â are not shared. *I have been sharing my Prime account with my father. Â He doesn’t live in the same household, but has been able to get free two-day shipping for some time. Â I don’t know how strict this rule is. In order to share your Amazon Prime account with someone in your family, you will need to log into your Prime Account . Â Once you do that, you should follow these steps. You can share your benefits by entering the name, relationship, email, and birthday of the person you want to share with. Â Please note that the person you want to share with must know your birthday in order to confirm. Â You must also enter your birthday. It is really just that easy. Â It only takes a few clicks and your household members can enjoy free and fast shipping from Amazon . Â I do get the question from some who ask why you would want to share your Prime benefits with other household members. Â That is fairly easy to answer. Â Some people don’t like to share their entire Amazon account with others. Â You might have your account setup the way you want it with your credit cards and someone else might have theirs in a different configuration. Â If you share your Prime benefits, then you don’t have to have two Prime accounts for people in the same household. Â My wife can order on her Amazon account and just use my Prime benefits. Â She doesn’t have to pay for a Prime account for herself, which would be a waste of money. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a Wordpress management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. This is actually GREAT because I’m always ordering stuff for my wife through my account (non-prime) because I have tons of Amazon credit stored up. So she has the best of the shipping (she has prime) but I have the free money! haha… Thanks for the great tip.  I am a Prime member.  Right now I’m living in Indonesia.  On the island of Java.  I am having trouble getting Amazon to honor its two day shipping commitment to me! (Just kidding.  My house doesn’t even have an address.  Maybe when I get back to the states). For now, just a big thank you for the info. I’m doing the free trial now and was bummed to hear it used to be $79 per year but now they raised it. If I go with it, I’ll probably start ordering more stuff like drugstore items and food/specialty items to make it worth my while. I wanted to try the membership for the TV shows netflix and hulu do not have, like Orphan Black. Thanks for the tip!  My hubby has been just using my account to order his stuff, but this will make it easier.  Just went and did it.  Thanks! I had NO idea about this! This is yet another reason why I love blogging; learning so many awesome tips from bloggers. No, you can’t share streaming! You can only share shipping benefits.  Amazon Instant Video and Kindle lending is not included. My dad added me to his Prime account last year. I am not sure if he will be renewing due to the increased price, but I havenâ€™t been ordering much off of Amazon lately anyway. Itâ€™s a neat feature! I don’t live in the same house as they do anymore, and we haven’t had any issues either. I don’t shop much with Amazon, so I have never really looking into what Amazon Prime includes, so thanks for enlightening me. I know someone that has it and she has been having a lot of issues with the shipping (as in it’s taking more than 2 days for her to receive her deliveries), but I’ve also heard a lot of other people are really happy with it. Maybe it’s worth me looking into? I did know that, but I guess I’m just stingy and don’t want to share. No, I am just the only one who orders anything, so I would share if anyone in my family wanted to. Prime is worth it for me to avoid Wal Mart. I have both Netflix and Amazon Prime for long time. I agreed to this 3 months back. But for the past 3 months, Amazon Prime Instant video beats Netflix on streaming the TV Series. Netflix remove lot of TV Series and movies from streaming and it will be only available on DVDs/Blurays. Amazon pay lot of money to took over the streaming rights from Netflix to promote Amazon Fire Player. That really depends on what you like to watch. Amazon doesn’t have the content I like or just duplicates what I have on Netflix.  I have both services since I enjoy Netflix, but I order enough stuff from Amazon. We’ve been hearing a lot about Amazon Prime and are thinking of dumping Netflix for it.  It sounds great!  Thanks for this added info, Grayson – we appreciate it. Yep we’ve been using the sharing feature since we started two years ago!  We definitely get our money’s worth by using Amazon Prime. Great service that I didn’t know could be shared. I will look into it very soon. Thanks for the tip. I love Amazon and for me Prime is definitely worth the money both for the shipping savings and the streaming video.  I didn’t even know you could share the Prime shipping benefits! I had heard of folks sharing Prime accounts, but I didn’t realize this was a built-in feature! Thanks for sharing this and spreading the word Holy cow. That is AMAZING! Now I can hook up my mom and my Grandma so that I dont have to order stuff for them anymore and they can get it shipped right to their doors. Thanks for the info Grayson! It’s not just household members. You can designate a secondary on your account that will still receive the shipping benefit. My mom lived in Washington and now lives in Alaska. Yet I still get free two-day shipping here in Arizona. According to Amazon, it is just for members in the same household.  While they say that, I have found the same as you.  I am not sure if they really enforce it, but they do indicate the other people need to be in the same household. I got really excited the other day when I heard somewhere that I could share my Prime account, but then I discovered one important caveat: You can’t share a student account. Even though I’m off the free 6 month student trial and I’m paying for my account, because I’m paying the reduced student rate, I don’t get the benefit of sharing. Just fyi for anyone else on a student account. September 5, 2014 at 4:14 am — Reply I did share my prime membership (shipping only, hope it extends to videos) to my friends, definitely not in the same household, one is even as far as MD (I’m from California). If my sister would add me, could we each use our own credit cards for our own purchases?  Can you chose different places to have items shipped to?  Sorry for the naive questions…I haven’t used Amazon that much but want to! Yes, you would use your own credit cards and shipping addresses.  Sharing Amazon Prime just enables your account to have the shipping benefits of your sister’s Amazon prime account. November 10, 2014 at 1:51 pm — Reply Thanks for the info!  Was wondering if the logins would be different for each member so that each member couldn’t access your recent orders or browsing history.  I sometimes buy things for other members in my family (that I would be adding) or friends.  Wouldn’t want them seeing….Is that a possibility?  Have been looking, but cannot find anything. November 10, 2014 at 1:54 pm — Reply Well, the person you share it with needs to have an Amazon account before they can do any shopping there, so the logins would be different. Your Amazon Prime shipping benefits are just extended to the account you add. They can’t see your order or any other of your information. My wife and I have been struggling with this for some time now. I’ve had an Amazon Prime account for years and my wife has been a “household member” on the account. However, anytime she places an order, I get an email notification telling me what she ordered. Is there any way around this, for privacy sake? I don’t see why I am privy to her purchases. She can also see what I have ordered within her own account. We would like our two accounts to be separate so we can buy each other gifts, etc. I wish I was able to help, but this doesn’t seem right. I have two other people hooked to my Prime Account and I can’t see anything they order or anything about their accounts. They can’t see anything about mine. Are you sure you both are actually logging into two separate accounts?  This seems to be the only plausible explanation of why you would receive this information. I have never heard anyone have this issue before.  I would recommend calling Amazon to see if they have an explanation, if you find that both of you are truly logging into separate accounts when shopping. I shared my prime account with my mom, now everything I order she is notified via email, just like the earlier post from Byron.  Can you let me know how you figured out to turn that off?  I looked and can’t find anything. Hello MJCamm. Is your mom’s email in your account for some reason?  I share with my dad and sister and they can’t see my orders. I also know a lot of people who do this with no issue. There is also no official thread or sites that talk about this issue from what I can tell. I just don’t see it talked about except for you and Byron. Not saying it’s not happening, as it obviously is, but I share my account with no problems and so do many of my friends and co-workers. I would love to help you, but maybe you should check to see what emails you have in your account to make sure your mom’s is not there. Hey Valerie, You can try it out and if you don't like it,then you can return it. I would try it out. If all goes well and depending on your… Hey Chris, The Mohu Channels hooks into your existing antenna. This deal comes with the antenna if you don't have one already. The Channels allows you to seamlessly work with… That looks pretty cool. We have a Tivo with lifetime service, and I'm thankful that they finally added a netflix app so that we don't have to switch over to… Grayson, Are there more channels offered through Mohu's Antenna versus a traditional HD Antenna? We currently use an outdoor HD Antenna at 27 miles away from broadcasting towers and we… I've been trying to do away with my cable but haven't been able to find a product I like to replace it with.
