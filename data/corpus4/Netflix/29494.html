What Netflix's Earnings Really Prove - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Netflix added 4.9 million new subs in its last quarter; 4.3 million in the quarter before that. This proves that Netflix is still priced at any extraordinarily low price. It's such high demand and the opportunity to raise monthly prices long-term that make Netflix's seemingly expensive stock look quite attractive. For all of the great things we're seeing at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), such as 20% revenue growth and margin improvements, the most important metric is the rate at which Netflix is gaining new subscribers. The company now has 62 million monthly subscribers, adding 4.9 million total subscribers (U.S. and international) during this most recent quarter and 4.3 million in the quarter before that. This incredible level of subscriber growth and retention proves one thing, and that thing leads to the reason why shares of Netflix are still a long-term hold even at new all-time highs of $530 (afterhours). What Netflix proved is that even after large monthly price hikes over the last couple years, its streaming services are still priced at a point that consumers flock to. In essence, Netflix's services are just too economical now that it has invested billions of dollars in content with vast viewing options and original content. Since 2011, Netflix's streaming services have increased from roughly $5 a month (DVD+streaming was $9.99) to $8.99 per month. That's a sizable increase, one that many consumers have complained about in dramatic fashion over the years. Yet despite this increase, Netflix remains the cheapest content king on the block, although it is also one of the largest. Both HBO Now and Dish's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling, streaming competitors to Netflix, are priced at $15 a month. PlayStation is taking the premium route, charging almost $50 a month for services. While significantly higher than Netflix's prices, these prices are nothing compared to the $117.30 that DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) earned per subscriber during its last quarter, which might I add was a near $5.50 increase year-over-year. The point being is that Netflix still has a lot of room in front of it to increase prices in the years ahead - $8.99 per month is still very cheap. Given Netflix's large collection of content, its dominant user base, and its award-winning critically acclaimed original series, there's no reason that Netflix shouldn't charge more, and won't. if anything, Dish, HBO, and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) just set the bar higher for Netflix, making it more acceptable for Netflix to increase prices to $12 to $15 a month with little backlash. Therefore, with Netflix's now $31 billion valuation, it might look pricey at 100x next year's earnings, but the opportunity to increase prices anywhere from 50% to 100% long-term creates a golden opportunity for further margin expansion and explosive revenue growth for many years to come. That said, many will object to this theory. Many will say that if Netflix were to charge $15 per month that they would no longer use the service. However, many of those same people pay $50 to $100 a month for pay-TV, bringing little logic to this theory. In fact, the only theory that's supported with actual proof is that media companies always increase prices as the cost of content rises and their content assortment grows. DirecTV and Dish are perfect examples, as their revenue per user rises annually to reflect increased costs for content. Hence, if these companies can do it, then so can Netflix as it continues to invest in content of its own. All things considered, I am in Netflix for the long haul. Sure, it looks expensive today, but when you start thinking about the opportunity to increase monthly prices and the potential for new revenue channels like video on demand for big budget films , I believe the future is bright for Netflix. If anything, Netflix's last quarter helped to confirm my belief, as its continued subscriber growth is proof that consumers still see the service as a great value play, and will continue to do so even with future price hikes.
