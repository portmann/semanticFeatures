Is Netflix Setup For Weakness After The Stock Split? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix announces a 7:1 stock split effective July 15. The stock trades down after an initial jump due to Carl Icahn selling his holdings. The recent stock-split announcement from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) continues a recent trend of stocks finally deciding to split after prices reach well beyond $100. In several situations the companies chose to forgo splits for a long-time and finally relented for a split far beyond the normal 2:1 split of the past. A lot of news going around predicts whether the split is a warning sign based on the results of the past split of Netflix over a decade ago. As well, a lot of analysis focuses on a similar 7:1 split undertaken by tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Unfortunately, most of the analysis attempts to create a one size fits all scenario. In reality, several different variables feed into how the stock trades after the split. Considering Netflix already has a prime example of what happens to the stock after a split, it is easy to overly focus on that scenario and assume the same outcome occurs again, but that doesn't provide very solid research. As a quick review, Netflix last split back in 2004. The stock went on a huge run in 2003 leading up to the split including a surge in the stock price in early 2004. As the below chart shows, the stock went from $10 to nearly $40 and back to $10 all within a year prior to and after the stock split. Ultimately, anybody reviewing this article knows that Netflix now sits considerably higher a decade later. Even an investor buying the stock right at the last split is very happy right now. The difference though is the time value of money and the magnitude of the return based on the current stock price of $660. High: February 12, 2004 @ $37.87 = 1,643% return With very few stock splits in the last 15 years after the market crash in 2000, limited examples exist of stock split outcomes. A couple of recent examples that fall into line with the Netflix split are Apple and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ). The two stocks had varying outcomes for the next year. In the case of Apple, the stock had made a run up to $700 (now $100 split adjusted) in the prior years and sold off hard. After a rebound from the lows, the 7:1 split took place in part due to investor anxiety that the high stock price was part of the reason that the stock failed to press forward. In the case of MasterCard, the stock split 10:1 in early 2014 after a long run in the stock. The stock hit all-time highs right prior to the split and consequently spent the next year working off the excessive gains of the prior year. Even now nearly 18 months later, MasterCard trades at around $94 after reaching nearly $85 in early 2014. The key to all of these scenarios including the original Netflix split more than a decade ago is that the stocks eventually rallied beyond the previous highs. The cheap stock (Apple) not at all-time highs at the time of the split immediately produced gains. The expensive stocks (Netflix and MasterCard) sitting at highs prior to the split struggled for an extended period of time before eventually setting new highs. The analysis suggests that the results of a stock post split depends greatly on how the stock performed prior to the split. In essence, a split due to a change in a corporate mindset or an arbitrary decision to split a stock such as the Apple scenario acts as an immediate catalyst for the stock. In the case of MasterCard, the split occurred after large gains and was undertaken in a manner that cooled the momentum on the stock. With Netflix doubling this year alone, the stock split aligns with the previous scenario of cooling the stock momentum. Of course, the Carl Icahn decision to dump the stock will impact the peak scenario that the stock split was about to produce with the Netflix originally jumping to $700 on the news. This move down to $660 might temper some of the dramatic movement to the high side, but it doesn't change the likely weakness in the stock for the next year.
