It's simply not credible.  What is more likely is bots and spam. I know because you can buy FB, twittergram, instachat, etc, accounts in bulk. Wed, 11/04/2015 - 16:42 | 6750385 hotrod Quit Facebook years ago and dont miss it.  Zuck has a liberal agenda including H1B escalation and no borders which negatively affects USA citizens.  People should delete FB. Wed, 11/04/2015 - 16:45 | 6750400 KCMLO Wonder what the downstream revenue is for their advertisers.  I still use it to promote a side business, I even tried their post promotion twice, nothing but click-farmers and no net benefit. I use an ad blocker and never see their crap on my screen, I can't imagine that advertisers are seeing a net positive out of Facebook, I could obviously be very wrong though... Wed, 11/04/2015 - 16:47 | 6750421 hotrod Have two younger daughters college age.  Live on FB.  Never bought a thing on it or look at the ADS.  They tune all that out.  My wife hates that things she looks at on the NET show up in FB ADS.  Tracking her. Wed, 11/04/2015 - 16:46 | 6750404 hotrod Had the Govt required people to display their lives and profiles on the net there would have been a REVOLT.  FB did it for the Govt. and everyone just offers it up.  Like Zuck said. " The Dumbfuchs just send me their information.
