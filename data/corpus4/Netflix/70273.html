This Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) is breaking out big time for my charitable trust. I know that yours is good, but I think mine's better. Gray Television (NYSE: GTN ) (NYSE: GTN.A ): "They are doing incredibly well." Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ): "Netflix is very tricky. I like Netflix as a concept stock, It's testified on the idea that the market cap is too small given the idea of how big this company can be. So I am blessing." EMC Corp (NYSE: EMC ): "I think it's stalled, I think it's stuck. I prefer to see you in Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) right here at $29. Make that change, make it tomorrow morning." Chuy's Holdings (NASDAQ: CHUY ): "This restaurant group has become way too hard. I think you should buy Jack in the Box (NASDAQ: JACK ) because that stock just keeps going down." Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ): "I think the D-RAM business has peaked. I like the semis that are cellphone oriented." Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR ): "I think the stock is breaking out and the company is not doing well. This stock is searching for a reason that's why it's going up. I like Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) and Cummins (NYSE: CMI ) more."
