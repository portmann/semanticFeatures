Netflix Investors: Ignore The Negativity - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is bringing back the iconic Tanner family with â€œFuller House,â€? a reboot of the classic â€œFull Houseâ€? sitcom. While nostalgia over the series has sparked sizable buzz and anticipation, critics are essentially ripping the show for the same thing that made it such a hit. For Netflix, the appeal of â€œFuller Houseâ€? is more about the cachet the program brings to the network and its heavy influence in the hotly-contested kids/tween market. "Whatever happened to predictability?" That is the first line of the iconic theme song from Full House, the long-running ABC series that helped launch the careers of John Stamos, Bob Saget and of course the Olsen twins (among others). On Friday, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) revived the series with Fuller House, a continuation of the original with a new twist on the classic formula. Yet in an ironic twist, the biggest draw to bring back the series is also turning into its biggest criticism. For Netflix this series is a big get and a big win, but you wouldn't know it from the reviews. To say the critic's feedback has been negative is an understatement. The reviews at times are borderline scathing, but what's interesting is what they all have in common is going under the radar. Yet predictability, simplicity and familiarity is exactly what made the original show work in the first place. It was a non-thinking comedy with a fun cast, and we knew that almost every problem would be solved within a half hour. It's the same thing with Boy Meets World, Step By Step, Family Matters and the many (MANY) others that were part of ABC's "TGIF" block. So that begs the questionsâ€¦ should Netflix and its investors care about the negative reviews? Simply put â€¦ no. After all, as the cast smartly reminded the media, negative reviews didn't impact the original in the least. Now some may argue the critics don't ever have influence on Netflix because the streamer doesn't release ratings, but that's not the reality. Strong reviews for House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are what helped propel this cord-cutter revolution in the first place. Had those series not been guided by such veteran skilled hands as David Fincher, Beau Willimon and Jenji Kohan this could be a completely different conversation. To be fair, at times Fuller House's critics are also united in the fact that they see the folly in their own reviews. They know you are not watching this series because you are expecting high-brow, thought-provoking comedy. You're watching because you either grew up on the original or your kids have become addicted to the originals. And that's the pointâ€¦ that's why Netflix put this show into production. Its executive team gets this show comes with a built-in audience, and that's a big draw. You actually have to give the studio credit, as while they have resurrected a few shows, they haven't gone overboard. Arrested Development, The Killing and Longmire each served a dual purpose. Aside from giving their audience more new content, the deals included the show's archives. What's interesting here is that Full House ISN'T a part of the deal. The original episodes are currently not streaming on Netflix, which is a little surprising. Then again greenlighting Fuller House wasn't about the past, it was about keeping an eye out on the future. To stay competitive, Netflix is looking at all avenues. What's lost in the conversation is that this series marks the first multi-camera project for the network. Until now all the network's shows have been single-camera programs, and both House and the upcoming The Ranch will have that "live-audience" vibe. The other angle of importance to Netflix is that, again, this is at its heart a tween series. While many people skip over the parts in Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) releases that discuss kids programming, the truth is it's a big deal. The kid media sector is massive and a lot of Netflix's and Amazon's audiences heavily utilize that programming. Full House usually blurred the line between kid and adult content without ever alienating either side. If Fuller House can do the same thing, it will see the same type of success â€¦ and so will Netflix.
