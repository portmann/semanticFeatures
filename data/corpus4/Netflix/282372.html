Sudden Massive Buyer Appears As Apple Breaks $100 | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Many of us are wishing to be bold, and maybe even  revolutionary.  But we are far too comfortable, and also too afraid.  Iceland refused to be blackmailed. Iceland refused to take on the extra debt (and debt slavery) that came with the blackmail. Iceland refused to touch its social programs. Iceland has the strongest...

Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:12 | 7006196 Looney I will start buying Apple products only when they ditch all this iCrap and start making (in the USA) shovels or, better yet, PITCHFORKS!  ;-) Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:13 | 7006207 thesonandheir Wed, 01/06/2016 - 16:37 | 7006762 Tarzan IPooP, a social media generated rating of every public tiolet in the  WORLD!  Now that would be a useful Apple product.  Traveling Moms the  world over would thank them! Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:21 | 7006258 KnuckleDragger-X I have an original Apple II and an original Mac that I've modified a lot over the years. Apple turned into hipster crap with the iPod and want Nazi in their lock-in. IBM as been dieing for 15 years and is finally going terminal. That is Apples future...... Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:28 | 7006299 DetectiveStern I'm a fan of their computers, more so because I hate windows and Linux doesn't run programs I use. I've had 2 macbooks that lasted 8 years between them. In the middle of the 2 macs I had windows laptops that lasted a year each. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:32 | 7006319 sun tzu My windoze Dell PC is 10 years old and running like new still on XP. I replaced the hard drive with a SSD and its faster than when I first got it. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:40 | 7006400 RobD I have an 8yo dell that has a new hard drive and memory and upgraded to windows 7, it still gets the job done but is definitely getting slower putting up web pages. Helped my nephew bring up a raspberry Pi project this last week running some form of Linux. For such a small unit it was faster then the old dell, pretty cool for $40. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 16:04 | 7006424 LowerSlowerDela... I just put Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) onto a Chromebook that I bought new for $95 last month.  Pretty cool little solid state laptop for $95.  I put LibreOffice (does everything that Microsoft Office does - for free) on it and it works great. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 15:41 | 7006405 LowerSlowerDela... Yeah (writing this on a Macbook Pro, solid state drive), all of my PCs have been way more dependable than my Macs.  I still use a seven year old netbook PC for some things.  It's a great little machine.  I've had to have my Mac motherboard replaced as it fried after 9 months. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 16:26 | 7006657 Panafrican Funk... Apple should get into the console gaming business.  That's about the only obvious market I can think of that they're missing right now.   Wed, 01/06/2016 - 16:17 | 7006616 edifice When is the iMothership supposed to be completed, anyway?
