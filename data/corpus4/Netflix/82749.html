Netflix Gaps Up On No New News - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The Momentum Train continues into lofty levels. Analysts are jumping on the $700 bandwagon. Hard to fight the gaps, difficult short. Stop loss limits keep you honest, and every once in a while you need to take a good licking to keep your ego in check and to sharpen your pencil more before you hit the buy or sell button. On Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), I'm not talking my book, because the short position was closed out this morning after 2 days of abuse, and there's not room for emotions in the trading book. According to all public news sources, there has been no news on this stock to justify the bump up. The stock split was anticipated, the international expansion (e.g., China, Spain) is inherent in their forecasts, and should be expected. In fact, one could argue that this is already all priced into the stock (that was my error in thinking). At current levels, Netflix is priced to flawless execution over the next 40 years. That does not imply a recommendation to be stubborn and short the stock. I'm not a glutton for punishment. I'm not bullish on the stock either, and my opinion on the valuation of this stock is clearly wrong right now. Nevertheless, the buying frenzy will cool down - it always does - and when the price of NFLX settles at its new perch, then all eyes will be on the July 21 earnings announcement. Despite management's forecast of incurring net losses through 2017, the continued growth of subscribers will have analysts salivating at the prospect of 200 million subscribers by 2020 (100 million in US, 100 million International) - yes, I will provide a link to illustrate that those numbers are achievable. And if the company is able execute on such growth, while keeping costs in check, and then maintaining simple growth over the next 45 years along with a generous and increasing dividend, then the stock is fairly priced. In keeping with my goal of encouraging evaluation and analysis of valuation models, I've prepared a forecast on googledocs so that the reader can get one view of what the embedded assumptions are on this meteor. I used a dividend discount as an illustration, but again, there's a ton of model approaches out there, feel free to try them out. 16% Growth in US streaming over next 5 years Payout increasing at 2% thereafter (for those who look at PV of dividends for a stock value - and that's never the case for these momentum plays) Add all that up, discount the cash flows (with a 1% rate) and the stock should be worth $689! In other words, it's priced to perfection, and then some. I suppose a good deal of the gaps up were suckers like me who got stopped out, and squeezed, but that's the way the momentum train rolls. The momentum stock is guaranteed to inflict the maximum pain on the short as possible, until it doesn't, and those who are on the right trade at the right time will feel smart and make a good return. One should never let the feeling of intelligence come from a good or bad stock trade, but, again, that's one of those facts of life. We feel smart when we make a good trade, stupid when we make a bad trade. The goal is to not let the bad trades turn into stubborn "investments". So, while I will sit and wait to execute a short trade again on the stock, I'm under no illusions that the price could rise to somewhere in the 700-720 range. The easier trade would have been to hop on the momentum train...
