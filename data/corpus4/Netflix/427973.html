A Deeper Dive Into Netflix's New 'Binge Scale' - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix recently released a â€œBinge Scaleâ€? that shows which programs are the most binged and which ones audiences take longer to finish. The scale looks at which series are â€œdevouredâ€? such as fantasy and sci-fi programs and which are â€œsavoredâ€? like political dramas and irreverent comedies. Netflix gathered the data off the global viewing habits of people in over 190 countries across 100 serialized series. The data shows a number of the networkâ€™s more well-known series are among those that are â€œsavored.â€?. Netflix can use that data to help craft future programming plans while other networks can look at it to try and mimic the streamerâ€™s success. No doubt that answer has changed over and over again over the last few years. A large part of that shift comes from the emergence of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and other streaming leaders. As a result the idea of success based on ratings doesn't apply to a whole new crop of shows; largely because we have no idea how many people are actually watching them. Netflix and the like are notoriously secretive with ratings data so when any morsel of information comes outâ€¦it's a big deal. And that just happened again as the "Netflix Binge Scale" has been released . The network responsible for giving "binging" a brand new meaning is doubling down on the term and wants to you know it. The scale looks at which type of shows are the most binged and which ones take audiences more time to power through. On it shows that are quickly digested are labeled as being "devoured" and shows that take longer to watch are classified as those being "savored." It's actually fascinating to see the breakdown characteristics as Netflix clearly has spent time here. For example shows that are "devoured" are ones that elicit a reaction or a strong emotional response. Conversely, "savored" programs are more thought-provoking and open to interpretation. So what falls where? That's actually what makes the data so interesting. Simply put more fantasy and sci-fi series are quickly watched while audiences of political dramas and irreverent comedies take their time. Netflix came to these conclusions after examining the global viewing habits of people in over 190 countries across 100 serialized series. If you think about that breakdown it makes sense because what it's saying is fairly obvious. Shows like House of Cards take longer to watch because you really have to pay attention to what's going on. And let's be honest you get to a point where you get tired of following Frank Underwood's latest scheme and need a mindless drama like Walking Dead (pun intended) to break the mood. What surprises me about the scale though is the steep difference between irreverent comedies and dramatic comedies. It never really occurred to me that people may need more time to watch a smarter series like Arrested Development and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt even though they are half the length of what are more dramatic comedies like Orange Is The New Black or Parenthood. It's an interesting observation. And thinking back on my own viewing habits I do tend to binge on Orange faster than I do Cards. Yet the one glaring (at least to me) omission is where a show like Fuller House would fall. It's not as smart as Arrested and nowhere near as dramatic as Weeds That particular outlier aside the scale provides something that is of value to Netflix and even more so to the industry. Let's start with what it means to Netflix because something funny happens when you look close at the results. You'll notice most of the network's marquee programs fall into the "savored" category while its more niche fair is "devoured." That's a handy piece of information right there for programmers and executives to have. While the network would never say it, basically what it means is that Netflix's more popular and successful shows are the ones that are more thought-provoking. So if I'm a Netflix executive that's going to make me want to order more shows like Narcos and Daredevil over shows like Marco Polo and Sense8. Now two things with that statementâ€¦first that doesn't mean there's no place on Netflix for a Marco Polo or Sense8 it just means the mainstream public has not embraced it on the same level. The other thing is I know a few people may be thinking how can I say certain shows are Netflix's most popular without ratings data to back it up? You have to look at what is more important to Netflix and that's two things; media attention and awards recognition. Both of those are big drivers for subscribers so those are the ones that move the needle. Those are the House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black's that get on the covers of TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly and get the award nominations. Those are also the newer entries like Narcos and Master of None's that get on the critics' must-watch lists and stand a good chance of breaking through come award season. Those are the shows that give you the subscribers to be able to carry a broad spectrum of programming. And all of those shows are clearly on one side (or on the fringes of one side) of the scale, while the bubble shows (aka shows that may or may not have a long term future) are on the other. Again to be clear that has nothing to do with quality or even likeability of these shows; it just has to do with what TV viewers are seemingly drawn to at this point in time. Certain shows just click better. Unfortunately for the rest of the market, the scale doesn't really help as much when it comes to advertiser's needs. For them they are going to buy time based on what shows they think are going to be watched live in the moment. Yet with the new emphasis on "stacking rights," these learnings do start to apply to a larger field. Also what this does for Netflix's rivals is help them pinpoint more about the viewing habits of its base and which programs seem to resonate more with which personality. As a result they can then develop similar programming rosters that could draw eyeballs back to their network and THAT becomes valuable for advertisers. While some of those results should be obvious, look at a show like Bojack Horseman. How many people guessed that was more binged than House of Cards?
