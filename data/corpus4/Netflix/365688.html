Intel Processors With Integrated 4G/LTE Are Urgently Needed - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The Intel Atom x3 SoFIA processor with integrated 4G/LTE cellular baseband feature is still a no-show. This delay has forced Intelâ€™s partner Asustek to reduce its order of x86 phone processors this year. The smartphone is still important toward the long-term viability of x86 processors. Aicha Evans, head of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) troubled mobile phone division is reportedly quitting . Her replacement must prioritize x86 processors with built-in 4G/LTE modems. Failure to do so only worsens Intel's smartphone processor business. Intel's struggle on smartphones is due to its failure to adopt fast enough to changing trends. Due to the aggressive roll-out of LTE networks by carriers, there are now more than 1 billion 4G mobile connections. By 2020, 4G is expected to account for a third of the estimated 9 billion mobile broadband connections. Telecom firms, which spent billions of dollars on their LTE network infrastructure, also are spending big money on advertising their faster/cheaper mobile broadband services. The informed mobile users are therefore rallying around the big shift toward 4G-only phones. The superior upload/download speed of 4G connectivity is a must among mobile users accustomed to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) streaming and hours-long YouTube sessions. Intel's processor designs should quickly adjust toward favoring 4G/LTE-compatible phone models. Very few tier-one phone manufacturers will bet on outdated 3G-only Atom x3 SoFIA processors. An all-in-one, System-on-Chip like the LTE Cat. The 4-equipped Snapdragon 212 from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is certainly more attractive than the current generation 3G-only Intel Atom x3. MediaTek also has cheap octa-core 4G-compatible processors that dominate China-sourced entry-level Android phones. Without an offer of substantial subsidies/discounts, Intel's 3G-only Atom x3-C3130 and x3-C323XRK are endangered species. Kitguru reported last year that Intel would release the mid-range Atom x3-C344X System-on-Chip (SoC) with integrated 4G/LTE baseband feature early in 2016. However, the first quarter of this year is over and this 4G SoC is still a no-show. Intel also has remained mum over the updates/development of the Atom x3-C344X. This lack of communication from Intel is a big letdown for manufacturers. It's no surprise that Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ), Intel's biggest client for Atom phone processors, will reduce its exposure to x86 phone SoCs. Not meeting the requirements of its biggest phone partner only discourages other tier-one phone vendors from experimenting with x86 phone SoCs. Due to the tardiness of Intel, Qualcomm and MediaTek will instead get more orders from Asustek this year. This is a very disappointing development. Asustek shipped out 20 million smartphones last year - 30% of them had Intel CPUs and modems. Asustek now plans to use Intel-made processors only on 20% of the 25 million phones it expects to ship out this year. The blame is entirely on Intel. It has failed to keep up with the processor designs of its rivals. The lack of a cost-effective 4G-compatible Atom processor product definitely compelled Asustek to source out more of its processor needs from Qualcomm/MediaTek. Evans' replacement needs to be more aggressive in prodding Intel's chip designers to catch up with their peers over at Qualcomm/MediaTek. It is not enough for Intel to create Atom processors that can match the energy-efficiency and pricing of ARM-based mobile processors. The next big hurdle now is for Intel to demonstrate it can create a competent 4G/LTE modem-equipped smartphone SoC. On a brighter note, Intel's smartphone campaign is in no danger of dying anytime soon. Asustek is still expected to order 5 million Atom x86 processors for its phones this year. However, the delay or uncertainty over the eventual release of 4G/LTE-equipped Atom processors still needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Intel needs to make a firm announcement that it is still committed to building better smartphone processors. Intel cannot give up its fight for smartphones. I believe that, aside from tablets and 2-in-1 notebooks, the smartphone industry still offers a worthy expansion area for Intel-made processors. The smartphone is the next evolution of office and home computing. I expect the eventual fusion of smartphones and personal computers. This fusion already is here with the upcoming release of HP's (NYSE: HPQ ) Elite X3 smartphone/laptop computer product. However, the Elite X3 is still an incomplete implementation of the smartphone/laptop concept. Due to its ARM-based Snapdragon 820 processor, the HP Elite X3 cannot run full desktop versions of Excel or Photoshop. I look forward to Intel and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) eventually coming up with a smartphone that runs the real full version of Windows 10, not the watered-down mobile version. Unlike ARM-based SoCs, Intel's x86 processor can run all the popular enterprise/productivity-focused operating systems (and their corresponding industry-standard software). Microsoft's Continuum for Phones concept can never achieve its full potential without Intel's x86 processor. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, QCOM.
