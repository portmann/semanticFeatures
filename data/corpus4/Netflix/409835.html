Netflix Launches Its Own Speed Test Website â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. How fast is your download? a new tool netflix speed test fast.com streaming download speed There are dozens of websites that can determine the download speeds of your current Internet connection. Starting this week, thereâ€™s another, this time from Netflix.Â  The video streaming service announced Wednesday that it would launch Fast.com, a second website that allows users to see how fast their Internet connection really is. Because Netflix is all about video â€” and quality of that content â€” Fast.com only focuses on download speeds, which determines the quality of video appearing on your screen. Hereâ€™s how it works: go to fast.com, and the test begins â€” thereâ€™s not even a button to push. The test is complete when the grey number turns a solid black color. Users can then compare the results with other speed test sites. â€œWe all want a faster, better Internet, yet Internet speeds vary greatly and can be affected by other users on your network or congestion with your Internet service provider,â€? David Fullagar, vice president of content delivery architecture for Netflix, said in a blog post. â€œWhen youâ€™re experiencing streaming issues, fast.com allows you to check the download speeds youâ€™re getting from your Internet service provider.â€? The company notes that fast.com is a bit different from its Netflix ISP Speed Index, as that test measures average monthly speeds of actual streams during prime hours. Fast.com is the second tool Netflix has introduced in recent weeks that aims improve users insight and control over the service. Earlier this month, the company launched a â€œCellular Data Usageâ€? setting within its iOS and Android apps that allows users to decide for themselves how much data they spend on movies and TV show viewing.
