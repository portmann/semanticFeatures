Amazon Prime Videos To Finally Be Downloadable On iOS, Android Devices â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. The latest version of the Amazon Video app for Android allows for offline viewing of Amazon Prime movies and TV shows. One of the selling points of Amazon Fire tablets — especially for frequent travelers and parents whose kids like to watch movies while riding in the back seat — is that Amazon Prime members can download videos for offline viewing. This option has not been available for Prime members using iOS or non-Amazon Android devices. But now Amazon is giving these members the ability to download movies and shows to watch at their convenience. Re/code notes that Amazon now lists iOS and Android devices as compatible for downloadable Prime Content . Amazon’s non-Prime rental and digital purchase content has long been available for download on iOS and Android, but when it came to the Prime video library, downloading was only allowed on Amazon-branded devices. It was a feature that set the service apart from other subscription video streamers like Netflix, but which few users could take advantage of. Now, instead of using downloadability as a way of selling Fire tablets, Amazon appears to be hoping that it will win over new customers to Prime. Of course, as Fire tablet owners can attest, not every Prime video is available for download. The e-tailer has to negotiate this feature for each of the titles it carries and some distributors either want too much or just simply say no.
