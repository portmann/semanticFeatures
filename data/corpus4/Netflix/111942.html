Learn more about PRO » Disney (DIS) is a wonderful company and a contender for the Buffett/Munger honor in terms of its wide moat and relative pricing power. While DIS is a wonderful company (and 97% of the opinionated pieces on Seeking Alpha since May have reminded us of that fact), the valuation metrics are simply horrendous. Despite love from the DGI crowd, DIS dividend growth over the past 5 years is only 8% annualized when normalized for payout ratio. DIS faces cyclical exposure and capital intensive commitments via resorts, movie and merchandise blow-outs are fully priced, and its cash cow ESPN is ill-prepared for potentially disastrous secular shifts. Disney is extremely expensive (based on free cash flow), poised for a massive plunge if a single tripping factor is hit. 40-60% downside potential. This is another contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue chip holdings. I keep approximately 70-80% of my assets indexed and in blue chips, so this is a very important field for me. As I've stated before, my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price, although I appreciate (and prefer) a strong bargain, quality companies rarely go on a fire sale. When they do, there's often deeper concerns. As Buffett and Munger best put it, "it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." This week, I'm taking a different approach and profiling a true "Buffett/Munger firm" that trades for far beyond its reasonable fair value. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ) is a wonderful company, trading into a very expensive price range, with downside of over 41% even to a rich valuation limit. If DIS traded at the mid-point of traditional blue-chips (roughly 15x of 3y average free cash flow), DIS has up to 60% downside. I believe there are significant risks to those who invest in DIS based on recent earnings, future content prospects, or dividend growth expectations due to extreme headwinds facing Disney's #1 cash cow (ESPN) and to the inherently cyclical and capital-intensive theme park and cruise line business. I believe that none of ESPN's risks are priced in and that the market is not prepared for a potential cyclical entertainment downturn, after five straight years of increased performance. Disney is often touted by dividend growth investor (DGI) types for its extremely impressive dividend growth rates, backed up by rapidly improving fundamentals and continual share repurchases. This is not an attack against the DGI investment strategy, I think there are strong merits to that approach, but the relative entry-point of an investment and its realistic growth trajectory are far more important than focusing on a myopic view of dividend increases. At first glance, Disney has grown its dividend by 17.2% annualized over the past 10 years, with eye-popping 5-year annualized growth of 27%. The chart below shows the relative ascent. In 2005, the yield for DIS was approximately 1.1%, the yield in 2010 was 1.1%, and the current yield is 1.15%. Meanwhile the payout percentage of free cash flow in 2005 was 20%, the payout percentage in 2010 was 15%, and the current payout percentage is approximately 34%. The dividend growth is indeed impressive, but the payout percentages have doubled since 2010 while the yield remains flat. This is something that the basic DGI premise misses. Accounting for a flat payout ratio, the 10-yr and 5-yr annualized growth in dividends would be closer to 11% and 8% respectively. Keep that 8-11% in mind when considering the valuation multiples. Disney has steadily repurchased shares over the past decade, which has allowed a Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm roll-up while still reducing the total share count - remarkably impressive! Over the past 10 years, DIS has spent $34.2B (net) to reduce the share count by approximately 348M shares, or approximately $98.28 per share. The average price paid seems rather atrocious, but this is due to heavy share compensation and the roll-up issuances. This is actually a pretty impressive expansion and repurchase program, one of the best I've ever seen. DIS has received a bargain purchase on all three of its major studio acquisitions, partially due to what I perceive as the "good home" discount. Disney thrives from a full-circle eco-system spurred by strong historical and future pipelines of proprietary content from the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm brands. Disney profits upfront from their production, and then continues to "milk" the content value through merchandise sales, theme park deals, and network licensing. Each visit to a theme park also bolsters the demand for merchandise and spurs interest in future content. Unlike other movie production firms, the profit share directly from the theater tickets and DVD sales is only a fraction of the total lifecycle profit potential. In addition to the content lifecycle, the strong DIS asset is their network brands, primarily ESPN. ESPN is the world's strongest sports news and live coverage brand, and has no direct competition. Disney has no legitimate equal in the content world, with the closest peers including Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB ). Disney's Pixar Studios has provided DIS with 15 continuous smash hits shown in the clipping below. Pixar has never produced a single dud, and every single release has grossed more than $500M in current terms. The below wallpaper design from Deviant Art highlights all the Pixar movies sans Inside Out. The sheet below highlights the history for all of Pixar movies, taken from the-numbers.com . Arguably the "worst" return on investment was from Cars 2, with a profit of "only" 180%, ignoring the inherent strengthening of the merchandise and theme-park branding. Disney's Marvel Studios has only improved under Disney management and has consistently churned out successful films. See below for the latest from "Disney Movies Anywhere" With Lucasfilm (Star Wars) also in the fold (including the separate rights to Indiana Jones), Disney has a virtually limitless pipeline of films well into the 2020s, with a strong likelihood of producing at least 2-3 blockbusters per year. This is before including the vast potential of the legacy content library, Disney channel programming, Disney-branded cartoons, and network licensing. Disney profits in a minimum of four stages from each successful movie release cycle: box-office, DVD/streaming, merchandise, and legacy interaction - which includes theme parks and cruises. Disney is extremely family-friendly, much more so than Universal Studios or even Dreamworks, which often leans towards more mature animation films. Disney has grown merchandise sales year-over-year over the entirety of the past decade and their theme park profits have been on a steady uptrend since hitting a low in Fiscal 2010. Boosts from new smash-hit movies such as Frozen and the upcoming Star Wars will reverberate for years and continue to trickle in profits. This cycle is reinforcing as fun theme park visits are associated with future Disney movies and the movies themselves serve as a sort of implicit advertisement for merchandise. Disney owns 80% of ESPN, and this is their true source (along with their namesake channel) of the majority of company profits and a vast majority of the profit growth over the past decade. ESPN is the world's leader in sports content, and shows no sign of weakening its dominance of sports content. ESPN is unparalleled in sports coverage and has a practical monopoly over the industry. Profits have been exploding, not due to enhanced subscription growth, but rather due to Disney's stranglehold over cable companies. ESPN has steadily increased its subscriber fee by over 20% per year since the mid-2000s, and is currently more expensive , by a factor of 4, than its closest channel competitor (TNT) and is almost 10x as expensive as Fox Sports. Those multiples only factor ESPN, and not ESPN2 or ESPNU. Investors often tout Disney and its family appeal and timeless content when considering the business prospects of an investment. Most write-ups and glowing news articles I read don't even mention the major source of growth. As DIS reaches record heights and is arguably the most overpriced blue chip in the entire stock market, articles come out touting " the No. 1 Stock in the World ." ESPN is often added in as an afterthought or as some sort of bonus property. No. You don't just "add in ESPN" as a cherry on top. ESPN is the story of growth. Disney is more dependent on ESPN's performance for their profits than they are on Pixar, Marvel, parks, cruises, and toys- put together. Note I'm not concerned about ESPN's continued domination of sports content, but rather their continued dominance of cablecos and millions of unwitting subscribers. ESPN-fueled growth (of the total cable business) accounted for 60% of the profit growth over the past decade and now accounts for a total of 56% of the total profits. When you buy DIS today, you aren't buying the House of Mouse with a 'side' of sports anymore - you are now buying the King of Monopolized Sports who also has a Mouse (and super hero buddies who live in a galaxy far far away…). I submit the logo below (creative mashup by yours truly) for consideration, but I doubt Disney corporate will adopt it! The below table from the most recent annual report ( 2014 10-K ) highlights the subscribers of each of Disney's network properties. Note the 95M subscribers to the ESPN package? How many of these subscribers would remain if they had to pay the effective commercialized rate of $36.30 per month? Note that research has shown that the "average" viewer believes ESPN is worth $1.45 per month, while DIS currently extorts cable networks to the tune of $6.10 per subscriber. With the major dependence on keeping its artificially high subscriber count (due to a lack, i.e. non-existence, of consumer channel preferencing), it's no wonder that Disney isn't responding well to Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) 'skinny TV' initiatives and that Disney CEO Iger is waging a misinformation campaign of his own. If you wonder why "Disney is in no hurry to offer the network as a direct-to-consumer product," it's most likely because income will plummet as the average of those 95M people only value ESPN at $1.45, not the $6.10 they are currently paying (plus cable/internet/etc. costs and markup), and certainly not the $36.30 ESPN would need to make the same profit. The table below shows just how outrageously profitable the cable networks are, with 43% profit margins compared to a more "normalized" 14% profit margin for the broadcasting sector. It's funny how the mainstream commentary focuses on how content-streaming ports like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will destroy the profit margins at HBO and cable companies like Time Warner (NYSE: TWC ) or Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), when in reality it's the strong cable content producers who are really raking in the profits (on a margin basis), and have much more to lose. ESPN makes the lion's share of its profits from (unsustainable) subscription revenues, at nearly double the rate of its advertising profit. The first cracks of ESPN's strength are beginning to emerge, and I expect this trend to be a long-term drag on profit growth. Note, I'm not predicting disaster at ESPN, I still think it's a great brand, but let's be honest about the source of growth and its future potential. When you're buying the most expensive blue chip on the market, you need that growth. Disney is enjoying an extremely successful summer and anticipation for a global blowout performance via the 7th episode of Star Wars , scheduled for Christmas 2015. Star Wars is most likely going to be the most successful move production in world history (not inflation adjusted), but we're already paying for that. Never mind the fact that even in last year's all-time record performance, "studio entertainment" only accounted for 11.9% of profits. Even if DIS somehow boosts their profits by an unthinkable 2x, this barely moves the EPS needle beyond expectations. What about all that merchandise? Last year was another record performance for that sector, with profits more than double their 2012 levels. Even with merchandise through the roof, we're still only considering 10% of total profits. Toy-making and peddling can be a tough gig, even when you have strong branding and product potential. Just ask Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ), or see the chart below. DIS holds the power by licensing and advertising these toys implicitly via studio content, and Disney currently makes almost as much money as Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT ) and Hasbro combined times two. There's a reason to be bullish, but also to be realistic about upside potential via struggling toymakers, and also to use perspective about the upside potential involving a business that's only 10% of the firm. Disney's Parks & Resorts are a wonderful business approach to capitalizing on a nationwide love affair with our favorite childhood characters. With attendance and profits booming, DIS continues to boost their ticket prices and is experimenting with dreaded blackout dates to further boost ticket pricing. Profits are booming, with 2014 producing the strongest profits in Disney history, at a level of over 2x the fiscal 2010 levels. However, this business line is capital intensive and is clearly cyclical. The US economy has been in "recovery" for almost 7 years and the stock market has been a one-way ticket to success and wealth since March of 2011. Last time the economy dipped, it look DIS five years to see a return to previous profit levels, despite a globally expanding footprint. All the theme park maintenance and expansion has been extremely demanding on the capital expenditure budget. With capex rapidly surpassing depreciation charges, and also due to cash outflows related to $2B in cash for Lucasfilm, Disney's earnings are far surpassing their actual free cash flow, which results in a potentially bloated P/E ratio. The chart below shows the surprising differences between free cash flow and earnings. Disney currently has one of the lowest "quality" ratios of earnings of the entire blue-chip stock market. Every quarter IBM (NYSE: IBM ) gets lambasted for their earnings disparity vis-à-vis free cash flow, but Disney gets a free pass? Remember that the majority of this involves investing in the parks, a notoriously capital intensive business, with clear cyclical risks. Disney's management is simply pathetic when it comes to this segment. How can video games based on Disney products possibly fail!? They do. Just like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) sucks at making cool phones and music players, and can't ever seem to make headway in search, Disney just cannot figure this one out. After an accounting split in 2008-2009, which separated "consumer products" from "interactive," the only real improvement was that consumer products (i.e. merchandise without video games) 'magically' started performing better. Iger didn't stand-still, hey neither did Steve Ballmer, and rapidly shed operations and laid off 700 people . Interactive still struggled, but was showing some signs of life as 2014 recorded a profit. Suddenly, DIS has now changed tact and is re-merging the two entities into "Disney Consumer Products." This is being billed as a fantastic no-brainer, but it's nothing more than a reversal of what happened just 6-7 years ago. I expect Interactive to continue to be a major source of struggle and confusion for Disney, which is unfortunate because selling Disney video games to adoring kiddos and protective parents should be easier than just about anything… Over the past 2 months, I have counted 30 positive articles on Seeking Alpha, 2-3 lukewarm articles, and only 1 negative publication . There's just no difference of opinion out there. I've seen some cautious comments and Tweets, but pretty much the entire community is in a love affair with Disney. Don't believe me, count them yourself . There's been a few greatly written articles that almost convinced me to make DIS my fattest blue-chip allocation. I wanted to call my mom and dad and have them overweight their retirement account on the mouse. I considered buying a "my first stock" frame for my future children. However, I also realized the majority of these write-up have involved the due diligence expected from an average taxi driver and have done the fundamental analysis equivalent of taking the 5-year dividend growth rate and extrapolating out into Infinity (that's a Disney game btw… go Interactive!). Despite the "buy what you love" mantra of famed investor Peter Lynch, a successful investor needs to dig a little deeper than that. What price are we paying today for what level of realistic growth tomorrow? Unfortunately the "price" is never really considered. Everyone just sees a ramp that looks like this: Even during the Big Fat Panic Week, investors were called upon to seek shelter in Disney . That's a great idea - seek shelter from potential market contagion by investing in what is arguably the most expensive blue chip on the entire market (based on free cash flow). Nonetheless, it worked, at least for the past few days! I mean no disrespect to my fellow authors, researchers, and analysts who love Disney and think it's a great investment. Disney is a phenomenal company, but the valuation fundamentals are simply horrendous. We aren't talking about a tech startup here, but rather a mature company performing near its peak. I believe investors are setting up for a Microsoft in 2000 type disappointment. In fact, MSFT in 1999 was a far better investment "idea" than Disney has been for months. Note that fantastic "investment ideas" don't necessarily translate to impressive investment results. Be careful out there. Look at free cash flow below and make your own decisions. But first, remember where most of the money has been coming from. As I've previously discussed in my other blue chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow (FCF) ratio in my valuation targets. My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield), but with DIS, I am willing to include a 17.5-22.5x range (4.4%-5.7% yield) just to give full credence to the "superior" business model and growth touted by bulls. I cannot think of another blue chip firm in which I would consider an investment over a 20x FCF multiple. Investors focus on DIS dividend growth, but FCF is the important metric to track, as it is the only way to fund these growing dividend payments. The averages are shown in the chart below. Note the recent growth leads to a far higher 3-year average. Although I believe DIS is a cyclical business, I am willing to accept the 3-year range and apply the extremely aggressive 20-25x range, to get full appreciation for their strong business model. This approach results in a 'fair' market capitalization of $91.9B to $114.9B. With 1.7B shares outstanding as of 29 April 2015, the fair price range for DIS is $54 to $67.60. I believe this range is extremely generous, yet still fails to make DIS attractive. DIS is currently trading for 42.5x the 3y average historical free cash flow, or 32x the record numbers produced in 2014. Disney is a fantastic brand, but the company carries extensive risk in the ESPN cash cow segment, which along with other cable content, accounts for over 50% of current profits. The broadcasting cash flow is at significant risk of seeing profits tumble by as much as 30-50% on new "skinny TV" type initiatives and a shift towards more web-based streaming sources. Cable companies are often targeted as at extreme risk, but digging deeper reveals that brands such as ESPN have far more to lose from a change of the status quo. Disney is also receiving a large portion of their profits, approximately 20% on a historical basis, from the clearly cyclical and capital intensive theme park and cruise line businesses. DIS is aggressively valued at a "full value" range of $54 to $68, with even the upper bound providing 41% of downside based on the current market price of $115 per share. I'll be the first to agree that I exited Disney too early on valuation concerns, but I hope other investors can avoid what at-best will be a decade of flatness, or potentially a significant correction course. Investing in DIS today is lining up to be a similar mistake as investing in Microsoft or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) in 1999-2000. In the meantime, sentiment remains hot. Since I sold my shares last summer out of valuation concerns, I never seriously considered shorting Disney. However, valuation multiples have blown past anything within reason for this mature stage company facing immense challenges in their most lucrative segment. On top of that, DIS continues to climb even as the markets appear to be worsening. I believe a short in Disney will serve as an effective hedge for a blue-chip portfolio, as other stocks such as Microsoft and Wal-Mart are far less likely to drop in similar fashion due to their valuation 'floor.' For those like myself who prefer options, I believe two sets of puts look appealing for Disney, the August strike at $110, selling for roughly $1.15-$1.25, and the January 2016 strike at $100, selling in the $1.70-$1.80 range. The August put is a way to play continuing market contagion in China and Greece-related panic at an extremely low implied volatility (IV). The January 2016 gives exposure for any potential misstep or trend reversal, also at a fair price. I doubt DIS will return to its "fair" range of $54 to $68 without a market correction, but a slight 10-20% dip on valuation concerns or ratings changes is certainly feasible in the short term.
