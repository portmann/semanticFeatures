Amazon Fire TV Stick Review â€“ A Cord Cutting Solution? - Frugal Rules Posted on April 24, 2015 by John Schmoll in Frugal Hack Fridays , Reviews The Amazon Fire TV stick is another in a growing line of cord cutting options for those looking to get out from under the burden of a monthly cable bill. We currently have service through DirecTV and have written about that in the past Â but bought a Fire Stick Â recently as we became Amazon Prime members at the end of the year. This Amazon Fire Stick review shares our experience using it. The Fire Stick is actually the second foray into streaming options by Amazon. They first introduced the Amazon Fire TV Â as a set top box that streams content and comes in at $99. Since we have DirecTV we currently have no need for a set top box but may in the future as we continue to look at challenging expenses . Did I mention that the Fire TV Stick is incredibly easy to use? Well, it is. As you can see from the picture below, it comes in a small box from Amazon and contains the following items: Itâ€™s not only easy to use, itâ€™s easy to set up. Mrs. Frugal Rules has had bad experiences in the past setting up wireless routers and other pieces of technology that claim to be easy to set up but then require her to spend an hour or two on the phone with a customer service rep in Malaysia to work correctly. The Fire Stick wasnâ€™t like that. You simply take the Fire Stick out of the box, put the batteries in the remote and connect the USB cable to the dongle and then to your TV. I actually recommend, as does Amazon, to plug it in to a surrounding outlet as they provide updates to it that you will not get if you simply plug the stick into the TV. One thing to keep in mind is that the cord is a bit on the short side; thankfully, we had an outlet within reach. Once I got the Fire TV Stick out of the box we were watching a video in about five minutes. In actuality, the time potentially could be less than that, but Amazon has a short intro video that walks you through how to us it as well as an option to sign up for Amazon Prime Â if youâ€™re not currently a member. As an aside, Amazon does offer a free 30-day trial of the Prime service by purchasing the Fire Stick if thatâ€™s something you want to look at. If youâ€™re looking for cord cutting options, then features are going to be a big thing for you. As a whole, the Fire Stick does not disappoint when it comes to features. The first thing many are concerned with are the channels youâ€™ll receive. Here is a sampling of the channels available through the Fire TV Stick: The Amazon Prime app is actually the only app that is loaded on the Fire Stick, but adding the others is relatively easy. You can also add other apps through the Amazon App store if you like, but Iâ€™ve not tried that out yet. Beyond the channels you can watch, the Fire TV Stick also has a number of games you can play but many require the Amazon Fire TV game controller ,Â to play them. Having used the Fire Stick thus far Iâ€™d say you donâ€™t necessarily need to have a Prime membership to buy and use it. Yes, it does add to the features of course, but there are plenty of options available through the standard apps and those available through the Amazon App store. Iâ€™ve not used any of the other similar options out there like the Google Chromecast , but here is a visual from the Amazon site that covers the differences in what each offers to get a flavor of how the Fire TV Stick stands out. I have really liked what Iâ€™ve seen from the Fire Stick thus far. The price alone has made it worth it. There are a few other things to really like about the Amazon stick, such as: Itâ€™s incredibly simple to use. You can get the dongle set up and ready to go in under 10 minutes. You canâ€™t beat that. Fast platform. I was curious as to how fast the platform would be and have not been disappointed. The platform is super fast and ultra responsive. A huge amount of content available. Whether or not you have Amazon Prime, there is a lot of content available on the Fire TV Stick. If you do have Prime, then youâ€™ll be even more impressed with the available content. Simple to use remote. The remote, while on the smallish side, is simple and easy to use. Itâ€™s relatively easy to move around the on screen platform through the remote and when you need to type things in itâ€™s very responsive. Great wireless coverage. Our router is at the other end of the house, on a different floor, and was picking it up at full strength. New X-Ray Feature. The newly added X-Ray feature allows you to identify favorite actors or songs in shows and find them in other shows or movies. Excellent storage capacity. The Fire TV Stick offers 8 GB of internal storage vs. 2 GB from the Chromecast. Not everything is perfect with the Fire Stick, though there are only a few things I donâ€™t like, such as: Limited voice search. It is available but you must download a smart phone app to use it. One click ordering. You may like one click ordering, though we prefer not to have it in our house. You can disable that through setting the Parental Controls, so itâ€™s not that much of a hassle. Weâ€™ve been using the Amazon Fire TV Stick for roughly a month or two now and are really enjoying it. Weâ€™re not in a place to cancel cable Â yet, as weâ€™re still under contract, but it could be a great go to option for those looking to keep costs down. There is a ton of content available through the device and while a good bit of it isnâ€™t free â€“ like Netflix or Hulu Plus, if youâ€™re already subscribing to one of those services youâ€™ll find the Fire TV Stick seamlessly integrates with your TV watching habits. If youâ€™re an Amazon Prime member then the Fire Stick can really maximize the value you receive from the membership. Amazon has a library thousands of titles large and growing daily. The other feature I really like is that you can use the dongle on any TV in your house. So, if you have multiple TVs you can simply pull it from one and plug it in another without a problem – as well as a new feature that allows you to take it with you if you travel. The Fire TV Stick , wonâ€™t replace all the shows you watch, but with the wealth of content they do have, it goes a long way towards getting you there while allowing you to cut the cord on cable. Now if I can just get my football Iâ€™d be set. Do you still have cable? What cord cutting options have you tried and come to like?
