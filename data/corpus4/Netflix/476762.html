How Apple Plans To Infiltrate The Streaming TV Market - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has long been rumored to be trying to infiltrate the TV market, whether through physical products or streaming content. Apple’s notorious reputation for being secretive and controlling has reportedly stalled them in advancing in the field. The company is reportedly working a new approach to enter the fray by creating a universal program guide that also includes streaming content. A plan of that nature would likely irk the major cable companies who have come to rely on customers using their own program guides. One of Silicon Valley's worst kept secrets is that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) wants to break into the TV space… badly. First the company looked at selling consumers TV's, then it looked at providing streaming TV programming and now its seemingly moved onto its next project - showing you what's on TV. On the surface, there's nothing new here as it's not hard to look up listings right from your actual TV, but according to new rumors, Apple wants to evolve the traditional model. In a clever twist what the company wants to do is create a guide that also includes which content is available from streaming channels. Sites like 9 to 5 Mac are reporting that Apple is meeting with "TV programmers and other video companies" on the guide with HBO, Netflix and ESPN among the likely partners. Basically what Apple is envisioning is a guide comprised of all the streaming channels you subscribe to so you don't have to log-in/log out to see what's airing and when. You can then click on the show and be instantly brought to it as we can do now with the traditional model. After all the company basically wrote the book on how to take something we all use already and put a clever new spin on it. If done right this could turn into a iTunes like system that could give them expanded reach in the world of TV…which of course takes us right back to what Apple has always wanted to be; a content provider. According to Recode , the new guide actually comes as an "outgrowth of the TV service it wanted to launch last year." The difference here is Apple is moving on (for now) from focusing on content part and just trying to create a universal program to access other's content. The trick with all of this though is that like with Apple's other top projects, we aren't going to get any confirmations until Apple is good and ready to share it with us. What's fascinating to me though is that this is a prime example of how the company pivots when its reputation comes back to bite them. Remember, earlier reports have hypnotized the reason for the delays in Apple launching a Netflix-esque original programming lineup is because of the company's notorious rep for both secrecy and control. Yet here the company has basically made the best of a bad situation while still not abandoning its original goal. In fact investors and analysts are slowly seeing a lot of Apple's TV related plans seep out and while individually none of it is a game-changer (yet), if you put it all together you can read between the lines. It is also very convenient this news leaked out this week as streaming network Hulu has released more information about its new "skinny" bundle service… another area Apple has been rumored to want to enter. It has to irk Apple a little that while it languishes in moving forward in this space, companies like Hulu are beginning to solidify its plans. And keep in mind that even if the enhanced program guide news is correct, Apple is still going to have to prepare itself for battle with the various cable/satellite providers who aren't going to be thrilled to have customers leave their built-in program guides for a rival. While Comcast and Charter can't really do anything about it, remember each has ties back to major networks like NBC and HBO which are large content providing partners Apple would likely love to have as part of this venture. Those are also potential partners for Apple to team up with as they are with CBS for "Carpool Karaoke." It's a fine line Apple is walking here as everyone believes they know company's ultimate goal, no matter how well Apple thinks it is disguised. Regardless Apple is still a leader in its field and I have no doubt down the road it is going to make a game-changing move of some sort in this area, but it may take a few detours along the way.
