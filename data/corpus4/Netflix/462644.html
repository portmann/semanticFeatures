Netflix: Be Wary Of Institutional Selling - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Watch for institutional selling as they collectively owned 84% of the float prior to earnings. Avoid buying Netflix as â€œamateur hourâ€? plays out. Wait and see if any rallies are sustained first. If you were unfortunate enough to be long on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares through earnings, it is crucial to re-assess your position from a risk standpoint and determine if you are able to stomach the possibility of a further price decline, which may be significant due to the makeup of the current ownership float. Prior to earnings, only 16% of Netflix's shares were owned by retail investors. The other 84% were owned by institutions. This creates a dangerous situation for new bullish speculators, as most of the float is already owned by "big money." If institutions decide in the coming weeks and months that they want to unload their positions, it will likely cause prices to sink further from current levels. Furthermore, the more prudent buyers who are interested in initiating a long-term position in Netflix are unlikely to buy during "amateur hour" and are instead looking to scoop up shares well below $80, with earlier "smart buyers" looking to buy in the $70 range, and bargain bin "deal makers" looking to accumulate in the $60 range and possibly even $50 although that is likely to be a stretch. The biggest issue that makes Netflix currently uninvestable from the long side is not necessarily the lower-than-expected subscriber count, hamster-wheel business model (takes a lot of effort and time to create an original show, and only a single sitting for binge-watchers to digest it, coupled with the entertainment adage that "you're only as good as your last project") or cutthroat competition from a myriad of competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), YouTube, cable providers, etc., but simply the price that the market has paid for Netflix shares as a whole over the past year and a half. For the record, Netflix is still a solid company. It is profitable and still growing, and I personally have a subscription which I enjoy using and have no plans of canceling. However, it is simply impossible for the company to grow as quickly as its stock has over the past year and a half. If Netflix shares were not so obscenely expensive, share prices would have likely remained stable post-earnings. Even after a 15% correction, Netflix as a whole is still priced at a colossal $37 billion market cap. Compare that to its book value of $2.4 billion, or yesterday's quarterly earnings of $41 million (rounded up to nearest million) multiplied by 4, which is a measly $164 million. Even if earnings are further rounded up to $200 million per year, we are still looking at an oversized PE ratio of 185. For this reason, I'm of the opinion that current buyers of NFLX are speculators, and that the sellers are actually the "investors" in this case, because only extremely high sentiment on a broad market basis can prop up such an expensive stock price.
