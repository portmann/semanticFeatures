2 Things I Like About Netflix And Its Stock Right Now - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX is now down about 20% over the last five sessions, visibly in correction mode. Such losses create better long-term opportunity, something that NFLX has been lacking. In today's market, there's not a lot to get excited about, especially for high beta, momentum stocks like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). However, even as Netflix shares now sit 25% off all-time highs, including a near 20% loss during the last five sessions, there are two things that I really like regarding both the company and its stock right now. Last Thursday, just before the bottom dropped out of the market and Netflix's stock price, cinemablend.com noticed that Netflix is hiking its prices from $10 to $11 per month in Europe, and from $13.20 to $15.20 in Switzerland. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has noted several times that as content costs rise, as will prices. Still, Netflix has been very slow to hike prices, probably because of how poorly investors responded back in 2011. Nonetheless, back in July I explained that even if Netflix were to top 150 million worldwide members, it would still have a hard time supporting its valuation with fundamentals. That's unless Netflix raises prices, substantially. This is a company whose content costs continue to soar and its high profit DVD rental business continues to dwindle. If Netflix ever wants to be a highly profitable company that supports its valuation, it must raise prices. Therefore, I am happy to see the company implementing higher prices for new subscribers, and more importantly, exploring a price hike for ongoing customers after one-year, as reported by cinemablend.com. That said, I discussed why Netflix needs to raise prices in that first linked article above, but just to reiterate the reasons here: The U.S. is renowned for having the highest cable prices around, as other areas in the globe have cable prices that are half to 20% as much as the U.S. Netflix's largest market is the U.S., and it is missing an opportunity to better align its prices domestically with that of cable prices. As explained in my first article, if Netflix earns just $8.99 per month from 152 million peak subscribers, that's only $16 billion a year in revenue. Sooner or later, Netflix's year-over-year growth will slow as its subscriber count increases, and the company will have a hard time supporting a $45 billion valuation with slower growth, low margins, and limited peak upside beyond $16 billion in revenue. However, if Netflix hikes its prices 20%, 40%, or even 60% over time, its peak revenue rises by the same degree. Seeing as how it'll be difficult to implement such a hike overnight, Netflix needs to get on the ball with increasing prices both here in the U.S. and around the globe. Last year, Netflix increased prices from $7.99 to $8.99 in the U.S., and I am happy to see it doing so in other parts of the world. With that said, talks of peak revenue and a $45 billion valuation brings up the second thing I like about Netflix right now: Its stock is trading lower! Prior to the market's recent correction, Netflix was approaching a market capitalization of $55 billion. Based on my earlier analysis, if Netflix's peak fundamentals couldn't support $45 billion, then it sure couldn't support $55 billion long-term. This means that stock upside was minimum short-term, and long-term, investors were likely to suffer. However, with Netflix falling 20% over the last five sessions, and now priced under $100, its market capitalization is now $42 billion. While still very expensive, I like that Netflix's stock is moving in a direction to where it could create better shareholder value. All things considered, I still think Netflix is too expensive, but I really like the company, I am glad to see price hikes, and if it gets cheap enough I'd be the first to jump on the stock. Even with five-day losses of 20% plus, I still don't think Netflix is cheap enough to buy, but I do think the perfect sequence of events are lining up to push Netflix lower, thereby making it a good investment. Netflix's stock is up 430% over the last five years, and still up more than 100% this year alone. Hence, if the market keeps falling, Netflix will likely keep underperforming, as investors tend to sell their winners first, and momentum stocks like Netflix are usually the first to go. In addition, Netflix may have hiked prices in the U.S. last year, but relative to cable prices, Netflix remains very cheap domestically compared to the rest of the world, and also in comparison to competing streaming services like HBO and Sling TV. This leads me to believe that Netflix will announce a much larger price hike sooner rather than later, perhaps one that prices its services closer to Sling TV and its prices in Europe, around $15 per month. That would still be very cheap, but it would instantly improve Netflix's peak potential while more than likely leading to further stock losses. In other words, I am hoping that Netflix continues to raise prices and that its stock goes much lower, like 30% lower. That's not because I am a Netflix bear or want to see the company fail, but rather I do like the company, and if the price is right, I want to own Netflix.
