ETF Hub Aug  5 2015, 09:45 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) sellers have piled onto yesterday's postmarket decline, as the stock comes out of the open down 8.7% after a revenue miss as international theme park growth slowed and interactive sales declined. On CNBC this morning, Bob Iger talked about his full-throated defense of ESPN on yesterday's earnings call. "Our business has performed extremely well , and we have a very, very strong outlook going forward, but we felt that given the importance of ESPN to the company and cable networks in general, that it was important for us to be candid about what we see in the environment. Simple as that," Iger said. He repeated that Disney was bullish on the cable business and ESPN specifically. "We did want to note the sub losses that we had seen. We also have an NBA deal that kicks in in 2017. But after 2017 we believe ESPN is going to deliver very compelling growth for this company." "I think it's a huge buying opportunity," said Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth. "I'm actually shocked it's down, but I've often said you never buy a stock for what just happened, you buy a stock for what's going to happen over the next few years."

The real kingpin  stock Disney tanks on a pretty decent earnings  report and they mention  Netflix in its report  and it jumps? Oh the market. I feel I'm not alone when I say I am tired of paying for ESPN when I can easily live without it. I can get sports news from about 5,000,000 different sources and if there's a game on that I absolutely have to watch I'll go to a friends house or out to a pub.
