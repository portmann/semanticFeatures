Two birds, one stone for Disney: Buy Netflix, BTIG says - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Apr  8 2016, 19:00 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney ( DIS +0.3%) has run into a bit of a hurdle in its succession plan after Monday's surprise news that COO and likely CEO candidate Tom Staggs was leaving his post . Observers speculate that the board didn't see the creative strength in Staggs that the company would need in a replacement for chief executive Bob Iger, planning to step down in two years. The company's also faced down woes over its TV business, both at broadcast net ABC as well as at ESPN. BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield has the answer to both problems: Disney should buy Netflix ( NFLX -0.6%). Then it gets a future leader with a creative streak in Netflix's "visionary CEO" Reed Hastings, as well as a substantial established stake in on-demand video. "Netflix is already a great friend of Disney," Greenfield says. "In fact, Iger has repeatedly acknowledged how they are in part responsible for Netflixís success. Disney continues to sell more and more content to Netflix spanning movies and television series, while at the same time struggling to get their own direct-to-consumer content business off the ground in the UK." But a deal would be huge . "Buying Netflix is an awfully expensive acquire, but it could be Disneyís only hope. Disneyís market cap is currently $157 billion and its enterprise value is $176 billion compared to Netflixís $45 billion market cap and enterprise value." This sounds very interesting and also possible, but I think Netflix wouldn't want to be acquired by Disney. They already have great leadership, road maps, and huge international expansion not too long ago and have visions far beyond we can tell. Never going to happen. Why would Disney buy Netflix for $45 billion + takeover premium when Netflix's only asset is investment in content streaming rights which is just $2.4 billion, and its cumulative marketing, technology and G&A costs for the last five years were $6.0 billion? Netflix is a dumb pipe with rights to stream content. Paying $45 billion for these assets and historical investments would be a bad trade for Disney. And Reed Hastings is definitely not worth the balance. It seems Mr. Greenfield doesn't understand basic economics, and this is an example of the lunacy surrounding stocks like Netflix. Reed Hastings not worth the balance? Really?  He is the only guy who built his company from nothing while all the other copy cat mediocre streaming services are corporate sponsored. Reed is an innovator and a great CEO. CER, I like Hastings too but to Fundamental's point, you can be a great CEO and innovator and not be worth 45 billion. That's quite a stash of money What would Apple have put Steve's Job's value at I wonder. Remember, they were under $10 if I remember correctly when they rehired him. Creating content and licensing content is expensive as Netflix has discovered. But building a streaming video service is getting easier every day. Disney has no competitors. Netflix has a new competitor every damn day. If DIS merged with NFLX it would benefit both today. Tomorrow it would benefit only NFLX. I have occasionally speculated on Seeking Alpha over the last year about Netflix possibly being bought out, not by Disney, but by others.   I was often attacked over the mere suggestion; the point being made that it would be too expensive a buyout to make sense. Well, if we accept that the current Netflix market cap is too high for a buyout to be wise, then what about a buyout of Netflix at a much lower price? A related detail is that there is so much negative stuff posted about Netflix, both here and elsewhere.  It makes me wonder if a one or more potential buyers of Netflix (and not necessarily Disney) could be using the anonymity of the internet to join in some of those negative posts, hoping to knock the Netflix stock price down to a lower, more affordable level. the awful performance of these 3 companies for the last few years show the simple fact that women are not fit to run such companies. I will throw my hat in the ring for CEO. I'd buyout Nintendo at a discount. Add those characters that are kid friendly. Imagine having Mario and Yoshi with Mickey and the gang... Work to develop more Nintendo games cross platform so we don't need a Nintendo specific console. Imagine the number of people on PC, PS4, and X1 who would purchase.  The money is in the software and not the hardware. Leverage those IP assets. Then continue to rely on groundbreaking directors and talent to keep building out Marvel and Star Wars. Continue to fund the great things at Pixar. Build out the princess theme of TFA and RO. It's not too hard. C'mon DIS and Iger. I'm willing to negotiate... netflix is an empty shell. A great company but fully empty once stripped out of content and loaded with debt. Disney board should be savvy enough to recall the TW AOL debacle attempting to buy "synergy" with a "visionary" leader at an inflated price just as the roller coaster peaked. He who doesn't learn from the past.... I'm not sure Disney should buy anyone right now.  They seem to have plenty of avenues to allocate capital. China, parks, movies, and they are planning on buying 2 more cruise ships. Why NFLX, can just buy Neflix executive for contend producing with a fraction of money. Neflix business model has low entry barrier, it's all about key persons. What does Disney do with all of Netflix's more risqu√© content.  I seem to remember a problem with the Weinstein Bros, Disney owned Miramax at the time, and a picture called, Priest, at the time it had a NC17 label.  Disney would not let the picture released. Netflix's content isn't 100% Disneyfied, it just wouldn't work.  Disney has an image and Netflix isn't that image, on paper maybe, but it just wouldn't fit. Agree NFLX would be a terrible acquisition; overpriced and they have the Hulu JV already. My take on COO is that Iger's NFL deal fell through and he's decided to stay. He'll be there for another 5 years and NFLX will be long since sold (to one of the cable operators perhaps) for a fraction of its current market cap. In the interim, we could see a repeat of AOL/Time Warner if NFLX somehow acquires a studio, ugh. Don't mean to be disrespectful, but I am sick and tired of seeing analyst fodder about companies they obviously know nothing about.  Buying Netflix is Disney's only hope? Does he mean that Chapter 11 is imminent for Disney unless they buy Netflix? If you glance at the article in Barrons, it is apparent this is exactly what this 'analyst' thinks. Note to SA editors: you might want to exercise a little discernment when re-printing content from Barrons; I have often found it devoid of intelligent thought. You are all missing the point!!! Netflix has paid less than $10b to be in the context streaming business. Why is that worth a market cap of 45 billion?!?!?!? Someone answer please. Why would a content king buy a non content King.... Makes no sense. Content is king. Apple would be smarter to buy Disney and incorporate all their content into Apple TV. Btig ideas make no sense. Loves Netflix but hates Disney and apple that makes money hand over fist. Netflix is in trouble because it doesn't own content. It's at the mercy of the content controllers like Disney. The content kings can charge whatever they want and either Netflix has to agree or not have any good content for their base. It's not going to end well for Netflix in a few years. It would certainly be great if that happened, but I don't see it. Disney is an incredible company but it can't get out of its own way. The stock would be a juggernaut if it weren't for that damn ESPN. Netflix would be just what the doctor ordered but I think it would have to be a hostile takeover to get the deal done. I seriously doubt this kind of idea gets any consideration at all. If it does, by any real entertainment company, it will be the top of the bubble and will be comparable to the AOL Time Warner deal - a totally bonehead move. Streaming at the Netflix level is not anywhere near as valuable as a third of Disney. This guy is a joke.
