Edwards Lifesciences Is Cheap - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/30/16) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has a huge opportunity and its market cap does not justify it. Cramer has lost faith in Kinder Morgan. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ): "I like Netflix. Why? because I think the opportunity for Netflix is bigger than the stock. I think it is a worldwide network and it should not be constrained by this lower total market capitalization." Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW ): This is a good company for the people in their 60s, 70s and 80s. The stock is cheap. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ): CEO Patrick Doyle is one of the best in the business. It's a good stock to own. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ): Cramer has lost faith in the company. MasTec (NYSE: MTZ ): Cramer thinks Eaton (NYSE: ETN ) is the better stock in this space. Hanesbrands (NYSE: HBI ): There is a lot of competition here. Go for TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ), Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST ) or PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH ).
