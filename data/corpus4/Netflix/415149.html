Netflix (NFLX) Stock: Something Big Is Coming! - Modest Money Learn how to trade penny stocks profitably!  Get started for free today! Netflix is having an incredible time in the market as of late, and things are going to get even better toward the end of the year. You see, pretty soon, the company will be providing access to Disney titles. Today, we’ll talk about why this is important, what we’re seeing from the stock in the market today, and what we can expect to see from NFLX moving forward. So, let’s get right to it… A few years ago, Netflix and Disney entered into an agreement. The agreement that was signed in 2012 is going to prove to pan out incredibly well for NFLX later this year. That’s because under this agreement, Netflix will have the rights to stream all Disney titles to their users as of September of 2016. This means that users will have access to titles from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and much, much more! Think about what this is likely to do for NFLX. The fact that the company will be able to stream Disney titles is absolutely amazing for the company. It is the only company that seems to have the ability to capture imaginations young and old around the world! Just look back. When you were a kid, did you watch Disney movies? How many parents will likely purchase services from Netflix simply to have this programming for their children? On top of that, if you watch movies, chances are that those created by Disney, Pixar, and Marvel happen to be on the top of your favorites list. The bottom line here is that when NFLX opens up streaming of Disney titles, chances are that sales of the company’s services will skyrocket! Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments! At the moment, the fact that NFLX will soon be able to stream Disney titles is starting to excite investors. Let’s face it, the news moves the market. With such positive news surrounding the stock at the moment, we’re seeing gains today following up on the positive movement we saw in the stock yesterday. Currently (1:09), the stock is trading at $99.67 per share after a gain of $1.78 per share or 1.82% thus far today. What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward Moving forward, I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from NFLX. First and foremost, the fact that the company will soon be allowing streaming of Disney content is likely to pick up sales in a big way. However, while the news with regard to Disney is overwhelmingly positive, it’s not the only reason that I have such a bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Netflix. Late last year, the company announced that it is going from being a domestic company to being a global company. At the time, NFLX opened its services up to consumers in more than 130 countries around the world. In fact, there are only a few countries where consumers don’t have access to Netflix and that’s only because of regulatory restrictions that are hindering the company’s plans to get into those countries. With the recent expansion into a global company, NFLX now has a larger audience than ever before, and global sales are expected to build the business exponentially!
