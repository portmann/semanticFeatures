Did Tim Cook Violate Regulation "Fair Disclosure" By Emailing Jim Cramer To Save AAPL Stock This Morning | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Never in history has the US entered a recession when rates were this low. And it spells serious trouble for the financial system going forward.   Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Earlier today, as AAPL stock was plummeting and had lost a whopping $75 billion in market cap, dropping as low as $92/share, CNBC's Jim Cramer pulled a rabit out of a hat, or in this case a previously undisclosed email out of his inbox. An email from AAPL CEO Tim Cook which said the following (as subsequently conveyed by Cramer to CNBC viewers ): As you know, we don't give mid-quarter updates and we rarely comment on moves in Apple stock. But I know your question is on the minds of many investors. I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last 2 weeks. Obviously I can't predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring. Additionally, I continue to believe that China represents an unprecedented opportunity over the long term as LTE penetration is very low and most importantly the growth of the middle class over the next several years will be huge. While we are delighted by Tim Cook's subjective take of AAPL's Chinese prospects, we have a different question: where is the public filing that accompanies this letter which constitutes nothing short of a private business update with an outside, and unregulated by Apple, market cheerleader? Because as the AAPL reaction to Tim's letter, which was clearly in Cramer's private possession for at least 1 millisecond before it was made public (and thus we don't know who else may have had access to it before its public dissemination), just how is this not a Regulation Fair Disclosure violation? Needless to say, the fate of AAPL, which is the most important stock in the world, held by a record 181 hedge funds, determines the intraday (and not only) fate of the entire market. â€” zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 24, 2015 And for those who may have missed it, this is what AAPL's stock has done today, ever since this clearly market moving letter, helped AAPL regain an unprecedented $80 billion in market cap since the lows. We are eagerly looking to find an 8K public filing of Tim Cook's letter among AAPL's EDGAR filings, even if it will have taken place hours after the market moving event, or alternatively, perhaps the SEC or any other authorities who were not too stunned to react today, can explain just why this is not a Reg FD violation? Then again, with AAPL leading the S&P rapidly into the green, we are confident this, too, will be promptly forgotten and swept under the carpet of "whatever it takes to keep the market green."

Regulation FD  addresses the selective disclosure of information by publicly traded companies and other issuers. Regulation FD provides that when an issuer discloses material nonpublic information to certain individuals or entitiesâ€”generally, securities market professionals, such as stock analysts, or holders of the issuer's securities who may well trade on the basis of the informationâ€”the issuer must make public disclosure of that information. In this way, Regulation FD aims to promote the full and fair disclosure.

Shame on you Tyler, you hater you.

Mon, 08/24/2015 - 14:08 | 6464369 aint no fortuna... It's my strong opinion that GS takes the opposite side of Crammer's shillery... by design? Would love to see what their prop desk did for trades in the minutes between Crammer's receipt of Cook's email and the actual dissemination of said email by Crammer. Should be a simple task for the regulators to take a look at the prints - too bad they won't though. Mon, 08/24/2015 - 14:03 | 6464363 Random_Robert The SEC regulators won't investigate (or prosecute) Tim Cook under FD law, for the very simple reason that they don't want to see their 401k balances get hammered...

Speaking from Berlin, where he is doing biomedical research on a Fulbright fellowship, Katz explained that growing up in such a community, â€œyou donâ€™t see commonality with people who arenâ€™t Jewish. There is a completely different taxonomy of people. There are Jews and then there are non-Jews, who donâ€™t have souls.â€? - See more at: http://mondoweiss.net/2014/01/haaretz-orthodox-taught#sthash.LCQ3feWh.dp... Mon, 08/24/2015 - 13:17 | 6464110 gatorengineer I wrote the other day that the hedge had it all wrong and this whole move was AAPL, and got flamed.  AAPL 18% interday move, and maybe more to come on NO VOLUME.... Write up there with the Pandit letter that saved it at 666,  Alot of damage should have been done though lets see what happens. - AAPL represents the health of Chinese economy. Presently, Chinese economy is a very sick patient and will become even more sicker. - AAPL is a vey sizable component of DOW 30 and S&P 500, etc., Consequently, it is very easy to manipulate the major financial market indexes by manipulating AAPL and few similar stocks. This is exactly what is going on. Tim Cook is a liberal and a card carrying member of the Brown Grommet club.

Mon, 08/24/2015 - 14:26 | 6464491 TongueStun I have a problem with terd burglars. They use 5x the healthcare resources as normal people, and under Obowelcare, I have to pay for them. They should pay extra for their own dangerous lifestyle choices, like smokers do.

Is the stock price lower or higher - that's it. Very much a one-dimensional understanding or care attributed to stocks.

Mon, 08/24/2015 - 12:12 | 6463668 thunderchief Apple has done some great things, but today they are just another gadget maker. I'll take a Samsung product any day of the week without thinking twice.  And if I don't like that, there are plenty more to choose from. Apple is just another gadget company using Chinese slave labor.  I hope the stock goes to what Nokias did.  Hell, ,  maybe I'll buy one of those again, or how about Sony or HTC. Mon, 08/24/2015 - 12:30 | 6463810 NihilistZero Seriously Apple could close shop and stop producing products tomorrow and outside of those that directly profit from Apple sales, nothing would change.  People would use Android phones and tablets and Windows laptops.  They have no dominant position in the cloud storage or business/server markets.  Every Apple product is COMPLETELY replaceable with lower cost and arguably better performing products.  They're a logo.  A brand.  Yet they're the most important stock in the world.  That should tell everyone all they need to know about the current state of "capitalism" and the "markets". Mon, 08/24/2015 - 12:56 | 6463978 Skateboarder Have you seen all the iWatch commercials? They're nauseatingly disgustingly gross - painting the most trivial, stupid things that "watch" can do as desirable. They're really pushing it to the techie/upper-middle-klass parents. Very much a parent-child-association marketing campaign. Fucken scumbags. Mon, 08/24/2015 - 13:33 | 6464215 FeelinFine Agreed. But they want to reinforce their brand by associating it with the human experience. Just like the black and white Cheerios commercials with some old hag force feeding them to a toddler . Technology slowly creeping untilit overtakes you. Excuse me while I load some bird-shot and start taking down some drones... "Pushing" is quite apropos.  Apple sells false feelings of joy no different than the dopamine rush of a drug. Mon, 08/24/2015 - 14:53 | 6464667 Hal n back the one thing apple really has going for it is not so much brand loyalty but brand stuck--once you create your playlists and ties to ipads or ipods or iphones its difficult to change. having said that, I am trying to find a way to leave the apple stable. They stopped making ipods, my ipad is becoming too complex and it is slowing down after 15 months, The touch screen is not reliable.any more pop up adds and I'll throw it out sooner rather than later. So those problems may or may not be shared by others. But I bet more than a few are upset and will gravitate to other platforms. Not to mention the possibility that with a global slowdown apple may no longer be selling new phones every 2 years to folks other than delvelopersd People may realize that, outside of battery replacement, the phone will actually work and do its thing for 3-4 years an dthe dropping more money just to have latest and greatest is great when you have the excess bucks to spend. Not so when you might be tight on money.
