How Netflix Is Proving Timing Is Everything - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Following a downgrade of its stock this week by a top analyst Netflix’s stock took a dive but quickly rebounded on the news of two major deals. The new partnerships with Comcast to allow them set-top box access and with The CW for quicker delivery of its show’s seasons continue to give the streamer new advantages. Netflix has long proven to be a industry disruptor and even as analysts begin to point out potential long-term flaws, the network seems to evolve just at the right time. Netflix will continue to make new in-roads and as proven with Comcast, those deals can even be with a long-term critic. The expression "timing is everything" lends itself naturally the Hollywood hype machine. It is not uncommon to hear a film did better than expectations because it came along at the right time or a show flopped because it debuted against something that sucked up all the viewers. Yet with streaming media time stands still. In that realm there is no set schedule and best of all… no ratings. I can't underscore just how important both of those elements are to the success of this medium. However timing is still important for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) as a whole as it continues to disrupt the mainstream model in stunning ways. Take this week for example. On July 5th investors woke up to Needham's analyst Laura Martin downgrading her recommendation of the stock. Martin cited concerns that Brexit would mar the company's international growth in future years. At the same time Guggenheim's Michael Morris added the stock to his company's list of "best ideas." Morris cited optimism that the investor focus would shift to "return to value proposition and pricing power." Just as that news was settling in, all of sudden two more stories hit about Netflix... this time both positive and not only did the stock regain its position, but it ended the day up. The more likely of the two stories to move the needle had to do with a partnership between Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and Netflix. The two have reached a deal where Comcast will allow Netflix onto its X1 platform making it easier for users to access the streaming service. This is significant for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that these two companies have a contentious history. Re/Code, which initially broke the deal, also has a nice refresher of their conflicts for those interested. Yet given Comcast just recently acquired DreamWorks Animation and DreamWorks Animation has a longstanding distribution deal with Netflix, these two companies were going to have a find a way to peacefully co-exist on some level. To remind readers though the basic feud tied back to the rules of net neutrality, which for those of you still confused by it (and its completely understandable), let me refer to HBO's Last Week Tonight With John Oliver which brilliantly breaks it down. The end result in this case though is that for Netflix this of course makes it easier for new subscribers to come aboard (and gives Comcast a added selling point), but the arrangement also has a secondary benefit. Currently the FCC is looking into the big cable companies and a proposal has been made to force cable operators to open up their set-top boxes to other companies. In other words, the FCC has heard your complaints about having to pay over $200 a year for the "privilege" to rent a set top box and is working on trying to drive down the fees or eliminate them completely. With this deal Comcast can say to the FCC, "look we are playing nice with our rivals and allowing them access." The ironic part is that Comcast (as well as all their cable brethren) have largely fought the FCC on the proposal, likely because they'd want to something like this on their own terms. It was (finally) confirmed today that The CW (NYSE: CBS , NYSE:TWX) will make Netflix its exclusive home for its catalog of programming. Until now, The CW had deals with Netflix and Hulu which were made to benefit all three parties as when it was signed The CW didn't have the same success it is now and Netflix and Hulu needed all the programming it could get. In the years since a lot has changed and Hulu told The CW in order to stay partners they'd like "stacking rights" to its shows. As a reminder "stacking rights" refer to the ability to stack shows for streaming and not have to be on a "rotating five" system with only the five newest episodes being available. Networks have long battled for these with studios because it makes it easier for new audiences (especially those of serialized shows) to pick up a show later on in its lifespan. Yet stacking rights greatly influence both potential individual series streaming deals and advertising revenue so studios are not keen to give them out. To me, what the most fascinating aspect of all this is the newfound power it gives Netflix. As part of the deal, Netflix not only gets the CW's library but it gets new full seasons faster. Instead of having to wait until the start of the new season to get all of the previous season's episodes, Netflix will get them just eight days after the previous season wraps. To simplify that… instead of being forced to wait until September to stream the newest season, Netflix will essentially have them all by June. Under this deal, The CW will also retain the "streaming five" model giving its own site (and the sites of its affiliates) the exclusive ability to stream current episodes not long after they first air which gives them a big advantage. While I agree the upside for The CW is that it gives audiences an entire summer to get caught up or latch on to its programming, it also closes the window between live and streaming even more. The biggest thing working against the cord-cutting option is that traditional media has LIVE viewing for EVERY channel. And that's the differentiator. Yes, as I'm sure people will point out, you have the ability to see live programming across places like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, but ONLY on select channels and only in a handful of markets does that apply to the national broadcast networks like The CW. By closing the window even further, The CW (and CBS by extension) is taking a risk here. In the short term it will pay off, but it's that long run play that is put into question. Will people eventually stop caring as much about seeing a "must-watch" show live? Likely it will depend on the show but for the networks to give audiences that option could prove dangerous. Remember a large part of the streamer's original success is because many networks saw the chance for a new revenue stream and the ability to make a quick buck by happily selling off digital rights to their programming. All this did was give Netflix and company time to find its footing and create its own original programming. By trading off the popularity of its rival's programs streaming networks were able to build a solid foundation that have rivaled the traditional model. Now that everyone realizes how strong they've become it's too late to do anything about it.
