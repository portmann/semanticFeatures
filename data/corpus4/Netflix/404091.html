The Media-Carrier Dance Is About To Begin - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney and Comcast have shown impressive gains the last five years. The reason is their vertical integration, the ability to create content and derive maximum profit from it. Over the last five years shares in Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) are up 147%. Those of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) are up 144%. What these companies have in common is vertical integration. Disney can execute an entertainment idea from its creation through its total distribution, right to its emergence as an amusement park attraction. So can Comcast. The Disney whisper number on earnings, due out later today, is for $1.18, and there is increasing confidence the company can meet or beat that number. Other companies can either carry entertainment or create it. There are media companies like CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and there are carriers like Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). This is inefficient. It's not the way things were in the "golden age of Hollywood." Back then, the theater chains owned the movie studios. Until the government broke that up on antitrust grounds, in the early 1950s, this was how entertainment were produced. Inputs, including stars, were controlled by contract. The exhibitor got every last squeal out of showing the product. The model is compelling, which is why companies brought it back, buying the government's silence with campaign contributions. Networks can now own the shows they exhibit, and do. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is, in its way, very little different from Loews in the 1940s. All this has important implications as the health of Sumner Redstone continues to fail and we approach the next round of media consolidation. Having a network, broadcast or cable, used to be considered plenty of vertical integration. You produced the show, you put the show on the network until it wore out, and then you disposed of it. But after years of falling with the slow collapse of the syndication model, that disposal value is rising again, thanks to over the top players like Netflix and, of course, Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). It also means vertical integration doesn't mean all it once did. To get true vertical integration today, you need to control the pipes over which your content is streamed to last-mile consumers. For CBS and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ), getting the maximum value from the resource may well mean selling out to a carrier. Carriers like AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon seem like obvious choices. But there are others, like Altice ( OTCPK:ATCEY ) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ), which just got finished buying Charter Communications. The last deal gives TWC a market cap of $61 billion, which is now higher than former parent Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). (While seeking dance partners, don't forget Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ).) The point is there are plenty of buyers and plenty of sellers on both sides of the media-telecom divide, enough to provide multiple potential partners for anyone who wants to emulate the kinds of synergies that Comcast and Disney now enjoy. Now that the value of media stocks is on the rise again, and panic over the "over the top" model is continuing, I predict deals. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS, CMCSA, AMZN.
