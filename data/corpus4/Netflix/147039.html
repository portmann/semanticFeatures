Can Apple Burst The Netflix Bubble? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is expected to begin offering a package of cable and network TV channels as part of a new Apple TV. Apple can build on this video streaming service to create a curated on-demand service similar to Apple Music. Recent comments by Apple Music honcho Jimmy Iovine suggest that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will extend the music streaming model to video content as well. Apple's entry into streaming video would provide the most effective competition Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has had and probably demolish its overheated P/E. Apple Music can be thought of as a test case for a broader transition out of Apple's iTunes purchase/rent download model for content delivery. When Music debuted, I had speculated that it would pave the way for a video streaming service. This was only a natural expansion, given what iTunes has become. This was largely confirmed by Iovine's comments in his recent Wired interview : We all know one thing, we all have different television delivery systems, don't we all wish that the delivery systems were better, as far as curation and service? In almost the same breath, Iovine begged off tackling the video job. He has his hands full with Music. But his comment makes clear that if Music succeeds, Apple will leverage the same approach of human curation as a discriminator in its own video streaming service. Assuming that Music is successful. Music got off to a rocky start , but has managed to garner 11 million subscribers during the free trial period. Apple's Eddie Cue has acknowledged the problems and stated that Apple is moving as fast as possible to fix them. Of course Apple is moving as fast as possible. It probably needs a much larger subscriber base to make Music profitable. Apple is estimated to have content costs per 1000 streamed songs of $2.47 in the form of royalty payments to labels and music publishers. Apple's royalty payments came out during the Taylor Swift fiasco regarding payments to artists. A thousand songs represents about 2 hours of programming per day during a monthly subscription. How much artists make per subscription depends on how much a typical subscriber listens to the service. At 4 hours/day average, Apple is paying about half of subscription revenue to labels and publishers. This means that Apple would make approximately $5.0 per subscription per month. Would $55 million/month be enough to cover Apple's operating costs (personnel, server operations and maintenance, software development) for the service? Probably not. It's more likely that Apple Music needs roughly $100 million/month after content fees to break even, or roughly double the current subscribers. This would put Apple Music on par with Spotify, which claims over 20 million subscribers . At 30 million subscribers, Apple gets into its normal operating margin comfort zone of 30%. So Apple Music has a long way to go, but with an iOS user base of 400 million (my personal estimate), Apple has a large pool of prospective clients for Apple Music. Assuming that Apple makes break even on Music with about 20 million subscribers, this will constitute a go-ahead for the streaming video service. Probably Apple already has a prototype service in development under R&D, ready to be deployed for product testing purposes once Apple management gives the go-ahead. The potential market for the streaming video service is much larger than for Music, if Netflix is any indication. As of the June quarter, Netflix reported that it had over 65 million streaming subscribers, for 31% y/y growth. The robust growth in its subscriber base has not been accompanied by equivalent growth in revenue (up 23% y/y) or operating income (down 42% y/y). Operating costs for Netflix have climbed 51% y/y as it has rapidly expanded globally in order to maintain its rate of subscriber growth. The decline in operating income hasn't bothered Netflix shareholders. Netflix continues to be one of the most highly valued tech companies with a P/E of 276, according to Google Finance . Although the subscriber base of Netflix is larger than competitors such as Amazon Prime ( estimated to have 40 million members ), I believe that the potential for internet video delivery (so called Over the Top, OTT) is much larger. In fact, I believe that OTT will eventually supplant broadcast TV in the forms of terrestrial over the air, cable, and satellite. This makes the ultimate target market much larger than what Netflix has achieved. The FCC has estimated that 90% of U.S. households, or over 110 million, are served by a Multi-channel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) such as cable or satellite. Eventually, I expect all of these users to be converted to OTT video delivery in some form, as I described in Apple's New Television Opportunity . Various rumors about the next Apple TV, OTT content distribution negotiations with broadcast and cable content companies, and Iovine's comment in the Wired interview substantiate the expectation that Apple intends to exploit its OTT opportunity. Apple has the scale to do that in a way that hasn't been done before. The entire subscriber base of Netflix is roughly equal to the number of iPhones Apple sells in a good quarter. Apple has a very large captive audience in its iOS user base. An official announcement of an Apple OTT service could come as early as the expected iPhone event next month. There are rumors that the new Apple TV will be launched then as well. Initially, the OTT service may not be much competition for Netflix. It is expected to be a "slim" package of cable and over the air broadcast channels offered in a live streaming format that essentially mimics the cable experience. The initial OTT service will form a platform on which Apple can easily build an on-demand service to rival Netflix. The OTT service will allow Apple to deploy much of the infrastructure that it will eventually need for the on-demand service. When Apple goes ahead with the on-demand service, the impact on Netflix valuation could be devastating. Thus far, Netflix has not faced serious competition that could curtail its subscriber growth. Apple's entry into the on-demand video streaming category will provide that competition. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
