Sell Netflix: Projected Growth Is Not Impressive Enough - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's increased cost of international expansion has resulted in a substantial decline in earnings growth, yet the company's stock price has risen dramatically. Analysts are confident about the company's ability to achieve growth by tapping into international markets, yet the growth for subscribers projected is not higher than past growth experienced. Netflix is extremely overvalued, and a risky portfolio holding. I am bearish on most US listed equity anyway, but found this to be a stronger case worth noting. A value-based investment approach to US-listed equities will become increasingly relevant, given the current market volatility and economic uncertainty ahead. An examination of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) clearly reveals that now is a strategic time to sell, as the days of high growth and low valuation are over. Netflix's P/E is substantially higher than average, and it has experienced a very recent decline in earnings growth. The true success story was between 2012 and 2014, while its current situation warrants a correction in its stock price. A bullish view of the company's potential and prestige should be balanced with the rational recognition that the stock's rise is no longer justifiable, and a correction is befitting. The international growth that is projected throughout 2020 is impressive, but nothing new from what the company has experienced in the past. As examined later in this article, the growth in earnings between 2012 and 2014 was substantial, which certainly justifies the rise in stock price. However, at its current price and valuation, a reconciliation is befitting. Net Revenue growth has been consistent since 2012, and was 25.8% during 2014. The true success story, regarding earnings growth, took place between 2012 and 2013, at which point it is safe to say that the sharp ascent of the company's stock price was befitting. Yet the most substantial increase in its stock price took place between 2013 and 2015, at which point growth had slowed. On top of this, earnings declined substantially during Q2 2015. While Netflix has been able to continue achieving constant growth through 2015, the current expansion is being spearheaded by international growth, as this accounted for 70% of the company's growth during the 2nd quarter of 2015. The high cost of international expansion negatively impacted the company's bottom line, as its earnings dropped by over 62.9%. Despite the drop in earnings, the company was able to add 3.3 million subscribers during the 2nd quarter of 2015, which accounts for around 5% of its current subscribers. Its net revenue increase of 23% can also be considered a positive driver. While its international expansion has been impressive, and resulted in high revenue growth, it is not strong enough to justify the company's high valuation. Moreover, the threat to the company's earnings has been substantial, and the process of reconciliation of the company's earnings will be timely. As domestic subscribers still account for a substantial percentage of the company's subscribers, it is safe to say that international expansion needs to be more aggressive to justify the company's high valuation and recent decline in earnings. The company's P/E has consistently been rising since 2015, mainly resulting from the high costs of international expansion, which resulted in recent 62.9% decrease in earnings . For the past 5 years , the company's P/E has been between 16.66 and 314.31. Other financial statistics provide further areas of concern, in addition the company's high valuation and decrease in earnings: Management Effectiveness: ROA and ROE were not very impressive, at 2.72% and 10.58% respectively. Q2 2015: The stock's price increased by 62.23%, while earnings declined by 62.9%. A continued rise of the stock's price and perpetual high valuation may be understandable, in light of the anticipated international growth, although the following factors should be noted to offset an overly optimistic view of the company's growth. While international growth was extensive, and on track to increase, it should be noted that this only resulted in the company's net revenue increasing by 22.7%. Meanwhile, the company's stock price has increased nearly triple this amount. Nomura Analyst Anthony DiClemente projected that the company would be able to grow to have 152 million subscribers. Based on this projection, the company would be able to increase subscribers by 133.8%, reflecting growth of approximately 29.7% per annum until 2020. To put this growth into context, we can compare it to the growth in subscribers achieved before Q2 2015: If growth goes as projected, it will still be lower than the average growth experienced in previous years. This is a red flag, given the company's current high valuation. The company may be good value based on its ability to tap into new international markets, but its growth will not be strong enough to justify its historically higher valuation. Netflix does have good things coming ahead of it, but a reconciliation in its price is befitting. Its current P/E can not be justified. Netflix's stock price is incredibly overvalued. Its plans for international expansion are impressive, but do not represent a substantial increase from its past growth. The high cost of international expansion has resulted in a rapid decrease in earnings, yet the stock's price still remains high. It is not at a point where it would be a wise endeavor to preposition oneself to profit from the international growth that is ahead. If you are optimistic about this growth, and are able to justify investing in companies with extremely high valuation, then it would be best to wait for lower valuation. The company's future outlook is good, but seems to be sensationalized. As financial experts have been saying that stocks in the United States could fall by 30-40% , its safe to say that investors should be rational and search for good value. Netflix is a clear case of a company that could very well be victim to this fall.
