For Disney, The Best Is Yet To Come - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha An exceptional track record YTD is leading this company to all-time highs. Disney relies on ESPN for a majority of its profits, and while lower this quarter, Q4 for Disney is showing much promise. International operations are set to increase with Shanghai construction nearing completion. We now have 64 separate hedge funds carrying around $4 billion in Disney (NYSE: DIS ) stock, with all of those benefiting from the YTD trend of the stock being up over 23%. The company has now passed the $200 billion market cap threshold, is leading the Dow, and now it's time to look to future quarters as indicative of how the House of Mouse can grow even larger. The sharp decline, putting Disney down 6% on the day, after quarterly earnings creates an exceptional entry point, as ESPN ad revenues and movies are going see great upside in FY Q4. I personally love goofy market sentiment that doesn't understand Disney's stock. They're selling off because of fear that revenues weren't high enough and that Disney can't sustain the all-time highs. I, however, believe in quite the opposite. Overall, the company beat on EPS by six cents, and missed by only $60 million on revenue ($13.1 billion vs. $13.17 billion), which is hardly grounds for negative sentiment. Every segment showed growth except Interactive, but it was competing against a prior year comparison of strong sales from its initial launch and Infinity 3.0 won't launch until the end of this month, providing support for stronger Q4 earnings. We're seeing significant international expansion, with the Hong Kong Disneyland expecting to open a third resort on site by 2017, costing Disney only $219 million . This location hasn't been as popular as other international locations, but this new addition could certainly provide a good boost. With a 43% stake in the Shanghai Disney resort (theme park, two hotels, and a entertainment center), the company has staked about $5.5 billion in the project and will be finishing in early 2016. Overall, I'm not worried about the theme park segment, as I know Shanghai is about to really increase revenues and with guests now spending more per person , along with attendance being higher in American locations, I'm content with the business. Back in October of 2012, when this company bought Lucasfilm for $4 billion, I thought the acquisition price was a little steep. I now realize that this was the best decision the company has made to reduce dependency on ESPN. With projections for the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens film to make $2.2 billion at the box office, before merchandise or any other ancillary stream, I have full confidence in the stock trending up. The company has Episode: VIII and Episode: IX lined up as two multi-billion dollar films to be released over the next five years. There will also be two films that are more character-specific, involving Boba Fett and Han Solo, respectively. Think about it: that's five total films based on one franchise that, just at the box office could bring anywhere from $10-$11 billion dollars in revenue over the next five years. That doesn't include their extensive pipeline of upcoming releases with Pixar and Marvel, better detailed here . Here's the largest caveat with movies: they only account for 12% of Disney's total revenue. Even with having some of the biggest titles in the industry, they need to keep bolstering this number up in order to diversify their product offering a bit better. Unfortunately, Tomorrowland and Big Hero 6 were basically written off in wake of Ant Man and The Avengers: Age of Ultron, as they were high budget, low return titles this past quarter. Even with those flops, the studio entertainment segment was still up 13% and did $2 billion in revenue. Analysts, here and here , for example, were betting on Disney to post big losses with ESPN and media channels, but that wasn't the case at all. Revenue for ABC, ESPN, and Disney channel combined were up 5% to $7.9 billion. With ESPN now accounting for 56% of Disney's total profits, the sports network has seen significant upside on the year, despite falling subscribers. Exclusive rights to a large amount of NFL and college football games is going to create an autumn worth remembering. I'd expect to see subscriber rates go up because of this. Sure, low ratings hurt ad revenues for these three major channels, but we have to think about the seasonality of the business. Baseball is currently the only sport going on, with games all over three hours that a majority of individuals channel flip when commercials come on, inevitably leading to lower ad revenues. The overlap that Football and Basketball are about to provide will surely help ESPN. ESPN has lost 3.2 million subscribers LTM, but that's old news and was previously exaggerated to be much higher. CEO Bob Iger stated in the earnings call that ESPN is a " must have " with any tv package and that 96% of all sports are watched live, which really reduces their worries for the segment. Furthermore, any advocates of the cord-cutting argument have to bet on ESPN being one of the last channels that'll ever fall victim to the switch given that statistic. Iger on the earnings call even said that streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are friends, not enemies. The consumer products division has the most upside. With more Star Wars merchandise rolling out September 4, merch from Disney's Frozen led the growth in Q3. With the segment growing 6% to $954 million in revenue. This exceptional growth, and while it only accounts for a small portion of quarterly revenues, can certainly get bolstered with franchises like Star Wars returning to relevancy. This is an incredibly difficult stock to bet against, given its years of returning exceptionally positive results. Iger sees this eighth straight quarter of earnings beat as just another indicator of the firm's long-term success, and despite forex problems causing half a billion loss in revenue for the quarter, brighter days are ahead for this stock. Disney still pays a comfortable dividend at 1.10% and I'd be honestly surprised if the company didn't hit $130 by the end of the calendar year. I think initial receipts from Star Wars: The Force Awakens will provide a great catalyst-base for boosting the stock, as well. I'm happy about the recent correction in the stock and believe it's a great time to get in. Oh, and if a record quarterly profit of $2.5 billion wasn't good enough, then I don't know what is.
