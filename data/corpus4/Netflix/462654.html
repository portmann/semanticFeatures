Peak Netflix: The Approaching Valuation Cliff - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix reported a slowdown in subscriber growth for Q2. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has ceased to be a momentum (upward) stock, and is entering a period of correction in which its earnings and valuation converge to a more sensible P/E. The share price trend is mostly downhill from the peak in 2015. Along this slippery slope, sudden cliffs may appear, as large institutional investors abandon Netflix as no longer disruptive. In January, I wrote the article, Have We Already Seen Peak Netflix? , pointing to the recent share price history as a possible indication that Netflix had peaked late in the year. As the chart above shows, the share price has continued to trend down. With the Q2 earnings report , investors have much more in the way of confirmation of the Peak Netflix thesis. As I pointed out in January, underlying the success of Netflix as a momentum stock has been the fact that subscriber additions was a metric that anyone could understand. As long as subscribers were added at a constant pace, the share price rose accordingly. That all came to a crashing halt with the Q2 subscriber data. Total subscriber additions came in well below the forecast of 2.5 million at 1.7 million. This represents a dramatic roll-off in growth rate, as the chart below shows. During the conference call , Netflix management offered a number of rationalizations for the shortfall. It was claimed that churn was higher due to higher service fees being charged, especially in the US, as existing subscribers were "un-grandfathered." CEO Reed Hastings reiterated his belief that the shortfall was not due to competition, even though domestic subscriptions nearly flatlined. His vision is that the market, even in the US, is far from saturated, and he continues to maintain that there is plenty of room for Netflix and its myriad competitors, including "virtual" MVPDs (Multichannel Video Programming Distributors) such as Dish Network's (NASDAQ: DISH ) SlingTV, along with SVOD providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Instant Video and Hulu. Hastings seems to see streaming services in the same vein as the broadcast and cable networks. In the old broadcast distribution model, consumers had access or bought access to a number of different channels, often at a multiple of the cost of Netflix. Hastings also stated the intention to continue to grow the proportion of original content on Netflix. It's clear that he sees content becoming primarily original, just as in the case of the traditional network and cable channels. So, In Hastings' view, there would be little mutual exclusivity involved in the competition between the SVODs. Consumers would buy all or most of them, in order to select their preferred content. There's a problem with this thesis, however. The problem is that there's already far more content on the major SVODs than most people can watch. Most consumers will not choose to buy additional SVOD services that they don't need. So, in effect, the SVODs and virtual MPVDs are competing. That competitive impact is already being felt in the US market. Netflix may already have reached a plateau in US subscribers. As of January, I had not foreseen the subscriber roll-off effect, but now that it's starting to manifest, it makes the Peak Netflix thesis all the more compelling. Most of my attention in January was focused on the fact that operating income and net income before taxes had also appeared to peak back in 2014, as the chart below shows. Income appears to have recovered in 2016, but it's still off the 2014 Q2 peak. Revenue growth is still healthy at 28% y/y to $2.105 billion, but operating income is down 6% y/y to $70.37 million. The sequential improvement in operating income was due to a smaller operating loss overseas. I had expressed concern about the increasing cost of servicing the Netflix debt, about $35 million per quarter. This is still a significant problem and accounts for much of the gap between operating income and net income before taxes. Unfortunately, this is only going to get worse, as Netflix management has indicated that it will continue to increase debt in order to fund original content. The need to sustain growth in overseas markets will probably continue to limit operating income. I don't see it recovering to the 2014 level any time soon. And, of course, non-GAAP free cash flow continues to be negative at -$254 million for the quarter. The profligate spending of Netflix would all make sense if it was faced with negligible competition. The spending is predicated on unlimited growth. But we're already seeing signs that the growth of Netflix is probably very limited. It's not that I think Netflix is doomed. Far from it. It has a strong product offering and is a leader in its industry. But that industry is maturing rapidly. Just about everyone has figured out by now that the Internet is the future of content distribution of all types. The mainstream media companies are moving rapidly to fill the void that Netflix had all to itself. Under the best case scenario, Netflix grows into its valuation. But even in this scenario, the stock doesn't appreciate significantly. Unfortunately, I don't see the best case scenario as being likely. I think it's far more likely that Netflix will fail to live up to the lofty expectations of investors, and the share price will correct accordingly. Those corrections are likely to be sudden and steep drops as we saw after-hours following the Q2 report. But the worst is yet to come. Netflix institutional ownership is a very high 84%, according to Google Finance. As institutions realize that Netflix is done as a momentum play, they're likely to bail out, putting large volumes of shares on the market. For this reason, I rate Netflix a short opportunity.
