CBS Positioned To Profit From The Future Of Television - CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) | Seeking Alpha A strong lineup gives CBS an advantage in negotiations with cable providers. CBS All Access and Showtime streaming position CBS to take advantage of paradigm shift. This past week, I purchased shares of CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS ). The company is well positioned to profit from a strong lineup and a paradigm shift in how TV/video content is consumed. While Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has been the pioneer, CBS is beginning to offer compelling streaming content. Unlike many of its peers, CBS is welcoming the future of television with CBS All Access and Showtime streaming. I believe that CBS is in the sweet spot for profiting from the transition to on-demand while being able to strong-arm cable companies into paying more for content. CBS All Access: For $6 per month, CBS All Access provides subscribers with access to 6,500 TV shows on-demand. This is cheaper than $8-9 per month for Netflix and $8 per month for Hulu. The shows include the NCIS franchise, the CSI franchise, Survivor, 90210, 60 Minutes, Criminal Minds, Elementary, Family Ties, Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Melrose's Place, the Star Trek franchise, Taxi and many more. The app is user friendly and much easier to navigate than Hulu. Given 9 million subscibers at Hulu and 60 M subs for Netflix , I project that CBS All Access will reach 5 M subs by the end of 2016. Showtime: This July, Showtime will be available for streaming outside of a cable contract on Roku, Apple TV and PlayStation Vue for $11 per month. Showtime provides a competitive alternative and complement to Netflix and HBO NOW from Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). Showtime will likely lure Netflix customers that want to increase their available content for streaming and others that are just bored with Netflix's content. HBO Now has better content than both Netflix and Showtime but costs $15 per month via iTunes and Sling.com. Given 60 million paid subscribers at Netflix, I project that Showtime's streaming service could reach 5 million subscribers by the end of 2016. The Cable Networks Division, which includes Showtime, is the most profitable part of CBS. In the first quarter of 2015 , Cable Networks accounted 33% of net income but only 15% of revenue. The Cable Networks Division recorded a profit margin of 47% vs. 17% for the rest of the businesses. A successful launch of Showtime streaming could drive net income and earnings per share growth. Five million subs per year at a 47% profit margin could translate to an additional $307 million of net income. Content And Negotiations: High quality content leads to negotiating power. The fall lineup includes new shows Code Black, Supergirl and Limitless. Returning from last year are NCIS, NCIS: New Orleans, Blue Bloods, Criminal Minds, CSI: Cyber, Elementary, The Good Wife, Hawaii Five-0, Madam Secretary, NCIS: Los Angeles, Survivor, The Amazing Race, 60 Minutes and 48 Hours. NFL Thursday Night Football also will return to CBS this fall along with their typical Sunday NFL games. On February 7th, CBS will broadcast Super Bowl L (50). This will likely be the most watched and most celebrated event of all time. Add in March Madness, and CBS has the upper hand when negotiating with cable providers. On June 30th, CBS' contract with AT&T U-verse , which has 2.5 million subscribers, comes due. After a short blackout last December, CBS struck a deal with DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH ), disabling the ad-skipping DVR feature for CBS-owned broadcasting stations. Valuation: Over the past 12 months, CBS earned $3.01 per share for a trailing P/E of 19.3. Looking forward, CBS is expected to earn $3.79 over the next four quarters for a forward P/E of 15.3. Over the past year, CBS aggressively repurchased shares outstanding, reducing share count by 15.7%. The reduction in shares outstanding will continue to have a positive impact on earnings per share. CBS is definitely a better value than Netflix. CBS' market cap is 39% lower than Netflix even though CBS' revenue is 60% higher and net income is 407% higher. CBS has more channels of distribution and has an opportunity to grow in Netflix's backyard - which is streaming. Conclusion: CBS is a well managed company with a great content lineup. As the method viewers use to consume video content continues to evolve, CBS will profit with the introductions of CBS All Access and Showtime. I plan on adding to my position in CBS on a pull-back in stock price. Source: CBS Positioned To Profit From The Future Of Television Disclosure: I am/we are long CBS, TWX, AAPL, FOXA, T.
