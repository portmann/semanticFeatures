My Top 5 Stocks Picks For 2016 | Seeking Alpha Matt Bohlsen , High Net Worth Financial Advising (149 clicks) World investment in renewables, largely in solar and wind, went up by 17% to $270bn in 2014, and will likely beat this for 2015, and again in 2016, spurred on by the successful December 2015 Paris COP21 climate agreement. History may show December 2015 as a tipping or inflexion point for the renewable energy sector. The two largest global economies USA and China are now both fully committed to renewable energy. With this in mind, here are my top 5 picks for 2016. Three of them are in the booming renewable energy/electric vehicle (NYSE: EV ) sectors. 1) First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR ) - Price = $63.41 The COP21 Paris Climate Change conference in December 2015, resulted in the first ever climate change agreement by all 195 countries. This will lead to a boom in private and public support particularly for solar and wind energy. In December 2015, solar energy just received a big boost in the USA with a 5 year extension of the 30% Government subsidy, and a phased down extension through to 2022. As Elon Musk eloquently says - "the planet is already solar powered" we just need to harness a small fraction of that power". See the full video here . Or as solar analyst Travis Hoium states , "Enough solar energy hits the earth every hour to replace all other energy sources used in a year combined. If we could capture 0.011% of the solar energy that hits the world every day it could literally power every car and electrical device currently in existence." Most experts conclude that solar and wind will be the major renewable energy sources. See also Tony Seba's video here . He estimates that US solar will go from 300,000 homes in 2013 to 20 million by 2022 - a 66 fold increase. Read also my previous article on this topic on Seeking Alpha here . Currently less than 1% of US has solar compared to 15 % in Australia. The potential for the US is for 1% to grow to 50% + , or from 1m today to 20m by 2020 - a 20-fold increase. Given the huge drop in solar panel costs over the past 2 decades, solar is now often cheaper than grid powered electricity and much better for the environment. The government is supporting solar and public opinion and awareness is changing rapidly. In 2006, only about 30,000 US homes had solar and the cost was around $9 per watt. By February 2016 the US is expected to reach the milestone of 1 million homes with solar, and prices are down to $3.79 per watt. More American homes than ever before are getting solar panels. The amount of home solar roofs grew 70% year-over-year for the most recent quarter. Solar farms are sprouting up all over the US. So far this year (2015), 40% of all the new electricity generating capacity came from solar. First Solar is currently my top pick to play the solar sector despite the stock rallying 40% in the past 1 year. The reasons are; US number 1 solar company by size, and the leader in the commercial solar sector, with a strong global business. A strong track record, and a very strong order book (US and abroad) for 2016, with over 75% of next year's available supply already contracted. High efficiency (16.4%) and cost effective solar modules. Very strong balance sheet with $1.81b in cash and marketable securities and growing (should reach $2.6b by end 2016), only $285 million in total debt and a low debt to equity ratio of 0.053 , and a strong current ratio of 3.63. Low 2015 estimated PE at 14.20. The PEG ratio looks high at 7.06 however analysts were previously bearish on growth thinking the subsidies would be cut at the end of 2016. Current analyst buy ratings are at 50%, with a consensus target price of $66.96. I expect analysts will soon upgrade this target in light of recent positive events. NB: For investors wanting more exposure to the US residential solar (rather than commercial with FirstSolar) leader with 33% market share, then I would suggest looking at SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ). I did not choose it here as it is not currently profitable and therefore more risky. Also if investors want the global leader then they should take a look at Trina Solar (NYSE: TSL ). 2) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) - Price = $230.46 I chose Tesla because 2016 will likely be a breakout year when they announce sales of the Model 3 "affordable car", priced around $35,000 less $7,500 of incentives in the US. Currently Tesla sells about 50,000 vehicles a year. I would not be surprised to see Model 3 orders of 100,000 to 500,000. This would be the catalyst to send a huge "charge" to the stock price and assure the success of Tesla. Electric vehicles will continue to boom for the following reasons: COP21's success will lead to further Government and private support for EVs. As more and more people switch to solar roof top energy, they will also switch to using electric vehicles, powered essentially for free from their roof top solar. Consumers will soon realize that EVs have amazing torque and acceleration and are fun to drive, almost silent and pollution free. Consumers will switch to EVs (especially Tesla Model 3) as they see lower prices, long range, and very low running and maintenance costs. Consumers will at last be able to significantly help the environment. Strong management led by Elon Musk and a strong technical team led by JB Straubel. Also a sound business plan, that is being steadily implemented. Tesla is in the top 3 EV companies for global sales, and is number 1 for sales of pure EVs globally. Tesla is a trend brand name. People will buy Tesla electric vehicles because they want the brand name recognition and status thereof. Tesla EVs offer more range than other EV makers. This is critical to buyers. They also offer outstanding performance, and soon price. Tesla will soon have a completed gigafactory. This will help bring down battery costs. That will allow the Tesla Model 3 to be price competitive with ICE cars as soon as 2020, or as early as 2017 if you include running and maintenance costs. The gigafactory will lead to other huge revenue streams for Tesla. That will include selling batteries to other EV makers, but most importantly selling batteries to SolarCity and other solar consumers who want to become totally self sufficient and off grid for electricity. These customers will effectively achieve zero ongoing electricity costs. Tesla has steadily rising car sales and revenue. The company is likely to become EPS positive (profitable) in 2016 or 2017 for the first time, as expenses slow and sales rise further. This will also be a huge catalyst for investors. Tesla's financials are naturally not great as profits have been is poured back into the company. The 2017 PE estimate is around 46. NB: Byd Co ( OTCPK:BYDDF ) is also a good EV company to consider if you prefer to invest in the "Tesla of China". It's currently priced at USD 5.35. 3) Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co Ltd (02208:xhkg) ( OTC:XJNGF ) - Price = HKD 13.78 , USD 1.45 China has embarked on the greatest push for renewable energy the world has ever seen. China has announced that they plan to add a staggering 100 KW of wind capacity from 2015-2020. This will double their wind energy capacity to 200 GW. China is already the world's largest producer of wind power (27% of global wind power capacity), and plans further massive increases. Goldwind is the global number 2 wind energy company, with 10.3 % market share. It is based in China, but also has global operations. It currently trades on a P/E of just 9.6, or 2016 P/E of 8.7, with an analyst buy rating, and a one year target price of HKD23.36, representing 70% upside. 4) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) - Price = $107.72 The Walt Disney Company is primarily a global entertainment company. They make money from their multimedia (TV, online etc.) content and networks, movies, theme parks and resorts, and merchandise products. My reasons for including Walt Disney are as follows: A recent buy catalyst is the likely upside to earnings due to the likely record breaking box office dollars ( $250 million opening record), for their latest movie, "The Force Awakens". It may well beat Avatar's $760m record, for the biggest US movie sales ever. The global movie sales are forecast by Goldman Sachs to reach $ 1.95 billion. Add to this merchandising from Star Wars (The Force awakens) that may bring in around $ 2.5-3.0 billion for Disney. Further series (8 and 9) in the Star Wars trilogy will continue Disney's success. Market leader for children's entertainment in a world with more and more kids who love Disney every day. The movie "Frozen", was an example of this. The Disney-Pixar tie up has been hugely successful. Also the $4b purchase of Lucasfilms will now pay off with the upcoming success of the Star Wars trilogy. New and expanded theme parks opening. Disneyland Shanghai has been announced and is in planning to open in 2016. I expect this will be huge for Disney, and will be Disney's sixth Disneyland theme park. A 14 acre Star Wars Land added to both Disney's existing Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Park. Plus an 11 acre Toy Story land will be added to Florida's Walt Disney World. Well positioned in Sports TV with ESPN. Subscribers and profits will recover over time from the recent fall back. Sports will remain very popular. If not it is immaterial to Disney long term. As a provider of quality and in demand content, Disney is in a strong position to set pricing and not have to sacrifice margins. Disney currently trades on a P/E of 20.9, or 2016 P/E of 19.1, a PEG ratio of 1.7, and analyst buy rating of 50% with a one year consensus target price of $120, representing 11% upside. 5) Alibaba ( BABA ) - Price = $82.65 Alibaba is part of the "BAT" team - Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), Alibaba, and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ). They are China's internet dominators and align with the "FANG" team of USA - Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) that boomed in 2015. I see 2016 as the year of the BAT. Global Internet users are forecast to almost double from 3 billion in 2015, to 4.7 -6 billion users in the next 10 years, and most of that will come from the developing world. China has the most people online by far and there are about 2.0 to 2.5 times more Chinese than Americans online. It is rapidly expanding both in China (increased smart phone and internet penetration) and overseas. Alibaba has about 350 m active monthly users heading towards 2b in ten years from now. On Singles Day (11/11/2015) the Alibaba site sold $14.3b of goods in just 24 hours. Most went through Alipay earning 0.18% commission for the payment operator partly owned by Alibaba. It has acquired stakes in many other promising companies such as Paytm in India (invested USD 700m in the start up), and around 20 new companies in 2015. If Alipay (owned by Ant Financial) has an IPO in 2016 then Alibaba will receive in cash 37.5% of Ant Financial's pre-tax profit , and 37.5% of its equity value, plus an option to take an equity stake of up to 33%. All nice for Alibaba. Ant Financial also owns a 51% stake in Tianhong, which manages an $87b money market fund called Zeng Yuan which trades on the Yu E Bao platform. Alibaba top line and bottom line revenues continue to shine, with net profit margins above 20%. Alibaba currently trades on a PE of 67, or a 2016 PE of 31.8. It has a PEG ratio of 1.19 and 90% analyst buy rating with a consensus target price of $93.52. Huisheng International (01340:xhkg) - Price = HKD 1.00 Huisheng is my number one speculative stock pick for 2016. It is a vertically integrated Chinese pork producer based in China, and listed in Hong Kong. It is currently expanding from 700K to 1m hogs pa. Revenues have been rising with flat profits as they have invested to expand capacity. Net profit margin in 2014 was 8.7%. It trades on a very low PE of just 3.25. My reason for liking them is the rising Chinese middle class love pork, the company is very cheaply valued, and profits will soon rise as the their capacity expansion is completed.
