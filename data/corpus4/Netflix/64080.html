An Apple Ultra HD TV Could Be A Better Growth Driver Than Smartwatches - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I support Icahn’s call for Apple to enter the Ultra HD TV market in 2016. Icahn’s estimate of $15 billion annual revenue from the sale of 10 million Apple ultra-high definition TV units is highly possible. The new $240 price target of Carl Icahn for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a little more believable if Tim Cook really revives the Apple HDTV product that was allegedly shelved last year. Icahn's call for Cook to finally enter the surging 4K/Ultra High Definition Television industry is in line with my old thesis . Selling television sets is a viable expansion move that could help Apple lessen its heavy exposure to iPhone sales. According to Mr. Icahn's 2016 & 2017 estimates, Apple could sell 10 million units of 55-inch and 65-inch Ultra HD TV sets. The potential revenue from this new product line is $15 billion in 2016 and $37.5 billion in 2017. I agree with Mr. Icahn's idea that Ultra HD TVs could become bigger than the Mac or iPad business. I will even go further and say that a smart iOS 9 or Mac OS X Smart Ultra HD TV could prove to be a bigger business opportunity than the Apple Watch. I do not think the iWatch could generate $22 billion in sales by end of 2016. Smartwatches are not as useful as smartphones, there is little incentive for big-spending people to buy them. The higher average selling prices of the Apple Watch models also makes them vulnerable to cheaper iPhone-compatible Android watches. Furthermore, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is already helping Swiss watch firm TAG Heuer create a luxury Android Wear watch. I opine TAG Heuer has a more powerful brand appeal when it comes to wristwatches. The TAG Heuer Android Wear watch will reportedly launch in November with a price tag of around $1,400 - significantly cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition's price tags of $10,000 - $17,000. KGI Securities has already warned its client investors that the Apple Watch is losing steam . KGI Securities has reduced its first- year annual sales estimate for the Apple Watch from 20-30 million units down to below 15 million units. I find the 50% estimate reduction from KGI Securities' Taiwan-based Ming-Chi Kuo (who makes his predictions based on Apple's supply chain in Asia) as more believable than Morgan Stanley's survey-based 36 million first-year sales estimate for the Apple Watch. If Apple did not cancel the development of its HDTV product last year, it could be have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the surging demand for Ultra HD TV sets. Digitimes reports that cheaper bill of materials costs could help the Ultra HD TV product to hit 40 million units in global shipments this year. Supply chain sources reveal production costs for 4K TVs are just 15% higher than full HD 1080p TVs. However, the price tags of current Ultra HD 4K TV sets are still 50% higher than full HD TVs. This is great for Apple's high-margin policy. Technavio analysts predict a CAGR of 45% for Ultra HD TV sales from 2014 to 2019. Mr. Icahn's $15 billion prediction for Apple HDTV contribution to Apple's 2016 revenue calls for an average selling price of $1,500. This is achievable because Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), LG Electronics, and Vizio are selling $1,000 40-inch/49-inch Ultra HD TV products. Samsung and LG should not remain as a duopoly in Ultra HDTV sales. Apple's successful high-margin policy for its hardware products will again allow it to sell a 55-inch HDTV for $1,500. Apple already dominates the premium smartphone sales in America and China. North America, where Apple is strong, is the biggest market for Ultra HD TVs. If iPhones can outsell cheaper Xiaomi premium phones in China, Apple's brand popularity could also help it become a dominant player in China's fast-growing Ultra HDTV industry . Xiaomi will soon sell a $800 55-inch 4K Smart TV in China. However, Apple might find it easy to beat Xiaomi with a $1,500 4K Smart HDTV - just like how Apple succeeded in getting more Chinese buyers for $885 iPhones (over the $327 Xiaomi Mi 3). Apple should listen to Mr. Icahn. Selling cheap $70 Apple TV boxes is against the traditional high-margin practice of Apple. The threat of PopCorn Time also makes the Pay TV service a risky venture. In spite of the growing number of subscribers, expensive content licensing still makes it hard for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) to make profit margin. Mr. Icahn's call for a $1,500 Ultra HD TV product is more coherent for Apple's long-term growth. If we use Digitimes' estimate of 40 million shipments for this year and average selling price of $1,000, the global 4K Ultra HD TV market could be worth $40 billion this year. A 45% CAGR could potentially mean global annual sales of $121 billion for Ultra HD TVs by 2018. Apple should not miss this obvious golden opportunity.
