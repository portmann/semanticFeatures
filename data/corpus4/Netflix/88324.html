Netflix Will Likely Fail In China - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Few American companies succeed in China, especially when there are Chinese companies with large amounts of resources also competing in that market. In the case of Netflix, all three of the biggest private Chinese companies are involved in video streaming, with Alibaba recently entering the fray. Netflix is too expensive right now, especially given this China risk, but investors should wait until after the stock split to short it. It's well known that the list of American companies that have managed to succeed in China is rather short. This is doubly so for companies that sell products that depend upon judging Chinese demand - a situation that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) finds itself in. It has to select shows that it will buy the rights to and bring to its Chinese portal. Even companies that sell undifferentiated goods have struggled to gain market share in China, with companies as mighty as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) unable to build a sizable presence. Netflix dipped a little bit on the news that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) would be launching the "Netflix of China." Alibaba is already a very familiar brand in China, and knows what Chinese consumers think. I think in particular they'll have a big advantage when it comes to designing the UI for their video streaming service. Chinese consumers have radically different design tastes than consumers in the West, as can be seen in Weibo's (NASDAQ: WB ) (a major micro blogging platform in China) extremely cluttered design. Tencent's ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) messaging apps are also packed with features. This would never fly in America or any other Western country really - Silicon Valley companies generally produce products that do one thing really well, and that's all. Good design in America is completely different than good design in China. Alibaba has already crushed American competitors before , and this time it's the one with vast resources at its disposal. The conglomerate model is also fairly popular in China, which is another contrast to America. The most successful (financially speaking) American companies are famous for their incredible focus, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). However, the most successful companies in China make money from a multitude of vastly different products. This can be seen from how both Tencent and Alibaba engage in multiple different lines of business, and the former manages to dominate social media, messaging, web portals and gaming in China . Alibaba dominates e-commerce, cloud services and payment (through their stake in AliPay). Additionally, the Chinese government is likely to favor local companies. Netflix's experience with video streaming is also not guaranteed to result in success in China. The best example of this can again be seen from how Alibaba beat eBay, despite eBay coming first. Additionally Uber, the pioneer in ride sharing services, only has around a 20% market share in China, while Didi-Kuaidi owns the remaining 80%. It's also interesting that headlines are declaring that Alibaba's service will be the Netflix of China, when such a video streaming service already exists , in the form of Iqiyi from Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ). Additionally Tencent has its own video streaming service as well, though it isn't as popular as Iqiyi. I doubt that Netflix would be able to beat Alibaba even if they launched their services at the same time, but there's an even slimmer chance of them beating an already entrenched service. They have to get the design, content and pricing right, which will take a lot of time and focus. Given that China is just one country in Netflix's overall international push, I feel that the latter is severely lacking. There's still a possibility for Alibaba to make inroads, given that video streaming in China is still young and more importantly because they are very well known in China and know China well. China isn't really a market that Netflix can afford to lose, given that it contains around 20% of the world's population. This is especially true since Netflix currently seem to be priced for perfection, having risen nearly 100% year to date, as can be seen below: Part of this was due to solid subscriber growth for the last quarter, and another part is due to excitement from an upcoming stock split. Investors are excited about the potential in international subscriber growth, and failure in China won't be an easy pill to swallow. Moreover, the valuation right now is very rich. It trades at a 185 P/E, and has negative growth rates, EPS wise. Even its revenue growth rate is only around 25%. They're also piling on more and more debt, increasing by 1.5 billion dollars in the past quarter . Most of this is going to fund their international growth/original content, which makes the debt somewhat risky. If their international growth or new programs don't go as well as expected, Netflix may be left struggling to fulfill its obligations. This risk is not really reflected in its share price, especially since China will be an extraordinarily tough market to succeed in. However, due to the stock split, I recommend waiting before shorting the stock/buying puts. People buy stock in companies that they know, and Netflix is well known among younger generations, such as Millennials. Younger people generally tend to have less money - making a high share price a greater deterrent to ownership than older people with more capital. This is why it's likely that the stock split will result in a rise in the share price, at least in the short term. The long-term future for Netflix looks murky, which is not reflected in the current share price, let alone an even higher share price.
