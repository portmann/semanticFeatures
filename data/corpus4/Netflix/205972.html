Netflix releases first original film - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Oct 16 2015, 02:58 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) first original feature film, Beasts of No Nation, is scheduled to make its global debut on Friday. The movie will be the company's first film to be released simultaneously in 29 theaters and on its streaming service, blending the new with the old and prompting questions about the future direction of the movie business. It's also a major shake-up to an industry in which movies generally get a 90-day window before they hit the Internet or DVDs. Netflix should be trading at $65 and NOT more than $100. It's quite clear no matter how many originals they release. Thank you Using Netflix will be a disaster. Hopefully for the production company, Netflix paid them a boatload upfront for the film. That will not be a very feasible business model to release those mega budget movies on Internet or tv before making a good groosing from the theaters. Who cares? CFO lies exposed by many today. 808k subscribers vs an estimated 1.1 million subscribers. its going below 70 tomorrow. sell stops @ 85 ok let's think about this. how much money have you spent on going to the movies this year for just the films. I can tell you I've prob seen 3-4 movies in 2015.. now imagine that there is a company that releases quality shows and now they added their own production releases and to top it off you don't need to go to the theater and you can get access to this for under $15 a month, sounds like a no brainer to me. If Netflix can continue to produce quality especially movies there will be masses signing up for the never ending blockbuster straight to your TV. this will bring in more money then theater revenue because only handfuls of the population see more then 5 theater releases each year. So when you do the numbers they will actually be making more from each person as just about everyone will eventually sign up when nflx gets to their production goals. you all are underestimating the potential of what netflix is setting up. imagine if you could just rent movies just released to theaters. something like on demand but with netflix. and at 8$ soon to be 9$ a month for netflix id pay 10$ to see a new movie. netflix could raise the monthly sub price to 15$+ and still its a steal. a big hit to cable companies. #gonetflix ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
