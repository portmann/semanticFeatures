Have One Dreamer Stock In Your Portfolio - Cramer's Mad Money (4/13/15) | Seeking Alpha Apr. 14, 2015  7:38 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , ABBV , AWAY , BIDU , BX , BXMT , DD , NFLX , NKE , NXPI , PSG , PVH , QCOM , TWTR , UA by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Netflix should not be valued with traditional metrics. Buy into Blackstone Mortgage Trust's secondary offering. Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, April 13. It's time to dream big for your portfolio. Cramer said that many stocks are undervalued because they are trapped in an index, to which they belong, or an ETF that buys the stock, or analysts who have traditional methods of valuation. He adds that some stocks are undervalued simply because investors can't think big. If investors start thinking big and attribute a small portion of their portfolio to dreaming big, then they can make big bucks. Commenting on the methods of valuation, he said, "They have a literal and linear sense of things, taught at fabulous business schools and then honed at traditional research houses. These quizzical valuations are a product of that upbringing." Cramer cited the example of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) to think differently about a stock rather than valuing it on EPS. The public currently gives Netflix a valuation of $27B. Since Netflix does not trade like a normal stock, its private valuation is irrelevant. Today, Netflix is dominant, the way people consume at-home entertainment. For a small monthly fee, customers gets access to huge content, and its own programming which has built brand loyalty. "The concept that users didn't have to pay for every program that they watch helped Netflix corner the market on binge watching," said Cramer. "As a private company, Netflix would be thought of as an important form of worldwide entertainment, and if it were up for a new round of financing, I think it could easily be worth double its current public valuation," said Cramer. Since investors are willing to give Uber a $40B valuation, or the billions that Airbnb, Dropbox and Spotify have attracted, Netflix is not that far off. "Why the heck shouldn't Netflix, which has changed the way we live, be worth much much more than it currently is?" While some investors may think that Netflix is overvalued today compared to the past where it was significantly less, is a concept that should not apply to cult stocks like Netflix. "Netflix is an institution. A worldwide one. It should be valued accordingly. One day it will be. Not this week. Maybe not this year. But one day," said Cramer. Cramer said if the stock makes any decline prior to earnings, then it's an opportunity to add Netflix to your portfolio. The same argument could be applied to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and HomeAway (NASDAQ: AWAY ). Cramer wants investors to own at least one big dreamer stock in their portfolio and take a little more risk than they normally would. CEO interview - Performance Sports Group (NYSE: PSG ) The strength of athletic apparel stocks like Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) shows the potential of the group. Another small cap stock in the group that has been performing well is the Performance Sports Group. The stock has rallied 47% in the last year. The company is a maker of sports equipment for hockey, baseball, softball and lacrosse. PSG has many top-notch brands such as Bauer, Mission, Maverik, Cascade, and Combat. PSG acquired Easton's baseball and softball business for $330M. The company reported a fabulous quarter and Cramer interviewed CEO Kevin Davis to hear more about the future of the company. Commenting on the Easton acquisition, Davis said, "No question about it. Easton is a fantastic company. Great people there, great innovation and really bringing compelling products to the sport and we are really excited to have it as part of the team." He spoke about the technological innovation in Easton's products and how it has been a great business for the company. He also said that the company is bringing innovation at every price point, so an average fan can afford to buy products. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) deal In the earlier days of investing, when a company like Qualcomm would lose a contract from Apple, the stock would be hammered. But those were the old days of investing. On Tuesday, Jana Partners pressured Qualcomm to spin off its wireless chip business in order to unlock value. In the old days, the hedge funds would have booked profits on the stock run and left. But with Jana Partners, the tables have turned. The activist pointed out that the Apple contract was never the problem, Qualcomm's corporate structure was. Cramer thinks that if Apple would have given the contract to Qualcomm, then no one would have questioned the company's structure. Also Jana thought that Qualcomm would be worth the effort if it was up for a bid with one of the largest contracts out there. "There are no real losers in the real world. There are only companies with lots of cash who win good business and others with lots of cash who lose good business but have strong balance sheets and simply aren't able to figure out how to bring out the value of their enterprise," said Cramer. He likes the idea of Jana not giving up. They have bought value in stocks like Walgreens and McGraw Hill. General Electric (NYSE: GE ): Cramer likes the stock. AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ): Cramer likes the stock. DuPont (NYSE: DD ): Cramer thinks it could do well in the long-run. Baidu.com (NASDAQ: BIDU ): Cramer thinks that the Chinese market is going crazy and he is not a fan of Baidu.
