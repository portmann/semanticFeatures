Netflix Plummets As Growth Story Comes To A Halt: Company Says "We Are Not Growing As Fast As We Would Lke" | Zero Hedge by Steve H. Hanke - Jul 18, 2016 3:34 PM Freddie Gray has taken the focus off of Baltimoreâ€™s painful economic plunge that can be laid squarely at the feet of Charm Cityâ€™s long embrace of anti-market economic policies. by Sprott Money - Jul 18, 2016 9:35 AM There is only one mode of legitimate analysis for markets. A lot of people seem to have forgotten these principles. Netflix Plummets As Growth Story Comes To A Halt: Company Says "We Are Not Growing As Fast As We Would Lke" While NFLX moments ago reported Q2 EPS of $0.09 that beat expectations $0.03 despite missing badly on international streaming adds of just 1.52mm Exp. 2.15MM), the reasons the stock is plunging after hours is because it appears that Netflix growth story is officially over, and not just because the company guided far lower on international net additions, seeing only 2.00 million, 20% below Wall Street's forecast of 2.54MM, but because as the Company itself admitted, "we are growing, but not as fast as we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business." It wasn't just the abysmal international guidance: NFLX also reported that it expects a paltry 300,000 net US streaming additions in Q3, less than half of the street's 695,000 forecast. NETFLIX 2Q INTL STREAMING NET ADDS 1.52M, EST. 2.15M NETFLIX SEES 3Q INTERNATIONAL STREAMING NET ADDS 2M, EST. 2.54M NETFLIX SEES 3Q DOMESTIC NET ADDS 0.30M, EST. 695K It appears that unscalability of NFLX barriers to entry was a little exagerated: As Internet TV rises in popularity, so do the SVOD offerings. In the US, for example, CBS All Access, Seeso, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others are all growing. Our view, however, is that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q2. First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where ungrandfathering is also underway. This is how Reed Hastings justifies the ugly forecast: Our global member forecast for Q2 was 2.5m and we came in at 1.7m. Gross additions were on target, but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the press coverage in early April of our plan to ungrandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter. We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually ungrandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations. With our large subscriber base, slight variances in retention versus forecast can result in significant swings in net adds, particularly in a seasonally small net add quarter like Q2. Our global membership forecast for Q3 includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics, on par with what we experienced four years ago, and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast X1 launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release Netflix on the X1 when the viewer experience is great. For Q3, we forecast US net adds of 0.3 million as ungrandfathering continues. We expect US contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q3 and Q4 and we anticipate meeting our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020, or even earlier.  International net additions in Q2 came to 1.5 million compared to our 2.0 million forecast. Ungrandfathering occurred in Canada, UK/Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordics during Q2 where, like the US, we saw a similar, earlierthanexpected impact on retention. In our newer markets, we continue to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multiyear period, similar to our International revenue rose 67% year over year. Excluding the impact of F/X ($ 37 million impact on a y/y basis), international ASP increased 8.7%. International contribution profit totaled $ 69 million as content spending was slightly lower than our forecast. For Q3, we expect international net additions of 2.0m. Our approach in expanding our global footprint in January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen, learn and iterate quickly. Now that we are six months in, we will localize Netflix in Poland and Turkey with the addition of local language in the user interface, subtitles and dubbing. Localization in other markets will take place over time as economically prudent. International contribution loss in Q3 is expected to be $ 95 million as improving profitability in our earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories. We remain confident in these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to 2014 which are individually profitable on a contribution profit basis. These 20102013 launch markets are on track to deliver aggregate contribution profit of around $500 million in 2016. This is what market saturation looks like: NFLX posted its first decline in internet traffic share in years. So NFLX growth is slowing down. Is its cash burn? Nope. "In Q2â€™16, free cash flow amounted to $ 254 million, compared with $ 261 million in Q1â€™16. We finished the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion, while gross debt was unchanged at $2.4 billion. We still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016/early 2017." Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content. Original content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix, exclusivity, greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh the timing of cash payments. And visually, the company has burned more than $1 billion in the past year, with $254MM in Q2 cash burn compare to $229MM a year ago. And then there is the great Chinese myth: Unfortunately, this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging. Disneyâ€™s streaming service, launched in conjunction with Alibaba, was closed down, as was Appleâ€™s movie offering. We continue to explore options and, in the meantime, have plenty of work to do in our newly opened markets. The sad summary that may well have closed the chapter on NFLX's growth story: Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years. Continued US growth will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US Netflix can reach 6090 million members. We continue to expect to run around breakeven on a net income basis in 2016 and to generate material profits in 2017 and beyond. We will drive operating profit growth in 2017 by reducing our international losses and continuing to grow US profit. raywolf EmmittFitzhume Jul 18, 2016 4:13 PM Gaius Frakkin' ... raywolf Jul 18, 2016 4:18 PM NoDebt Gaius Frakkin' Baltar Jul 18, 2016 4:23 PM 847328_3527 Delving Eye Jul 18, 2016 5:50 PM Most of their new films added stink.

The ultimatum was to take in increase or get downgraded to lower bandwidth. I said fine....downgrade the bandwidth. I am this close to moving to Crave on principle I am also getting sick of paying them to produce second rate garbage that they consider winners that are only full of violence and a very heavy LGBT indoctrination. Hey, I don't pay you to brainwash me netflix. I'm there to be entertained and you are failing on that account. Why couldn't you do a deal with criterion instead of producing your own junk and actually bring some quality movies to you site. and stop taking your movies out of the bargain dvd bin. It is embarrassing for a supposed leading movie provider some of the stuff you try to sell to me Penelope Dreadful U4 eee aaa Jul 18, 2016 5:01 PM When they start queer-norming, I stop watching the show and usually the series. I turned off Shades of Blue, Rosewood, The Catch, and several others when they started throwing in obligatory lezzie sex, and back alley blow jobs. Nope, too much out there to watch, listen to, read, and do, to put up with a bunch of perverts and freaks trying to brainwash me. Also, I don't shop at Target, J C Penneys, and I stopped buying Campbells soups. They used to have a pretty good selection of classic and silent films, but you can't even do a goddamn "genre" search on Nutflix anymore. Foreign films are my favorite but their selection has become tiresome, to say the least. H H Henry P P P... Jul 18, 2016 4:14 PM When you already have every person on the planet subscribed to Netflix, why would investors think there would be any additional growth prospects?  Netflix doesn't release phones every year, they don't sell additional services.  It's a one trick pony, and they have to find another revenue machine to generate from, not just a monthly subscription. Nothing new here.  Peaking around to $680 before the 7:1 split seemed a little ridiculous.  Call me when it gets to $14. I used my sister's login to check out Netflix. Under new releases all they show is all of the Netflix series and every once and a while a movie. I tried to find any of the big movies released last year and couldn't find any of them. For a movie service they seem to have very few movies worth watching. AND REALLY $.09 IS A BEAT FOR A COMPANY TRADING AT 340 P/E!!!!!! I think international is slow because nobody couch-potatoes like Americans not to mention shitty ISP.  Is there enough gross tv watching internationally to warrant a paid membership?  I guess not. ThrownOffZHTwice Jul 18, 2016 4:39 PM Netflix used to have a lot of good movies.  Now the selection is not very good.  I have not dropped them yet, but I am considering it.  SlingTV is pretty good.  I have the basic package.  Seems every couple of weeks they have free days of HBO and channels like that.  I look at the two or three movies that HBO has that are worth watching, so it works out pretty well.  I'd never subscribe to HBO.  I got 30 days of Amazon Prime for free. You have to pay extra for any good movie, what a load of shit.  Amazon Prime was crap.  Crackle, which is always free, has a few good movies, but also commercials, but that is okay.  Too bad about Netflix selection.  It used to be good.  Netflix should spend their money putting good movies online, and not waste it on their own lousy productions. I spent  30 minutes Saturday looking for anything worth watching.  The New Releases suck.  The Just Added is old content. And there mustbe dozens of shows they are producing themselves.   It is also worth mentioning that the average Netflix movie seems to have 1.5 stars.  It is streaming crap on demand.  Great for a public sewer, Rio would LOVE to be able to do that!  But not so compelling for a video service. On a more Serious Note, Sony is starting their own streaming service through the PS4, probably coming to other platforms sooner rather than later.  Sony of course owns roughly 1/3 of all the IP in entertainment.  So they are extremely well positioned to absolutely BURY Netflix in the next year or so. Anyone else have a NFLX account? Mrs. Homey has one and for shits and giggles I logged on recently and tried to find about a dozen or so of my favorite movies. NFLX had NONE OF them.  Then tried to find a few episodes of my favorite old time TV shows- again NOTHING.So I asked Mrs. Homey why we still have it and she said the content has gotten much worse and  we are cancelling. To be honest, I can find about as much if not more for free on the interweb and YouTube as on NFLX. I took a flyer last year and bought 300 shares at $100 right after the split-- rode it to $120 and sold when I saw their earnings and laughed my ass off on their aquisition cost per customer and debt financing.  To me this is at best a $10 stock.  I disagree with you guys...sorry, but I pay 8 bucks a month, and altho the movie selection is not so good, I have found a few good ones. each month...I find t least a dozen a month.. that makes each movie I watch about 60 cents.."the messengers" was good, just watched "marco polo", etc.   I think netflix is fine, but you guys are correct, they have 80% crap movies...so afr tho, its been worth my 8 bucks a month..... - Captain America Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Age of Ultron(and most of the Marvel series)  hell on wheels, prison break, the messengers, say what ya want, but for 8 bucks a month, I dont see a problem... the reason netflix is having a problem, is because people are sharing their passwords with other people...netflix is clamping down on it..Another reason netflix is not doing good, is because people starting downloading the movies and sending them to others for free...Netflix has already taken care of this also...It is of my opinion, that the real reason that netflix is doing not so good, is because PEOPLE DONT HAVE ANY MORE FRIGGIN MONEY!!!!! I hate artciles such as this....netflix is not "plummetting"  they are at an average situation when looking at their stocks...They are a little low right now, but far from "plummetting".....I cant trust zerohedge anymore, with headlines such as this...I am going to do my own reserch from now on...look at the 2 year stock in the link below...  ZH is losing my attention with their gloom and doom headlines...Yes, I know the world economy iw collapsing, but dont make things up to get more views, try to stick to truth Mr Tyler Durden. Distilling this down: Apparently that whole pitch about spending to buying market share that every startup seems to be peddling isn't a winning business plan, it just results in an unsustainable P/E and when they raise prices people drop them just like they did with the companies they're trying to disrupt. Now the question is how long companies like this can keep up the charade before people start chasing actual returns. I'll pay a bit more if you put better shows and movies on streaming. 95% of what is there is garbage. I download all my movies and tv shows from a few sites, get the best of netflix and other tv shows plus the latest theater releases. I hope the nsa isn't lurking. 07-18 17:30: ASIAN DAILY ECONOMIC RELEASES CALENDAR NOW AVAILABLE IN THE RESEARCH... 07-18 17:30: ASIA-PAC SERVICE IS NOW LIVE FOR TODAY'S SESSION 07-18 17:30: RBNZ Deputy Governor Wheeler housing price correction is rising 07-18 17:30: VMware sees Q3 revenue $1.76B at midpoint, consensus $1.72B 07-18 17:30: IBM says returned $4.4B to shareholders over last 6 months 07-18 17:30: Brown & Brown Reports Q2 GAAP EPS $0.47 vs $0.44 Est., Sales $446.5M vs $440.3M Est. 07-18 17:30: Yahoo Sees Q3 Adj.
