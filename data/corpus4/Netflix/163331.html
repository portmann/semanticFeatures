Amazon Prime Video Just Did What Netflix "Never" Would and I'm Excited! | Debt RoundUp Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! When you’re a cable cutter like me, you have to find ways to enjoy some on screen entertainment. I don’t go to the movies much because I don’t like to eat the extra butter popcorn for $14 and don’t need a gallon-sized soda. I also don’t like to pay prices that continue to rise faster than the cars in the last Furious 7 movie. Either way, I still needs my fix from time to time. We already don’t have cable, so we use a few TV antennas from my good friends at Mohu . If you need an over-the-air antenna, you need to pick these up . They are awesome! Beyond that, we do have a subscription to Netflix, but we also have Amazon Prime. It’s been worth it for us to have both, but that’s because I do a majority of my online shopping at Amazon. I’m a customer and I like their service and fast shipping. The movies and TV shows from Amazon Instant Video is just an added bonus. I’ve had no issues with either Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. Both services worked well for me, especially since I got two Amazon Fire TV sticks (they rock by the way!). Â We have good WiFi signal around our house, so streaming is not an issue. One downfall of streaming in our current setup is we couldn’t take our movies/tv shows with us when traveling. We have a nearly three year old, who has sworn off napping these days. Having a little entertainment in the car would be nice. We do have a tablet, but I got the version with only WiFi. We also have phones through Cricket Wireless , but I’m not about to use all my data for streaming on a tiny 4? screen (no, I don’t have a huge iPhone 6). Â Because of our current setup, we just couldn’t take Netflix and Amazon Prime with us on the road. Â At least that is how it used to be! Amazon has decided to change up the streaming game a bit with a cool new feature for those who have Amazon Prime with their instant video feature. There was one point in time a Netflix executive said they would “never” allow people to download content for use outside of streaming. Now, at the time, that might have made sense. Netflix is all about trying to beef up the internet speeds around the US. Considering we really don’t have good internet speeds compared to the rest of the industrialized world , I assume they didn’t want to use downloads as an option. They wanted to push for faster internet connections around the world. It does benefit them greatly to see more people connected at faster speeds. In comes Amazon, who’s goal is to add more streaming users than Netflix and they just announced that you can download some movies and TV shows to take with you. This is awesome and I’m excited about this. I was just on a trip with my wife and son in the mountains and it would have been good to have the tablet powered up with a few good shows that he likes. Since we already have Prime, why not just download some shows and not worry about it? Amazon has stepped up where Netflix wouldn’t and gave customers what they have asked for. People have wanted to able to watch content when they aren’t connected to the internet. Phones give us that, but we pay a lot of money for data usage (well, I don’t, but other people do). This is a big step for streaming services like Amazon Instant Video. Now, you can easily access the content you want to watch, when you want to watch it. You can download movies and shows for a plane ride, train ride, or even car ride. No need to worry about data usage and mobile connectivity. This helps you get through all of that and it should excite you. It really should! OK, so you know that you can download the movies and TV shows when you’re a Prime member, but how can you do it? Well, I’m going to show you and it’s really not that hard. You can also just jump over to Amazon to learn more about the downloads. First, you must be an Amazon Prime Member. If you’re not, sign up here for a 30-day free trial ! You can download content on the iPhone, iPad, Android phone and tablets, and the Fire tablet. You have a lot of choices. In order to watch the content on these devices, you need to download the Amazon Video App. You can get it from the App Store or through Amazon Underground (Android). If you have the Fire Phone or Fire Tablet, then you can just hit Videos from the home screen. Once you’ve done that, you can fire up the app and search for the movies and TV shows you want to watch and download. There will be a “Download” link or icon next to the shows and movies which are eligible for such processes. Once you are ready, just click download and let it go. Amazon suggest you keep the Vieo app open and your phone plugged in. Remember, this should be done over WiFi and not through the cell data network. That would be worthless and time consuming. If you’re going to download large files, make sure you have a good WiFi signal and you won’t be leaving until it’s done. That is basically it. It’s not a very hard thing to do, but know that not all shows on Amazon Instant Video are available for download. That is just the nature of the entertainment industry. I’m sure Amazon will be pushing for more content to be allowed, but they already have thousands of movies and shows which can be downloaded locally to your device. If you’re an Amazon Prime member, what do you think about this new feature? Will it keep you a member if you’ve been on the fence? I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband.
