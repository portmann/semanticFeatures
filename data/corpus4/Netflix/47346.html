Time Warner Is Growing A House Of Value - Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) | Seeking Alpha Returning cash to shareholders at the current rate of 6.6% of market cap. Recent launch of HBO Now to drive additional growth. This past week, I doubled my stake in Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). It is a nice blend of growth and value. The company projects 2015 adjusted EPS of $4.60 - 4.70 per share for an 18.4 P/E. The stock currently pays a $0.35 quarterly dividend for a yield of 1.6%. The dividend has grown by double digits each of the past six years. In 2014, Time Warner returned $6.6 B to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, 9% of the current market cap. Earnings: On 4/29/15, Time Warner reported 1st quarter adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share, an increase of 23% versus the previous year. This beat consensus estimates by $0.10 per share. Revenue increased by 5%, and operating income increased by 12%. The NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament helped the Turner segment to increase operating income by 26%. The company repurchased $1.1 billion of shares outstanding from January 1, 2015 through April 24, 2015, 1.6% of the company's market cap. The company projects EPS of $4.60-$4.70 per share in 2015, for a forward P/E of 18.4. Over the past five years, earnings per share have grown at an average of 18%, including 18% last year. This stock will likely reward investors for years to come. Returning Cash to Shareholders: Time Warner has a shareholder friendly policy of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2014, the share count was reduced by 6.4% after reducing shares by 3.5% versus the previous year, a 9.6% reduction over the past two years. From 1/1/15 through 4/24/15, the company repurchased an additional 1.6% of shares outstanding, a 5.1% annual rate. From 2011-2014, the number of shares outstanding was reduced by 23% at an average cost of $45 per share. The stock is currently trading 71% higher. Time Warner also pays a $0.35 per share quarterly dividend, now yielding 1.6%. The dividend has increased at an average annual rate of 11%. Because of share buybacks, the total payout for dividends has only increased by an average of 3.4% per year. TWX is returning cash to shareholders at an annual rate of 6.6% versus the current market cap. HBO versus Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ): As of December 31, 2014, HBO had 138 million subscribers, including 46 M domestic subscribers. By comparison, Netflix has 60 M paid subscribers including 40 M domestic subscribers. Time Warner's market cap is approximately 2 times that of Netflix, but HBO only accounted for 19% of TWX's revenue in 2014. Last year, HBO recorded operating income of $1.9 billion versus $0.4 billion for Netflix. HBO has higher margins, higher operating income, better content, more subscribers, and a more attractive stock valuation than Netflix. In addition, HBO is just starting to move into Netflix's streaming market with HBO Now. Look for HBO's revenue to accelerate as it creates additional competition for Netflix. Growth Opportunities: I believe HBO Now is one of many streaming apps that Time Warner will use in the future to compete directly with Netflix. Currently, HBO Now is available through Sling by DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for $15 per month. I expect Time Warner to introduce additional apps that leverage their massive library of movies and TV shows. They have an opportunity to modify or replace the Warner Archives app to include a larger selection of modern movies and TV shows. Unlike Netflix, Time Warner has a massive library of content and could avoid the high content acquisition costs. Another opportunity is to have smaller focused apps like a Cartoon Network streaming app for a monthly fee. Price Trend: Since forming a bottom in fall of 2011 at $30 per share, TWX's stock price has continued to trend higher. On 7/21/2014, the stock closed at $86.60. Since then, the stock has failed to hold that level but continued to have higher lows, forming an asymmetrical triangle. This is a continuation pattern where the previous uptrend continues after price resistance is broken. When the stock breaks above that level, look for it to continue to trend higher. Conclusion: Time Warner is a great company with a huge library of movies and TV shows. I believe the stock represents growth at an attractive price. It is a shareholder friendly stock with a history of returning cash to shareholders. With an 18% EPS growth rate and 18.4 P/E, TWX will reward investors for years to come. If you own Netflix, you should consider selling your shares to buy shares of Time Warner. Source: Time Warner Is Growing A House Of Value Disclosure: The author is long TWX, AAPL, WMT, FOX.
