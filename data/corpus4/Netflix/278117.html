AT&T: A Beautiful Spot To Be In - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha Dec. 31, 2015 12:21 PM ET  |  About: AT&T Inc. (T) , Includes: AMZN , NFLX , TWC , VZ by: Christopher F. Davis I have covered AT&T from a number of angles thus far. Today we learned AT&T's largest competitor Verizon has seen almost 2 million subscribers for its Go90 mobile streaming service. AT&T is offering its own mobile streaming content. AT&T (NYSE: T ) is my top dividend play for the next five years. I have been covering it from a number of different angles. Perhaps the most interesting of the discussions surrounded the funding of its dividend and whether the dividend would be raised by more than a penny. We then learned of course that, not surprisingly, the dividend was hiked by another penny quarterly. I discussed that cash really needed to be directed at reducing debt. With the DirecTV purchase, there are strong sources of revenues, but the company has been saddled with debt. By paying this down, while upping its payout, the stock is incredibly attractive. Of all of the names in the sector this is the one I want to own because of the yield and the prospects for share appreciation. Of course, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is the largest competitor. It too pays a nice yield, but has seen some strong share appreciation, while AT&T is just starting to see growth after sideways trading for years. But I think AT&T's time is coming. This is because we recently just got some pretty big news out of the company that relates to the possibilities that stem from the DirecTV acquisition at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. At this event we learned that the company is responding to the Verizon Go90 service which was launched in October that promises free entertainment content to users. I think AT&T's service is going to do very well, and this is because of how Verizon's Go90 service is performing thus far. Just what do I mean? Well just this morning , we learned that the Go90 service has been downloaded nearly 2 million times through December 15th. Remember this is a free service to subscribers but is ad supported. Of course, that is not going to draw in the big bucks. Once the service has gained traction, the company will likely offer a premium paid version of the Go90 service in 2016. What's more, this will be attractive as the streaming will not impact a customer's data usage tally. This is a strong way to target teenagers and millennials. The service will help compete with companies such as Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Why? This is because all of these companies offer entertainment content. Netflix and Amazon have been competing with Time Warner for some time. Of course. DirecTV is a direct competitor, and so AT&T has a leg up on Verizon in that regard. But Amazon and Netflix are streaming experts. Verizon is challenging them. And in turn, AT&T can watch and learn from Verizon's experience to perfect their own mobile entertainment services. It's a beautiful spot to be in. I love that AT&T is infiltrating various sectors beyond being a simple telephone service company that it once was. It's moving into the 21st century to compete with Amazon and Netflix, and hopefully, to take market share from Verizon. We are still awaiting more details on AT&T's own mobile entertainment service. The idea is that it would be a comparable service to what Verizon is offering. AT&T is pursuing rights to offer content for individuals without a satellite TV subscription. They would be targeting those with a mobile or tablet screen. So what is the potential reach? According to Randall Stephenson, CEO, there are 30 million homes without pay-TV subscriptions in the U.S and so the company wanted to have this kind of content for these consumers. In addition, the company also was going to launch a premium package in Q1 2016 for mobile content. Recall that Mr. Stephenson said: "That big bundle content we will deliver and are delivering in one of two ways. We are streaming that bundle of content into their home and also streaming the content to a mobile device…This is about the best over-the-top portfolio of content I believe in the United States." He was referring here to having the stacking rights to offer full current seasons of TV shows, including latest episodes, in addition to past seasons for customers from various networks like Viacom, A&E and sporting content from ESPN and the NFL. Of course, the details surrounding costs and potential revenues from this new venture remain to be seen. But the point here is that those rewards from the DirecTV acquisition that many of you have been demanding are starting to be realized. This is a new company. Verizon's Go90 service has picked up almost 2 million subscribers since its launch. This should give AT&T pause. Why? It shows the true potential of the service they are launching. I only hope as a shareholder they can develop this intelligently and profitably. I don't know the value of the new mobile content venture, but I'm pleased to see new moves from the company thanks to the DirecTV acquisition. This is a big positive in my opinion. So now, I turn it to you. What do you think about the news today out of Verizon? Do you think AT&T can rival Go90? What about the prospects of rivaling Netflix and Amazon?
