Get Ready For Black Friday in July! Amazon Prime Day on July 15th | Debt RoundUp Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! I got a nice little email the other day telling me about “Prime Day!” This new day is coming up next week, July 15th to be exact. If you’re wondering what Prime Day is, then you should first look to Amazon.com . Â They are touting this day to be bigger than Black Friday. If you’ve ever shopped on Black Friday, then you know there are deals to be had. So, what is Prime Day to be exact? Prime Day is a specialized sales event just for those people who are members of Amazon’s Prime service. Since I’m a member, I get emails telling me of sales events. I’m pretty excited about Prime Day to be honest. The main reason is we are looking for a particular product to replace our failing Xbox 360, which runs out Netflix account. Since we don’t have cable , we watch a lot of Netflix. Our TV is connected to our Xbox 360, but it hasn’t been working too well lately. I’m on the fence about getting another Fire TV Stick or going with a Roku . I’ve heard good things about Roku and my father just got one and likes it. I’m hoping I can score one of these on Prime Day. Make sure to check out Amazon’s Prime Day page for more information. Basically, Prime members will get instant access to tons of deals, sales, and lightening deals, which regular Amazon customers will not. They bulk up on sales when Black Friday is around and if they plan on going bigger, this could be a huge sales event. It will essentially be Christmas shopping in July. If you want to get in on the Black Friday type action in July, then Prime Day should be on your list. Remember, this is happening on July 15th, 2015. It’s going to be an all day sales even with more deal offers than what Amazon shows on Black Friday. As a regular Amazon shopper, I know there are going to be a lot of deals. Here is the official word from Amazon… Prime Day is a global shopping event, offering more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members. On Wednesday, July 15 new and existing members will be able to shop thousands of Lightning Deals, Deals of the Day, and will receive unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping. Members will find deals starting at midnight PDT, with new deals starting throughout the day, as often as every ten minutes. Not a Prime member? Try Prime today and get immediate access to deals on July 15. Prime members can find deals on products across categories including electronics, toys, video games, movies, clothing, patio, lawn and garden, sports and outdoor items and more. Members will enjoy deals on items perfect for summer adventures, their to-do list, family road trips, back to school supplies, and everyday essentials. Prime members can shop on any device, including smartphones and tablets and enjoy deals anytime, and anywhere. So, if you’re already an Amazon Prime member, then you just need to head over to Amazon.com on Wednesday, July 15th and start looking around for the deals. Amazon will be promoting it heavily on the home page that day. You will just need to sign into your Amazon account which is Prime enabled. I don’t believe those who have access to your Prime shipping benefits will get the deals, but it can’t hurt to try. If you’re not an Amazon Prime member, then right now is the time to sign up. Yes, it costs $99, but what you might not know is Amazon gives you a 30-day free trial . Think about it. You can sign up for the free Amazon Prime trial , shop on July 15th, then cancel your membership once your stuff arrives. You can get access to the Prime Day deals, but don’t have to fork over the $99 per year fee. That’s a win-win my friends. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband.
