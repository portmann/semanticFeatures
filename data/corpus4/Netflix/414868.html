The European Commission takes aim at Netflix and Amazon Prime - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha May 25 2016, 11:13 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor The European Commission  proposes a set of rules that would require Netflix ( NFLX +0.7%) and other online video providers to help finance films made in Europe. The regulatory framework would allow member nations to collect payments from on-demand players based outside of their borders to support domestic production. Streaming services such as Amazon ( AMZN +0.5%) Prime and Netflix would also be required to devote 20% of their library to European content - a level currently cleared by both services. It's not that. They are trying to avoid a monopoly of only US or whatever other country made movies. By enforcing a % of the library to be European they achieve that. And as the news indicate, they already achieve it. There is plenty of good content made in Europe. They just don't want it to be an issue in the future I'm not sure there can ever be a "monopoly" of content - content is constantly produced at all levels and by all countries.   The "natural" way this should work is that good European content would be in demand and Netflix would license that content to cater to its European customers.  By forcing Netflix to buy content that may or may not be in demand short circuits this process which ultimately results in a misallocation of capital and a loss to the average consumer. Even if Netflix didn't want to build a local media library, the capitalist process should result in a Euro-centric Netflix clone (assuming people do want to see European films - I do)... For a group of developed economies, they sure love their protectionist policies...   Sure, let's force the US technology and media industries subsidize your media sector - who cares about the consumers? Please explain?  I know there are state subsidies designed to bring in jobs for local economies but that's about the extent of my knowledge on that. Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.
