But what I really want to know is, is Facebook selling cheaply sourced offshore likes, or are these Made in USA likes? Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:26 | 6226854 r00t61 If these older ZH articles are right, then most clicks in the ENTIRE social media space are total fakery, generated by click farms and algos. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:30 | 6226881 saints51 Most are fake. It is used by people who produce no value to society by making bots to click likes for an article all the way to page 1 of google since google algo ranking bot loves social media. People spam their website with this crap and pop on google adsense so people can click the ads for a small revenue which is called CPC or cost per click. Yes the internet is super fucked up.

Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:43 | 6226935 Bangin7GramRocks Shit on me if you must, but Zuckerburg is the most profitable advertiser since William Randolph Hearst 100 years ago. Facebook may not last, but currently it is quite powerful. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:31 | 6226888 Dr. Engali Even if Walmart were to go bankrupt today, they still have tangible assets in real estate. What does Facebook have? Tue, 06/23/2015 - 17:03 | 6227014 BlueHen1990 Not even just real estate, they have tons of inventory that is currently has recovery values well above their carrying values. They have an operating cycle of roughly 50 days, which is really good for such a massive retailer, and over $9 billion in cash on hand. What does Facebook have?????? Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:22 | 6226839 DetectiveStern You'd think that but as the NSA's interface to the public it will be propped up as long as the NSA can spy on everyone. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:52 | 6226977 pods They don't even have to break the rules to do it. YOU allow it. Then they sell it to whoever wants/needs it for a price. http://www.truthandaction.org/man-rants-police-state-facebook-guess-shows/ What happens when a company based entirely on internet views of advertisements loses advertisers becasue no one is buying anything, advertised or not? Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:32 | 6226892 saints51 you seem cool. We can be bunk buddies in FEMA Camp. I hope we are in the same region. Would be cool to have a friend. We can share one of those rubbermaid coffins we paid for. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:52 | 6226974 curbyourrisk Facebook mines DATA..  that is more important to the direction of this government and they will pay TOP DOLLAR for the information about you. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:23 | 6226837 cherry picker This little peon brain of mine cannot comprehend the market caps of corporations such as FB and Google and Amazon when you compare revenue, assets (brick/mortar/inventory) to Walmart or an Oil company or manufacturer. The latter companies will always be worth something if they are not indebted to the eyeballs and that also affects share value. Facebook could be gone in a few days and there would be no physical evidence except for a data center here or there. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:27 | 6226862 SERReal1 Amazon does at least have Distribution Centers where they do house product (assets). Facebook and Google do not sell any physical goods. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:27 | 6226863 Dr. Engali Tue, 06/23/2015 - 17:00 | 6227001 BarkingCat I have not bought anything from FecesBook, nor do I have a page or account with them. Zuckerburglar can suck on a wild hogs dick and swallow. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:31 | 6226891 gatorengineer walmart should have tanken on Amazon sooner, now they are pretty well fooked, (that is as long as no one realizes Amazon is loosing money) and will likely tansform into a grocery chain. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:28 | 6226868 SERReal1 Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:29 | 6226872 large_wooden_badger Facebook is now straight up crowd-sourced populist propoganda interspersed with occasional updates on gym, tan laundry status and rescue dogs. It's a goldmine for the psyops folks. They'll never let it fail. Walmart on the other hand, they're a private-sector for-profit business that has no place in the planned communist utopia. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:33 | 6226895 gatorengineer Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:39 | 6226925 large_wooden_badger Tue, 06/23/2015 - 17:05 | 6227025 BarkingCat I'll transition to a leach and let all the fucking Obama true believers become the productive units. I will simply check out and watch the whole thing fall to shit like all the other communist lands of plenty. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:29 | 6226877 bloostar The worst part of this fad are those companies who insist on referring you to fartbookface.com because they're too lazy to create their own dedicated website... Really gets my goat when an ad like that appears on TV.  I don't WANT to visit faceplook.com!  You hear me? Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:33 | 6226896 Dixie Flatline There are some employers who will not even consider you for employment if you do not have a FB page.  Of course, do you want to work for an entity that would require such idiocy? I wouldn't work for an employer like that and I am sure I am not the only one. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:44 | 6226940 bloostar True, the first place a young manager/interviewer will look is now FB or Google.  Guess us 30 to 40 something's are ki d of bug***ed, especially when a bus spotter sharing the same name hits the top of the search list! Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:30 | 6226882 gatorengineer Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:31 | 6226889 Dixie Flatline Tax Increases? Why Facebook's Billion Dollar Income Isn't Taxed (At All) By IRS Does this remain true?  How can the progs demonize walmart, who pays massively into their fedzilla, while giving fb a pass?  Didn't someone say that paying taxes was patriotic...or something? Facebook is cool and hip millenial utopia. It exists in a magical place where everyone is equal and most don't have to do anything actually resembling work. Walmart generates profit and exploits workers. Everyone is unhappy and malcontent. Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:31 | 6226890 waltonloads08 Tue, 06/23/2015 - 16:43 | 6226938 Americanpharoah It's kinda ironic that advertisers whose job is to scam consumers into buying worthless crap have been scammed by facebook in the exact same way.
