Mark Hibben Positions For 2016: All-In On Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Negativity surrounding Apple will lift after it reports earnings later this month. Tim Cook is a better CEO than Steve Jobs. Mark Hibben is among Seeking Alpha's top Long Ideas and Technology contributors (No. 1 in both categories, as of this writing). He is an independent iOS developer who writes broadly about tech on SA, with a consistent focus on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). In this 2016 outlook article, we play the hits. Given the response we see at Seeking Alpha, it's clear readers want to hear about Apple. And they want to hear about the company from Hibben. So, with zero interruption from me (SA Editor Rocco Pendola), here's what we at Seeking Alpha like to call "some strong opinion & analysis (O&A)" exclusively from Hibben. The most important thing investors need to do in 2016 is take a long-term view of Apple's stock price performance relative to the overall growth of the company. I've pointed out that Apple's price has lagged its growth considerably this year. Despite remarkable growth in its fiscal 2015 (y/y revenue up 28%, y/y operating income up 35%), investors haven't rewarded Apple with commensurate share price gains, as the chart below shows: It's been claimed that this is because the market is "efficient" in pricing Apple for its future growth. This is absolute nonsense. Market efficiency seems to be a concept that people like to assert when it supports their viewpoint. Was the market efficient in pricing Enron or GTAT? If the market is efficient at all, it's only in the very long term, because it takes a long time for the market to figure out what a company is really worth. Eventually the market figured out that Enron and GTAT were worthless. Eventually, the market will figure out that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) isn't worth anything close to what its P/E implies. Eventually, the market will figure out that Apple is worth a lot more than what its P/E implies. I expect that a lot of the negativity about Apple that has been holding the price down will let up after the December quarter earnings report later this month. Tim Cook Is A Better CEO Than Steve Jobs The management styles of Cook and Jobs are very different. Jobs was much more involved with product design, taking a direct hand in UI design as well as physical design. Jobs is on a lot of Apple patents as a result, including basic UI patents for iOS. It's also well known that it was Jobs that insisted that the first iPhone have a glass rather than plastic screen in order to minimize scratches. There was a downside to the Jobs management approach. This was its insistence on building the "best" product, which meant best as Jobs saw it. This was held over for years even after Cook took over, in the form of the insistence that the iPhone 5 screen was the "best" size. This caused Apple to fall behind the market. Cook is more pragmatic, and that is reflected in a more market-driven approach to product design. The iPhone 6 and 6s are the products of this more pragmatic approach. Cook has also moved to diversify the iPhone and iPad product lines, rather than just building the "best" product for each. What is "best" is really in the eye of the beholder, and technology companies necessarily need to address a broad spectrum of what the market views as best in order to be successful. Thus we now have two screen sizes for iPhone, three for iPad, and possibly another screen size on the way for iPhone. In the sense that Cook is more pragmatic, Apple has become a much more successful company for it. For this reason, Cook has been a huge benefit for Apple investors. Cook is not the visionary that Jobs was, but he's a better CEO. His recent management changes give me even more confidence in his abilities. He's delegating much more and much better than Jobs ever did. Clearly, the role of design visionary has been delegated to Jonathan Ive. His elevation of Jeff Williams to COO shows that he is able to let go of his old role to embrace a more top level management role. I'm particularly happy with the elevation of Johny Srouji to SVP for Hardware Technologies. This demonstrates a recognition of the critical role that Apple's custom system on chip design plays in creating an essential discriminator for Apple's iOS devices. Srouji has led the design team for all of Apple's SOC's since the A4 in the first iPad. Why Did Apple's Attempts To Develop A Streaming TV Package Fail? Probably the situation is very different from what it was when iTunes first came out in 2001. Content downloads for sale was relatively new, and Apple could offer a unique experience in iTunes as a digital content store. The expertise required to build iTunes and get it to work reliably wasn't as widely available. It made more sense for the music industry to throw in with Apple than to try to build an equivalent capability on its own. That isn't true for the TV and cable networks now. The large networks have invested in Hulu, and cable networks such as HBO (NYSE: TWX ) have their own iOS and Android apps. What's the added value that Apple could provide? If there is any, it's in making iTunes the best "one-stop shop" for content, whether streamed, purchased or rented. But I don't think that gave Apple a lot of leverage with the content providers. And it may be that Apple TV and iOS and Mac OS X devices are just hosts for a variety of content-based apps, rather than iTunes being the center of everything. I think the rumors of Apple trying to put together a skinny bundle of TV channels for live streaming are credible, but it may never happen. Probably, the networks will simply go it alone with their own apps for OTT. And, of course, this would save Apple a lot of money. Back when the Beats deal was still a rumor, but the video with Dr. Dre had been posted on YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) appearing to confirm the deal, I wrote an article, Why The Apple/Beats Deal May Be Dead . Although my speculation was wrong, the article resonated with quite a few readers. I received quite a few comments to the effect that Apple would be better off if the deal was dead. It's actually very difficult for anyone outside of Apple to assess the value of Beats to Apple, as I said at the time. It doesn't appear to have been revenue per se. I continue to believe that Beats had some music curation technology (software) that Apple wanted. This has been subsequently confirmed more or less by the appearance of Apple Music. When I think about the problem of providing individualized, human-curated song lists for millions of subscribers, I tend to conclude that there must be a significant level of software augmentation in order to make it work. Otherwise I don't think it's cost effective. The key elements of the software are feedback to tell the curator how well the curator is doing in engaging subscribers and some form of classification of subscribers by taste and listening preferences. It's actually a very difficult problem. I'm continually appalled at how lousy the suggestions are in purely software-based systems such as Netflix. Netflix recommendations are a great example of artificial stupidity, which is much more common than true artificial intelligence. The realization that a music service needed human curation, combined with some form of software augmentation, was probably what made the Beats deal work. This probably extends to other forms of digital content, like movies and TV. So I think the jury is still out on the Beats acquisition. But if Apple Music continues to grow, and if the tech is applicable to other areas that Apple might get into, such as streaming video, then it will have been worth the Beats price tag. As for a large M&A in general, I'm sure that this is something that would excite investors, but I doubt that it's in the cards. Apple could get huge, but I doubt that it would be good for the company. Growing organically allows the company to manage the growth much more effectively. Google's acquisition of Motorola and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) acquisition of Nokia's (NYSE: NOK ) smartphone business serve as better cautionary examples than Beats. I expect that Apple will continue to pursue its policy of acquiring small companies for technology and talent. As for Dr. Dre and Iovine, well, acqui-hires don't normally make it into the SVP ranks that report directly to Cook. I believe both are working under Eddie Cue. Competition Between Microsoft And Apple People tend to assume that I must be hostile to Microsoft because I'm an Apple investor and write so frequently about Apple. In fact, I own several Windows PCs running either Win7 or Win10 and do most of my work on them. Win7 overall is my favorite OS. I have a great deal of admiration for Satya Nadella, but I don't regard Microsoft as a good investment. Microsoft is very much in transition, and the transition is not going as well as Microsoft investors seem to think. The lack of presence in smartphones is a huge problem that cannot be discounted so easily. Smartphones and mobile devices in general have become the most important personal computers for most people. It's the computing device they use the most. The fact that Microsoft's efforts in this arena have collapsed (very expensively) is an enormous problem. Microsoft's consumer devices such as Surface Pro and Surface Book have to be viewed in this larger context because to pretend that Microsoft doesn't need to succeed in smartphones would be ludicrous. I like the Surface Pro and Surface Book. In fact, I've said often that Apple's stance on not equipping Mac OS X laptops with touchscreens is just plain dumb. Once again, this seems to be a holdover from the Jobs era. Once again, Apple is claiming to know what's best for consumers, rather than offering a choice. I've seen a number of articles by Microsoft bulls proclaiming that Microsoft's Surface products will take share away from iPad. Unfortunately, I can't argue against this. However, Microsoft has only a limited ability to capitalize on this. Microsoft's fundamental problem is that it's competing against similar products from its Windows OEMs. When a new Surface Pro is introduced it gooses sales for that quarter, to about $1 billion. The new Surface Book may double that, but it's still a fraction of what Apple sells in iPads alone. But a larger fraction. As far as Windows devices in general, I continue to maintain that the free upgrade being offered to Win10 will have a net effect of depressing Windows device sales for 2015. Things may look up for 2016. Microsoft can subsist for a while by appealing to existing Windows users to upgrade to new ultra mobile form factors running Win10. However, I'm starting to doubt that Microsoft will ever achieve its goal of 1 billion Win10 users. If we look at usage statistics from sites like Netmarketshare, it appears that there's a very large block of Win7 users who aren't interested in upgrading. I'm personally a little uncomfortable with the role of investment adviser. I prefer to offer insight into technology companies, and let investors make up their own minds. Lately, partly under encouragement from SA, I've started to offer Buy/Hold/Sell ratings. That being said, I don't want to commit to owning any particular stocks at any time in 2016 or the future. I will reiterate my Buy ratings for Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ). I regard Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Architecture as rapidly becoming obsolete, so I recommend Intel and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) as Sells. I'm interested in and may upgrade my Hold ratings for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) as events unfold next year. As for what I currently am invested in, I'm all-in on Apple. This is primarily because I believe that the negative narrative that has kept the stock down this past year will likely let up when Apple reports December quarter earnings. If the market still won't reward Apple following the earnings report, I won't pull money out of Apple since I still think it will win in the long term. But I probably will start putting money into other stocks, including any of the ones listed as Buys or Holds. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
