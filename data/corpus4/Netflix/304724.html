For Amazon, The Only Chart That Matters | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! For all the traders and hedge fund managers who are under 30, Amazon has been here before, and not just once: a place where the company's growth prospects - perceived as virtually boundless - were put into question, leading to a collapse in the soaring stock price. Indicatively, putting the company's "valuation" in context, AMZN is now trading at a PE of roughly 460x, which compares to 87x during the last peak in the summer of 2008. But what matters for Amazon has never been earnings: it was always top line growth (the company generated $107 billion in sales in 2015 and less than a billion in net income) and multiple expansion (or contraction). Putting all that together we get the following chart courtesy of IceFarm Capital: 16 years of sales growth since the first dot com bubble superimposed on top of AMZN's multiple expansion (or contraction). In the latest quarter, worldwide net sales growth once again took a leg lower despite AMZN now employing over a quarter million workers! But the real question is what will the market do: will it continue giving AMZN's multiple the benefit of the doubt, and let it grow at its recent torrid pace - a pace we have seen many times before - or will the market sniff out that as a result of the global growth slowdown the time to exit has arrived, and lead to an outcome we have also seen many times before, when AMZN's multiple growth suddenly went into reverse sending the stock price plunging as a result. And .......A  teacher goes around            her class asking each of the kids, what do they need at            home? 1st kid says "A computer".            Teacher replies "That'd be very useful. Every family should have a            computerâ€? 2nd kid says "We really            need a new lawn mower" and the teacher responds by saying thatâ€™s an            excellent choice. Little Johnny pops up and            says: "At my house we don't need  anything." The teacher asks him to            think again carefully because everybody needs            something. Little Johnny replies,            "Nope I'm sure! When my sister started dating a Muslim, I remember Dad            saying, â€œWell, that's the last fucking thing we            needed!"   Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:26 | 7110714 Tzanchan Yeah but ya know in the old days, everybody told their kids to go out and bring home a nice (fill in the blank Jewish/Catholic/Protestant whatever) spouse to be. Friends of ours had a son who did that; found a nice Jewish girl, got married; he's an MD, -0- student loan debt; she's a DDS with like $300,000 in debt(!). She must have great oral skills....... Now I tell the kids, I don't give a damn who you bring home as long as you don't have an albatross around your neck in the form of student loans.

At this age of feminism with all the laws against man, you can not trust woman. Men don't change but woman do. You start of with a nice girl and 10 years and a few kids later the hormones change the persenality of most women.

Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:19 | 7110665 remain calm Amazons PE is 900. If you don't think it's going to correct bigtime in this Bubble, then i suggest you load up and buy some calls and while you do that I recommend you stick your head between the legs and kiss your ass goodbye. AMZN always corrects in down markets, and not just a little, show that chart because that is what matters at this point in time in these market conditions Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:43 | 7110765 Id fight Gandhi Eff em right in the ear. Their retailing business model essentially selling a dollar for 50Â¢. That's why they're gaining users and market share.any other retailer has to abide by real metrics while they can burn cash and be rewarded with share price gains. Oh they have a cloud platform to be envied? Screw that. Its a competitive segment race to the bottom in price. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:59 | 7110825 Somewhat Evolve... Amazon prime membership was something like $50-$65/year when it first came out. I used the hell out of it. Would get a $5 book delivered just for the hell of it to make the UPS guy trek all the way out to my house.  Now it is $100. At least a 33% increase in price, and they still aren't making money. Talk about thin margins. Agreed with your assessment of a dollar for 50 cents. Also Bezos seems to be insanely motivated from all reports. The factory workers are treated worse than cattle. If Amazon disappeared, I wouldn't notice.  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:42 | 7110982 Bangin7GramRocks They throw in a free Netflix and streaming music service with Prime! How could they ever make money when they spend billions on a streaming video service that they basically give away. I love the value of Amazon Prime and the overall service I receive from them. But they trade profits for customers and they will lose those customers if they ever charge enough to earn a profit. A bit of a pickle... Thu, 01/28/2016 - 20:50 | 7111416 Oldwood No different than Chinese businesses dumping product to steal market share, using infinite debt as a means of funding it. Everything now is about theft through debt. No principled individual or business can survive this fucked up mess, and will only find their rewards in heaven (if they are lucky). Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:46 | 7110995 Bobbyrib Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:33 | 7110735 muppeteer its a shame its so expensive because this company will be around for a long long time, seriously brilliant business model Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:25 | 7111155 Amy G. Dala As it stands now, UPS basically works for Jeff Bezos from Dec 15 to about Jan 5.  With Prime, this window will be expanding.  They are foregoing profit in order to co-opt another business that is leading its industry.  Fucking brilliant.  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 17:43 | 7110759 g'kar i recently ordered haven seasons 1-4 dvd sets from amazon (free shipping option).  they came in three seperate packages. the package that had seasons 1 and 4 ended up being two season 1's. i requested a return on one of the two season 1's and chose "have ups pick it up" for the return (free). Largely because of Amazon, customers are coming to expect "Free Shipping".  Problem is, shipping is expensive - beyond just the USPS, UPS or FedEx charge there is also the cost of employee wages in picking and packing, the cost of the box, padding, shipping labels, and the hardware and software required to run it all. The smaller mom and pops trying to compete are often forced to eat shipping costs because of this, which is large reason why the mom and pops are dying out trying to compete with the Not For Profit Amazon business model. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:56 | 7111042 economessed I got free shipping on the 900 lb Browning gun safe I bought ON SALE.  They had to have lost over $1,200 on that transaction.  The next lowest price I could find (delivered) was over $1,800 more from a neighboring state.  Great safe, by the way! Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:21 | 7111141 Amy G. Dala Look, anybody can sell shit.  Anybody can sell shit on the internet.  How much more can Amazon streamline this process?  Not much. What Amazon is lacking is its own delivery chain.  Thus the drones.  But drones alone won't cut it. This is where growth trumps profit.  Amazon is gaining huge leverage over UPS as it accounts for ever more of its delivery business.  (Next up will be USPS.  As it stands now, the primary function of USPS is to collect, deliver, distribute first class recyclables.) I am sure there are plenty of dark sources, that do not care about P&L, to provide funds for that model. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:01 | 7110835 dochood One thing Amazon had some real promise in was Cloud Computing... getting companies to off-load their data centers to them.  The agility, scalability, and flexibility were amazing. Then, right after Snowden, when Obama had a chance to calm European and other countries' fears about their data being spied on by the NSA, he DOUBLED-DOWN on the government spying, pretty much costing the Cloud Computing industry BILLIONS. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:17 | 7110892 goldinpenguin It's all about Prime. Approx $5B revs from Prime (based on 50M est custs),$100 YR for prepaid "free" 2 day shipping. (Ever notice how much of your Prime stuff comes via USPS now)? I did some price comparisons with Jet.com and Jet is cheaper. Less bells and whistles but you pay for those things with higher AMZN prices and Prime. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:53 | 7111028 economessed Jet is consistently less expensive, and have been every bit as convenient and quick as spamazon.   Two less syllables to boot! Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:47 | 7111222 goldinpenguin amzn might be cheaper with the daily deal prices but my limited price comparisons showed Jet cheaper, sometimes 15-20% on routine items, Jets will probably crash and burn without the prime sweetener   Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:29 | 7110927 847328_3527 I like buying on Amazon but recently they have had alot of glitches tyring to make your experience "better." Usually changing a good thing has problems. I always say, "if it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it!" Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:32 | 7110942 TheDanimal Like I said on another article, I just purchased some earbuds that are cheap as fuck, $7 to be exact.  I'm no serious audiophile but much more so than your average joe, and these things sound great.  But WTF?  How is Amazon making any profit?  At least this partially answered my question as to where the managements' heads are.  I forgot they care more about the top line than the bottom.  Why do investors tolerate this?  Is it because it doesn't matter if you receive dividends when Grandma Yellen is driving stock prices through the roof? Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:50 | 7111016 Early Retirement EBAY now has better prices than AMZN on almost everything. And increasingly I find items I look at on AMZN are sold by shady 3rd parties, not "Fulfilled by AMZN." This has made Prime a dicey value proposition. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 18:54 | 7111035 Last of the Mid... Amazon still has a  core business, I'd rather use them than go to stale poon tang smelling wally world and wait in line for the checker to decide to wait on me, or for the fucking front end manager decide to open up another check lane. Fuck wally world I'll go Amazon any time. They have a business model and it's NOT going away. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:10 | 7111088 ArgentDawn Prime isn't just free shipping, it's access to prime video as well, which alone is comparable in price to Netflix. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:56 | 7111252 goldinpenguin we've almost run out of movies worth watching on Prime. I wouldn't pay a lot per month for Prime viewing and an awful lot of stuff comes USPS, Prime is probably 200-300% of their profit. I dumped prime when they raised the price to 100 and I'll wait for their next Prime sale too, 100 is too much IMO   Thu, 01/28/2016 - 19:21 | 7111139 Heterodox economics A few years ago, I bought and sold Amazon, and made a nice profit (which also outperformed stock indexes at the time). While Amazon fulfills two of my investment criteria (S&P500 company and I use the company's proucts), it does not fulfill the third criteria at this time: it is not near its lows.   I absolutely agree that Amazon is currently over-valued at this time. This article is extremely useful:  Notice the yellow bars on the chart.  When the yellow bars are above 0 percent, Amazon tends to be over-valued.  When the yellow bars are below 0 percent, its a good buy indicator.
