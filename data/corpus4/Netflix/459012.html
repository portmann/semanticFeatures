Netflix Victory Is Comcast's Loss - Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) | Seeking Alpha The recent deal between Netflix and Comcast is a major step forward for these two companies. The FCC has pushed for increasing openness for set-top boxes. In early July, as investors saw Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares begin to tumble on news of a downgrade by Needham , the share price quickly reversed when the company announced that it had entered into a deal with sometimes rival Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) to allow users of the X1 system to receive Netflix content through their set-top boxes. On a year-to-date basis, Comcast is up over nearly 19%, while Netflix is down over 14%. While there have been a range of opinions on the value of the deal from Netflix's perspective, there has been surprisingly little comment on what the deal means for Comcast. Ultimately, the deal is likely a long-term positive for Netflix, but represents an additional erosion of Comcast's security as a top cable company- plus the latest reverberation of the FCC's "Unlock the Box" campaign . Last week, these two media giants announced that they had reached an accord through which Netflix content would soon be available directly to Comcast customers who use the X1 system - Comcast's newest technology. Currently roughly 30% of subscribers use the X1 box, but the cable giant says it expects that number to be up to 50% by the end of the year. Neither company is giving a lot of details according to a recent Wall Street Journal article : "We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year. We'll provide more details at that time." By the numbers , Comcast X1 users number around 7 million, with that number expected to grow to 11 million by year-end. If Netflix can attract a significant amount of these subscribers to its service, this could significantly bolster its U.S. grow statistics, which have slowed. Even with these numbers, Netflix valuation (its P/E ratio is currently above 330) is hard to justify. Investors should expect the most significant growth to come from deepening penetration into Asia. At current price levels, Netflix should be considered between a buy and neutral. There is some short-term upside heading into earnings, but longer-term there needs to be more clarity to justify holding the stock in one's core portfolio. While Comcast, which still lacks the shiniest reputation with customers, will certainly declare the Netflix deal as a victory and extol their expanding capabilities, against the backdrop of increasing "cord-cutting," the deal is another reason to be short the stock. In mid-February, the FCC approved a proposal that put a significant part of Comcast's business in its crosshairs. The company has tried to counter the FCC position by taking its own steps - perhaps making a Federal regulation unnecessary - but the issue continues to threaten the company's core business. In April, Comcast attempted to flout the need for regulation when it announced that it was putting its technology in certain smart TVs as well as through Roku devices. The commission responded to the move by saying that it "appears to offer only a proprietary, Comcast-controlled user interface and seems to allow only Comcast content on different devices, rather than allowing those devices to integrate or search across Comcast content as well as other content consumers subscribe to." While the deal with Netflix may be some further response to the situation, it seems unlikely that Netflix will be sufficiently integrated to satisfy the objective of Unlock the Box. The numbers for Comcast suggest that the end of set-top box rentals could make a significant impact. With an estimated $20 billion a year being spent by consumers to lease these boxes, the end of this revenue would be significant. If one estimated that Comcast has 22 million subscribers and uses the commission's estimate of an average of $200 per year per customer, this represents a loss of $4.4 billion per annum if box leasing disappears. That is not a small hole to fill. The reason, however, that the Netflix deal should give investors further pause is that it demonstrates that the erosion is happening from both sides: Comcast access is becoming box-free and other apps are being added to the Comcast platform. Given the expense of Comcast service, in either world, there is little justification for the cost. A great deal of the content available on Comcast is available elsewhere, and when Comcast is juxtaposed - as it will be against Netflix - consumers are likely to see just how disproportionately expensive it is. With the Netflix deal, Comcast subscribers should determine that for the relative value, the cheap Netflix subscription (often less than the X1 rental fee) is better accessed without Comcast at all. As the industry moves increasingly in this direction, despite strong year-to-date performance and a dividend yield of 1.6%, Comcast is a short. The deal represents the first penetration for Netflix - a serious market disruptor - into the ecosystem of a major provider. Investors should expect to see more of these deals and at an increasing rate. While it is hard to imagine a company as large and diverse as Comcast will not find diversification techniques to offset some of the potential losses, there is meaningful downside in the stock over the long-term.
