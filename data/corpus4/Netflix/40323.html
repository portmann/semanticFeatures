Netflix Train Has Left The Station - Cramer's Lightning Round (4/24/15) | Seeking Alpha  |  Apr. 27, 2015  5:28 AM ET  |  Includes: BTU , FTR , NFLX , RDS.A , RDS.B , SEAS , SIX , TMUS , WFM by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Royal Dutch Shell has paid too much for BG Group. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ): "They are being very smart at acquiring but I believe in growth and the growth in that industry is coming from T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS )." Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM ): "The stock acts badly, there is no doubt about that. But you have to take a longer term view about what Whole Foods is doing and that to me says that you can buy half now and buy the other half after the report." Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ): "We have to take a page off the old trading floor here. You missed it. There was a time to buy Netflix and that was before the quarter. Now you have to wait for it to come in again. The train has left the station without you." SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE: SEAS ): "SeaWorld is coming back and I think that part of it is that very smart advertising campaign they have. But with that said I still favor Six Flags (NYSE: SIX ) because I like consistency and that is what Jim Reid-Anderson has been showing when he has come on the show. Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU ): "It is the best of the worst. Why buy the best of the worst when you can buy the best of the best? I am going to say definitively to sell because maybe you want to catch a point or two, but that's not my game." Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A ) (NYSE: RDS.B ): "My charitable trust decided to sell this and buy more growth oils because we feel like oil is coming back. We feel that this acquisition that they made, they paid too much for, so I am no longer a fan of Royal Dutch Shell."
