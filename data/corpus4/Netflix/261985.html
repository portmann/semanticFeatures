Apple's Retreat Means Netflix Will Remain King Of Paid Streaming - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Apple has reportedly suspended its ambition to offer a monthly subscription TV/video streaming service. The retreat of Apple should please Neflix investors. Without the threat from Apple, Netflix will continue its robust growth rate. In spite of its $200 million cash hoard, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reportedly failed to land a licensing deal with content owners. After years of failed negotiation , rumor has it that Apple has suspended its planned $30-$40/month live-TV service because content owners/publishers wanted more money. While this rumor is not an official/permanent declaration that Apple will never compete in premium live-TV streaming, it's still great news for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) investors. NFLX's momo-like valuation is largely due to its impressive growth in subscribers and annual revenue. Apple's reported surrender over its ambition to compete in the multi-billion streaming industry deletes a potential headwind for Netflix. The old worry about Apple's planned subscription TV ambition was that it could have been a zero-sum game for Netflix. There was the risk that millions of Apple TV/iPhone/iPad-using customers of Netflix would defect to Apple's streaming TV service. Apple's huge pool of iPhone and iPad users would really have made it a bigger menace than the combined competition offered by HBO Now, Hulu Plus, Vudu and Sling TV. According to Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) survey Apple devices accounted for 62% of viewed streaming pay-TV content in Q2 2015. Netflix (and its investors) therefore should rejoice that Tim Cook did not capitulate to the fees demanded by broadcast/cable TV content owners. Strong In TV Anywhere/Mobile Streaming Since Apple has suspended its plans for a live-TV service, a majority of iPhone and iPad owners will most likely continue to rely on Netflix to get their fix of TV shows/movies. Without Apple's meddling, Netflix remains the king of TV Everywhere. Furthermore, T-Mobile's (NASDAQ: TMUS ) favoritism toward giving Netflix (and not YouTube) unlimited mobile video streaming means Alphabet's subscription-based YouTube Red service also is not a threat to Netflix. Carriers like T-Mobile that want to attract customers have every right to favor Netflix over other streaming service providers. Netflix is still the dominant mobile streaming entertainment provider. The prospect of free unlimited mobile streaming (at reduced resolution) from other U.S. carriers is another long-term tailwind for NFLX. Smartphones and tablets are now outselling computers and set-top boxes. Netflix will likely continue to post double-digit growth in annual revenue. The long-term growth momentum of Netflix has always been due to its strong presence in US homes. Aside from being the leader in mobile streaming, Netflix remains the biggest fixed internet bandwidth hog in America. The endemic popularity of Netflix gave it 37.1% share of all peak period downstream internet traffic in the U.S. This is more than double that of ad-supported YouTube. Apple, which also sells on-demand video/TV content via its iTunes Store, only accounts for 2.8% of downstream Internet traffic. The Business Insider chart supports my speculation that the majority of iPhone/iPad users get their premium streaming entertainment from Netflix, not from iTunes. Another revealing fact in the chart above is the negligible web traffic of BitTorrent (illegal file-sharing), which only accounted for 2.7%. Netflix previously discussed the threat of Popcorn Time earlier this year. However, torrent-powered Popcorn Time and its variants are already dead . I opine that the cheap $10/month subscription rate of Netflix makes illegal torrent services almost unnecessary. Consequently, the subscription-based video streaming (SVoD) service popularized by Netflix generates more revenue than downloads or pay-per-view on-demand streaming. SVoD will continue to rake in more than 50% of all U.S. commercial online video streaming until 2020. Netflix's leadership position in SVoD means it gets to gooble up the largest cut of this multi-billion cake. I endorse a long-term buy rating for NFLX. In spite of the risks involved in betting on momo tickers, Netflix still has upside potential in 2016. With Apple now most likely out of the picture, Hulu Plus, Vudu and Sling TV are too small to challenge Netflix's dominant position in the U.S. I also see the upcoming China expansion as another growth catalyst for Netflix. China, India and other Asian countries have a lot of iPhone and iPad users who can easily afford a $10/month streaming service. Asians who bought $600-800 Android phones also are potential customers for the TV Anywhere service of Netflix. It will reek of defeatism if Netflix just sits and watches Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) new $57/year service ($6.08/month) dominate China's video streaming business. Netflix should learn from the lesson of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) pathetic 1.5% share in China's e-commerce. Amazon's mistake is that it did not challenge Alibaba promptly and aggressively. Netflix therefore should accelerate its entry in China before Alibaba's TMall Box Office service gets too popular. Without a foothold in that populous country, Netflix's global expansion efforts will be handicapped. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
