Oil, China And The U.S. Dollar - Cramer's Mad Money (5/3/16) | Seeking Alpha Investors should closely watch what happens next with oil, data coming out of China and the U.S. dollar. Don't overlook revenues generated by services. Cramer hosts executives from Cypress Semiconductor and Blackhawk. Stocks took a beating Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow down nearly 1% and the Nasdaq down more than 1%. While investors may appear skittish, Mad Money's Jim Cramer said those in the market shouldn't overlook three key items when making their assessments: oil, China, and the U.S. dollar. First on the list is oil. Despite the drop Tuesday, oil is heading higher, Cramer suggested. Oil tumbled on news that OPEC members are increasing production. That said, Cramer pointed out that demand is picking up and overall production is dropping, which may lead to higher prices in the future. China released data Tuesday suggesting a slight decline in growth. Cramer said it's important to look at other positive data coming from the key economy. And then there's the dollar. Cramer disputed suggestions that the dollar is heading toward new highs. Rather, he said the dollar is in a "lull," and "when we have a lull, we like to take the temperature of the market and look for some bargains." As the dollar gets weaker, companies can raise guidance, Cramer added. Cramer started with retail. Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) won an upgrade Tuesday. Cramer said CVS (NYSE: CVS ) is a company he likes "very much." As for other companies, Cramer pointed out Clorox (NYSE: CLX ) reported a better-than-expected quarter, beating on both the top and bottom line. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) impressed with its results. Moves by Bill Ackman on Valeant (NYSE: VRX ) helped drive the stock higher. Cramer said Chipotle stock (NYSE: CMG ) has remained somewhat unchanged since the company's challenging first quarter report. And finally Cramer highlighted comments from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook on how the company's lucrative services stream may not be valued correctly by the market. And don't forget Apple's big stock buyback and $10 billion profit from the last quarter. "The major trends (oil, China and the dollar) remain very much in place," Cramer said. "And when they aren't, you are still getting a whole different set of stocks that we at least expect to rally. That's bullish, not bearish." Cramer featured more of his interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook during his Tuesday show (the first part of the interview can be found on Monday's show ). Cramer asked the CEO what the "Tim Cook Apple" stands for. Cook didn't want to refer to the company as his, but stated that Apple is striving to make the "best products on earth that enrich people's lives." "We want to change the world through our products," Cook said. The CEO also said Apple attempts to conduct business in a way "that's right and just." The company takes special care to address issues surrounding its impact on the environment, whether it's assessing how much energy Apple products use or relying on renewable energy to power the business. Apple also cares about privacy and how it treats its employees, Cook said. Cramer asked Cook about statements made by presidential candidates, whether it's Republican Donald Trump on suggestions Apple should make its products in the U.S. or complaints by Democrat Bernie Sanders that corporations are destroying the moral fabric of the country. Cook said government "in general has gotten dysfunctional in the U.S. and in other countries as well," and that puts "more responsibility on consumers and companies to help promote change and to improve things." Cramer asked about the government push to obtain data from an iPhone used in the San Bernardino terrorist attacks. Cook said Apple is happy to work with law enforcement and if officials have a valid warrant. The request to break the iPhone tied to the terrorist attacks presented something different. "We stood up," he said. Helping to break into one iPhone could create a permanent way to bypass iPhone password protection, Cook added. Cook also suggested the privacy concerns raised by the government action didn't belong in court, rather as part of a bigger discussion among all impacted parties. "It's a complicated issue," he said. The Mad Money host offered examples. Costco generates a steady stream of revenues with its membership fees. Netflix generates revenue through its monthly service that Cramer said he would gladly "pay double for." Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime platform is an "asset beyond belief." And there's Apple and its services. Whether it's paying for back-up of photos or a family music plan, the services portion is a significant asset for the company. On Cramer's show the previous day, Cook said revenues generated by services were up 20% in the last quarter, and they continue to grow. Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ: CY ) stock has struggled despite recently delivering decent first quarter results and guidance. "I can make a case it's a real bargain," Cramer said. Cramer had outgoing CEO T.J. Rodgers on his show to share his company's story. When asked why he is leaving the CEO role, Rodgers said he's still working at the company and remains on the board. The transition to a new CEO has been planned for some time, with the hope of bringing "new blood into operations." Rodgers also said he's bullish on the company and its future. While Cypress has seen a gradual decline in revenue, Rodgers said most of that revenue decline was the result of a decline in revenues from businesses the company is divesting. Blackhawk (NASDAQ: HAWK ), the gift card giant, has encountered headwinds related to the delay in EMV implementation (the credit card chip technology) by many of its retail partners, mainly grocery store outlets. The issue pertains to fraud occurring within the space, as retailers put restrictions on gift cards to address that issue. Chairman William Tauscher told Cramer the issue on EMV implementation is a 2016-only event, and that most of the issues will be solved by the end of the year. It's expected that 95% of Blackhawk's retail customer base will be compliant with new procedures by September, the fourth quarter at the latest. Tauscher also pointed out that retailers are working hard to solve the issue, given that stores want to avoid any friction with customers. Cramer said that while the EMV issue is big for Blackhawk, it's "not his company creating the problem." Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ): Stay away. "I didn't like that conference call." Disney (NYSE: DIS ): "I think you have five years' worth of movies (coming out). I'm not worried about ESPN." Charter (NASDAQ: CHTR ): The cable company is working to acquire Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ). "We like it. We say stay long."
