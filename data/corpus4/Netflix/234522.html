ETF Hub Nov 12 2015, 18:57 ET | About: Time Warner Inc. (TWX) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor If Hulu sells a stake to Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), it would be an equal partnership with existing co-owners, meaning it would draw down the stakes of the other three -- Disney (NYSE: DIS ), NBCUniversal (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and Fox ( FOX , FOXA ) -- to 25% each. The move would definitely be a strategic play against Netflix and Amazon.com for the service, which has gotten increasingly active in the past year with new subscription models and aggressive moves into original programming and licensing products away from competitors. Content spending reportedly went to $1.5B this year from $600M in 2014. Time Warner wouldn't just be putting in cash, it would be committing to license content beyond what it's already sold. Time Warner owns TV powerhouse Warner Bros. along with HBO, and Turner Broadcasting and its properties. It suggests that a sale in whole that was discussed in 2013 is further off the table now. The WSJ reports that the current (preliminary) talks value Hulu between $5B and $6B. Nervous content owners may favor a stronger Hulu and its closer relationship to existing TV vs. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which they feel is accelerating cord cutting and lowering ratings. Netflix, which fell into the close down 3.5%, is off another 0.8% after hours. Previously: With programming buildup, Hulu's losses increase (Nov. 06 2015) If the four strongest media companies have to join forces in order to have something that can at least come close to Netflix, it just means that Netflix should be valued at more than all of them combined. this changes when hulu has enogh subscribers to make up for less of recenue from licensing to netflix, then netflix becomes an hbo premium compliment to hulu Right now Hulu is for cord cutters and Netflix is for cable subscribers and cord cutters. Don't think this changes any time soon. Network and cable shows mostly all stink. Most movies on Netflix are no good either.
