Is The Netflix-Style 'Binge' Model Still As Viable? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NBC recently tried to emulate the Netflix model with its new series â€˜Aquariusâ€™ which comes at a time where the 'binge' model may be at a crossroads. Showrunners, executives, and audiences are beginning to contemplate if the â€œall-at-onceâ€? style roll-out that made Netflix a powerhouse is still the right strategy. A number of new contenders are lining up with different ways of unveiling programming in an attempt to dethrone Netflix or at least take away some of its market share. TIME.com perhaps summed it up the best saying "NBC wants to be Netflix. Netflix wants to be NBC." It's a true statement as just recently Netflix made it clear that, while everyone thinks cablers like HBO are in the company's crosshairs, it's actually the big broadcasters that should be worried. What sparked this whole resurgence around discussing the streaming model was NBC's (a subsidiary of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK )) decision to stream all 13 episodes of its Aquarius miniseries online following its initial airing last Thursday. This is a move into Netflix' (NASDAQ: NFLX ) territory at a time where Netflix is trying to make a play into network territory. As I mentioned before, the battle lines are being drawn and investors need to be ready because Aquarius is just the tipping point. One interesting trend though that was brilliantly explored by The Hollywood Reporter last week as part of this overall discussion was that the "all at once/binge rollout" idea may be waning or at least losing some supporters. Let me be clear I'm not saying people are going to stop binge-watching (especially if they miss three or four episodes of their favorite series), but they may not be as quick to want to get involved with a new streaming series that is designed for binge viewing. Think about it for a second … at what point does watching a House of Cards-like show becomes more of an obligation than a pleasure? Whether it is an established show like Cards or new one like Bloodlines, does the pressure to finish the show in a small amount of time take away from the overall enjoyment of the experience? For example, if HBO decided all of a sudden to release all of Game of Thrones' new episodes at once, you would likely feel like you have to watch it or risk being spoiled, because it's such a well-known series. Yet by doing so, you'd lose that breather in between acts where you can reflect on what you just watched and really take in the "wow" factor. Having that "to be continued" moment also carries the conversation into the mainstream and builds buzz which is vital to the business model of any content company. I get the argument on the other side of the coin, but even if you are a cord cutter, you have to acknowledge the traditional model had its strong suits. You will always have people who binge a series in a weekend and that's fine, but it's the ones that then complain they have to wait a full year for the next set of episodes that are the very reason why we need to explore new models. They are the ones who want to have that discussion about the series right then and there, but others aren't anywhere near the same point in the series, and that stifles the conversation. Honestly, though this whole thing is akin to giving a little kid a box of candy and telling them they can decide when they want to eat it, but once it's gone it's gone. I'll give you strong odds that kid has a hell of a stomach ache in about 5 hours. Can you really blame the kid though? They really don't know any better… and neither do we as viewers, because this is how we've been trained. Yet now when you have people like Orange is the New Black showrunner Jenji Kohan questioning her own series model, and people like Mad Men's Matthew Weiner saying if he ever did a streaming series he'd want to parcel it out versus releasing it all at once, you begin to wonder if this business strategy is still sound? When it was one or two shows that was one thing, but now we have a large number of "binge-able" programming options. In many cases, it is not that a person doesn't want to watch that particular show, but they need to catch up on the other ones that people are watching on a weekly basis (i.e. Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead) and have more of a sense of urgency to them. Traditional network executives and audiences now more and more want that time in between to discuss these "shared experiences." Under this model, you can't, because everyone is on different pages, and that takes away from those watercooler moments showrunners have worked so hard to create. So does that mean a happy medium where streamers do a batch system of a few episodes every week? Maybe, maybe not, but there has to be a balance of some sort between once a week and all at once… yet for now, this is where we are. Netflix for its part seems unwilling to move and recently told audiences at MIPCOM that the current "one episode at time model" is antiquated and used its internal data as a way to back its multi-episode structure. Granted this is a company that made its bones on disrupting the current standard, so you can't blame them for wanting to keep things status quo. However, what's interesting to ask here is that if the model begins to change again (and rivals like Hulu and NBC are pushing for that direction), will Netflix adapt or go into denial like broadcast and cable networks first did when it first came around? I do personally find it a little funny and ironic that Netflix is such a data-driven company, yet it doesn't actually release the one piece of data that everyone wants… its ratings. Again, I completely understand why, but it's a valid point. For now, Netflix is still in the driver's seat, and even more so it answered one of its major criticisms with the successful launch of multiple new series (Bloodline, Grace & Frankie, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Marvel's Daredevil) that paired with established hits like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black giving them a lot of ammo and continued momentum. Yet this is still just the beginning, and more and more you'll see additional networks and services try alternate approaches. These companies missed the boat the first time and they don't want to make that same mistake a second time. Source: Is The Netflix-Style 'Binge' Model Still As Viable?
