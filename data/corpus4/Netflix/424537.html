This Is Where US Adults Get Their News From | Zero Hedge by Capitalist Exploits - Jun 5, 2016 6:57 PM A SERIOUS CRACK appeared in the markets today.  This was due to the lousy payroll report of only 38,000 new jobs for May. by Cognitive Dissonance - Jun 5, 2016 8:56 AM The ugly, and self evident, truth is the vast majority of us wish to partake of the spoils of Empire while denying Empire and the means by which it acquires the spoils. by Tyler Durden - Jun 5, 2016 8:45 PM As social media continues to become a larger part of many people's everyday lives, it's not surprising to see that users are now more than ever getting news from the social media platforms. A survey by Pew Research found that 62% of US adults get their news on social media, which is up from 49% reported in 2012. Of the 62%, 18% responded that they often get news from social media, 26% said sometimes, and 18% said hardly ever. The leading social media platforms where users get their news are Reddit, where 70% of users get news, 66% of Facebook users, and 59% of Twitter users. From 2013, all platforms have grown the percent of users who receive news from the sites, with Facebook experiencing the biggest increase. When looking at each sites' total reach, and the proportion of users who get news on each site, Facebook leads the way - Facebook reaches 67% of US adults, and 44% get their news on the site. Twitter only reaches 16% of adults, but 9% get news from the platform. Users of Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube users are more likely to get news by chance, while LinkedIn, Twitter, and more likely to be looking for news. Here is how the demographics break down for each social networking site. Social media users also consume news through other news platforms, with local television being the most popular overall, and print newspapers being the least popular alternative news source. It's evident that social media is becoming an increasingly popular way for people to consume news, although recent revelations about Facebook's suppressing of news raises cause for concern for those scanning the site for newsflow. Also, as Facebook usage and reliance for news explodes, one should keep in mind another thing: Facebook is watching, and listening . scintillator9 Insurrexion Jun 5, 2016 9:04 PM Eirik Magnus Larssen scintillator9 Jun 5, 2016 9:17 PM Generally speaking, a good way to stay well-informed about a topic or issue is to always read the perspectives of opposing political views on it, back to back. There's a great deal to be learned in that gray area which both sides habitually overlook or intentionally ommit from their account. This is, in fact, the main reason I regularly read Zero Hedge despite not at all belonging here from an ideological point of view. Chastising this website's crazed right-wing extremist base is just a bonus. J S Bach Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun 5, 2016 9:18 PM One has to work at "harvesting" the truth from more honest sources and then using the gray matter betwixt ones ears to synthesize truth from established facts. LowerSlowerDela... J S Bach Jun 5, 2016 9:34 PM Regarding Facebook: I'm not on it much. I didn't realize that there was a "news" feed somewhere on my page.  J S Bach LowerSlowerDelaware_LSD Jun 5, 2016 11:47 PM From its very inception years ago, I remember getting an email from an aquaintence asking if I wanted to be their "friend" on FaceBook. (Of course, that meant I had to sign in to my own FaceBook account - which I did not and never will have.)  My initial (and right) instinct was to ask myself... "if I don't reply to this... does that mean I'm NOT their friend?!"  The whole concept has always seemed so voyeuristic to me. The whole "social media" is indeed... "ANTI-SOCIAL".  I notice younger people today roaming around staring at their "smart" phones in some sort of surreal form of interaction, when indeed, it is the total opposite.  People today are more afraid than ever to confront their fellow man or woman in an honest conversation. Where this high-tech bullshit is all leading - only the devil knows.  All I know is, we have to remain vigilant to the truth and convey it in the old-fashioned way of speech. FUCK social media, social programming, social control and manufactured consent.  If you're part of the apparatus, then you're part of the problem.  beemasters Lore Jun 6, 2016 12:32 AM Yes...the very same Facebook that is freely letting ISIS use it as their communication medium and sale of prostitutes, apparently. Theosebes Goodfellow LowerSlowerDelaware_LSD Jun 6, 2016 12:37 AM TeraByte J S Bach Jun 6, 2016 12:50 AM Agree, the Net is a great tool, but in presence of a huge supply of irrelevant and fake data, it also created a great responsibility for everyone to filter and to pick apart essentials from all trash. It requires basics of nonnegotiable nature sciences before absorbing main stream and social media propaganda and many people do not have this knowledge and delude political doctrines rule over laws of Nature..  Never the less politics has already grown more transparent with no way of hiding all the backroom deals like before, thatÂ´s why there is much turbulence globally, when subjects donÂ´t take anymore everything for granted. Artemis Rand Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun 5, 2016 9:18 PM He's right and I force myself to read a leftist sites like huffington post or salon at least a few minutes every day to keep up with the deranged, sick, morally depraved ideas and thoughts of the "liberal" morons as well. LowerSlowerDela... JohnG Jun 5, 2016 9:34 PM besnook Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun 5, 2016 9:34 PM a lot of people here, at least the old timers, are uncommitted except to the opposition of the left/right paradigm created as a false choice. most reasonable people have common ground regardless of supposed ideologies. it is a real shame. however, that the the wacko right is not engaged by the wacko left more on this site. that would be great entertainment for those of us on the sidelines of this fake battle. they wouldn't b kicked off the site as long as they remained civil, unlike many of the other ideological sites for both sides.

OldPhart Insurrexion Jun 6, 2016 3:44 AM I used to get my news from AOL (America On Line) until I realized how tightly they had constricted the internet, then I used them to connectm then went of MSN and from there to the world for the news. The moment I could drop AOL, I did.  And started reading, eery fucking night, just like I used to walk, every fucking day, across this desert. And, like then, I found an oasis or two.  Like Zero Hedge and a few others.

NoDebt Amalgamated Tang Jun 5, 2016 9:01 PM Green arrow, BTW.  You actually made me think about that for a few minutes before I could come up with an answer. HRH of Aquitaine NoDebt Jun 5, 2016 11:10 PM No shit Sherlock.  That was my response as well.  Fuck it.  The USSA is toast.  If people are that fucking stupid that they think entertainment and propaganda are news, stick a fork in us, we are done. It is unfortunate (and one suspects a deliberate strategy to ensure - ) that the majority prefer the latter over the former. newworldorder skinwalker Jun 5, 2016 9:24 PM Add Mark Dice to the list too. (as far as one of the sites I go to as well. He does a lot of good stuff, especially with his fake petitions...) the news websites are supposedly "taking a hit" from the users just getting the news on facebook or reddit and not going of their websites in terms of getting less advesrtising traffic... Tyler, clearly your definition of an "adult" is far different from mine. This entire country is in need of adult supervision. We have an extremely narcissistic 'adult' population here in Amurica; men and women who reufse to age gracefully, getting plastic surgeries, on credit, of all things, ignoring their children because to them a cell phone is the priority in their lives, etc. I see 'parents' all over the place, every time I go out, who are so into their cell phones that they WILL NOT even interact with their children at all. I've seen entire families at the park who sit on a bench and do not play 'cuz each generation is too busy with their cell phones! These families don't even make eye contact with one another, let alone anyone else. Just a small observation on my part. Whomever gets his/her news from a "social network," deserves all of the mis and disinformation they get. After all, social media is completely unbiaed, so They keep telling us...
