Netflix: The Countries That Matter - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Management and analysts keep touting far-flung growth of 200 countries. 90% of broadband users reside in 50 countries (excluding USA and China). Sometimes the numbers make your eyes pop out. An analyst from Oppenheimer recently estimated that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) would command a 30% market share worldwide of broadband connected devices, and accordingly the price target was ramped up to $800 . This good news is, of course, following the cadre of similarly bullish statements that we've seen these past couple weeks. I compiled a list of broadband users from Wikipedia so the source integrity can be taken for what it is. Then, on my open model on GoogleDocs . I performed some handicraft to estimate overlap and provide a wild-guess at total addressable devices. From there, I estimated market share gains from now until 2020. The goal is to try to really absorb from a business point of view what some of these analyst reports are basing their price targets on. First, China. I don't believe any analyst that claims to have an estimate of 100 million users without including China. The only way to get to that figure is to assume that Netflix commands dominant market share in every country it enters, and that's a long stretch in my opinion. If Netflix succeeds in achieving such a worldwide market share, and sustains it, hats off, and I should have been a leveraged long position. China has a broadband connected base of more than 245 million users according to my calculation. And, it should be noted, my calculation is only intended for relative sizing and wild-guessing, so don't use any decimal points or presume too much specificity. Excluding China, the following countries matter. Based on the above market sizes, to reach the forecasts that we're seeing these days, which look something like this: …implies a growth pattern of something like the following: Getting about 9% share in China by 2020 Getting about 15-20% share of tier 1 countries by 2020 (less in some countries like India where only 8% is required) Commanding 20% share of targeted tier 2 countries by 2020 (they don't have to enter all the tier 2, only about half of them - so one can ignore Uzbekistan, Sudan, Ukraine, and even Singapore. I've begun taking a subjective view of these countries and incorporated them into a country-wise forecast on GoogleDocs. Still more art than science, but worth looking at to structure your thinking and for generating scenarios to support growth assumptions. The purpose of the forecast is to help illustrate the scope and scale of the required expansion - no analyst will correctly forecast all these country targets. Try to dig into the analyst forecasts to understand the growth that's being estimated to support the share price. If this growth pattern is going to be sustained and remain significant like we're seeing in the forecasts, the following types of things must happen: First and foremost, success in China, Japan The company can safely ignore certain large markets like Russia, Egypt, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. Continued growth in Western Europe and Tier 2 countries, with market penetration tending towards dominance (15-20% penetration) New market entry and success in Korea, India, Vietnam, South Africa, Hong Kong and similarly sized countries where broadband penetration exists. One can safely ignore launch statements about countries like Portugal, Singapore or Thailand, they don't even move the dial as far as the 2020 assumptions are concerned. There's only a few countries that matter, and the analysts are assuming that Netflix NFLX will excel at ALL of the important markets! In order to support a global expansion juggernaut, the growth pattern implies that the offerings stay competitive, relevant, and unique enough to not only attract new viewers, but also to maintain a loyal multi-year user all around the world. It implies that growth continues in the face of competition, and that legal and regulatory issues are satisfactorily addressed as and when they arise. And, that's just on the sales side. The price targets we're seeing also imply a continually improving contribution margin, tamping down on growth of G&A, Tech and Marketing starting in about 2017, paying a good dividend starting in 2018 (or buy-backs) and maintaining enough pizzazz to still sport a P/E multiple of around 40 in the year 2020.
