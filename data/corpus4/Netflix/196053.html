Netflix Adds $1 Per Month To “Standard” Plan For New Subscribers â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Three months after Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the company wasn’t planning to increase rates in the U.S. anytime soon , the company announced it was doing just that — by $1, at least for one plan. Variety reports that Netflix is raising the price of its most popular “standard” plan from $8.99/month to $9.99/month for new subscribers in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. Current subscribers will continue to enjoy the $8.99/month cost for access to two HD streams concurrentlyÂ for another 12 months before the increase kicks in on their bills. â€œTo continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles, we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the U.S., Canada and Latin America,â€? a Netflix rep tells Variety. The company’s other “basic” and “premium” plans were not affected by the increase. The basic plan, which costs $7.99/month, includes standard definition video and only allows one stream at a time. The premium subscription, which costs $11.99/month, includes up to four simultaneous streams and the option of watching Ultra HD content. On an earnings call in July, Hastings said the company would continue to offer a reasonable starter price and allow users to slowly climb the pricing ladder. â€œWe want to take it very slow,â€? said Hastings. â€œThings are going well. Thereâ€™s no need to be disruptiveâ€¦ Itâ€™s really focused on going very steady, very slow, and over the next decade I think weâ€™ll be able to have more and more content and add more value and then to be able to price that appropriately.â€? The standard plan increase comes just two months after the company implemented a 10% price increase to the standard plan for subscribers in Europe.
