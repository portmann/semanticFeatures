So it’s like Game of Thrones, just with more branding, a bunch of people wielding tech instead of swords, and no brutal battles to the death (we think). Planet of the Apps — yes, we get it, Apple — has opened up the call for entries at planetoftheapps.com to find 100 tech entrepreneurs who want to be on the show slated to debut in 2017, Variety reports. Those interested have until Aug. 26 to submit their online applications with a one-minute video explaining their bright idea for a new app. Selected candidates will then get the chance to get hands-on guidance from â€œsome of the most influential experts in the tech communityâ€? while theyâ€™re on the show, as well as featured placement on the App store, and possible funding from venture capital firms. There’s one obvious reason Apple is doing this, as you might guess: all the projects it’s greenlit have, so far, centered on its existing business. How do you spread news about your company?
