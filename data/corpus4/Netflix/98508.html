How Amazon Is Paving The Way To Profitability Through Prime - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is increasing the number of products eligible for Amazon Prime. This will also increase customer satisfaction. Amazon Prime growth will make Amazon more attractive to digital advertisers -- which makes Amazon more diversified, as advertisers spend more on digital video. Don't be an investors who waits for profitability -- in the case of Amazon -- as the company is on the right track. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) followers already know that the online retailer's number one strategy for keeping and expanding its position in the e-commerce space is fast delivery. The company is currently using its Amazon Prime program to improve the results of this strategy - and improved revenues and sustainable profitability should be an end product. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Amazon has been silently working on a program that could significantly increase the number of products eligible for two-day shipping under the Prime program. The program involves listing new Prime-eligible items that independent merchants will ship directly from their own warehouses to customers. To maintain the integrity of the program, Amazon is working with independent merchants that have consistent on-time delivery history. Note that Amazon usually requires merchants to ship goods to its warehouse to be considered for the Prime program. To start with, we have to note that Prime members spend over 100 percent more than non-Prime members - according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. With the sales boost Amazon Prime offers, we can expect that Prime listings will significantly increase going forward. Here's why. As more merchants find out that Amazon is allowing some independent merchants to list their goods on Prime based on their good track record of on-time delivery, other merchants are likely to develop a culture of consistent on-time delivery. Ultimately, the Amazon Prime program will grow. An added benefit of this is that Amazon's operational efficiency would see a boost, as this would reduce warehousing needs - at the minimum. First, an improved Prime program may entice non-prime members to try the program, thereby, bringing in additional revenue through the $99-a-year program. Additionally, existing members will have even more reasons to renew their memberships. You also have to factor in the additional products Prime offers. In summary, expanding Prime listings will give more consumers reasons to spend $99 on getting free shipping all-year round on most items they'd need and also enjoy free video streaming, music and e-book goodies, giving Amazon an edge over competitors like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) that only offer video streaming. Second, the potential growth in Prime's subscriber base is bound to generate more sales. Remember that Prime members tend to spend at least twice as much as non-Prime members. So as this program expands, investors should see the direct benefit on Amazon's top line. This is one benefit that is not directly obvious from the move. But those who follow the digital adverting space know that brands are dedicating more ad dollars to digital video . Amazon launched its own video ad business in early 2014. And by growing its Prime membership through improved Prime listings, advertisers will be more enticed to use Amazon to connect with their target audience, ultimately improving Amazon's earnings potential. The way to profitability described in here will not be achieved in a day - not even in a year. This move belongs more in what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos regards as an "investment phase." So short-term investors should look away from this. However, here is something for long-term investors to consider. I recently read a post on Total Atlanta Realty and I took an investing lesson from it that applies to Amazon. "Doing home upgrades yourself (even when you have to hire a contractor) is often cheaper than paying the increased home value to a seller who has already done the work for you" Here's how it relates. The writer was talking about how home buyers usually lack vision by paying more because of minor deficiencies, instead of playing less for home that have what they need - and later on fix the deficiencies. As for Amazon, investors are criticizing the company's recent lack of profitability, which is, to me, a minor deficiency for now. The investing advice from above is that we should vision the solid fundamentals of Amazon - like the one discussed above - which should make it profitable on the long run.
