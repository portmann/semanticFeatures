Like HBO? Watch These Shows On Amazon Instant Video Now! | Debt RoundUp As an Amazon Prime member , I get access to thousands of shows and movies via Amazon Instant Video . It’s one of the perks of Prime, along with the speedy two-day shipping (one day for most of my orders). Â Now, I do have Netflix as well, so many times the shows just overlap each other. One thing that stood out to me when I was scanningÂ Amazon was they have added some HBO shows. Yep, if you’re a fan of HBO and their content, then you can get your binge watch on and have a wonderful weekend doing it! While there aren’t a ton of HBO shows on Amazon Instant Video, they do currently have ten popular shows for you to watch. If you like that sort of thing, then it’s time to get Prime . If you already have the service, then fire up your Instant Video and start watching! I’m going to use my Amazon Fire TV Stick to watch Boardwalk Empire! Below are the shows that Amazon currently has available. I’m sure there will be more to come in the future, but this isn’t a bad start at all! Before you get started looking them over, make sure you take advantage of a free trial of Prime if you don’t already have it. Get your Free 30-Day Trial of Amazon Prime with Instant Video As with anything Amazon related, Not all shows are available on Prime. They might have a few seasons, but make sure you pay attention to any charges. They will tell you if the next episode or season is part of Prime Instant Video or not. Either way, here is a good way to spend your weekend, especially if you’re dealing with rain or bad weather. Curl up, turn on your TV and watch some quality programming from HBO! OK, I wanted to keep this short and sweet for this Friday. I hope everyone enjoys their weekend. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a Wordpress management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. Thank you for your kind words Lorelei! I think this strategy is one of the best ones out there, but I'm partial! This is the best financial website I have found for practical information on paying off debt and saving simultaneously. Everywhere else seems to deal with paying off debt as if… That's good to know. I will update the post to reflect the ability to stream to your TV from the PC app with Chromecast. Thanks for sharing! I cancelled it,… My daughter wears contacts so I'm going to check this out. We always order online because it's SO much cheaper than buying from the optometrist but getting a rebate, too?!… If you have a chromecast stick, you CAN stream your pc app to your tv, I do it regularly. Open your chrome browser and in the upper right hand corner… Where did she get such a deal? I've never seen my contact doctor give me a chance at a rebate!
