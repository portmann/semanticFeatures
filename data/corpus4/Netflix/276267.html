Bill Maurer's Predictions For 2016 | Seeking Alpha Apple and Netflix investors should expect some select disappointment. The next major area for consolidation will be in consumer goods. One struggling tech company will finally make a much needed move. As the year comes to a close, investors are starting to look at what 2016 has to hold. Each year, I try to provide a couple of predictions as to what we will see in the market. Last year, I did fairly well with my 2015 group , being dead on with thoughts about tech giants and a major change to the Dow 30. Today, I'm here to provide my predictions for 2016. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) dividend raise will disappoint investors: There have been those calling for the technology giant to significantly increase its dividend in recent years, and yet the company has not obliged. If we look at total dividend payments for the past three fiscal years in the most recent 10-K filing , Apple only increased the figure by $1 billion dollars between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015. The most recent fiscal year saw $11.561 billion in total dividend payments. There are a couple of reasons why I don't think we'll see a dramatic dividend increase in 2016. First, most of the company's cash is generated outside the US. This has resulted in Apple taking on a large amount of debt to accomplish its capital return plan, and the company is mostly focused on share repurchases at this point. Apple's outstanding share count only came down by 4.9% in fiscal 2015, after a 6.8% decline in the prior year. This was mostly due to the stock's rise limiting the amount of shares that could be repurchased for a similar dollar amount. As a result, I see another high single digit or low double digit percentage raise in Apple's dividend during 2016, which I believe will be a disappointment for many who think a massive rise is coming. I'll have a more formal dividend prediction as we get closer to a potential raise. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) won't add 5 million domestic paid subscribers: 2016 is expected to be the last major year for Netflix's dramatic international expansion plans, with the company expected to focus on increasing profitability in 2017 and beyond. While it wouldn't surprise me if the international subscriber base grows at a decent clip, and perhaps tops expectations, I don't think investors should be looking for too much growth in the US. As a point of reference, Netflix's most recent guidance calls for an increase of 5.67 million paid US subscribers in 2015, after 5.99 million in 2014. So why do I see a bit of a slowdown next year? Well, there are a couple of main reasons: Increasing prices will result in slightly higher churn. Greater competition will limit growth and increase costs. Summer Olympics will provide a mid-year speed bump. Company gets closer to market saturation rate. I understand that a couple of these items have been part of the bear case against Netflix for a number of years. I do think we'll start to see some of these issues gain a little traction in 2016, enough to provide a meaningful slowdown in the US segment. I also believe that increasing content costs, especially if Apple decides to launch some sort of service, will limit Netflix's content library. Netflix has seen substantial growth in its US subscriber base in recent years, but it is time for a mostly natural slowdown. There are a number of smaller names in this space that have vastly underperformed the market in the past year. I recently detailed how Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK ) could again be in for a rough time thanks to a warmer winter , and its shares are down about 45% over the past year. Wolverine World Wide (NYSE: WWW ) has lost 40% of its value over the past year, while Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX ) and Steven Madden (NASDAQ: SHOO ) have also underperformed the market. While these companies may offer great products, there are certain issues with each that make them questionable stock picks. All of them currently have market caps of less than $2 billion, so a takeover by a larger firm or a go-private transaction would not require a ton of capital. Perhaps we'll even see a merger of two of the names in the space, and there are more companies out there than just the ones I've listed. As some of the larger apparel names look to diversify their businesses and accelerate growth, it would not surprise me to see one or more of these smaller names taken out. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) will need to find a new CEO: In this year's prediction regarding company executives, I believe the struggling search company will look for management change. The core business continues to deteriorate , while plans for the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake have changed multiple times. With revenues on the decline and earnings plunging, Marissa Mayer has not proven she can get the business headed in the right direction. She also lost a key ally on the board recently, which could prove to be costly if her position is up for debate. While a new leader may not be chosen during 2016, especially if she is axed late in the year, I do think it is time for the company to move on. A turnaround is finally here for...The Container Store (NYSE: TCS ): I've been very bearish on this retailer for a while, and over the past two years the stock has fallen from the mid $40s to the high single digits. Some of the items that have hurt the name, primarily a stronger dollar and premium valuation, have improved significantly over the past year. With the company opening new stores and expanding certain initiatives to current locations, revenue growth is expected to accelerate in the February 2017 fiscal year. While the company's initial forecast for the upcoming year may not be that strong, expectations for this name have come way down (and so has the stock). While I don't see the stock returning to the $20s or $30s anytime soon, even a return to double digits would represent close to 30% upside from current levels. Today, I provided my predictions for 2016. While I do think Apple and Netflix could disappoint in certain respects, that doesn't necessarily mean I would go out and short these two currently. I do think Yahoo needs to get some new leadership in place, and I think the footwear space looks ripe for M&A. Finally, I think The Container Store will get back on its feet.
