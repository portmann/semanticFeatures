Planet Fitness: Netflix Like Growth? - Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) | Seeking Alpha Planet Fitness is growing as a company like Netflix was 5 years ago. I discuss similarities and the unique business model of PLNT. You Belong. That is one of the mottos of Planet Fitness (NYSE: PLNT ), one of the fastest growing franchises and somewhat new publicly traded companies in the country. I have been a member for 7 years. Some in my inner circle have described this name as the next Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Now I am not sure we can so as far as comparing the name to Netflix as the companies are vastly different operationally. However, Netflix depends on subscribers. Planet Fitness also depends on members (subscribers). Both companies offer very low rates. This often prevents cancellations, as even when cash flow is tight, these types of low dollar memberships are often the last to go. Why else is the comparison somewhat appropriate? Well PLNT is growing as a company like Netflix was 5 years ago. Planet Fitness has an aggressive and wildly successful advertising campaign, similar to Netflix, especially the Netflix of years past. While Planet Fitness doesn't have the global reach, and is in an entirely different sector, the growth path and member model's are strikingly comparable. However, while we all know what Netflix does, there are likely readers who are unfamiliar with Planet Fitness. Briefly, Planet Fitness runs fitness centers (i.e. gyms). The beauty of these fitness centers are they are geared toward everyday people. Simply put, they are not for serious training. The atmosphere is designed to be clean and inclusive. Weight dropping, grunting, shouting are all highly discouraged and can result in public shame through the patented 'lunk alarm,' or worse, membership revocation. The company is operating a casual fitness center. In fact, Planet Fitness is more of a social gathering place than a gym in many regards. Many college students, state employees, and finance sector friends routinely meet up at my local branches to get a 'work-out' in before happy hour. Some use it as a happy hour. Most offer tanning, free pizza once a month and a limitless supply of tootsie rolls. They also sell beverages, health products and merchandise. The business is low asset and relies on steady member fees. But the draw is that you don't have to be in fantastic shape to feel like a part of the culture. You belong. But does the stock belong in your portfolio? Is it the next Netflix. I don't think it is the next Netflix, but then again I never thought Netflix stock would surpass $100. Hindsight is 20-20 indeed. The truth is, the company is profitable, and is just getting started. The company just reported its Q1 2016 , and was quite successful. I don't think it is in hypergrowth mode, which is a good thing. Instead the growth is manageable and steady. I much prefer this approach. A total of 48 new Planet Fitness franchise stores were opened in the quarter bringing the total to 1,171. This helps the company see revenues increase 8.3% year-over-year to $83.3 million, while system wide same store sales jumped 6.8%. This suggests both higher membership rates and increased merchandise sales. What I think is strong to note is that despite revenues climbing just 8.3%, net income almost doubled. This demonstrates the margin power of this business. Eerily similar to Netflix, yes. But such a long way to go. Net income was $16.3 million versus $8.5 million last year. Contrast this with Netflix's billions in revenues and hundreds of millions in net income per year. Still, Planet Fitness' moves are encouraging. Income per share for Planet Fitness grew 25% from $0.12 to $0.15. Christopher Rondeau, Chief Executive Officer, said this about the quarter: "The year is off to a strong start. We continue to be successful attracting new consumers to Planet Fitness, which, combined with system-wide same store sales growth of 6.8% contributed to our outperformance in the first quarter compared with guidance. Awareness of our affordable, non-intimidating fitness offering continues to increase driven by the combination of our powerful national advertising strategy and continued unit expansion. We remain confident that we have a significant runway for growth based on how well our concept continues to resonate with the large population of casual and first time gym users. At the same time, our group of well capitalized franchisees is on schedule to open a record number of new stores this year and the pipeline is robust looking beyond 2016. We believe our differentiated, asset light business model has our company well positioned to deliver enhanced profitability and greater value to our shareholders over the long-term." There is your growth evidence. The company is newly publicly traded, and here in 2016 the company is on pace for record openings, with a strong pipeline beyond 2016. On top of the growth, the company is looking to be shareholder friendly. Why? Well despite being newly publicly traded, the Board of Directors has authorized a $20 million repurchase program for the company's common stock. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase. The share repurchase program does not have a specified expiration date. Still not considering the name? The company also raised its full year 2016 outlook. It now sees total revenue of $360 to $370 million, with 210 to 220 new stores. It upped its earnings guidance to $0.62 to $0.65.
