Verizon Admits Defeat On Custom TV (And That's OK) - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon's new Custom TV lineup actually represents a substantial retreat from the idea of customizable TV. This isn't necessarily something to mourn as Custom TV was poorly executed from the beginning. The new offering represents a substantial pullback by Verizon in concession to its content partners, but it does retain the very best qualities of the old Custom TV. For that very reason, it may still not satisfy Disney and the others that objected and filed suit to stop Custom TV. Verizon's failure has few implications for other potential trailblazers in a la carte TV, but it does offer some lessons. "He who fights and runs away lives to fight another day." Someone should hang that motto on a sign somewhere in Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) corporate headquarters. Verizon has finally admitted that its Custom TV offer did not quite go as planned, and is commencing a refresh. As of today, the old channel lineup of a core and a choice of seven themed supplementary bundles will be replaced by two new non-complementary offerings, both at the same price as the old core tier and with a choice of three themed supplements. Verizon is trying to put a brave face on this change, which in fact amounts to a tacit surrender to the titans of pay-TV today, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ). But in fact it has nothing to be ashamed of. Its brave attempt failed, and whether they admit it openly or not, they have conceded defeat. That may end up being good for Verizon if Disney accepts its humble apology and ends their ongoing litigation. And it will definitely be good for advocates of a la carte television because it means someone else can step up to the plate. Verizon's Custom TV was never all it was cracked up to be anyway. It was marred by several flaws from the moment it came out of the gate. First, it was too expensive. While Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Hulu offer to replace at least a substantial portion of a cable viewer's content for $8-$12 a month, Verizon wanted $55 just for the core package, as well as two channel packs. Discounts off that price were available by bundling internet, but the additional fees brought it right back up, including a $12 fee for basic DVR, a broadcast channel fee, a regional sports fee, etc. All told the real price was pretty close to $55 even with the bundle. Additional channel packs were $10 apiece. Even the cheapest option then was only about $15 cheaper than just getting a regular package of TV channels, almost not worth the hassle alone. But it wasn't just the hassle. A lot of the best cable channels were located in the channel packs, though the core had the Big Four broadcasters, at least. But of the top 30 "cable channels," i.e. neither broadcast nor premium, the expensive core had precisely four of them. Of course, the whole point of Custom TV is to trade content for cost, so that wouldn't have been such a problem, except that the cost reduction was so small. It was a relatively large trade-off of content for a relatively small savings. Worst of all perhaps may have been the packs themselves. Three of the seven were actually well designed, but only because they were so obvious: Kids, Sports 1 and Sports 2. A fourth, News and Information, was borderline acceptable even though Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) News and MSNBC probably shouldn't be bundled in with Discovery Channel, by some measures the top cable network out there. The other three were atrocious. It became obvious quickly that Verizon had put little thought into trying to identify the actual "clusters" of channels different customers actually watched and didn't watch to create a truly compelling Custom TV offering. Pop Culture included everything from ABC Family, one of the top choices for American teenagers, especially girls, to Spike network, whose average viewer is male and 42-years-old. It also included the Independent Film Channel, the very antithesis of "pop." Meanwhile, the Lifestyle supplemental grouped A&E, a general entertainment channel known especially for classical reruns of old shows, with the Travel Channel, as well as the Lifetime family of channels. But the worst of all was the Entertainment channel pack. Five of the top cable networks were on it, the most of any supplemental, and the channels had little in common with one another, such that every customer would probably need at least one of them and have little use for most of the others. It seemed to encapsulate everything Verizon hadn't even tried to do with its new offering. Even the name reeked of a certain negligence. Every channel pack strove to provide entertainment. Beyond that, it seemed to have no theme. The fact that Custom TV wasn't worthwhile for the customers soon meant that it was even less than that for Verizon. Disney and Comcast both accused Verizon of breaking contractual commitments, and Disney actually made good on its threat to sue. With content partners angry and customers more or less indifferent, Verizon obviously needed to change course. The new Custom TV is a legitimate attempt to retain what progress the original did make while repairing the damage done to Verizon's partner relations. The new lineup will consist of just two either-or options, Essentials and Sports and More. Sports and More contains the two sports pack sets of channels and Essentials contains most of the other five. There will be three theme packs available for $6 each and they are far better targeted with Kids, Teens, and Family, Global Sports, and Movie Lovers. Disney has not said yet whether it will drop its lawsuit. On the one hand, the integration of ESPN back into a "basic" tier should be enough to mollify it. It has already agreed to allow similar sports-free Essentials packages with other pay-TV providers. On the other hand, Verizon has gone further than most other providers in making their Essentials package into one that is less bare-bones and more "everything but sports." Most of the five non-sports channel packs have been included in Essentials. If that ends up making more customers choose it and drop ESPN, it is scarcely less threatening to Disney than the old system. Disney may be right to worry. Verizon did far better on pricing this time as well. Both packages are available at the same $55 price as the original, but now with most of the extra packs included. For sports lovers not much will change. They were probably picking the two sports packs as their free channel packs anyway, and leaving most of the rest. But for non-sports watchers who were sick of paying for sports, they can stop paying $10 surcharges to pick up multiple channel packs, each with only one or two channels that they want. For them this is probably a real price drop and may drive more customer growth for Verizon. My best guess is that Disney will take a pause for "negotiations" with Verizon to stall for time and see how the new packages fare. If they see an ESPN exodus they'll push on, if they don't they'll let things settle down. Although Custom TV must be regarded as a disappointment, if not quite an outright failure, investors should not mistake that as a sign that traditional pay-TV is safe. All the problems Verizon tried to address are still present. Pay-TV is expensive and rigid. Cable's most expensive channel, ESPN, is one that only 35% of customers actually want, even though almost all are required to pay for it. What lessons are there for whoever tries to shake up the industry next? How can investors spot the real trailblazer when they arrive? The most important lessons to take away from this episode are two. First, "Custom" has to actually mean custom. If it doesn't mean outright a la carte, it has to at the very least mean bundles that are not just smaller but smarter. ABC Family makes a better partner for Lifetime than FX, which in turn makes a better partner for Spike than ABC Family does. $10 also may have been too high a price for channel packs. Instead of seven $10 packs, maybe the next offer should have 10 $7 packs. And all with a clear theme and clear target audience. Price matters. Most customers have channels they don't watch, but they are not going to give them up to save pennies on the dollar of their old packages. The price doesn't have to hit Netflix lows of $10 for the core, but savings need to be substantial, and one of the best ways to do that is to have better designed packs of channels so that more packs can actually be left out of the package. Second, traditional content providers are fully aware of the danger that a la carte poses to their established monopolies. Half measures that attempt to straddle the divide between customers and partners won't cut it. Rather, the next effort might be well advised to simply accept that they are going to anger the existing establishment and just try to establish an offering so compelling that customers demand it, leaving the powers afraid to miss out by actually walking away or suing. The offering I'm describing does not exist yet. Netflix doesn't have sports or news, Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) Vue is not really any cheaper, and Sling TV's bundle is scarcely better designed than Custom TV. Nevertheless, the demand is there, as is evidenced by the fact that even Custom TV's bungling couldn't keep away a third of Verizon's new subscribers. When someone does hit it out the park, investors would be well advised to jump in early. A la carte, or something close to it, is still the future. Ultimately Custom TV only had three real custom options: sports, kids and everything else. The new system retains all three options while dispensing with most of the complexity and reducing costs for at least some customers. On that basis it has to be seen as a success for Verizon regardless of Disney's reaction. If they actually do drop the suit, that will just be the icing on the cake. Combined with Verizon's continued strength in wireless, I recommend going long on Verizon.
