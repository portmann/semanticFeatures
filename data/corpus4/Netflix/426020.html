Apple Will Never Buy Netflix Or Tesla - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Let's leave the rumormongering to manipulators and focus on investing. It is extremely unlikely that Apple would ever buy Netflix or Tesla. This article presents the buy or build decision for the reader to decide. If you're wondering about the picture, you'll get it in the end. It's got a "for sale" sign on it. I don't remember the last few consecutive days that went by without an acquisition rumor involving Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and [insert any high-flying momentum stock], but the vast majority of these rumors don't make sense from a financial, strategic or even logical perspective. Here are some examples, which I do NOT recommend reading: TSLA , TSLA , TSLA , TSLA , TSLA , TSLA , TSLA , NFLX , NFLX , GPRO , GPRO , FIT , FIT , etc. You get the point. So why do these articles pop up by the minute? Because they generate views for the writers and the sites that publish the articles. Why? Because most retail investors have never worked on an M&A transaction and think M&A is "sexy" (yeah.. that's how M&A advisors refer to anything appealing, instead of saying, "appealing"). Having worked on a few M&A deals, please allow me to explain. The following argument would need to be slightly adjusted for any given company and situation; but in Apple's case, it really comes down to: The company has more money than it can wisely spend, and it can build anything that any other company can, because they have the capital and the ability to hire skilled people. Period. Let's take Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) as an example: It's been rumored since the dawn of time that Apple is just about ready to buy Netflix. Any day now. Let's open the curtains and see how likely this is (you clicked it, didn't you? We both know you'll click anything blue). As of June 6, 2016, the market cap of Netflix was nearly $43 billion, and this figure does not include the outstanding in-the-money stock options that management periodically exercises , which then increases the number of shares outstanding and dilutes existing shareholders. But that's a topic for another article. Assuming a conservative 25% to 30% control premium to the current market cap, Apple would likely have to dish out at least $55 billion to buy Netflix. Sprinkle on top the $12 billion in off-balance sheet obligations, and a $67 billion purchase price is no chump change, even for Apple. What would Apple get in return? Nothing that it doesn't already have (brand value? check . people? check . technology? check . access to content owners? double check ), other than the rights to a few original shows, more than three of which I bet you cannot name, and which comprise only 10% of Netflix total annual content spend. 90% of the content Netflix buys is not exclusive or up for grabs to the highest bidder when the contract ends. Apple can create the same set up for much less money. Netflix spends about $6 billion per year on content. So instead of paying the purchase price calculated above, Apple can buy nearly the same content, for more than a decade. The majority of Netflix's contracts last less than three years . Contradictory to logic, very rarely does an M&A transaction come down to price versus value. More often than not, M&A is driven by ego. The egos of c-level executives, their financial advisors, legal advisors, tax advisors and the list goes on. Think about maybe a hundred people with different agendas pulling in different directions, and somewhere along the way, price versus value perspective fizzles away. The whole thing really boils down to: what does the boss want? And everyone else usually falls in line after much useless deliberation and countless late nights. Sexy. Right? Now, put yourself in the shoes of Reed Hastings or Elon Musk (NASDAQ: TSLA ). You have all the money that you will ever need plus tens of billions of dollars of walk around money. You are not driven by money, but by your goals and principles. For more than a decade, you have tirelessly built your baby from ground up. And you read stuff like this . Would you really let a potential buyer convince you that they have a better shot at accomplishing your goals than you? And sometimes more importantly, could you stand no longer being the most important person when you walk into a room? If you think the reasons for an M&A deal are the ones listed on the press release, you are being naive. Those press releases are drafted and edited tens of times before they ever see the light of day. The real reasons are what I discussed above. No surprise then that mega mergers more often than not destroy value. Bottom Line: Apple didn't get to where it is by paying $2 for something they can get for $1. If you think they should pay up for these companies, I would recommend reviewing your latest credit card statement line by line. Oh, and I have a bridge to sell you .
