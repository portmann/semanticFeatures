What 'Beasts Of No Nation' Flopping In Theaters Means To Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix?s original film 'Beasts of No Nation' opened this past weekend across multiple mediums, but earned next to nothing from theaters. The film?s theatrical earnings actually mean nothing in the long run, as the only reason for a traditional release was so the film would qualify for the awards season. While the film's theatrical revenue means little, the possibility is always in play that people will misconstrue its value and that could potentially hurt the company in the long game. It literally means nothing. The truth is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) didn't release Beasts of No Nation in theaters to make money; the company did it to enter the Oscars race. Truth be told, this is actually one of those articles I thought about writing but wasn't sure if it would be needed. I thought I had covered most of it last week, but then I started seeing stories go up about how this was a big flop for Netflix and I wanted to explain to investors why that's not the case. Now make no mistake Beasts of No Nation is a huge priority to Netflix and its success is vital to its business model. Yet how it did in theaters is a terrible indication of it potential success. First, you should know this wasn't a wide release; this was a limited run in just 31 theaters, across 30 markets. At the same time, it was available to the 43 million Netflix subscribers as part of the usual monthly subscription fee. As a result, theater chains are boycotting the film, so even if Netflix wanted a lavish big run, it wasn't going to happen. Let me simplify it even more. If you were a Netflix subscriber, would you rather view the film for no added cost from the comfort of your home or pay an additional $10+ to see it in a theater? While a few sites encouraged readers to experience this with their fellow man, those pleas were (understandably) falling on deaf ears. Beasts made $50,699 in total, which is a theater average of roughly $1,635. I could give you comparisons to other limited releases but it would make no difference. It wouldn't be a fair comparison, as Beasts is in a field all to itself at the moment. So that begs the question, why release it in theaters in the first place if the studio knew it had the potential to do poorly? By rule to have a film be considered for an Academy Awards nomination, it must receive a run in a New York- and Los Angeles-based theater for a specific amount of time. This is a rule Netflix is very familiar with, as it has used it to get its documentary series nominated, but this is the first time the studio has tried it for a scripted release. Beasts was acquired for $12 million by Netflix with the purpose of throwing an awards campaign behind it. Starring acclaimed actor Idris Elba (Luther, The Wire) and directed by Cary Fukunaga, the Emmy-winning director of True Detective's first season, the film is a dark drama set in the world of child soldiers in West Africa. It screams Oscar. Now remember the film has won acclaim from critics and audiences and will likely be in contention for this awards season. However, the fear that Netflix and its investors are beginning to realize (and if they haven't, they will soon) is that negative stories about its earnings could impact those odds. While I'd like to think the majority of voters understand the strategy at play here, the general public probably doesn't, which means public sentiment could negatively alter the film's chances. Yes Oscar voters rarely nominate films that match up with the public's interests, but if the audience vastly shows a dislike towards something voters usually steer clear. Despite what many believe, public perception does impact the awards race. Oscar voters do vote their own minds but that doesn't mean they don't at least entertain the public's thoughts. So when I search for the film and a lot of the first stories I see are about its gross revenue, that's not a good thing. Netflix is going to be a powerhouse in film, just as it is with TV, but that took a while to happen and that will likely be the case again here. You can also bet that when a non-awards film like Adam Sandler's Ridiculous 6 hits the servers in December, it may not get a limited run as there's no need. Why open themselves up to that? The service has never released numbers on its properties and probably won't, so there's no reason to start now and so why create more unneeded noise. In fact, every film will likely carry a different roll-out model. The simple fact is that Netflix wants you to stream its movies and that's perfect, because the theaters don't want to show them for that very reason. Keep that in mind when you see negative stories coming up about Netflix because of Beasts theatrical numbers and just remember those aren't the numbers you should care about.
