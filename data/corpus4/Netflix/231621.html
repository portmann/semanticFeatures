Netflix Inc.: Short For Risk-Lovers - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix Inc. has showed terrific revenue results for the nine months ended, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth. However, other performance metrics show that the company is less attractive than the average industry player. For example, they are much worse than Time Warner Cable’s. The best assumptions made in the DCF model show that the company is overvalued. The comparative analysis confirms my findings. I suggest that investors who love risk buy put options on this stock. Risk-averse investors should not consider this investment at the moment. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is a good stock for you, if you are a fan of growth stories. The company shows one of the best results in the industry. The three-year average compound annual growth in sales is 19.8%, which is circa 2.5 times higher than the industry average (and much better than Time Warner Cable's). The last 8-K report shows that the company's year-over-year revenue growth rate is in excess of 23% which demonstrates the company's attractiveness as a growth player. The platform's content library has increased by circa 35% during the same period. This is one of the best results shown by the company in its history. However, there are several questions that should be raised. First of all, take a look at the profit margins. Although the revenue growth makes other growth metrics look positive, the company is ineffective. Its operating margin is 4.8% and its net profit margin is 2.5%. These are significantly lower than the industry average. To compare, Time Warner Cable is circa 50% more effective in each ratio. The decreasing net profit margin makes net income growth much lower than the industry's average. Consequently, ROE and ROA ratios are both unattractive when compared to other companies' in the industry. On the other hand, Time Warner Cable's ROA and ROE are fantastic (see Diagram 1). The only thing we should consider Netflix's comparative advantage (financially) is its low-risk credit profile. The company's Debt/Equity ratio is below the industry's average. However, the interest expense has increased dramatically during the last year. The current interest coverage ratio of 2.9x is three times lower than the last year's (7.6x), a troublesome trend, indeed. On the other hand, despite the better operating margins, Time Warner is much more indebted than Netflix, with D/E of 2.6x and the interest coverage ratio of 3.1x. Due to an outstanding revenue growth, the company has grown its market capitalization by 15 times during the last five years, while the S&P 500 and the Pay TV indexes have showed relatively modest results (see Diagram 2). The company's current market capitalization is about 300 times its net profit and approximately 22.5 times its book value (Goodwill included). Despite the projected forward P/E of 22.5x, these figures make me feel that the best moment for investing in the stock is long gone. Now, the stock looks substantially overvalued (I bet Graham would be shocked to see this outrageous market inefficiency). However, it is usually better to check the fair price with the DCF and the comparative analyses, as numbers are very important. My DCF model is presented in Diagram 3. In Diagram 4, you can see how different metrics of Netflix Inc. will change during this period. I have made several assumptions, which can be easily seen in the "Assumptions" tab of my Excel file. My model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest and adding back cash and investments, the market value of equity is circa $37.3B in the Base scenario. Consequently, the fair value per share is about $86 per share. It is 25% lower than the current price of circa $114 per share. The Super Stress scenario's implied fair price is $77 per share, which is 33% lower than the current price level. The sensitivity analysis is presented in Diagram 5. According to the Base scenario and the assumptions for the EV/EBITDA multiple and WACC, the price range should be in the range of $90-$110 per share. This price range represents a 5-20% downside risk at current market prices. My comparative analysis is based on three key ratios: P/E, P/S, and P/BV (see Diagram 6). The results are terrible. The best case here is a 55% decline to reach the Industry's top-quartile level. On the other hand, these ratios do not embrace the effect of increasing revenue and net income growth. However, even the projected net profit CAGR of circa 20% (see my DCF model) does not make the P/E ratio attractive. The lowest forward P/E ratio my model gives me is 81.0x earnings in fiscal 2021, which translates in to an earnings power of 1.23% (Earnings/Market Cap ratio - opposite to P/E). It is terribly low in the current situation, especially given the uncertainty with the interest rate hike. Both DCF and comparative analyses show that Netflix Inc. is overvalued. Hence, my recommendation is SELL with a target price range of $80-95 per share. This target price range translates into a 20%-30% downside opportunity. However, keep in mind that the company can show better results than I expect. Therefore, I suggest that only risk-loving investors sell the stock short. Moreover, it is safer to buy put options than directly selling the shares. Finally, risk-averse investors should abstain from taking a position in this stock in either direction.
