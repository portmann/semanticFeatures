ETF Hub Sep  7 2015, 18:32 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) released the trailer for its first theatrical film this weekend. The film has already generated  positive buzz  at film festivals in Europe, including the highly-regarded Venice Film Festival . Beasts of No Nations opens at select theaters and will be available for streaming on October 16. The early take on the film set in Africa is that its intense tone and strong acting performances could put it into the mix for award consideration. Exhibitors will keep a close watch on the film's box office draw, a positive reception could influence how the sector handles future Netflix big screen movies. let's see how much this news is worth tomorrow. the say we should double from here on every time they release an original movie in theatre!! #sarcasm aside, we all know that none of this can support the stratospheric valuation but hey rally on ! From the Review: "A few years ago, the idea of a streaming website as a serious TV player was unimaginable, and now Netflix is collecting Emmy trophies for its shows. Could Oscars soon follow?" The answer, of course, is not only yes, but inevitably yes.  What Hollywood hasn't (yet) figured out is that streaming is not a fad that's somehow going to go away.  It will only grow stronger over time.  As such Netflix will soon be in a position to offer talent the sort of artistic freedom and global reach that no studio can match.  And that, more than just raw dollars, is what truly motivates creative talent.  So increasingly you're going to see the best writers, directors, and acting talent gravitate to the "new breed" of studios like NFLX as the showcase for their art. So netflix will be what time warner is today? Setting up a site to stream movies isn't that difficult to do. The trailer looks pretty good. I would be worried if I owned a movie theatre right now. Time Warner, Lion Gate should just see this as competition. Century and AMC should see this as the end.
