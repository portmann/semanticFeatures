Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Unlike other social media networks like Twitter, where you can be anyone you like as long as you’re not trying to impersonate, say, the Queen of England, on Facebook, users are required to use their real names on the site. One British woman made a big change to her identity in order to regain access to her account, only to be kept waiting to find out her fate.

Last month, a group calledÂ #MyNameIs, made up of members of the LGBT community, Native Americans, domestic violence survivors and others, protested outside Facebook’s California headquarters over its real name policy, notes Mashable .
