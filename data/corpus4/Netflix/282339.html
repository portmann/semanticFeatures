FANG Stocks: 2 To Embrace, 2 To Discard | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The so-called FANG stocks were market leaders and beaters in 2016 as investors bid up anything that could deliver outsized growth in a tepid global economy. Market leadership rarely translates from one year to the next, and some of the FANG stocks are vulnerable given their run-ups in 2015 and current valuations. Two of these stocks are still investable and two are vulnerable to significant pullbacks in 2016. My analysis of the FANG stocks for 2016 is highlighted below. 2015 was dominated by the so-called FANG (Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )) stocks as they were some of the few large-cap stocks that provided outsized returns in 2015. Out of the 3,000 largest stocks by market capitalization, almost two-thirds were down 15% or more from their 52-week highs as we closed out the year. Given the rocky start so far to 2016, that number has probably grown. The FANG Index benefited from investors bidding up growth to extreme levels in 2015 and Netflix was the best performer within the S&P 500 in the just closed year. This made some sense as there was a dearth of names that delivered robust growth in what was the most anemic world economy since 2009 to last year. However, market leadership rarely carries over from one year to another. As such, some of these former highflyers could be extremely vulnerable in 2016. So which of the FANG stocks make sense to continue to hold in 2016 and which should be discarded in the New Year? Here is my take. I still cannot embrace paying north of 100 times forward earnings for either Amazon or Netflix. Their profits margins are extremely thin (Netflix is projected to make just a quarter a share in profits in FY2016). Both companies also need to continue to invest on a grand scale to grow their businesses by adding distribution centers, for Amazon, and video content, for Netflix. Eventually, the music will stop, and investors at some point will no longer paying these sky-high multiples for either stock. Facebook and Google, now Alphabet, look much more reasonable. Both dominate their respective industries with Google owning some two-thirds of the domestic search market and Facebook being the dominant force in social media. Both are also benefiting by the continuing migration of ad dollars from traditional venues like television and radio to digital media especially mobile and video. Facebook does look somewhat pricey at 36 times forward earnings to begin 2016. However, keep in mind the shares went for ~42 times forward earnings to begin 2015 and the stock posted a strong year. In addition, Facebook is just touching the surface of the potential in its video offers. Revenues should see another year of 35% to 40% increase in FY2016. Alphabet is my favorite play currently of the FANG stocks. The shares do go for 22 times forward earnings which is slightly more than the 20 times forward earnings they commenced 2015. However, the company has made a couple of key changes in 2015 that should unlock further shareholder value. The company brought in a new and experienced CFO from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) into the firm this year which has imposed some adult supervision to what has also been a startup culture. The changes she has already made have created shareholder value and will continue to do so in the future. She helped lead the charge to split off Google's more speculative businesses into separate companies for greater transparency. In addition, the new CFO has gotten expenses under control. In the last reported quarter, expenses grew nine percent year over year, down from 28% in the same period the prior year. Starting in the New Year, the company will start to break out revenues from the main parts of the company. This should create shareholder value and a greater multiple for the stock just as it did when Amazon started to break out the contribution from its Web Services division this year. Google's YouTube ownership is a very undervalued asset. Only Facebook has more than the 1.3 billion active users that YouTube can claim. This compares favorably to the 70 million subscribers that Netflix currently sports. YouTube is also seeing faster growth than both FB and NFLX, noting earlier this year that viewing time had increased 60% year over year while mobile viewership had doubled. YouTube brings in some 15% of Google's overall revenue which is approaching $75 billion this fiscal year. That number could grow to 25% of overall revenue five years if the company can double the revenue per YouTube user over that time frame, which seems eminently possible given how fast advertising dollars are migrating to digital channels, especially video. Think about this, YouTube is producing nearly $9 billion in revenue, more than $2 billion more than Netflix which has a market capitalization of $50 billion. Assigning a per-user value along the lines of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), which seems conservative, to YouTube puts a $100 billion value on this part of the company's business or about 20% of Alphabet's overall market capitalization. Not bad given YouTube was purchased for less than $1.7 billion nine years ago. Alphabet will also be a major player whenever the world eventually transitions to driverless cars, of which there was a good piece on MarketWatch this morning on the coming paradigm shift. Finally, the company operates the fourth largest data services operation in the world. It recently assigned a company director with extensive "cloud" experience to build out its web services offerings and it could eventually become a major player in this fast growing space ala Amazon or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Given all of this, it is hard not to like Alphabet's long-term future and it is worth paying a slight premium for that long-term growth. Given the multiples of Netflix and Amazon, the shares look downright cheap, and it is the only FANG stock I currently own. However, if we do get a significant dip in the market and Facebook drops below $100.00 a share, I will probably establish a small position in that FANG stock as well.
