Alibaba to launch video streaming service - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha Jun 14 2015, 11:19 ET | About: Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) is planning to build China's version of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and HBO (NYSE: TWX ) via a new service called Tmall Box Office. "We want to create a whole new family entertainment experience," Alibaba's Liu Chunning told reporters in Shanghai. TBO will launch in about two months, with content bought from China and other countries, as well as in-house productions. Low Barriers to Entry and Competition from Local Players. International expansion for Netflix comes with many headwinds; premium is not justified. Once BABA has to negotiate licenses with content owners, maybe they add a few territories, at least via options. They are not exactly a company that wants to stay in China only. The real competitive pressures are in getting content, not so much consumers. That is is a headwind the market has not recognized in setting NFLX's valuation. Or a PEG of 4, or negative FCFE, or a Debt/Equity ratio that's tripled in one quarter, take your pick... Didn't NFLX go up like 5-7% just a few weeks ago because of a "rumor" re: China and an Alibaba partnership? Maybe up another 5%, since this "clearly validates their market and business model!" Let's see what all the spinmeisters raise their price targets to now ... Ya, and what's really scary is that only a few weeks after a meeting with Hastings and company Jack Ma will have a competitive product.  Talk about a short window to bring a product to market. Don't know about it, Tencent is already making huge progress in this market. I don't believe it will add some value in the coming 5 years or so. Will be filling the exhaustion gap, up 10% from the original China news, may lose all 10% premium. This stock is so overvalued. Reality will set in. Down 30 on the open. Wondering how Yoku will 'fit' in this design? At a minimum the content they create will be purchased and have more distribution, then there will be the advertising and cross marketing. More than likely Yoku has to be part of the Alibaba netflix-it practically is already. It's more accurate to suggest that Netflix is copying Yoku of late with the advent of commercials.
