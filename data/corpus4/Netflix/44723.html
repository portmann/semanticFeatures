Netflix Priced Above Perfection - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Despite strong subscriber growth, Netflix is exhibiting multiple dangerous trends in both opex and content cost growth. This article rehashes previous work (mid-April) and applies a balanced earnings model to the streaming business. NFLX is priced to "perfection" (100% success rate of business model) at $537/sh. Two weeks ago, prior to, and following earnings, I wrote articles claiming the " Netflix ( NFLX ) bull thesis is profoundly flawed," and highlighting the disastrous financial trends behind Q1 15 earnings . Obviously the market was enthralled with the net subscriber additions and decided to worry about financials another day. I won't repeat my short position with 10 articles within 3 weeks, all rehashing the same talking points, but I did promise my readers a financial model illustrating what a perfectly executing Netflix would look like. Absent any phenomenal news, I'll likely wait until after Q2 earnings to update the model projections. I won't repeat the exact contents of the other write-ups, but in summary, I see NFLX as facing clear y/y subscriber growth while spending record amounts on subscriber acquisition. Content liabilities have grown faster than revenues in all but one quarter (Q2 14) of streaming existence. During the past three quarters (Q3 14, Q4 14, Q1 15), growth in non-content expenses have skyrocketed, suggesting NFLX is getting desperate to fund growth. Each of these trends is shown with clear charts: pre-earnings and post-earnings. For this article, I've focused on a few additional deep trends, with a more neutral take on the sustainability of Netflix's business model. I've included two bearish takes and two neutral indicators of the ongoing growth and scaling results. Despite the NFLX sleight of hand via "contribution margin," streaming has long been a money-losing business. However, to the credit of management, significant progress was made until Q2 14. The trend then reversed and is now flat-lining. Despite the growing revenue scale, NFLX has yet to turn the corner as both opex and content costs continue to climb at a faster pace. Despite Netflix's success at turning a bottom line profit (mostly due to the power of the DVD business), free cash flows have struggled. Also note the last input is a quarterly reading while the first three are annual readings. If 2015 continues along this line, it could be a very painful year for the balance sheet. Nope. This isn't really a bearish chart. I'm including this to highlight what I view as one of Netflix's best areas of control - total liabilities per subscriber. Although content liabilities are now higher than they were last year, the overall trend is clearly downward. If NFLX can keep costs in the $160-$180/sub band while also increasing monthly charges, there is a chance of achieving profitability. This chart can be interpreted in many ways, but I'm clearly seeing lower peaks and less dips (flattening cost fluctuation). If NFLX can hold subscriber acquisition to a $50-$80 bandwidth, then the growth expenses should at least be manageable. The cause for concern is the y/y growth in Q3 14, Q4 14, and Q1 15, clearly fueled by European expansion. It will take Q2 15 results to see if the "lower peak" trend continues. When I started the Netflix model around 2 weeks ago, I was trying to approach the valuation from two avenues. One: model what I perceived as realistic revenues and expenses and determine a terminal value. Two: create a feasible model that justified the current share price ($560). In the end, I've attempted to merge the two together. I've included many bullish aspects such as persistent blended price increases, reduced content growth, and flat interest expense. I've been slightly more neutral in my subscriber growth estimations and marketing expense calculations. I've modelled growth on a y/y trend as opposed to a q/q with a seasonality factor built in. As shown, the seasonality naturally comes out based on the established trends. I believe my y/y growth figures are pretty balanced, but definitely open to input. I've included the potential impact of yearly $1 price hikes, blended quarterly due to churn and grandfathering. On the international front, I've given NFLX the benefit of the doubt on breakneck expansion through 2016, followed by healthy growth thereafter settling on a 15% y/y run rate. I've included price hikes, but at a slower pace than seen domestically. These price hikes are aggressive considering the multiple set-top box partnerships NFLX has developed that involve 3-6 month free trials and 10-15% royalty payments. While I see international subs potential doubling within 3 years, I don't see subscribers or revenues surpassing the 50% mark for several more years. In these charts I've been extremely generous with content COGS (16-18% annual growth versus historical 25-30%), G&A spend (12% y/y versus historical 27-64%), and interest costs (flat versus clear expansion trend). I've been more neutral/balanced with marketing and T&D expenditures following the subscriber growth trends. Each year highlights the pre-tax earnings from the consolidated business. At $41.66 pre-tax for CY18 (roughly $30 EPS assuming blended 28% liability), discounted at 10% for 3.5 years, and with a robust 25 P/E, the NFLX streaming business is worth $537/sh. Assuming NFLX is able to beat the current (negative) trends in both content growth and non-content opex growth (i.e. the "virtuous cycle" starts appearing) while maintaining current subscriber growth trends AND managing to raise the monthly subscription prices at a healthy clip without disturbing growth, NFLX is fully priced (100% success rate of current business model) at $537/sh. Keep in mind, the $537 assumes zero room for error in any facet. Slower growth, slower price hikes, higher content expense, higher interest expenses, or any other multitude of changes could negatively impact these projections. This model also assumes that future competition has zero to negligible impact on NFLX's subscriber growth curves and negligible impact on content cost curves. I welcome a lively discussion and/or competing models. I also think Eric Przybylski's article from April 22nd offers a good take from a slightly more bullish angle.
