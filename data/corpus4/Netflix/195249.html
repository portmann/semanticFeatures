Netflix: Looking For Slight Q3 2015 Revenue Beat - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (450 clicks) Netflix is set to announce 3Q15 earnings after the market closes, Wednesday, October 14. There are strong domestic and international paid subs growth trends to support healthy Q3 growth. International monthly ARPU should be weighed by FX and low Japan pricing headwinds. We are looking for Netflix to report revenues just slightly north of $1.76 billion for the quarter. We believe Netflix's ability to top this aggressive 24% Y/Y topline growth estimate amid multiple headwinds is indicative of a strong and rapidly growing international audience. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is set to announce 3Q15 results after the market closes, Wednesday, October 14 . The earnings report is quite crucial, as it comes amid several new expansion initiatives and changing macroeconomic conditions, including multiple international market launches, intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime and Hulu globally, emerging market weakness, global currency devaluation, and a strategic shift in company focus to exclusive content. We believe current trends indicate strong domestic and international paid subs growth, which will drive a revenue beat despite FX headwinds and Japan pricing weighing on international monthly ARPU. Analysts are looking for $1.75 billion in revenue for the quarter. We believe that this estimate is an accurate gauge for Netflix's performance in the quarter, and further believe Netflix will beat that number by roughly $11 million. According to our analysis, there are strong paid subs growth trends to support healthy Q3 growth. In terms of Q/Q sequential growth, domestic streaming paid subs growth has slowed this year. 2Q15 saw domestic streaming paid subs grow 1.84% Q/Q, down from 2Q14's Q/Q growth of 2.06% and 2Q13's 2.55% Q/Q growth rate. International streaming paid subs Q/Q growth, though, saw a sharp snapback to accelerating growth after a down 2Q14. This is due to new market expansion in 2Q15, specifically including Australia and New Zealand market launches in March. Moreover, we can see a deceleration in the DVD subs loss rate. In terms of Y/Y growth, domestic streaming paid subs growth has been consistently slowing from 23.16% in 1Q14 to 17.02% in 2Q15, with markedly lower Y/Y growth rates this year compared to last year. Y/Y international paid subs growth rates were showing a slowing trend until a MRQ reversal due to new market launches. Concurrently, Y/Y DVD paid subs loss rate has decelerated over the past year. In terms of domestic paid subs growth, Q3 sequential growth has outpaced Q2 sequential growth in the past 2 years. 2Q14 saw domestic streaming paid member count grow just over 2% sequentially (34.377 million to 35.085 million), while 2Q13 saw domestic streaming paid member count grow just over 2.5% (27.913 million to 28.624 million). By comparison, 3Q14 domestic streaming paid member count grew 3.36% Q/Q (35.085 million to 36.265 million) and 3Q13 domestic streaming paid member count grew 4.55% Q/Q (28.624 million to 29.925 million). In the past 2 years, 3Q domestic streaming paid sub growth has outpaced 2Q domestic streaming paid sub growth by 80-200 basis points. Extrapolating this trend, 3Q15 domestic streaming paid sub growth Q/Q should be greater than 2Q15's 1.8% Q/Q growth. We believe Netflix will report domestic streaming paid members of 42.207 million in 3Q15. This represents 2.8% Q/Q growth (roughly 100 basis point acceleration from 2Q15 Q/Q growth) and 16.4% Y/Y growth, consistent with the current decelerated domestic streaming paid subs growth trend. We also believe international growth will build upon its strong 2Q15 Y/Y growth thanks to its Japan launch and continued expansion in European and Australian / New Zealand markets. 3Q15 includes roughly one month of the Japan launch, and new non-English originals like Narcos and Club de Cuervos ensure continued strong adoption in foreign markets. We see international paid member count growing to 25.469 million in Q3, as this represents 77% Y/Y growth. While this may seem high relative to 2Q15's 68% Y/Y international streaming paid member growth, it is still slower than 3Q14's 78% Y/Y growth. Given new market launches, we believe this 77% growth in paid international streaming members is very achievable. On the DVD subs side, we believe Y/Y loss rate will continue to decelerate. We believe paid domestic DVD member count will be just over 5 million at the end of 3Q15, a 15% Y/Y decline. In terms of our calculated monthly ARPU (which differs from the reported monthly ARPU, and is simply revenue divided by paid members at end of period divided by 3), we believe that domestic streaming monthly ARPU will continue to build on its upward climb. We are looking for domestic streaming monthly ARPU of $8.50 as Y/Y paid subs growth decelerates meaning a higher concentration of full 3-month paying subs. We believe domestic DVD ARPU will stabilize at $10.48, as domestic DVD ARPU has fluctuated around $10.50 since 2013. In relation to international streaming monthly ARPU, we believe that figure will continue to decline in 3Q15, as the strong dollar and Japan's pricing structure will likely weigh on ARPU. Although the Euro has somewhat stabilized against the USD, most other global currencies weakened during the quarter and this should adversely affect international monthly ARPU. Moreover, Japan's pricing structure offers Netflix for $5.40 per month for "basic" , a healthy discount to MRQ monthly international ARPU of $7. We are looking for slight international monthly ARPU compression Q/Q to $6.90. We expect Netflix to earn roughly $1.076 billion from domestic streaming customers in the quarter (42.207 million paying members at end of quarter times $8.50 monthly ARPU times 3), just above $527 million from international streaming customers in the quarter (25.469 million paying members at end of quarter times $6.90 monthly ARPU times 3), and just under $158 million from DVD customers (5.014 million paying members at end of quarter times $10.48 times 3). In sum, we expect Netflix to report record revenues of $1.761 billion in 3Q15, an $11 million beat on analyst estimates. While this revenue beat is marginal at best, it is a beat on an aggressive analyst number calling for 24% Y/Y topline growth. We expect Netflix to top this estimate despite emerging economy and strong dollar headwinds, and believe this is representative of a rapidly growing international audience.
