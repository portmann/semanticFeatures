European stocks just broke a one-month high and are poised for their best weekly gain since late January on renewed hopes central banks will keep monetary policy loose for longer. Overnight, Asian equities and currencies also marched higher following yesterday's gains on Wall Street (the Dow ended above 17K for the first time since August, while the S&P 500 closed well past its 50-day MA of 1,995). Oil prices are advancing into the $50s , pushing past a key level to record a gain of nearly 9% this week. Support appears to be coming from a variety of factors, including recent OPEC comments on tackling the global overhang, expectations of shrinking U.S. production and concerns about Russia's military operations in Syria. Crude futures +2.5% to $50.64/bbl, the commodity's highest level since July 22. Just days before the first Democratic debate , presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has published a series of proposals aimed at cracking down on Wall Street, pledging that individual bankers who violate the law will be "prosecuted and imprisoned." The plan would impose a graduated "risk fee" on large financial institutions and strengthen the Volcker Rule. A separate tax would be levied on high-frequency trading, targeting strategies that involve a large number of order cancellations, a practice her campaign says makes markets "less stable and less fair." Christine Lagarde has opened the door to a second five-year term as the head of the IMF, stating she is "prepared to serve" if the fund's shareholders keep her as managing director. "I'm certainly open to the fact that it could not be my last annual meeting," she declared. The former French finance minister's current five-year term ends in July 2016. Europe's "migrant crisis" could allow some countries wiggle room in terms of their budgetary commitments, Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for the Euro and Social Dialogue, told CNBC. The stability and growth pact's fiscal rules (such as budget deficits no greater than 3% of GDP) have to "be respected," but the laws could provide a certain amount of flexibility "in extraordinary circumstances." Eurozone countries are due to submit their draft budgets to the commission on October 15. Embattled mining giant Glencore is slashing its zinc production by a third in reaction to a 30% plunge in the commodity's price over the past few months. The company will cut 500K tonnes of zinc production, 4% of the world's total supply, including closing its Lady Loretta mine in Australia and Iscaycruz mine in Peru. Glencore ( OTCPK:GLCNF ) shares are up nearly 7% in London in response to the move. So what happened at VW's congressional grilling yesterday? Not much. Michael Horn, head of Volkswagen Americas, insisted that deceptive emissions software was not a corporate decision, but something a few employees engineered. The executive also said he couldn't provide an exact time frame for when the fixes would be carried out or a plan for VW dealers, but declared that Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ) will compensate customers and address any impact on performance. According to an estimate by Warburg Research, the automaker will ultimately face costs and lost revenue from its damaged image of more than â‚¬35B ($39B). The new tentative labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) and the United Auto Workers union will be one step closer to being ratified following the UAW Chrysler Council's meeting in Detroit today which will discuss the agreement and vote on it.

The U.K. government has sold off another 1% of its stake in Lloyds (NYSE: LYG ), cutting its total interest in the bailed-out lender to below 11%. News of the latest share sale comes in the same week the British finance ministry announced it would sell at least Â£2B worth of shares in spring 2016 to return the bank to full private ownership.

Looking to reverse a two-year profit slide , Standard Chartered's ( OTCPK:SCBFF ) new Chief Executive Bill Winters plans to cut up to a quarter of the bank's most senior staff.

Combining two vaccine components from Crucell Holland and Janssen Pharmaceutical, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) is beginning clinical trials of a preventive Ebola vaccine regimen in Sierra Leone. Is the Ebola outbreak finally over? For the first time since the disease was reported in March 2014, the World Health Organization reported no new cases over the past week. According to the WHO, this is part of a trend: The number of cases in West African countries has remained below 10 per week over the past three months, but that doesn't mean the virus can't surface again. A total of 11,297 are said to have died since the start of the epidemic. Danish transport company DSV is buying California-based logistics company UTi Worldwide (NASDAQ: UTIW ) for $1.35B. DSV ( OTCPK:DSDVY ) offered $7.10 in cash per share, which represents about a 50% premium to UTi's closing price on Thursday. UTi's board has unanimously accepted the offer. UTIW +43.4% premarket. In a wide-ranging interview with Handelsblatt , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk had some trash talk to unleash on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Asked whether he takes Apple's automotive ambitions seriously: "Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch? (laughs) No, seriously: It's good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches." On Apple hiring Tesla's "most important engineers": "Important engineers? They have hired people we've fired. We always jokingly call Apple the "Tesla Graveyard." If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding." Netflix is hiking the price of its standard streaming service by $1/month to $9.99 for new customers in the U.S., Canada, and parts of Latin America.
