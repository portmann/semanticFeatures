Netflix Earnings Preview: Slowing Subscriber Growth A Concern - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix reports Q2 FY2015 earnings after market closes on Wednesday, July 15th. We project Netflix to miss the Street's estimates on both revenues and earnings. Video streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reports Q2 FY2015 results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 15th. The Street is expecting revenues of $1.65 billion and $0.31 EPS. We expect Netflix to miss both revenues and earnings for Q2 FY2015. We project Netflix to post $0.30 EPS on $1.62 billion in revenues. We believe Netflix will miss estimates for the following reasons: Continued spending on marketing and SG&A The core of Netflix's business is its subscriber base. The company's domestic subscriber count and international subscriber count have grown relatively predictably since FY 2011 Q3. Historically, Q2 has consistently been Netflix's weakest quarter for sequential subscriber growth, suggesting a slight seasonality to the business. In the FY2015 Q1 letter to shareholders , Netflix issued Q2 guidance of 42 million US subscribers and 22.78 international subscribers, representing sequential growth of 1.45% and 9.10%, respectively. Netflix's subscriber count guidance for Q2 is in line with the company's previous growth trends. To forecast Q2 revenues, we applied these growth rates to Netflix's Q1 revenues in domestic and international streaming. In addition, we forecasted that revenues from domestic DVD rental revenues would fall 3% from Q1, in line with previous sequential growth rates in domestic DVD rental revenues. Combining these revenue streams, we arrive at a Q2 revenue projection of $1.62 billion. Netflix's aggressive international expansion plan has hurt the company's bottom line. FY2015 Q1 EPS was $0.38, down more than 126% from FY2015 Q1. International streaming operated at a -15.6% contribution margin, and Netflix guidance projected the operating loss to deepen in Q2. As international streaming growth outpaces domestic streaming growth, Netflix's bottom line will continue to underperform. In addition to international headwinds, we project marketing and SG&A expenses to remain high and deflate Netflix's bottom line. Last quarter, marketing and SG&A expenses represented 12.38% and 5.82% of total revenues. Both expense categories were about 2% higher than Q1 of the previous year. We expect elevated marketing and SG&A spending to continue as a result of Netflix's international expansion. All told, we project Netflix to post $0.30 EPS, which is one cent short of consensus estimates. Overall, we project Netflix to miss the Street's estimates on revenues and earnings. Q2 seasonality and aggressive international expansion-related expenses will lead to a disappointing quarterly report.
