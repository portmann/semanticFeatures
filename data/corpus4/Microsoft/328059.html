The REAL Reason Bill Gates Supports Backdoor FBI Access | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Microsoft programmers have allowed NSA backdoors in all Windows software since 1999 or before . And while Microsoft sometimes pretends that it's fighting for privacy, it has long been a direct partner of the NSA , helping government at every opportunity . Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:55 | 7227047 dexter_morgan I wonder if the Donald comprehends the situation since he seemed to be of the opinion Cook should go to jail or something if he does give them their way. That wouldn't be a good sign.  No one cares to stop the carnage of evil as it flaunts the law in the faces of the world's People every day. There is no justice for the evil that is out of control because of the lack of the control of, evil. The really filthy truth is the people are angry because there is plenty  of admiralty law to perpetuate the cash generating prison world  complex with, but there is no justice for these evil leaders and politicians, and media cretins who blatantly flaunt that they are above the law of the land. The people are fed up with all the trash and BS and lies and deceptions. They hate with a passion the evil lying dying dinosaur media complex. No one supports them, or buys any products advertised on the TV drug any moar. Take that hag hitlery and her scumbag accomplice the other commie, Obama for instance. The stack of criminality and corruption is staggering and yet, not a peep in the supposed news media that is no less that the most vile, evil bunch of carkin accomplices to the worst skanky evil to ever walk the planet in this charade, this horrendous farce, this shit show deluxe from hell's arsehole.

Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:15 | 7226556 Reaper Trust in government, in operating systems, in software, in judges in black robes, in FBI agents, in police, or in juries is for fools.  Is the testimony of any government hack into your internet communications to be trusted?  All FBI forensic evidence must be doubted.  i.e. https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-... Stupid juries want to believe FBI and police testimony, when these testifiers are experienced in presenting false testimony. http://www.innocenceproject.org/free-innocent/improve-the-law/fact-sheet... Your only good defense is that the government, aka police or FBI, could not legally obtain that which they will certainly lie about.  Encryption is abuse protection from your supposed protectors. I would venture that it was off limits. Bill knows the game now, and has cooperated with the government since way back. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:13 | 7226549 sgt_doom On TV interviews on Apple and the FBI, Gates sounded like a complete idiot, as if he didn't understand what Apple was talking about (always a possibility with BG). What GW is talking about was Micro$oft's ADVAPI.DLL file, created expressly for NSA. But rest assured, if the FBI gets their feeb hands on Apple's encryption scheme, then the Chinese intelligence will have it within 48 hours, as the feebs have long been deeply penetrated by Chinese intelligence, as too many of their agents will give up EVERYTHING for a little bit of Chinese poon tang! (Of course, since Ann Coulter's boyfriend is an FBI agent, that might just be a major step up for them!) Tue, 02/23/2016 - 18:57 | 7226410 redwater I don't think their is any candidate left who isn't for the deep state having access to everyone's phone andr computer. Republicans and Democrats are fighting over who's more of a pinko commie than the other. Republicans and Democrats voters are at the point where they'll voluntarily apply to be sent to the FEMA camps for the good of the nation. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 18:45 | 7226393 xizang777 Amazing that in this modern age, that no one car read.  As in READ the Fourth Amendment.   Any warrant has to state a probable cause, and state what in particular the government is looking for.   This current federal government wants the master keys to access EVERYONE'S privacy.   Once they have those keys, what assurrance do we have that they will follow the Fourth Amendment.  Or do you suppose the government will just use those keys to access everyone's data willy nilly, when and as they please.  And of course, those keys will be available to everyone on the black market.   So much for privacy.   May as well just install government cameras in your bathrooms and bedrooms.  Tue, 02/23/2016 - 18:38 | 7226355 Citxmech The "Real" reason?  How about because Gates is one of the world's most eager whores who will do anything to protect his position including fight for the chance to be a concubine of Satan? Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:32 | 7226634 peddling-fiction He was also lying through his teeth about Global Warming (he forgot they call it Climate Change these days). /lol Bill was showing off his personal pseudo equation. Probably Davos babble. http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/23/bill-gates-the-world-needs-a-miracle-t... Tue, 02/23/2016 - 17:46 | 7226125 williambanzai7 First of all, I always assumed that Apple has already given the government the keys to the back door, but that is not my question. But assuming for arguments sake they have not: Why isn't Apple saying if you come with a proper court order, give us the Phone, WE will unlock it, draw the data out and hand it to you in a strictly confidential basis. That is very different from Apple being forced to say: OK here are the keys go ahead and have fun unlocking that Phone and any other Phone you feel like unlocking with what you learn from that exercise. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:39 | 7226953 dexter_morgan This is what I've been saying to people with dumb stares - if they have a warrant, then give them the info. If they want more than the info - tell them to go fuck themselves.  williambanzai7, They (apple) already complies with Fed warrants in that way.  Fedgov wants them to build a backdoor into the hardware, like China currently does with quite a few items.  Oddly enough had Fedgov given Apple a phone call, Apple could have taken the iphone in question back to the users location and uploaded any / all info on to the Icrapple cloud drive and given Fedgov all the info.  Fedgov chose NOT to make that phone call and fucking bricked the iphone .                    Oh well...LOL. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:13 | 7226816 nmewn I read they got to nine failed attempts and stopped, number ten bricks it. Could be wrong but thats what I understand and of course thats all we (or should I say "I") have to go off of, press reports...which could be false reports.  Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:49 | 7226713 Bennie Noakes As I understand it, to unlock the phone you need to guess the password, which could take years if the password is strong. So the government is requesting a special version of the phone's software that would prevent it from permanently locking after 10 incorrect guesses. Even with the software mods the FBI is requesting, there is no guarantee that the government would be able to guess the password in any reasonable amount of time, or that they would find any useful information if they did. But they could use the modified software on any iPhone of the same make. Given the failure to the government to protect IRS information of millions of taxpayers and employment information of millions of government employees, how could Apple be sure that the special hacking code they give the FBI would not end up in the hands of criminal hackers? Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:08 | 7226795 nmewn On the issue of time, the time to unlock, one of the theories I've read is they (if they don't have "a masterkey") is to suspend the devices comprehension of time. Doing so allows them to run an almost unlimited amount of passcodes past it in less than the blink of an eye, the device "thinking in terms of seconds" thousands or millions of password guesses running through it micro-seconds until one hits. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:38 | 7226948 nmewn I'm no expert either and am only relating what I've read too but knowing what I think I know, they've already got it and this is all for public consumption. They could have done all this "legally" under seal, a gag order, both parties are being very forthcoming & open to set something else up (IMHO), probably a precedent that will devolve down to even divorce cases in the future, ten years max...lol. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:42 | 7226968 dexter_morgan NEVER WASTE A CRISIS. Sounds like Apple one of few companies that hasn't already given them this backdoor, so use the San Bernadino incident to get it.  Is there really anything on that phone they don't already have like contacts via cell tower records, email records, etc.? Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:26 | 7226607 messystateofaffairs Its all a show for marketing purposes, to make Apple look like they care about customers privacy. The back doors been with Apple a long time. I beleive strong encryption cannot be cracked by the government. Independent smart people can't do it so neither can govt. I use Truecrypt software and the developers of the software claimed on the website that they found a flaw with the software and its not secure. Independent testers have not been able to find a weakess. I think govt got to the founders and twisted their arm to discredit their product to weaken user faith in it precisely because they can't defeat it. I have faith in open source software and strong encryption and that includes products like bitcoin. They are going to play a vital role in the fight for freedom. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 19:22 | 7226593 HalinCA Tue, 02/23/2016 - 18:42 | 7226378 nmewn I had always assumed the same and I'm not so sure they don't, this could be the old good cop/bad cop routine with Apple finally saying "Gosh darn it, we tried folks but it's a court order dangit all." But what you say is what should happen, they get ONE government rep in the room (and not some little photographic memory geek either, a top dog and just one) and Apple unlocks it, downloads it and most importantly Apple gets a copy of whatever is on it (because I really don't trust what they will say they found on it) and that copy is given to a third party (say like, the ACLU for shits and grins) and Apple keeps that key so that copy can be turned over to the defense counsel should the need ever arise. The government cannot be trusted with whatever Apple says they have (the encryption keys/code/hack software) to i-phone devices, they've made that abundantly clear by their past actions in scooping up everyones data.  From my understanding the phone was not "owned by" Saaayeed Nutcase, it's owned by his employer (local .gov if I recall) and they are giving the government permission along with it being "evidence" in a crime.  As an aside, I believe there is only three rational possibilities going on here, whatever is on it implicates .gov itself or they really are trying to get a "master key" or it's a ruse to explain how they've had access to i-phones all along. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 18:18 | 7226263 motley If they provide a backdoor method to crack the encyrption, the encryption can no longer be trusted.  This doesn't matter whether the method is provided internally (worrisome) or externally (worse) because you are admitting that there is a backdoor and then "people" as well as the security must be trusted.  This is not real security any more...it means someone or something out there has a key to your backdoor that you don't know about, and you just have to trust them. Any encryption can be brute-forced with computing power...the stronger the encryption, the more computing power it will require and the longer it will take to busted.  Encryption is getting stronger all the time, but so is computing power and access to large computing grids. If you want to sell your product based upon secutiy, you don't allow a back-door, period. This is very important to Apple's image, as it should be. Tue, 02/23/2016 - 20:15 | 7226824 knotjammin2 All the hoopla about this story is just plain bullshit.  Apple gave up the codes a long time ago and that's from somebody that worked on the team.  No Bullshit!!
