Here's The Real Reason Why Microsoft Moved Higher After Earnings - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Understanding why Microsoft moved higher following earnings is a bit of a mystery, but I think I know why. For the most part, the outlook wasn't particularly phenomenal in terms of constant currency. But if you look further out there's meaningful growth potential due to commercial revenues. However, it's not just commercial revenues, the Xbox/Surface/Skype/Advertising product segments are starting to grow into larger businesses, which impacts more of the revenue mix going forward. So, if you combine all of these factors it seems the outlook was actually conservative, and it's particularly hard to make an accurate forecast on next-year sales. I anticipate that commercial subscriptions will convert into a higher percentage of office users, paired with high growth segments impacting consolidated sales more substantially in FY 2017. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) remains one of my more favorite ideas, and this is mostly driven by the fact that the company is well managed and is transitioning into a growth phase. Of course, anyone can acknowledge that Microsoft's presence in mobile hasn't actually been very convincing. However, the company has been able to demonstrate that it can continue to grow its presence in the enterprise. Office 365 revenue in commercial was up 70% in constant currency, dynamics and cloud services revenue grew 12% constant currency, and office 365 consumer grew by around 3 million subscribers in the past quarter. The decline was due to the transition from license to subscription revenue. On the front-end, the consumer office segment will experience a moderate drop in revenue, but over time I anticipate that the annual subscription will cumulate into larger revenue over time. Furthermore, many people gain access to Office 365 via an office computer, so the momentum in the commercial segment seems more indicative of the overall growth potential of office. I don't see many people going out and buying Office Suite software when they really don't need it, unless if it's for school or they like to work at home. Of course, many companies and universities provide free Office Licenses on home computers for employees/students, so this is where the line becomes a little gray. But overall productivity software is expected to grow considerably over the next three years. Now, if you're wondering why I'm so fixated on Office revenue, it's because it's the largest contributing revenue category, followed by server related licensing, infrastructure and middleware. Anyone fixated on the PC and Phone space when reviewing Microsoft's results is really missing the big picture here as the company illustrates in its recently published 2015 annual report that across key product categories they've made some pretty decent progress. Remember, Microsoft is a massive organization, so it's important to understand that the company operates on multiple pillars. Microsoft isn't really concentrated in a particular space, so the industry-specific problems pertaining to PCs won't substantially impact the rest of the company. I usually refer to this breakdown because it's really hard to understand the growth of the various product segments as you go through the fiscal year. Microsoft tends to break down by segment in a really awkward format. But for those of you who are pretty growth oriented it's important to point out that the Windows PC segment was what really suffered in the past year. And the Office revenue is going through a mix shift transition away from perpetual licensing to subscription revenue. The revenue is deferred for Office 365, so you have to imagine that it takes time for there to be a meaningful uptake in sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The point is, the total subscriber figure growth is more indicative of the consolidated revenue growth going forward, as this particular segment could generate 10% growth year-over-year, and the impact on consolidated revenue growth is 2.1% or so, and that's just one product category. Now, obviously handset sales were particularly weak in the prior quarter, but what really stood out was the revenue outlook in Q4 CY 2015, which is Q2 FY 2016. The company mentions that in the holiday quarter the best case scenario is $25.4 billion in terms of sales with worst-case scenario at $24.8 billion. For the most part, my bias is to the upside due to seasonality and refresh in the PC segment. However, there's no denying that the consensus estimate from analysts sits in the middle and that sales are projected to decline by 4.9% mostly due to foreign exchange impact. Microsoft mentions in its outlook that the revenue impact is likely to be around 4% due to FX. However, if you factor back in that 4% you're looking at around flat sales for the next quarter in terms of constant currency. That implies a flat year-over-year outlook. What really stood out following earnings was the sudden move higher. It's really hard to understand why people are so optimistic after management guided flat revenue when compared to prior year comps. You would imagine that these numbers aren't that good, but I've seen this play out over the past couple years with Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ), where revenue ramps substantially once they transition more of their users over to subscription over software licenses. Microsoft thinks that over time the transition will generate 1.5x more in revenues per user and that user growth will continue due to the broader demand for productivity software in various markets. In other words, the market seems a lot more forward-looking when pertaining very specifically to Microsoft, and that's what's surprising to me because markets are usually short sighted. My guess is that the various industry-wide reports surfacing on the eventual bottom of semiconductors in Q4 CY 2015 and the ramp up of software subscriptions is what's driving the optimism. There's also no denying that console gaming revenues should be up significantly in Q4 CY 2015 due to Halo 5 and that the remaining segments like advertising and Surface will leap out at us eventually. The growth in Surface between 2014 and 2015 was 107%, and I'm not saying that triple-digit growth will happen again this year. It's just that in my view the revenue growth of a $4 billion segment could be the real surprise to sales in the next quarter as their consumer electronic franchise is starting to gain legs and is moving meaningful volume off the shelves. So, if the big businesses are set to stabilize or grow modestly over the course of three years, the high growth categories like Skype, Azure and Surface are set to contribute perhaps an incremental improvement of $5 to $10 billion to consolidated sales, which more than offsets the weakness in PCs, which is expected to bottom out anyway. The end takeaway is that there are a lot of moving parts at Microsoft right now. You have substantial growth priced into the stock, judging by its valuation (37.6x EPS). However, the causal relationship for that valuation seems substantiated due to notable strength in the smaller business segments, paired with a major sales catalyst once Office 365 commercial licenses completely convert over to subscription. With those two factors combined the question then becomes when do sales grow significantly? Obviously management is being pretty conservative here with their guidance, but that's obviously due to their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Anyone who simply breaks it down into these various segments will recognize that there's a lot of pent-up upside. And I'm not saying it happens next quarter, but eventually, Microsoft should be able to report a fairly sizable improvement in sales and earnings over the next year or two. It's just not yet clear when the smaller segment will grow into a large enough of a base to impact the remaining segments. And finally, it's not yet clear when PCs do eventually bottom out. But if all the stars do align, which I think they will - it will continue to outperform and the earnings multiple will eventually stabilize. I've been optimistic on Microsoft for quite a while. Going forward, I plan to elaborate more on the valuation I think it will trade at, and provide my own estimates on 2016 sales/earnings in future articles. Thanks for reading.
