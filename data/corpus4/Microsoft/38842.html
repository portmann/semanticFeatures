Microsoft Keeps Its Head In The Cloud - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft reported quarterly earnings Thursday and beat on revenue and earnings. Consumer licensing revenue was down 25% Y/Y and Japan's macroeconomic issues could weigh on results going forward. Surface Pro 3 (revenue up 44%) and cloud services (revenue up over 100%) are two catalysts that could drive the stock long-term. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) reported quarterly earnings on Thursday and beat on both revenues and earnings . The following chart outlines revenue growth by segment: Consumer Licensing Revenue In Free Fall Heading into the quarter consumer licensing revenue was down 25% Y/Y. It nearly matched that with a 24% Y/Y decline from $4.6 billion to $3.5 billion this quarter. As PC sales go, so goes PC licensing revenue. Desktop PC sales are in decline due to [i] a general decline in durable goods orders and [ii] consumers' use of mobile devices for personal tasks they used to use desktop computers for. Japan - the segment's second largest market - isn't helping matters either. Japan is currently the third largest economy in terms of GDP, but it's economy has been stagnant since its real estate debacle in the early '90s. Management referenced Japan on the earnings call: I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan, given it's our second-largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly four points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attach to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics ... The impact is most evident in our DMC and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan and we don't expect this to change in the short term. The launch of Windows 10 later this summer may jump start licensing revenue. However, Microsoft's "Japan problem" could weigh on this segment for several more quarters. The computer/gaming segment was down 4% Y/Y. Surface revenue of $713 million was up 44%, driven by the new Surface Pro 3. Microsoft appears well-positioned to take advantage of consumer demand for lighter notebook computers with the functionality of an iPad. The Surface Pro 3 could become the hedge against declining consumer licensing revenue that Microsoft expected its mobile phone segment would be. The Xbox, however, is another story. Xbox platform revenue was down 24% Y/Y. The decline was driven by lower unit sales and lower average sales prices ("asp") caused by the lower-priced Xbox One. Despite the lower price, the Xbox One still lags behind Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) PS4 in new sales. I thought Xbox sales would contribute more, but I was wrong. Microsoft's commercial-other segment is all about the cloud. Commercial-other grew 45% Y/Y, but cloud services revenue more than doubled for the second straight quarter. Management estimated commercial cloud services had annualized run-rate revenue of $6.3 billion. This would put it at about $1.58 billion for the quarter - on par with the $1.57 billion in cloud services revenue Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reported this quarter. Microsoft ranks second behind Amazon in cloud services in terms of market share, yet the reported revenue makes them appear about even. Surface Pro 3 revenue and the jaw-dropping performance of cloud services have changed Microsoft's narrative from one of "old tech" to "new tech." The quarter was very encouraging. However, at over $47 MSFT trades at 19x p/e, and its EPS growth (-10% Y/Y) needs to catch up with its p/e multiple.
