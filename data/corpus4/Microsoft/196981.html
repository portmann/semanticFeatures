Apple: Mac Increases Market Share Amidst PC Downdraft - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Research firms IDC and Gartner have reported a significant downturn in PC sales except for Apple's Mac. The data confirms my expectations for the effect of the Windows 10 upgrade program. According to preliminary data by research firms IDC and Gartner, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Mac line of personal computers continues to buck the overall decline in PC sales, increasing market share in the process. The purported slowdown in China that was supposed to be so devastating to Apple was nowhere to be seen. My key thesis concerning the free upgrade offered by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to Windows 10 was that this would tend to suppress sales of new PCs by Windows OEMs. This was finally acknowledged in IDC's press release regarding Q3 PC sales and market share: While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware. There continues to be the expectation (promoted by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), mainly) that new hardware would stimulate sales in Q4. Perhaps, but I doubt it. According to Microsoft, about 110 million have upgraded to Windows 10, leaving a huge remaining pool of users (over a billion) that haven't upgraded but could. I expect Windows 10 adoption to be rapid, and OEM sales to continue to decline. Except for Apple. Apple has had a policy of free Mac OS X upgrades for some time, and as the only vendor of Mac hardware, doesn't have to worry about the effect of the upgrade policy. The predictions of IDC and Gartner for Macs were a little closer together this quarter. Both research firms placed Apple in the number 4 position in PC sales globally, and the number 3 position in sales in the US. Gartner is predicting slight y/y unit growth of 1.5%, while IDC predicts a slight 3.4% y/y decline. This is probably in the measurement noise for both companies. Chances are that sales will be basically flat compared to calendar 2014 Q3 sales of 5.52 million units. This is not awe-inspiring performance, except in the context of the continuing implosion in PC sales, which the Win10 upgrade has effectively accelerated. According to IDC, the y/y decline in PC unit sales was 10.8%, according to Gartner, it was 7.7%. PC sales in the U.S. were basically flat y/y, the research firms agree, while Mac sales grew in the U.S., although the firms don't agree by how much. IDC says U.S. Mac sales grew by 1.6%, Gartner says they grew by 7.3%. The most significant aspect of the research reports is what they say about conditions in China as they bear on consumer spending for computers and Apple products in particular. By now, one would have expected the dire predictions of so many Apple bears regarding China to be manifest. Yet there is very little sign of a China slowdown. Gartner reports that PC sales in the Asia/Pacific region showed a 1.7 percent decline from calendar 2014 Q3. IDC wouldn't give specific numbers, but for Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) did say that Volume was close to expectations this quarter. The market was softer compared to the previous year due to currency impact on the region and clearing of channel inventory as the main priority for many countries. Some big projects were postponed, including an education project in India. The commercial market was soft and was generally supported by government projects in many countries. What was significant about the IDC statement was what they didn't say. IDC didn't say that volume was down due to an economic slowdown in China. Apple's Mac sales also don't suggest much if any headwind in China. Although flat year over year, global sales of about 5.5 million units represents a 14.7% sequential increase. Not what one would expect from a slowdown in one of Apple's most important markets. In the June quarter, China represented about 27% of Apple's total revenue, an increase of 112% from the previous year. For the first half of the year, Apple reported that Mac sales had grown y/y by greater than 30% in China. Continuing strong Mac sales indicates that China sales growth continues, although not by the blistering pace of the first half of the year. I've repeatedly urged Apple investors to take a data driven approach to Apple, rather than a rumor driven approach. I've pointed out in Why Apple Investors Shouldn't Fear China and in a follow up on Nike's (NYSE: NKE ) China earnings results that the data just wasn't there to support the idea of a recession or economic contraction in China. China's economic growth rate may well be slowing. Under the circumstances, I've expected the negative impact on Apple to be minimal, and in the form of a slowing growth rate rather than a lack of growth or outright decline. The Mac sales data appears to confirm this. Mac sales growth in China may well be slowing from the 30% y/y pace of the past two quarters, but will probably still post y/y gains in China, as well as sequential q/q gains. Although there's insufficient data to make quantitative predictions for China sales, the available data continues to support my thesis that China's economy is stable and still growing, albeit more slowly. Rather than succumbing to panic, I urge Apple investors to wait until Apple reports its fiscal Q4 results later this month, which will provide much more reliable details about China.
