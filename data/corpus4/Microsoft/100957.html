Microsoft: My Reaction To Satya Nadella's Employee Email - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sent a company-wide email to employees detailing what the companyâ€™s plans are going forward and how the company expects to return to its former position. Nadella outlined key areas of strategic focus such as business, the cloud, and creating "dual-use" customers. The good news about this letter is that it shows a much more streamlined and focused leadership under Nadella than Ballmer. Overall Iâ€™m left with a positive outlook post the letter and Iâ€™m excited to see what the next few quarters hold. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella sent a company-wide email to employees detailing what the company's plans are going forward and how the company expects to return to its former leadership position across verticals. While the email wasn't intended for the public, Geekwire obtained the email in its entirety. I recommend a full read as the email is interesting, meaningful, and if you're a Microsoft investor, it's impactful. Three Bold Ambitions: Reinvent productivity and business processes, Build the intelligent cloud platform, Create more personal computing… "Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world…We will realize our mission and strategy by investing in three interconnected and bold ambitions: Reinvent productivity and business processes, Build the intelligent cloud platform, Create more personal computing…" So this is something that I've been following for a while, and Nadella summarized and made it a focus in his email. I think it's pretty obvious that Microsoft is business focused currently and feels like that's where its definitive competitive advantage lies. I couldn't agree more with the company and with the strategy. Microsoft has been a hot topic in consulting circles and in the SMB/enterprise solution space as of late as a direct result of the leaps and bounds forward that its solution products have taken. Driving this attention and attraction has primarily been Power BI, Power BI Designer, the upcoming release of Surface Hub, and the integrations the company has executed to build out its entire productivity suite (including those with huge SMB/enterprise solution names Box (NYSE: BOX ), MailChimp, etc.). Let's not forget that Microsoft has other, secondary products like OneDrive and the suite including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint helping further the value-prop. Microsoft becoming relevant to a new generation of users and centers of influence is huge and a highly productive long-term market cap driver. It's users in and around the 25-40 age group that are either going to adopt Microsoft products or not, and it's these users that are going to decide the future of the company. This age group, the bottom 30% at least, grew up in an age of zero brand loyalty and a "what have you done for me lately" mentality, and Microsoft has done nothing but impress them and make life easier. If it can keep this up, it becomes a fixture in the conversation of where to turn to when in a solution pinch. If not, well, it stays where it is. "…we will reinvent productivity services for digital work that span all devices. We will also extend our experience footprint by building more business process experiences, integrated into content authoring and consumption, communication and collaboration tools. We will drive scale and usage by appealing to "dual-use" customers, providing productivity services that enable them to accomplish more at work and in the rest of their life activities with other people…" I believe Microsoft to have a unique and again clearly defined advantage over ancillary, umbrella product competitors Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), recently taken-private Dell, etc., in that Microsoft can dominate the workplace to a greater degree than any of its major competitors. I really believe that. I believe that if Microsoft is to grow adoption of its total product portfolio, take for example its mobile devices, that it should leverage its business capture ability. Put simply, if Microsoft can familiarize users with its operating systems and platforms at work it stands a far greater chance of seeing crossover consumer adoption. As the operating system "translation" is made less of a hurdle, which I presume creates some of the adoption friction the company is experiencing currently - I myself allowed this friction to cause me avoid Microsoft products before Power BI introducing me back into the ecosystem - adoption should increase. Higher rates of adoption stand a better chance at creating network effects and adoption loops. Of course this would be huge for Microsoft. My big takeaway right out of the gate is that Nadella is focused on the right strategy. That matters. "…all these experiences will be powered by our cloud platform - a cloud that provides our customers faster time to value, improved agility and cost reduction, and solutions that differentiate their business. We'll further provide a powerful extensibility model that is attractive to third-party developers and enterprises. This in turn enables us to attract applications to our cloud platform and attach our differentiated capabilities such as identity management, rich data management, machine learning and advanced analytics…" This was interesting in that 1) I've commented recently that I thought Microsoft wasn't going to be concerned about developing its own cloud going forward, instead preferring to quasi-"outsource" the platform and 2) that the cloud space - inclusive of anything to do with storage but also in regards to deriving value from simply having/facilitating activities via the cloud - has been/is in a race to zero and has been commoditized. To hear that Microsoft intends to make this a point of focus, although vaguely - and I'm still unsure what direction this will lead the company's efforts - is a bit puzzling, especially in light of how the letter to employees started. I'll have to wait for specifics maybe at next earnings or in future interviews that Microsoft management gives before I pass final judgment on this, but right now I'm left a bit stumped. I just don't see how doing anything outside of simply hosting platforms on the cloud can work to drive value. I think Microsoft should continue to partner with companies like Box for cloud services and take its own expenditures and resource commitments down to minimum levels. I think there are a few other ways for Microsoft to cut fat as well but those are subjects for future articles. The good news about this letter is that it shows a much more streamlined, much more focused leadership under Nadella than Ballmer. The Ballmer regime will be forever remembered for horrible acquisitions, impairments, little productivity, and helter-skelter. To see Nadella has a vision and more importantly one that makes sense is big for building confidence in the early going. It's also encouraging to see Nadella willing to make tough decisions - restructuring divisions and management was brave. Overall, I'm left with a positive outlook post the letter and I'm excited to see what the next few quarters hold.
