Why Microsoft Must Kill Off The Legacy Windows Ecosystem - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha A Windows game developer has written an editorial condemning the "walled garden" of the Windows app store. This developer would prefer to continue selling directly to consumers, rather than through Microsoft. The Windows app store is vital to the future of Windows, so Microsoft has no choice but to dismantle the legacy Windows software ecosystem. In a scathing editorial in the Guardian , Epic Games co-founder Tim Sweeney all but declared war on Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Universal Windows Platform (UWP). UWP is Microsoft's attempt to unify Windows 10 app development for all its hardware platforms under a single Windows app store. It's a "write once, deploy to many" approach that one would think would be popular with Windows developers. More importantly, UWP probably represents the only viable economic future for Windows. Clearly, Sweeney sees something a little sinister in UWP. He writes: The specific problem here is that Microsoft's shiny new "Universal Windows Platform" is locked down, and by default it's impossible to download UWP apps from the websites of publishers and developers, to install them, update them, and conduct commerce in them outside of the Windows Store. Sweeney accuses Microsoft of unfairly advantaging UWP apps with features unavailable unless developers submit to the control of the "locked down" UWP ecosystem. Microsoft hasn't abolished apps developed outside of UWP, but it clearly is trying to coax developers into using UWP rather than the older, more "open," Win32. Sweeney would like to eliminate the "walled garden," allowing developers to sell UWP apps directly to consumers, just as most PC apps have been sold. In the process, Microsoft would be unable to collect the 30% fee it charges for the Windows app store. Ironically, Sweeney points to Android as the progenitor of this new despicable business model, without ever mentioning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or iOS once. Epic Games (through its Chair Entertainment Group subsidiary) had developed one of the most successful games for iOS, Infinity Blade, in 2010. Epic games still has games and apps on the iOS app store and continues to make the Unreal Engine development kit available for game developers under iOS. But there hasn't been much new development by Epic for iOS in a while and Epic appears to be mainly focused on its Gears of War franchise, which is actually one of the few UWP games. It's likely that Epic has become more than a little disenchanted with the "walled garden" of iOS and is unhappy that Microsoft is going in the same direction. As an iOS developer, I can certainly sympathize. Developing for iOS is very challenging, and it doesn't help that each new iOS generation is accompanied by a host of poorly documented changes that pretty much guarantee your app will no longer function. But that's the limit of my sympathy. Peter Bright, in a rebuttal on Ars Technica titled, Tim Sweeney is missing the point; the PC platform needs fixing , points to all the solid technical reasons why the new UWP is an improvement on the existing Windows ecosystem. I won't belabor his technical arguments. Bright only points out what all of us (yes, that includes yours truly) Windows users already know: Windows, for all its openness, is a chaotic mess of conflicting hardware, drivers, and software. We live with this because the very openness of the ecosystem has some advantages in hardware cost, as well as the ability to customize systems. Ironically, Bright's missing the point as well as Sweeney. This isn't about the technical advantages of UWP, or even the practical benefit to developers of UWP as a simplified way to develop Windows apps. This is about the cruel economics of competition in the mobile device world. Right now, Windows isn't competing with other desktop operating systems such as Mac OS X or Linux. Right now, Microsoft is locked in a battle for survival with the other main personal computing ecosystems of Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android and Apple's iOS. I know it's an unfamiliar concept to regard the mobile device ecosystems as personal computing ecosystems, but that's what they've become. And both have comparable number of users to Windows. In turn, Microsoft is attempting to reshape Windows in the mobile device ecosystem mold through Windows 10. I pointed this out in Microsoft 'Mobilizes' The PC . This transition is more than just moving Windows to more mobile devices such as phones, tablets and 2-in-1 convertibles. The transition is also one of fundamental changes in Microsoft's business model. These changes mostly involve emulating, to a greater or lesser degree, the business models of Apple and Google. Microsoft tried to adapt the classic PC OEM licensing model to Windows phone, and almost immediately it broke down. Microsoft ended up having to give Windows phone away for free to its main partner, Nokia. With neither Apple nor Google charging consumers (or OEMs) directly for mobile operating systems or upgrades, Microsoft has had to follow suit with the free upgrade program for Win10. Even though this is supposed to be temporary, I think it's unlikely that consumers will ever pay for another Windows upgrade. Windows as a direct revenue source is probably going to become increasingly unimportant, and this leaves the Windows app store as a key revenue source from Windows going forward. Under the circumstances, the motivation for Microsoft to transition its Windows users to Windows 10 becomes self evident. Microsoft isn't getting much revenue from its legacy Windows ecosystem. Sweeney's editorial underscores the fundamental difficulty Microsoft faces in managing this transition to a modern mobile device business model. Just as Microsoft is breaking down the barriers of the old OEM model by fielding its own excellent Win10 devices, it's also breaking down the old developer model with UWP. There was bound to be friction and unhappiness on the part of Microsoft's partners, as I have noted in the case of the OEMs . I didn't anticipate this kind of blowback on the part of developers, but I should have. The Windows developers have grown accustomed to the commodity PC business model and don't want things to change. But change is coming, and neither Tim Sweeney, nor Epic Games, nor anyone else in the Windows developer community can stop it. My reservations about Microsoft mainly revolve around its ability to manage this transition. Microsoft seems to be in a "have your cake and eat it too" mode where it seems to preserve the old PC business model while simultaneously dismantling it. This is an unachievable compromise that forces Microsoft to dissemble about its true intentions. Sweeney's editorial shows that this isn't really working. Microsoft CEO Nadella needs to provide developers with more clarity on the transition that is taking place, with a roadmap, milestones and a timetable. This is the best way to ensure that as many developers are on board with the change as possible. Because of the difficulties that I've foreseen regarding this transition, I remain somewhat cautious on Microsoft, rating it a hold. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
