Investing In Yahoo Net Of Alibaba Still A Very Compelling Opportunity - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha The risk-reward for this investment has never been so favorable. Over 80% return under a favorable tax outcome, with modest upside even under a negative one. Investing purely in the Operating Business (net of both Alibaba and Yahoo Japan) can drive phenomenal returns once both are spun off (a longer term opportunity). In this article, I want to outline why the Yahoo RemainCo (or "Yahoo stub"-essentially YHOO net of its stake in BABA ) is a compelling long-term investment opportunity. To do so, I will provide a background for those unfamiliar with the situation, explain why this mispricing exists, and show that this dramatic undervaluation is unmerited. The background follows below. Yahoo initially invested in Alibaba in 2005, sold a portion of its holdings during the IPO, and currently owns a 15% stake valued at roughly $25B. Earlier in the year, it announced plans to monetize its stake as part of a tax-free spinoff and sought a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS to ensure that the spinoff would be tax-free. However, on September 8, it was revealed that the IRS had declined the company's request for a PLR. This means that the IRS is not immediately guaranteeing tax-free status - it does NOT indicate that an unfavorable tax outcome is certain. The stock has fallen precipitously and the current price reflects a fully-taxed BABA stake and a discounted value for the remaining assets the company owns. The board has recently authorized the spinoff and evidently feels that the chances for a tax-free divestiture are high. The current price offers a compelling investment opportunity in the RemainCo, which one can "create" by shorting Alibaba and going long Yahoo. This allows one to hedge exposure to BABA, secure modest upside if the BABA stake is taxed, or potentially tremendous upside if Yahoo can divest BABA tax free. I believe the chances for a tax-free divestiture are high. And given that the spinoff is expected to close in 2H15, expect this to be a very low-risk, high-reward opportunity within a relatively short timeframe. Note that it will likely take some time for the market to properly value the operating business. But the benefits of a tax free-divestiture will be realized immediately. Moreover, the full potential of this investment will be realized once Yahoo Japan is spun off as well (which is likely to occur in 2H 2016 at the earliest). I recommend shorting 0.265 BABA for every share of YHOO long to create the RemainCo at approximately $14. I think it's conservatively worth $16 per share even under a worst-case tax scenario, and $26 in a tax-free scenario. The principal reason that the market currently undervalues the RemainCo is that the BABA stake makes up a significant majority of Yahoo's value (YHOO has essentially served as a tracker stock for BABA, see image). This has caused investors to ignore YHOO's other assets. Negative news regarding YHOO's tax-free distribution on September 8th also caused panic-selling among event-driven investors. Poor performance at the operating business (search and display ads, the "OpCo") also has dampened investor enthusiasm and led to an undervaluation of the Yahoo RemainCo. It's important to recognize that this is a business with close to $6Bn in net cash and over $1Bn in expected EBITDA for 2015 (which includes 100% margin royalty revenues from Yahoo Japan). YHOO's current price also assumes zero possibility for future improvements in the operating business. There are several opportunities available to improve the operating business and stem the revenue declines (which will be discussed later). In this section, I will attempt to detail why the RemainCo is a compelling investment opportunity despite the considerable skepticism surrounding Yahoo's ability to survive as an independent company. It's very clear that the Yahoo Operating Business has been struggling, but the fast-growing "MaVeNS" (Mobile, Video, Native Advertising and Social) has offset some of the declines on the desktop-side. Revenues are showing sign of bottoming, and various sell-side analysts have projected modest growth in the quarters to come. I also believe management has several tools available to improve profitability. Adjusting its cost structure to bring EBITDA/employee closer to AOL's and a switch from Bing to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to improve its net search revenues can add over $500M in EBITDA (50% increase, see below). Despite operational difficulties, the company is forecast to realize $1.087B in EBITDA for 2016, and has close to $6B in net cash, which management has shown an inclination to direct toward share repurchases. MAVENS performance has been strong (Source: Susquehanna). Search growth is expected to stabilize, and may grow under an amended search agreement with Bing and use of Google as the principal provider. See below (Source: Morgan Stanley). Management has shown an inclination to reduce share count - I believe there is scope for considerable reduction post-spin (cash will comprise a significant portion of RemainCo's valuation) (Source: Company filings). Despite a struggling core business, YHOO has options available to create value. YHOO's search agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) terminates in October 2015. Under amended terms, Yahoo may use Google's Search capabilities (up to a potential of 75% of search revenues) and benefit from its significantly higher (over 30%) PPC. Even with a 20% premium, and additional revenues at 80% EBITDA margins, the OpCo can increase EBITDA by $385M. As prominent activists and analysts have commented, Yahoo has a bloated cost structure. In comparison to Google and AOL (NYSE: AOL ), it severely lags on Revenue/Employee and EBITDA/Employee. By simply bridging half of the gap between AOL (in terms of EBITDA/employee), Yahoo can add $160M of EBITDA, for a total additional $540M (over 50%). This translates to an additional $2.6/Share of value. I believe that management interest in focusing Yahoo's efforts and right sizing its cost-structure amid investor pressure will make this a priority. Yahoo owns a 15% stake in Alibaba Group Holding Limited as a result of its 2005 investment in the company. BABA is a holding company principally engaged in online and mobile commerce. The company provides retail and wholesale marketplaces through PC and Mobile Interfaces: including Taobao Marketplace (B2C), Tmall (C2C), Juhuasuan (group-buying, discounted sales), and AliExpress (global e-commerce). Alibaba controls over 78% of the e-commerce market in China, and has numerous other high growth assets. Increase in mobile take-rates coupled with very strong mobile growth should allow growth to continue at a healthy pace. Furthermore, the current valuation leaves substantial upside from non e-commerce assets (online payments, cloud, logistics, etc.) I feel the RemainCo is far more undervalued and low risk - our trade is thus intended to hedge exposure to BABA. However, one should recognize that this trade structure involves hedging only the taxable portion of Yahoo's Alibaba stake. As such, any upside in BABA's share price from now until the completion of the spinoff will provide an additional source of upside. I have no substantive opinion on Alibaba's value going forward, yet I note that its current price is roughly 19X adjusted 2016 EPS, net of its cash and investments. This seems to be reasonable value for a company with such tremendous growth potential. Note that Yahoo is including its small-Business Unit (ATB) within this SpinCo (for the sake of simplicity, I'm valuing it as a component of the RemainCo). I believe there is a very high probability that a tax on BABA can be avoided (evidently, so does the board, as the spinoff has been authorized). Given extensive research by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom (a highly regarded corporate law firm and the company's tax counsel), I believe the spinoff may proceed tax free. Liberty Interactive's (NASDAQ: QVCA ) spin-off of its heavily appreciated TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP ) stake (in addition to the numerous other similar spinoffs John Malone has successfully executed) shows that similar transactions have occurred in the past. Even if a spinoff of BABA is found to be taxable, I believe YHOO management has multiple options available to avoid a tax. For instance, the Yahoo OpCo can be spun off (leaving legacy YHOO as a shell for YHOO's public stakes). Sell-side analysts have proposed that Yahoo can issue preferred stock/debt collateralized by the BABA stake and distribute them. To use another Liberty technique, Yahoo could issue a tracking stock for its BABA stake or OpCo as Liberty has done for its Latin American and Caribbean businesses. The company owns 35% of Yahoo Japan, a JV between Yahoo and SoftBank Group Corporation ( OTCPK:SFTBY ). Yahoo Japan is trading within the multiple ranges of its e-commerce and Internet Media peers, although valuations are high. Performance at the e-commerce division has been strong (21.3% transaction value growth last quarter), and its payments business continues to gain users and market. As with YHOO, the company is executing well on mobile, but somewhat struggling on the desktop side of its business. The outlook on Yahoo! Japan is flat, due to valuation, but one can easily hedge against it (given that it's publicly traded). I will outline a method of investing in Yahoo, net of both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba (which is more long term - YHOO management has expressed a desire to tax-efficiently monetize this stake, but this is unlikely to occur before 2H16). This image shows the future corporate structure of Yahoo following the spin-off. The trade is intended to create an interest in the OpCo and Yahoo Japan ("RemainCo") (Source: Susquehanna). The RemainCo is valued as follows in the table below. I value the YHOO OpCo using EV/EBITDA. As a result of numerous acquisitions and investments, there are considerable non-cash charges (goodwill amortization, etc.). The company also has a significant net cash position which would not be reflected in a P/E analysis. I value YHOO OpCo at 5X - I consider the company similar in nature to a newspaper company in that its principal source of revenues (advertisements) are in decline, and there is considerable competition from large internet companies. Yahoo's internet peers (justifiably) trade at much higher valuations as they are much better businesses. As such, it would be inappropriate to use an internet company multiple. I have adopted a multiple lower than even the mean for newspaper companies for conservatism. A similar company (old-era tech company with declining businesses), AOL, was acquired at 7.7X EBITDA, and traded in the "6s" range prior. One can "create" an investment in Yahoo RemainCo at a price of $14 by shorting 0.265 BABA for every 1 YHOO long. This assumes that BABA will indeed be taxed, and leaves potential upside for a favorable tax outcome. If one is confident in a tax-free distribution, one can short 0.407 BABA for every 1 YHOO to create RemainCo for approximately $5 (this can lead to significant losses under a negative tax outcome, however, and I do not suggest it). Modest returns are still possible even under a negative tax outcome, owing to Yahoo's current undervaluation, as shown below. As one can see, substantial returns can be realized if BABA is spun-off tax free. The investment is structured to be profitable even with a tax: the upside to YHOO (approximately $9/Sh.) in the event of no tax will translate to substantial returns for RemainCo. Over the longer-term, a tax-free divestiture of Yahoo Japan can be expected to generate even greater return. Given the timeline of the BABA spinoff, this should not be expected before 2H16. Note that this trade is not intended to reflect any returns from the cash generated by the BABA short, and does not factor in shorting costs (however, given BABA's lack of a dividend, this should not be substantial). See below for a return analysis of investing in Yahoo, net of both of its Asian assets. Additionally, if the value of BABA increases (I am not anticipating this) AND a tax is avoided, the increase in value of the RemainCo will be disproportionately greater, as this trade structure hedges for a tax. I also have not modeled in additional EBITDA for the OpCo or the effects of an aggressive share repurchase - the former is something shareholders will undoubtedly pressure management to pursue and the latter is very likely to be on management's agenda for creating value. The thesis principally relies on a favorable tax outcome to generate returns. But evidently, there are numerous additional opportunities for return.
