Microsoft: 3 Takeaways From The Citi Global Tech Conference - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha MSFT EVP and CMO Chris Capossela presented at the Citi Global Technology Conference. Capossela gave some very candid and very powerful commentary as to the near-term strategic focuses of Microsoft and the overall direction of the company. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) EVP and Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela recently presented at the Citi Global Technology conference. Capossela, who's a growing more important figure at Microsoft thanks in no small part to CEO Satya Nadella's strategic initiative to reshape the company image and messaging, touched on several marquee areas of wonder in what was hosted as a very fireside chat-like presentation. The following are my key takeaways. "We care about things like your - what kind of browser are you using, what is our share of our browser versus Google's browser versus Firefox…that's more queries being executed through Bing, that's more ad revenues flowing through Edge and that's obviously the revenue source for us independent of the Windows device. I should not say independent, I should say post fail of the Windows device, clearly shows another big one…so we've invested heavily in Cortana which is a personal digital assistant that's built into Windows 10 and she can help you do all sorts of different things, look up information, remind you of things, finds things for you. And as you use Cortana, you are not using the Bing or the Google query engine you were probably using 15 minutes ago…and the more people fall in love with Cortana and use Cortana, the more we're able to essentially capture that query share from Google." This is a new product so I wouldn't have expected this to be a huge focus for the company prior but I was caught off guard when hearing Capossela stress the importance and the focus Microsoft will have on Edge going forward. I actually think that Edge is a very nice Google Chrome (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) comp. It might even be a slight improvement but my guess is it will take years of proving out its value-prop for Edge to take real market share from Chrome and I understand the investment in the browser by Microsoft but this is a bold initiative. Chrome, with it having over one billion users, is the 800-pound gorilla incumbent. Trying to unseat Chrome won't be easy and it likely won't be cheap. Regarding one possible spend item tethered to the unseating of Chrome, Cortana might have been developed primarily with this endeavor in mind when assessing Cortana's capacity as a layover onto Edge. I never would have thought about that prior to this conference. It makes sense though, thinking that Cortana is an Edge-first developed tech in that Microsoft has no real competitive phone capacity (where personal assistants are largely being deployed) and that Microsoft has been hugely focused on winning the desktop/tablet since Nadella took the head spot. I'm shocked by this. I'm intrigued. But mostly I'm just impressed. The Nadella regime is going all-in on winning the desktop and winning the productivity use case. Expect this to be a huge narrative focus for Microsoft going forward. Post-Windows Device Fail, A Return To Mobile? "We're also going to build phones for businesses. We know business customers want a very, very secure phone that's incredibly good at calendar management, at e-mail, at productivity, at Skype for business etc. and so we think those two segments are segments we can focus on and build a much, much better solution and much better business than we have today…I think we have too much to do in front of us right now to get back in the game with the two audiences that we think we can serve incredibly well and then we'll see how things evolve and we'll take it kind of one step at a time, but obviously we want to be in the phone space." Fresh off a huge impairment and off the multi-year embarrassment that was "the mobile effort" to hear that Microsoft eventually wants back in isn't surprising but it is somewhat surprising to hear that the company is making a clean break from the space. This just isn't going to be a focus for the company and you know what? That's just fine if you ask me. I'm actually encouraged to hear the issue put to bed. Microsoft should continue to do what Nadella has it doing, focusing on winning what it's good at. Sticking to hitting the ball down the middle of the fairway and hitting the short lay up onto the green rather than trying to hit onto the green with one shot. What I also took from this dense passage was that Microsoft and the company has evidenced this with its recent partnering and deep integration with Box (NYSE: BOX ) - this greatly values security. Box, with its EKM and governance product rollouts, is the leader in the cloud collaboration and cloud storage niche. Box also happens to be getting cheaper by the day. Of everything outlined by Caposella the only thing that Microsoft doesn't provide per se is the securing of everything via its cloud (let's not have the OneDrive discussion here because Box simply does it better). And how convenient would it be to just add that service as a layover via M&A? I've opined this makes a bunch of sense before but hearing Caposella lead with security isn't something that isn't productive to my Box/Microsoft M&A thesis. Right now, by all indications, it appears that Microsoft is content to simply lean into Box's services but my guess continues to be that if Box gets "cheap" enough, Microsoft would step in and take it out. I'll be closely watching Microsoft's M&A efforts from a roll-up standpoint (much smaller M&A) to see if they leave any breadcrumbs for what could be a bigger push. "…so you know we have Skype, the consumer Skype business which essentially is a free model and then we monetize on the enterprise side with Skype for Business and there you're essentially paying for all the IP value that consumers really don't care about, but then enterprises care a lot about. So that might be quality of service, that might be audit ability, log ability, discovery, obviously security, those types of things. When you think about the Skype for Business category, you are really talking about corporate instant messaging, audio conferencing, video conferencing, remote meetings, real-time collaboration. It's all of those spaces sort of blended into one tool set…and so for us, there is just a huge opportunity for an IP-based solution that a company can use with their existing hardware…they are only to bring in new devices as literally laptops, tablets, phones that can run all of this tech and yet they can make their employees far, far more productive than they are today and frankly unplug a lot of the legacy infrastructure that they have... I mean I think we all still have that experience of starting a conference call and taking a long time for everybody to get going. We think it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get one of these meetings sort of up and running which is just pathetic, particularly when you add a third party and when it is not someone working just in your company and so it is just a lot of upside to making that experience reinventing that and making it far, far better and that's how we think of it." Ok, I know that's a big passage but I think all of it is important. I also think being a realist about what Microsoft is trying to do here matters as well. I'll try to break this out while now waving the pom-poms. First, I find it incredibly refreshing that Microsoft is taking on big challenges. This is a big one - the remote corporate meeting problem. But, it's also highly competitive. Plenty of capable, well-marketed public and private competitors also are trying to capture this market and some are doing a fairly decent job of this. That said, nobody is executing on a level where it wouldn't make sense to at least hear a pitch from somebody else. Microsoft took on Skype with big eyes and high ambition but no real deployment use case that made sense in it's at the time Frankenstein's Monster of a product portfolio and company model. Now, with its focus on productivity and on securing enterprise business how smart does that Skype purchase look? How perfectly does Skype, with its near-open architecture for usage, fit into the total productivity suite for SMB/enterprises? We now have the greater Office productivity suite, we have the ancillary additives like Power BI and Desktop, and finally we have specific use-case additions like Skype. Microsoft, if it can drive adoption of Skype or provide some ecosystem benefit for using Skype, has a closed loop productivity ecosystem that is all inclusive. That matters. It really matters to huge enterprises that want one singular provider of technology and enterprise solutions. It also really matters to that mid-range SMB market that's growing quickly and not simply selecting a productivity provider based on the now but on the "who is big enough to service us when we're double this size in 18 months?" That's Microsoft. If Microsoft can find a marquee item outside of its Office productivity suite, something that's the final "yeah but Microsoft also does this for me" item, I just think that its SMB/enterprise pack is going to be really, really hard to pass up. That's viewing the suite and the ecosystem as-is, in real-time. That's not giving Microsoft any credit for integrating Cortana into Skype or to Dynamics or to anything. That's as of right now and right now only. My guess is that Cortana wasn't developed and wasn't invested in to only be deployed at minimal scale. So just factor that into any personal assessments. I think Skype is going to be a major, major mover for Microsoft in the immediate term. I'm also going to be watching Microsoft's roll up acquisitions for anything that hints at helping along Skype/Cortana integration or Skype/Cortana use case expansion. I continue to really like the new Microsoft. I think that the company is doing all the right things and saying all the right things to rebuild market confidence that was lost the greater part of the last five years. That doesn't mean Microsoft will execute or imply that Microsoft will see any level of success, but boy is it a start. I think the next 12-18 months at Microsoft are going to be incredibly important in determining the company's place in broader tech and its long-term viability. While this was just one conference, I really like what Microsoft has going on right now. I continue to recommend a long position in Microsoft. Good luck everybody.
