Amazon.com: Bill Miller - Please Pass Me Another Glass Of Kool-Aid - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Bill Miller appeared on CNBC on October 14, 2015, and said AWS is worth $80 billion. Bill Miller said Amazon has no competition and will easily be worth $500 billion one day. I think Mr. Miller has had too many glasses of Kool-Aid and should open up a stand. After buying 50 cups consumers can earn one share of Amazon. On October 14, 2015, the great Bill Miller appeared on CNBC . During his interview the topic of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was raised for discussion. Anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Mr. Miller to explain how he valued AMZN. Although, I included the hyperlink to the video above, I will paraphrase Mr. Miller comments. Mr. Miller said that when AMZN came public (I checked the precise date and it was May 16, 1997) it then had a $400 million valuation. Today the valuation is $250 billion. He said since it came public, AMZN has hardly sold any shares. This implies that there has been no dilution. Well that isn't exactly true as Amazon split its stock three times during the late 1990s, so I took a snapshot of AMZN's share count on January 27, 2003 (from its 10-K). Fast forward to June 30, 2015, and lo and behold there are 476 million fully diluted shares. So technically, Mr. Miller is right that AMZN hasn't diluted equity holders by issuing shares in a large secondary offering. But it has diluted share holders through the issuance of stock options. 88 million shares is nothing to sneeze at. So, I don't get Mr. Miller's point here. Also, Mr. Bezos has a huge stake so he doesn't want to dilute his ownership percentage. Moving along, Mr. Miller then goes on to compare AMZN to John Malone's TCI and he spouts off that original shareholders who invested with John Malone made 900X their money and TCI never made a profit. I think this is another disingenuous and hyperbolic comment as media companies are valued on EBITDA and there's also huge upfront capex and therefore D&A that runs through the income statement. I highly doubt TCI generated a 900X for investors without generating free cash flow at some point. Next he says GAAP earnings don't matter and that AMZN has no competition as far as the eye can see. When pressed for a specific valuation he said the following: AWS is now a $8 billion business. It's growing revenues at a 80% to 100% clip and it deserves a 10X sales multiple given its lead over Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). He also said the president of AWS stated that revenues could reach $90 billion or equal to the size of AMZN's current day web business revenues. Finally, he said AMZN is worth more. Andrew says how much more. Bill Miller said easily $500 billion. So there we have from Bill Miller's mouth to God's ears. Refinance your house and bet it all on Amazon as surely it will "easily be a $500 billion" company and you will get rich as a shareholder. As Navy saying goes - loose lips sink ships. Perhaps, Mr. Miller just rang the bell at the top. Let's spend some time on AMZN's valuation. Amazon's enterprise value as of Friday was as follows. 476 million fully diluted shares x $571 = $271.8 billion, plus $3 billion of net debt, so let's round up to $275 billion. Forget the fact that Amazon is trading at upwards of 27X this year's cash flows from operations. Let's look at how other companies are valued by the market. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), arguably the most dominant and important software company of the old world, sports an enterprise value of $146.7 billion. Now let's think about Bill Miller's comment that Amazon has no competition. Check out this article from San Jose Mercury News written October 17, 2015, discussing "The Cloud." Here's an important excerpt from the article "Oracle, HP, Cisco embrace the cloud." Wait a second, the great Bill Miller said Amazon has no competition. Well, I guess Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Oracle ( ORCL ) and HP don't count. Then there's Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that already has a cloud business and sports a $378 billion market capitalization. Oh yes, and MSFT has $65 billion in net cash. I guess Bill Miller doesn't see Google, Microsoft, Oracle or Cisco as credible threats. So we see that CRM is resting at a 52-week high and its market cap is $51.6 billion. Let's look at how the market is valuing CRM on a sophisticated multiple to sales, the way Mr. Miller thinks. Hmm...Salesforce.com is trading at 8X revenue not the 10X Mr. Miller suggested. Salesforce.com is a pure play vehicle too. Perhaps, AWS is only really worth 8X? So if we split hairs and drink some more Kool-Aid and concede the point that AWS is valuable, let's value it at $65 billion to split the difference (what's $15 billion between friends). This leaves Amazon's web business and its prime membership. So the market is then valuing this set of businesses at $210 billion, if we agree on the $65 billion figure (which I don't but will play along with for now). Source: Amazon.com FY15 6/30/15 10-Q As we can see Amazon is very granular in how it breaks out its sales (NOT!) as there is media and the catch all electronics and general merchandise (and of course Prime that creates the positive feedback loop). Alternatively, for $210 billion, I could do the following. I could pay a buyout premium for the following three businesses and vertically integrate them. So, I'll pay $55 billion for FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), $15 billion for Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), and $30 billion enterprise value for Macy's (NYSE: M ). I would then have $110 billion to spare. With the extra $110 billion, I could buy other businesses that specialize in other categories. I'm half kidding, but trying to establish a point here. Concluding Thoughts: Anyway you slice it, an investor needs to be five or six cups of Kool-Aid deep in order to comprehend Amazon's valuation. Perhaps, Mr. Bezos is the world's greatest salesman because investors, led by Bill Miller, are coming up with utterly fantastic ways to justify Amazon's valuation. Lastly, I love how die hard capitalists simply dismiss the NYT's August piece about Amazon's back stabbing culture. This is will end in tears, I just can't tell you will any precise when the music will stop. P.S. Here is a good article from the The Atlantic for people to understand Amazon's AWS business.
