Microsoft beats Wall Street view on high demand for cloud products | Reuters Shoppers stand in line to wait for the grand opening of a flagship Microsoft Corp. retail store in New York, October 26, 2015. Microsoft Corp reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat analysts' expectations, driven by aggressive cost cutting and growing demand for its cloud products and services. Microsoft, under Chief Executive Satya Nadella, has been focusing on cloud services and mobile applications as growth slows in its traditional software business. The cloud, in which growing numbers of companies move much of their information technology off premises, proved a bright spot for the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant. Up to Thursday's close of $52.05, Microsoft's stock had climbed more than 26 percent in the past 12 months as investors showed their confidence in Nadella's growth strategy. The shares rose 5.3 percent in after-hours trading. Revenue from the company's increasingly important "Intelligent Cloud" business, which includes products such as servers and platforms such as Azure cloud infrastructure and services, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. The company's combined cloud business was on track for $9.4 billion in annual revenue, the company said, up 15 percent from the $8.2 billion revenue it estimated last quarter. "They nailed the cloud," said Matt Howard, a venture capitalist at Norwest Ventures who monitors Microsoft closely. Total revenue, however, fell 10.1 percent to $23.80 billion, squeezed by a strong dollar as well as a weak personal computer market that has reduced demand for Microsoft's Windows operating system. On an adjusted basis, revenue fell to $25.69 billion but beat analysts' estimates. Revenue in the business that includes Windows fell 5 percent to $12.7 billion. Windows revenue closely tracks sales of personal computers,  which fell 10.6 percent globally in the December quarter from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. IDC said business should improve later this year as companies that had delayed replacing machines before upgrading to Windows 10 make the switch. Windows 10 was released last year. Microsoft generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States, so is susceptible to big shifts in exchange rates. The average value of the dollar, as measured against a basket of major currencies, was 11.7 percent higher in the last quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter of 2014. The company's net income fell to $5 billion, or 62 cents per share, in its second-quarter ended Dec. 31 from $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. ( bit.ly/1PIRXEs ) Analysts on average had expected a profit of 71 cents per share and revenue of $25.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
