The Royal Canadian Mint just published its Q1 2016 Report, and the silver bullion coin sales figures were stunning to say the least Congressman Brady was smiling, waving, and making his escape to a  waiting vehicle.  One of our children shouted, "Dad!  He's getting away!"  Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

Job-cut program to be in place by end of June Co. employs about 3,500 staff in Germany Wed, 05/25/2016 - 10:15 | 7604016 Save_America1st When I started at my current  job I supervised 19 men who corrected the images for the News Paper,  did the pagination, output the film, and burned the metal plates for the  pressroom. Since then, we created a script that corrects the  images.  It does a lousy job, but it replaced 5 men.  Then we automated  the pagination, another 3 jobs gone.  Then we purchased two Kodak  digital Metal Plate imagers.  This eliminated the need for film and  nearly the entire prepress department. 16 positions are gone.  It  now takes 3 people to do the work 19 did.  What's worse is, IT is now  done remotely and the three IT guys left on sight, we use to call them  the Maytag men, are now the three who run the plate imagers, while on  call for tech issues.  Lets just say, they're not happy with their  extended duties.... These were middle class income skilled  craftsmen who are now mostly without a job, the uncounted masses that  make up the bulk of those who've dropped out of America's industrial  work force.  These are the folks who the young services industry  workers, making 12 bucks an hour, are replacing. It's not just  burger flippers loosing their jobs to robots.  Automation is trimming  the work force at a pace the US economy can't sustain, mostly because  the jobs it replaces are not just low payed services jobs, but well  payed positions last held by the dying blue collar middle class! Wed, 05/25/2016 - 10:52 | 7604271 markitect I own an Architecture & Engineering firm that does small commercial, industrial and residential both multi family and single family.  15 years ago to complete the volume of work we can do now took 10 people.  We needed a full time specification writer and product researcher, multiple draftsmen, project manager, principle salesman, book keeper and Secretary, head designer and engineer.  Now its my partner and I, doing all the sales and product research as well as engineering and design.  We model a lot of our work now, no draftsmen any more - heck we dont even "draw" anymore.  We have one kick ass architect / engineer who can model a building by himself that used to take 3 people.  We all work more for less, the fees just arent there to support the overhead of the past office arrangement but this has all been made possible by the software.  It's just eliminated a ton of jobs and those savings went to the clients not our bottom line.  Thats deflation in my book.

What draws these H-1B "folks" isn't pay, it's subsequent citizenship for them, instant citizenship for their newborns and later citizenship for their elderly parents and extended family. If the Big Tech oligarchs had to pay every cost associated with the H-1B and his extended family in the US the Tech oligarchs wouldn't be firing Americans and hiring H-1Bs.

Wed, 05/25/2016 - 11:15 | 7604416 markitect I cant speak for printing but yes, in my business most of that efficiency goes towards lowering my price to stay competitive to get work.  Its a race to the bottom.  Like the printer said, the technology doesnt necessarily mean a better product, in our case its passable, but it saves time, labor and overhead.  Im sure the gains passed on to the customer are also neutralized as they get squeezed some other way like higher taxes, regulations or "efficiencies" causing them too to lower profits.

Soon it turns into an infestation of Indians, like cockroaches. Watched this happen at multiple Fortune 500 tech companies. So if you don't agree, you are blind to the truth and therefore can fuck off. Wed, 05/25/2016 - 11:59 | 7604647 NurseRatched Microsoft has Americans working in Finland?  Really? It looks like the rest of the world is getting thumped by these layoffs.  The American firings ought to be limited to the executives who thought it was a bright idea to buy Nokia's handset division.

They can "offer" citizenship to Patel and his family while not paying for it, but it has zero economic value to you because you already have citizenship. Ironically, Patel's citizen children will do as poorly with Big Tech as the US citizen their H-1B father displaced. New crops of the easily exploited, hungry for US citizenship, will be available and Patel's kids will be living in his basement.

America is still trying to soak up as much talent from all over the world. US will bound back from the crash faster becuase the constitution will be the only law of the land (not including local laws) and on the backs of foreign talent.
