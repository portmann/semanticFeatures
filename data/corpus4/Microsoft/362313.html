Yahoo could be sitting on $4B 'patent goldmine,' says NY Post - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Apr  7 2016, 13:05 ET | By: Brian Pacampara, CFA , SA News Editor Citing intellectual property experts, Yahoo ( YHOO -1.6%) could receive between $3B-$4B just from the sale of its patent portfolio, reports NY Post. “Yahoo has a lot of fantastic patents that can be used on the enterprise side. There are Yahoo patents that cover Yahoo business, but there’s a lot more that cover businesses they’re not in,” says one expert who has valued the portfolio. So far, no bidders have expressed interest to buy just the patent portfolio, but rivals including Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon and LinkedIn, have been following the process closely. Yahoo should consider a name change like Google/alphabet. It has a large number of 'eyes on' so it is not a hopeless situation. If they can repackage Jello which is not really that great, why not repackage Yahoo which has major plus factors. 'Could" is a dangerous word. Brokers love it, though. Gets the herd up and grazing. I always wonder if brokerages are paying journalists to use that word. 'Could" is a dangerous word. Brokers love it, though. Gets the herd up and grazing.
