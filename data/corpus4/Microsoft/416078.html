Buy Amazon At 298 P/E Or Get 5% Dividend At 12 P/E? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Retail stocks have taken a beating since the first of the year. Many financially solid retail companies are paying 5% plus dividends. Brick-and-mortar stores are not going the way of the buggy whip. As the new millennial world turns toward theoretical total Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) domination, the real world continues to have shoppers shopping. Retail businesses that have survived for decades against cut-throat competition are not going to roll over and give all their business to Amazon. Au contraire. Retailers are responding to Amazon (and others) by lowering prices, offering free delivery and making returns easier and easier. Plus they are upgrading their websites to be more "Amazon" like. Contrary to what Jeff Bezos thinks, none of this is rocket science. It's a down-in-the-gutter knife fight and do not underestimate the guys who have the sharpest knives. What this means is there is a ripe opportunity approaching to buy solid, financially strong retailers who have dividends above 5% and who will more than hold their own against Amazon and its ilk going forward. The end of traditional retail is not only not near at hand, it is not in sight. In this article, I outline the top retail stocks paying more than a 5% dividend. As you can see by the chart below, retail spending has been going up pretty consistently for at least the last four years. So the problem is not the consumer. However, the department store portion of retail sales has been going down. And the e-commerce portion of retail sales has been going up although it still represents a rather small share of total sales up only about 3% since 2011. If you look at Amazon's latest 10-Q on page 21 you can see net sales not including AWS (Amazon Web Services) was $26.5 billion and profit was $467 million or about 1.8%. AWS kicked the most at $604 million. And though you could argue that AWS services to retail customers is a retail sale, it is a kind of sale that does not compete with brick and mortar retailers. In reality, AWS competes with cloud companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ). Because retail is so seasonal, you need to look at trailing 12 months figures to get apples-to-apples comparisons. As you can see in the following chart, Amazon's financial metrics are so out of whack compared to the five high-dividend retail stocks, I chose that one would have to be a true believer to think Amazon is the best choice going forward. So you can buy Amazon, a stock with no dividend, no stock buybacks and a P/E of almost 300 or you can buy a basket of stocks with an average dividend over 5%, buybacks in place and an average P/E of 12. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) is a good example of comeback retailers. In 2012, Best Buy looked like it was on the ropes. Competitor Circuit City had bit the dust a few years earlier and many thought BBY was next, a lumbering $50 billion company that could not compete with all the new online electronics resellers especially Amazon. Best Buy hired a new CEO, revamped their stores, and enhanced their customer service policies to attract and keep new customers. Well, they not only survived, they thrived going from a $1 billion loss in 2012 to a combined $2 billion profit in 2014 and 2015. Yes, their sales shrank from $50 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2015 but by eliminating marginal items they increased their profits significantly. From a close of $11.29 on Dec. 28th, 2012, they soared to a high of $44.33 on Nov. 11th, 2013. They never cut or dropped their dividend and in fact paid special dividend of $0.50 in both 2015 and 2016. Current dividend rate of 92 cents is up 35% since the gloomy days of 2012. If you add the special dividend, Best Buy's dividend rate jumps to 4.5%. So yes, you can make a lot of money (while collecting your dividend) by buying high-quality retail stocks when they are beaten down. About the same time BBY was at its low, Amazon was at $250. I had a great urge to short AMZN feeling it was in never-never land and was due to drop precipitously. Fortunately, for my wallet, I resisted that urge and went back to more mundane stock picking that involved somewhat logical pricing schemes. The idea that it would be over $700 less than four years later never entered my mind. Jeff Bezos says his rocket ship can go to the moon and maybe his stock can too, but odds are against it. Amazon has a history of good quarters and bad quarters with an inconsistency in profits that has to be frustrating even to the most ardent AMZN bulls. And although AWS has added a new dimension, it is the retail component that really hasn't changed much. And the old retailers have a chance to learn good lessons from AMZN especially in the areas of customer service and online selling skills. Those skills are not rocket science and Best Buy has proven that you can learn how to compete with the online retailers if you apply good management techniques. The retailers I chose to compare to Amazon namely Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ), GAP (NYSE: GPS ), Best Buy, Pier 1 (NYSE: PIR ) and Guess? (NYSE: GES ) all have experienced management, continuing profits, stock buybacks and an average dividend of over 5%. If you are patient and willing to sit back and collect what I think are safe dividends you could benefit from significant price appreciation over the next year or two. As for Amazon's price, I do not even know what to say. I was wrong before and maybe the price is going to 2,000 but it seems to me the other high quality retailers offer safe odds and a good return while you wait.
