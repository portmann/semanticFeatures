Despite saying it wouldn’t treat business customers the same way, Microsoft has changed its mind and now says it’ll be nudging those users to make the switch as well. Microsoft has been pushing its free update to Windows 10 on consumers with things like automated downloads and pop-up notifications, and now it’s changing how it will approach business PC customers who have yet to upgrade. â€œSmall businesses and organizations will soon be able to receive notifications about the upgrade and then directly upgrade to Windows 10,â€? explained Matt Barlow, Microsoftâ€™s general manager of business group marketing, in a post on Microsoft’s TechNet blog. Previously, Microsoft said it wouldn’t push business customers in the same way, as many companies could have critical legacy software and hardware that could run into compatibility problems, notes ComputerWorld . One big difference between how Microsoft nags business and regular customers? Companies will have the ability to block Windows 10 upgrade notifications, an option consumers running “home” versions of Windows 7 and 8 don’t have.
