Microsoft Makes Good On Plan To Push Windows 10 Upgrades More Aggressively â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

Click to print (Opens in new window) Last October, Microsoft told Windows 7 and 8 users that it was only a matter of time before they’d be pushed a bit more aggressively to upgrade to Windows 10 . That time is now, as the company will be recategorizing Windows 19 as a “recommended update.” That means that the Windows Update system will download and start the upgrade process automatically on thousands of machines. At that point, you’ll still have a choice as to whether you upgrade or not. You can opt out of future notices to update as well. “As we shared in late October on the Windows Blog, we are committed to making it easy for our Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 customers to upgrade to Windows 10,” a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to The Verge . “We updated the upgrade experience today to help our customers, who previously reserved their upgrade, schedule a time for their upgrade to take place.” The Windows 10 upgrade is free for Windows 7 and 8 users through July 29, 2016. After that, it’s anyone’s guess if or how much Microsoft will charge.
