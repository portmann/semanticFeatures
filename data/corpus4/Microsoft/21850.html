Here's Why Intel Could Sell 30 Million Smartphone Processors - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel beat its 40 million tablet application processor sales target in 2014. Intel can also sell 30 or 40 million smartphone processors this year. ASUSTeK could help Intel sell 30 million or more smartphone processors this year. The release of Windows 10 could increase adoption of the Atom X3 SoC among budget smartphone vendors. The mobile chips division of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) may still suffer operating losses well beyond this year. However, I appreciate the recent announcement that ASUSTeK ( OTC:ASUUY ) expects to ship 30 million smartphones in 2015. This is almost double the original 16 million estimate that ASUSTeK made last year. This is a very important tailwind for INTC investors. Intel is the exclusive supplier of smartphone application processors for Asus smartphones. ASUSTeK expects the affordable ZenFone 2 premium Android phone to be successful in China. Asus has already shipped out 10 million smartphones this first three months of 2015. Jonney Shih, Chairman of ASUSTeK, predicted that the China market could help his company ship out 10 million more. The Intel-powered $280 ZenFone 2 was introduced to China, Taiwan, and France last month. Asus plans to offer this affordable high-end phone to customers in India, United States, Hong Kong, Russia, Singapore, Japan, and Indonesia starting this month. The 4GB RAM-equipped ZenFone 2 is cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi4 , OnePLus One , and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Nexus 6 high-end phones. I therefore expect the Intel-powered ZenFone 2 to attract millions of price-sensitive customers in China, India, Russia, and Indonesia. If Shih is confident that China could deliver 10 million smartphones for ASUSTeK this year, I am also confident that India, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States could also help Asus ship out 10 million more smartphones. The emerging countries are the new growth drivers for smartphone sales. The $280 Intel-powered ZenFone 2 is perfectly priced to win the middle class and semi-affluent consumers in India, China, and Indonesia. According to GfK Asia, India will be the top country with the best growth potential in smartphones. The ZenFone 2 has already received 1 million pre-orders in China. Yes, Xiaomi is likely to continue to rule the high-end Android smartphone sales in China. However, unless Xiaomi can lower the $360 price tag of the Mi4, the ZenFone 2 could seriously hurt the sales of Xiaomi's flagship phone in India and Indonesia. The $80 price disparity between and Mi4 and the ZenFone 2 is already huge savings for people in emerging countries. Even a smart American would also appreciate the $80 discount. ASUSTeK would probably increase production of the ZenFone 2 when it finds out that Chinese Aliexpress resellers are selling the $280 ZenFone 2 for $440 to customers like me located in countries where the ZenFone 2 is not yet available. The ZenFone 2 will only get launched in the Philippines on May 10. My point is that Intel smartphone chips are finding their way in higher-margin smartphones that are turning out to be a commercial success. Consequently, any contra revenue on ASUSTeK's exclusive use of Atom SoCs might be minimal. My 30 million estimate for Intel smartphone application processors this year is already realistic with ASUSTeK's own 30 million smartphone shipment estimate for 2015. There will be other OEMs that will use the new Atom X3 SoC for their budget Android smartphones. Intel's partnership with Rockchip and investment in Spreadtrum could help Chinese white-box smartphone vendors to shift from ARM to x86 mobile SoCs. Unlike ARM-based SoCs from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek, x86 processors could flawlessly run Windows OS and PC software/games. The overhead savings of using an x86 chip that works with all operating systems is pretty obvious. ASUSTeK could easily create a Windows 10 version of the ZenFone 2 Android 5.0 smartphone without having to negotiate with Qualcomm. The aggressive pricing strategy of ASUSTeK is a long-term tailwind for Intel. The success of the ZenFone 2 proves that Intel has finally found the path toward success in smartphone application processors. The issue of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) allowing Windows 10 to run in ARM-based Android smartphones is NOT a deal breaker for Atom smartphone processors. Unless other software giants like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), and Autodesk port their x86-exclusive software to work on ARM architecture, the Windows 10-on-ARM proposition is still very limited. Chinese smartphone vendors in Shenzhen will still want an Atom X3 LTE-enabled SoC so they can save money. They can use one x86 processor to create two smartphone versions, or even create a dual-boot Windows/android smartphone. Chinese tech giant Huawei already made it clear last year that it is willing to sell dual-OS smartphones. The 64-bit Intel Atom X3 could have the same energy efficiency of ARM-based Qualcomm or MediaTek SoCs. It can run Windows 10, Android, Linux, or any other operating systems and their respective apps. The Atom X3 family is priced reasonably so that OEMs can use them even on sub-$75 Android or Windows smartphones. Qualcomm's latest entry-level SoC, the Snapdragon 210 is not yet 64-bit . The Rockchip-designed quad-core Atom X3-C3230RK (plus 4GB of RAM) is perfect for $150 Windows 10 or Android smartphones. The upcoming ZenFone 3 might just use an Atom X3 . Xiaomi's new budget or premium smartphone might just come with an Atom X3. Lenovo's ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) next Windows 10 smartphone might just use an Atom X3. The enterprise-centric Lenovo P90 smartphone already uses the older 64-bit Atom Z3560 . If Intel was able to sell 46 million tablet SoCs last year, there's a strong chance that it can also sell at least 30 million smartphone processors this year. Smartphone sales are far higher than tablets. Intel is now the No.2 supplier of tablet application processors. I look forward to Intel also becoming the No.2 smartphone SoC vendor. In spite of the obvious contra revenue operating losses on mobile chips, 11 expert analysts still endorses a Buy for INTC. The contra revenue is a hammer that hurts Qualcomm and MediaTek - they are losing OEM clients to Intel's cheap, multi-OS, 4GB RAM-capable Atom processors. Intel is a consistent winner for the last 10 years. Buy INTC if you want a safe-as-gold investment. In spite of the 9-figure annual operating losses on mobile, Intel is still rich enough it wants to buy Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) for around $13 billion .
