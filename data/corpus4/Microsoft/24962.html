ETF Hub Apr 11 2015, 19:04 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Following an NYT column featuring remarks from exec Bill Hilf that that were taken to suggest HP (NYSE: HPQ ) is exiting the public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, HP has told CRN it remains committed to the space. However, the IT giant adds (echoing Hilf's remarks) it's "not competing head-to-head with the big public cloud players," such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). HP's comments follow the February departure of top cloud exec Marten Mickos (joined via the Eucalyptus acquisition ), and the splitting of his responsibilities between Hilf and two other execs. The company entered the public cloud market in 2012, and (like many other enterprise IT firms) has been a backer of the OpenStack IaaS platform (pitched as an open-source alternative to Amazon/Google/Microsoft's proprietary offerings). HP asserts it has the largest OpenStack public cloud in existence. HP's stance arguably highlights the challenges traditional enterprise IT names face in countering the cost and scale advantages possessed by IaaS market leaders, who have often eschewed the hardware of IT giants in favor of cheap white-label hardware produced by Asian contract manufacturers. HP has partnered with Taiwan's Foxconnn and Accton to offer white-box gear for cloud providers. Synergy Research estimates the broader "cloud infrastructure service" market (covers IaaS and PaaS, as well as private and hybrid clouds) grew 48% in 2014 to $16B, as more on-premise workloads get migrated to cloud environments and various cloud service providers relying on IaaS/PaaS infrastructures see rapid growth. Amazon towered over the space with a near-30% share, close to 3x that of #2 Microsoft. IBM , Google, and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) rounded out the top 5. It's a lot easier to sell something to others if you first make and use it for your own livelihood and profits.  Amazon, Google and Microsoft have that advantage.  Microsoft has the further advantage that most of their enterprise stack is used by most enterprises in building private clouds thus making hybrid and public use second nature.  Amazon and Google have to license Microsoft's products to supply such capabilities to enterprise customers. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
