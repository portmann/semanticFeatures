While those videos can be fun for you to watch, theyâ€™re often part of a longer video that was posted somewhere else first. And the creators behind them donâ€™t enjoy seeing them repurposed by someone else.Â  In fact, these video makers say the pirating taking place on Facebook costs them hundreds of dollars and the social network isnâ€™t doing enough to protect them or their work, the Wall Street Journal reports. While creators say theyâ€™ve bombarded Facebook with requests to take down the so-called â€œfreebootingâ€? videos they claim infringe on their work, itâ€™s a constant back-and-forth to protect their videos. â€œI have become so jaded by it and exhausted by it,â€? the creator of a science experiment says of his attempts to get the social network to remove clips posted without his permission. â€œItâ€™s a bit like your house is being robbed and youâ€™re on holiday. Youâ€™d almost wish you didnâ€™t know so you could enjoy your holiday.â€? Another YouTube creator says he spend 36 hours crafting â€œtake downâ€? requests to companies, including Facebook, after posting a snowboarding video that he claims was freebooted at least 200 times. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, video creators must flag infringing content to companies â€” like Facebook â€” which are then required to respond. The trouble, creators says, is that these requests to Facebook often take hours or days to be addressed. While that might not seem like a long period of time,Â in the era of fleeting attention and viral videos, hours can seemÂ like a lifetime. The WSJ reports that Facebook has elevated its anti-freebooting efforts by testing new rights-management technology, partnering with video content makers, and using third-party technology that â€œlistensâ€? to videos uploaded to the site and checks for matches in a database. Additionally, the company has expanded the team that responds to â€œtake downâ€? requests, and is now removing pages or profiles that repeatedly upload pirated content. â€œFeedback from our partners is essential to creating a robust solution that fits their needs, and weâ€™re committed to providing a comprehensive video management system,â€? a Facebook spokeswoman said. The rights-management technology, which is still under development, has hit a few snags, according to the WSJ.Â At first the system wasnâ€™t able to detect a match if a user recorded a show with a mobile phone and uploaded it to the social network site. Video creators see Facebookâ€™s progress as a â€œgood-faith effort,â€? but itâ€™s not quite fast enough and continues to cut into revenue. â€œWhy would anyone go to YouTube at all if theyâ€™re getting their fill of great videos in their Facebook feed with no idea of where that came from?â€?
