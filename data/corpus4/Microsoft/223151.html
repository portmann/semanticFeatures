Intel's Skylake Solution Overwhelms AMD's Carrizo APUs - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha New Excavator/Carrizo APUs are still no match for Intel's Skylake/Gen9 SoCs. Intel HD Graphics Gen9 is better than Carrizo iGPU. INTC is working very hard on integrated graphics. Intel's eDRAM introduction at 15W makes its mid-end and high-end solutions more compelling than before. Zen architecture will be a certain remarkable improvement, but INTC has a lot of firepower for the following years. With the last Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) Carrizo APU release, people thought that AMD could achieve very good results in the APU field, reducing the performance gap against Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) while achieving some graphics advantage. AMD claimed an improvement about +15% of IPC and +30% of performance per watt at 15W TDP. As for the graphics field, AMD claimed +65% performance than the last Kaveri APUs at the same TDP. Such a boost would have set a good base start for the successive Zen architecture, which will effectively reach the market in 2017. I must admit that I was quite skeptical about those performance claims, and first benchmarks confirm my doubts. In addition, it looks like Intel has worked very hard on integrated GPUs, and it is finally introducing the eDRAM even in those 15W SoCs, providing a huge graphics boost that AMD cannot reach even with its last architecture. From the CPU point of view, it would have been possible to see more improvement from Steamroller to Excavator than from Broadwell to Skylake. However, the last benchmarks tell a different story: AMD A10-8700P performs roughly 10-15% better than AMD A10-7350B while Intel i5 6200U/6300U performs roughly 10-15% better than Intel i5 5200U/5300U. This simply means that Excavator architecture meets the claims, but it only provides a performance improvement (talking about %) similar to Skylake. Obviously, since Intel's solution is quite faster, Skylake provides a better absolute improvement. (First Surface Book reviews show that Skylake could perform even better when the thermal dissipation is built correctly. Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) devices are to be well considered when talking about benchmark comparisons). However, this is not where I want to focus since it's always clear that Intel Skylake would have been widely faster. I want to focus on the GPU field instead, where AMD basically claims to be faster and more competitive. We can check the following table, where I resumed performance improvements on similar/specular benchmarks for HD 5500, HD 520, R6 Kaveri, and R6 Carrizo (note that there are still few benchmarks available to make a comparison): The performance leap from Intel HD Graphics Gen8 to Gen9 is greater compared to the performance leap from Kaveri to Carrizo. This makes sense since AMD had to lower the TDP by 4W (-21%) while Intel is pushing very hard on graphics improvements. Unfortunately, there is only one game benchmark available at the moment, it is Dota 2. This is a game that significantly favors Intel's graphics at low resolution and quality settings, a scenario where the CPU must work hard to elaborate the high GPU frame rate. On the contrary, at higher resolution and quality settings, Intel's GPU generally loses some of its advantage because the CPU is not the bottleneck anymore. Therefore, it is interesting to see that the HD 520 improves much more than R6 Carrizo in a scenario which has always been in AMD's favor. I must point out that the HD 520 (as well as HD 5500) powers a wide range of SoCs, from i3 to i7 solutions: the graphics performance difference is very narrow between these kinds of SoCs, and it is not unusual to see an i5 to perform better than an i7 due to thermal constraints. Remember that Intel 15W TDP SoCs are usually employed in Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 (Surface 4 Pro is an example) while the first AMD Carrizo benchmarks come from a bulky laptop (which generally favors thermal dissipation). Just from this comparison, Intel has done a good job in the graphics field, and this causes my skepticism: If AMD targets the graphics field with its APUs, why would customers prefer its solutions all of a sudden? Excavator did not erode any relevant performance gap compared to Skylake while Carrizo iGPU provides a quite lower improvement than Intel Graphics Gen9. AMD exploited an old, low-cost miniaturization technology (28nm); it has set very low price targets and it has endured continuous losses trying to achieve any relevant market share, but Intel's dominion is still intact. The same scenario is repeating itself with Excavator/Carrizo, or maybe it is even worse. Obviously, we have to wait some time to analyze the future reviews of both the products, but first reviews put Intel even better positioned than last year: a XPS 13 with i5 6200U is roughly 100% faster than a XPS 13 with i5 5200U in Metro 2033 at low settings, a very high demanding game. The first R7 Carrizo benchmarks show that this APU deeply suffers thermal throttling if the dissipation system is not good enough. Looking at what I have been able to find out (note that the linked article shows internal tests, but in real recent benchmarks, R6 Carrizo performs 10-15% lower in 3D Mark 11), R7 Carrizo should perform better than R6 Carrizo by +10-15%. Such a boost is obviously welcomed, but it would be only sufficient to reach HD 520 average performance in GFXBench and 3DMark. Things get worse if we consider games with Broadwell/Gen9 (since there is only one comparable result for Skylake at the moment). If we take all the Notebookcheck benchmark games at playable settings for HD 5500 and R6 Carrizo, we will notice that Broadwell is roughly +15% faster than R6. This means that Broadwell will have similar performances compared to R7, implying that Skylake HD 520 will be significantly faster without any eDRAM module. Intel employed the eDRAM module in various SoCs, starting from 28W solutions, but this year it has been introduced starting from the 15W offer. The top-end Surface 4 Pro employs an i7 6650U which is powered by a HD 540 Iris GPU, with 48 EUs and 64MB of eDRAM. Looking at first recent benchmarks, this GPU is able to outperform the HD 520 by 50% with the same TDP while it is roughly on par with the HD 6200 Iris Pro (47W SoC). To better evaluate its graphics capacity, it will be able to outperform GPUs like 940M and it will be able to face something like a M370X (Macbook Pro Retina 15') or slightly better. Given this scenario, the eDRAM makes possible to decently play games and drive professional 3D programs if the 3D project is not excessively heavy. Even from the price point of view, there is only a small difference since the i7 6650U costs just $22 more than i7 6500U or i7 6600U while the i5 6260U and i5 6360U cost just $23 more than i5 6200U and i5 6300U. This means one thing: What you have seen in the previous chart was simply meaningless, because Intel has clearly raised the bar with the eDRAM addition, which enables it to massively outperform AMD in the 15W mid-end and high-end solutions. This kind of performance difference was quite unthinkable just last year. What about the Zen architecture? The server Zen SoCs will be released in Q4 2016 (with market product presence in H1 2017) while the desktop and laptop solutions will be released in mid-2017. These SoCs will provide a better IPC by 40% (but we know that such high claims hardly meet reality) and they will be built with a 14nm node technology, achieving a high core count (however, the sources state that Zen will adopt 2 cores for 5-15W and 4 cores for 15-35W). Will this be enough to reach Intel? Sincerely, I do not think so. Intel will release two new architectures in 2016 (Kaby Lake) and in 2017 (Cannonlake); in addition, it will release two new GPU architectures at the same time. INTC is also planning to release Cannonlake at 10nm and to double the core count, projecting to also increase eDRAM adoption. If we want to consider HBMs, such a technology is not suitable for integrated GPUs, because these SoCs do not have feeding requirements even comparable to discrete high-performance GPUs. Moreover, Intel could still adopt 3D XPoint and MCDRAM to face an eventual AMD HBM SoC adoption. Given these points, it is very difficult to see competitive results from AMD's Zen architecture. It will certainly be a nice improvement, but from what AMD has already disclosed, its chances to provide a really competitive solution are still very low. Steamroller/Carrizo APUs cannot change AMD's fate, even in this generation. The relative CPU improvement is similar to what Skylake is showing at the same TDP while the GPU comparison looks worse than expected. Intel HD Graphics Gen9 has improved graphics performance at a major rate compared to AMD, tipping the balance towards its favor. AMD has obviously achieved good results, reducing the TDP by 20% and improving performances, but Intel HD Graphics simply grew much more. If we also consider Intel's eDRAM solutions, INTC clearly owns the medium- and high-performance segments without any doubts. In my opinion, AMD has no chance of achieving relevant market share, and it will continue to register losses in the laptop and desktop segment through 2016. There is still little hope for the Zen architecture since the last cash infusion will permit AMD to release it in 2017, but if we consider AMD's claims and Intel's potential for the following years, it is frankly really hard to see the Sunnyvale company living better times in future. Even the chance to see Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) devices running AMD's SoCs (custom or Zen) looks quite unlikely to happen. In any case, I do not exclude that Apple is evaluating this route, but at the same time AAPL is evaluating Intel to build future modems and application processors to power its iPhones and iPads. Moreover, if Intel maintains its performance per watt leadership, Apple is unlikely to turn down the faster solution, no matter the price. The entry level Mac line would be the only segment where a slower AMD APU would make sense, but Intel would still provide a probably more suitable solution, given the upcoming 10nm Cannonlake. The actual scenario makes me consider Intel a quite solid and consistent long-term buy with a very good potential in many fields. For what concerns AMD, with the recent cash infusion, it could be an object of some speculation, but it is a stock I would not consider to invest in now. Its destiny is too much uncertain and it is all based upon Zen's success and the eventual major contracts with Apple. AMD is more likely to be acquired or go bankrupt in the following years.
