Microsoft, Volvo disclose driverless car deal - Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:GELYY) | Seeking Alpha Nov 20 2015, 03:41 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Volvo ( OTCPK:GELYY ) has struck a deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that will see the two companies work together in developing driverless vehicles and give potential car buyers an interactive shopping experience using the latter's HoloLens headset. Customers who come into a Volvo showroom will be able to use HoloLens to view a car in 3D, change colors and see how many of its features work. Although details were scarce in other areas, the move highlights the trend for technology companies to jump into the autos space. Oh my. I love the ambition but with the glitchy-ness of Windows 10 I would be living in fear within an autonomous car powered by Microsoft. I kid. I'm sure Microsoft will do better than Detroit, at least. Wait:  Having lately read SA articles that claim MSFT has lost the battle for corporate success and probably also simple survival, am I now to be told that MSFT is actually positioning itself with a successful partner for future technology success?  What will they do next?  Come up with new ideas other corps. haven't discovered, enhance their still growing cloud business, or...?   What's a guy to do?
