Amazon Doesn't Make Much Profit (And That's OK) - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is still a buy at current prices. Profits will not matter for Amazon until revenue growth slows. Until then Investors should take advantage of the current momentum. Many believe that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is vastly overpriced. Amazon certainly does not follow traditional valuation models and currently profit does not matter to the share price. The stock price reflects the expectation of future profits and continued growth. Profits could indeed begin to increase and even out to a reasonable PE ratio over time, but that time is not now. Investors should take advantage of the current momentum and invest in Amazon until their growth slows. Many investors follow a strict rule of never picking a stock over a certain PE ratio. These investors have been missing out on massive profits from the increase in Amazon stock all year. For Amazon and many other stocks, profits do not matter. What matters is revenue growth. This growth is what has led to Amazon's current success. Amazon's revenue has grown from $147M to projections of over $100B this year. By no means do I suggest that Amazon is a buy and hold forever stock. The price will have to come down to earth someday. However, Amazon has the current advantage of not needing profits. Amazon's goal is to increase market share by crushing the competition and gaining customer loyalty. Any profits that they do make are hidden by R&D costs to increase innovation. This strategy is what is fueling Amazon's current share price. Once this revenue growth starts to slow down, then profits will matter. But until then growth is more important to investors than profit. With such a high valuation Amazon's stock price will rapidly decline from a negative surprise. However, this surprise will come from a decrease in growth as opposed to a decrease in profits. Many think Amazon is making the switch to earning profits with AWS. While AWS has much better margins than Amazon's retail business, Amazon is still following the same strategy that has been working by cutting prices to gain market share over competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Due to their size Amazon will have a lot of trouble continuing such impressive growth. However I believe they can keep it up in 2016. Once this growth stops Amazon will need to work on profits and these profits will come with their commanding market share and R&D. Until that day Amazon and investors are happy with growth and hiding profits through R&D. It's not too late to jump on the Amazon train. I'm not sure how long the run will last but the end is not here yet. Investors should take advantage of the momentum and buy Amazon on the dips before Q1 while setting up stop losses to protect from a possible negative surprise. While Amazon currently does not need profits to continue to rise, there are indicators that the profit days are coming soon. Consensus estimates forecast that Amazon's profits will approach $20 billion by 2019. Most of this profit is expected from AWS. AWS accounted for roughly 7% of total revenue but represented 52% of operating income last quarter. With AWS total sales increases of 78% and 81% year-over-year for the past two quarters, this could be a game changer for Amazon. By 2020 AWS is expected to account for $38 billion in revenue with a 35% margin. Here is a chart comparing AWS to other cloud competitors: While AWS had a very profitable margin, this profit will go down in the short term. This is not a problem as the goal is market share, not profit. While AWS is the biggest cloud entity, it only has roughly 1% market penetration . Amazon will continue to cut prices and plans on adding four new regions in 2016 compared to just one new region in the past two years. This rapid expansion will lower margins in the short term but pay off in the long run. Conclusion: Even though margins are low in retail, with profits of less than one percent of revenue, Amazon has a lot of room for potential growth. This combined with the massive growth in AWS, which does have nice margins, will lead to the continued success for Amazon in the future. Amazon is focused on raising revenue and users, profits will come later. The sales estimates for the year show that this strategy is working with Amazon capturing more and more market share. Investors should take advantage of Amazon's momentum in the short term and buy on the dips caused by oil volatility before the next earnings report. If Amazon's price comes down to earth, it will not be in 2016. I predict a $725 share price after Q1 earnings are released.
