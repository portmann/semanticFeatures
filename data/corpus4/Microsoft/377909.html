Reverse Engineering Microsoft's Value - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha In my personal investment research time, I try to examine a different technology company each week. This time I looked at Microsoft. On first glance, I found Microsoft's stock price to be rich, so I dove deeper to understand what the market is thinking. Using a "reverse engineering" process, I understood how MSFT is priced and subsequently took a look at why it is priced in such a way. Weekly, I personally take a look in the tech world to find a suitable place to put my money. This week, I looked at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and what I found may make you reevaluate how you view the mature company that it is. After looking at MSFT's stock price and some basic metrics, I first asked, is Microsoft priced for growth? That's a pretty heavy question. If the answer is yes, then my next question becomes is Microsoft trading at these levels because it's in growth mode or because it's expected to be in growth mode? If I can determine the market is accurately pricing Microsoft, then I can buy shares today at a reasonable, fair valuation. If the answer to that two-part question is no and no, it becomes a decision to pass on the investment for now and, if possible, create a fair value entry price on the stock. In this article, I answer and evaluate these questions using a less conventional method. To understand if Microsoft is trading at growth levels, I need some growth valuation parameters to hold it up against. Here, I use the company's historical multiples as well as a comparison to a growth company's earnings. Picking this comparable is probably harder than the actual analysis itself, therefore, I decided to reference well-respected Seeking Alpha contributor Chuck Carnevale, who is endearingly referred to as "Mr. Valuation." I believe his valuation metrics are arguably the most conservative of our time and will represent valuation accurately. In particular, I will pull from his recent article Is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) A Screaming Buy Or Sell? In this article, Chuck applies a generous 10% annual earnings rate for a dividend growth stock and an acceptable 20% annual earnings growth rate for a growth company. However, since I don't expect Microsoft to be growing at Facebook-like multiples due to many factors, I split the difference and use a middle ground of 15%. Typically, when evaluating whether a stock is overvalued, most people look at the current price-to-earnings and price-to-sales metrics among other ratios to observe if they are higher than the comparable and, if they are, conclude the underlying stock is overvalued. However, I want to change that evaluation and use a different method. This method takes a growth company-like earnings rate, historic company multiples, the current stock price and determines if they line up. If they do, it means the stock is trading in a historically average range with growth-like earnings. It's a reverse engineering method to "check" our valuation with our expectations. For the historical valuations, I determined Microsoft's average P/E ratio to be about 13 for the last six years, not including this most recent year to facilitate a historical basis. Similarly, MSFT's average P/S ratio is 3.54. This historical valuation brings us back to 2010 and is the starting year for my growth calculations. In fiscal year 2010, Microsoft earned $2.10 per share. Using the predetermined 15% annual growth rate, MSFT today would be yielding $4.22 in earnings per share. Using today's share price of ~$53, the P/E ratio would be calculated at 12.56, near the historical ratio of 13. Continuing the exercise with a price-to-sales comparison, the company brought in $62.48B in revenue in 2010. Using the same 15% growth rate gives us $125.11B in revenue for the last fiscal year. The P/S ratio then calculates to be 3.76, which is slightly above the 3.54 historical average, but within an acceptable tolerance. We can conclude Microsoft trading at $53 using historical valuation averages should be growing earnings at growth company rates. In other words, Microsoft is currently priced for growth. First question answered. On to the first part of the next question: Is the company currently in growth mode? Since we've done the bulk of the work already, it is easy to apply actual earnings from the past five years. In the table below, I examine the released earnings with the year-over-year growth, including the average growth rate. *Does not include $8.4B in impairment charges It seems net income isn't terribly healthy let alone in growth mode. Revenue on the other hand seems healthier, but still a decent amount below our expected rate of growth. It's easy to conclude the company is not currently in growth mode. This brings us to the other arm of the question: Is Microsoft expected to be growing? This is trickier, but these future expectations are what the market uses to price securities. However, the market isn't always right and that's what I ultimately want to weigh. Using past and present analyst estimates to get a handle on how the company performs relative to them can be a good indicator of what is to come. Because of the long track record, this can be an effective method for evaluating expectations of the company. For this analysis, I use several sources, ranging from Yahoo Finance to FAST Graphs, which provide collective analyst estimates. Because Microsoft is well-covered, analyst estimates seem to be within pennies across these various sources. Now, of course, estimates are just that - estimates. Therefore, I must look deeper than that alone and also include the companies' track record of beating or missing estimates. Using NASDAQ's earnings surprise history , Microsoft in the last three quarters managed an average beat of 13%. I'm going to give MSFT the benefit of the doubt and say it can maintain that streak. I then factor in estimate beats to give us a "realistic" idea of what the company may issue. *Because FY16 is halfway over I factored in a 6.5% surprise. These numbers look better and give me the impression Microsoft is ready to kick it into growth gear. However, I hope you're now recalling my exercise above that gave the company a growth EPS of $4.22 to support the current share price. It would take the company until after 2018 to be fairly valued based on historical average multiples. But I already see the comments saying historical multiples shouldn't matter here if the company is in growth mode. Alright, let's bump it up. I'm willing to pay up to 16 times earnings for a Microsoft that is kicking some butt, but not complete butt. That equates to a share price of $63.52... In other words, I'm looking at capital appreciation of nearly 20% over three years, or 6.22% in compounded annual growth. That's not terrible, but remember I'm seeing a company priced for growth, and I'm not looking for a measly 6.22% per year from a growth stock. For comparison's sake, I've realized 28% in compounded annual growth with my Facebook holding. That growth is very healthy and one that I'm willing to pay for. Great question. Because MSFT pays a dividend, I'm willing to accept less than 28% in CAGR. I apparently agree with 15%, so let's stick with that number. I would need to buy shares of MSFT at $42 to realize a 15% CAGR over the next three years. That's over 20% downside I must hold out for. So what am I assuming about Microsoft? I'm assuming Microsoft will trade for 14.3 times this year's forward earnings per share of $2.97 to see high enough annual capital appreciation to buy a company that is currently priced like a growth company. If the company is priced for growth, then I want the share appreciation of a growth company. With Microsoft at current levels, I will not realize that. By reverse engineering Microsoft's current valuation, I found the stock is priced for growth. However, that growth is not here, but expected in the future. Unfortunately, the growth that is required to support the current valuation is about three years away. For the stock to be valued for growth and growth-like appreciation, the stock must be trading for $42. Of course, several things could change between now and then. I would reconsider MSFT closer to the current share price if Microsoft: expands in the tablet market with Surface while overcoming Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) competition, or I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
