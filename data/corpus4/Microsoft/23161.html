Microsoft's Persistence With Surface Will Yield Big Gains - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Earlier this week, Microsoft introduced the Surface 3 and completely altered the direction that the entry-level tablet has been going. The non-Pro Surface 3 is capable of fulfilling the needs of professionals in ways that the iPad can’t while costing the same. Last quarter, Surface made up 4% of Microsoft’s total revenue, but a nifty foundation is being built for the brand to grow. When it comes to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), the Surface brand has always been one of my favorite topics because I believe that OEM manufacturers like Dell, HP (NYSE: HPQ ), Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) and many others are failing Microsoft when attempting to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on anything other than pricing. I have covered this in further detail before, and concluded that when it comes to personal computing, the Surface is Microsoft's action against the competition and may as well be vital to the company's future of mobile computing. Apple revolutionized the build quality of mobile devices with elegant products and attention to detail, and the Surface brand has taught us that Microsoft is very capable of competing with the quality seen with MacBooks. Microsoft's perseverance of the Surface series has begun to pay off with the Surface Pro 3, and I'm optimistic about the Surface 3's ability to lift the company's hardware revenue. Last quarter, Surface generated $1.1 billion, or approximately 4% of the company's total revenue and I'm confident that we will see far greater numbers arrive in both the near and long term. The latest iteration brings full computing, professional tasking and note-taking in its smallest and most affordable design yet. Additionally, with the upcoming Windows 10 operating system forming the foundation of Microsoft's future products, the long-term prospects of Surface are beginning to look very good. The most important aspect of the Surface 3 was Microsoft's long-awaited termination of the ARM-based Windows RT failure, which now makes the entry-level Surface a full-fledged computer. This also means that the library of apps has literally increased by millions compared to its predecessor. Windows 10 was likely a major motivator for the tablet as Microsoft advertises that Surface 3 owners will receive a free upgrade to the unified operating system. Other significant changes include the carry-over of the Surface 3's high-quality note-taking pen, albeit at an understandable $50 extra. This brings me to pricing where the Surface 3 initially passes with flying colors. The elegant, ultra-thin, magnesium-housed tablet that brings a full desktop experience at $500 is great value, but I must admit that the terrain gets a bit rough as we go up. For $500, users will get a relatively slow Intel Atom processor and a mere 2GB of RAM, which is OK. However, for an additional 2GB of RAM (and 64GB of storage), users will have to fork up an extra $100, and if you purchase the pen the total will be $650. For an extra $150, buyers could purchase a Surface Pro 3, which includes a larger higher-resolution display, a pen, the same 4GB of RAM, and a far more powerful processor. Although this difference isn't terrible, it does reflect upon Microsoft's ill-natured pricing schemes. As an example, in order to get an extra 4GB of RAM on the Surface Pro 3 compared to the entry-level 4GB version, buyers are forced to fork up an extra $500 and simultaneously upgrade their processor and storage for a total of $1,300. Even Apple let its customers upgrade their MacBook Pro's 4GB of memory to 8GB for an affordable $80 before the new models defaulted to 8GB of memory. To conclude pricing, the Surface 3 at $500 is a spectacular deal and from my personal experience with Surface tablets, the $130 flimsy keyboard cover is far from a necessity unless you are typing long documents as the touch keyboard is excellent. When it comes to entertainment, the Surface brand has a long way to go before it will be able to compete with an iPad thanks to Apple's 5-year head start with iPad-dedicated apps. However, when it comes to professional and productivity usage, the Surface 3 leaps over the iPad as it delivers the capabilities of a full computer. The Microsoft Office suite comes free for a year, and the amount of professional desktop apps available on the Surface far exceed anything that the iPad can deliver, at least for now. Furthermore, the Surface has a note-taking experience that students and artists will find particularly useful. The Surface Pro 3 directly targeted the MacBook Air and partially the iPad Air, however the Surface 3 is in a great position to compete with the iPad Air 2 and I suspect that many tablet seekers will easily give the Surface 3 their attention. Ever since the arrival of the Surface Pro 3, I have become very optimistic toward the future of the brand. Microsoft's persistence has brought the Surface from a bulky, heavy and clunky product to a lightweight, thin, and elegant Surface 3. With the new MacBook, Apple has given us a demonstration of what's possible from Intel's latest Core M processors with the new MacBook and I suspect Microsoft may use such processors in its upcoming design. Microsoft has "nothing" to say about the upcoming Surface Pro 4 for now, but I am pretty confident that it's going to be something great. In addition to great products, Microsoft is building a sturdy foundation for the Surface with the upcoming arrival of Windows 10. Windows 10 plans to serve all Microsoft Products from the Xbox One, Windows Phone, Surface, Desktops and more. Microsoft also emphasized that developers will be provided a platform that will allow them to create a single app and watch it seamlessly work across every Windows device. This will instantly translate to rapid growth of app development for devices like Windows Phone and Surface, which suffer from a lack of developer interest due to its small customer base. However, Microsoft's PC business is huge and if this will be operating on the same platform as its phones and tablets, there will likely be a major interest on behalf of developers. The Surface had a rough start, but its most recent quarter has passed $1 billion and I believe that the tablets are still within its adolescent stages. Going forward, the Surface is going to build upon itself and bring significant value to Microsoft, which is a new direction for the software-based company. Apple made nearly $9 billion in revenue last quarter for the iPad alone, which is an enormous addressable market for Surface and I expect to see Microsoft eat into this revenue following the launch of the Surface 3. The Surface is very important, and Microsoft's execution is both spot on and exciting. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
