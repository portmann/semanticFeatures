Tax Reform Should Be A Priority In 2017: Beware Of Ultra-Low Tax Rates - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Dec. 28, 2015  5:04 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: CA , CTXS , GOOG , GOOGL , IBM , MSFT , ORCL , VMW by: Lenny Grover Tim Cook's Blowup on 60 Minutes was widely covered, but the need for tax reform deserves even greater attention. Tax reform can help grow the economy by encouraging capital formation and domestic reinvestment while reducing the federal deficit. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize need for "tax reform" - one of its leading advocates is new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Reform is unlikely in a Presidential election year, however. Companies exploiting loopholes in the tax code to reduce their tax rates may face higher rates in the future. Future after-tax earnings and cash flow expectations should be adjusted accordingly. Back in September 2014, when public outrage was focused on tax inversions, I wrote an article entitled "Tax Inversions" Are Tip Of An Iceberg That Already Cost The U.S. Treasury Hundreds Of Billions . While the focus on my article was the $630B in untaxed foreign earnings of Dow 30 companies, an astute commenter pointed out that Apple also was a large offender. During his 60 Minutes Interview earlier this month, Tim Cook was asked about Apple's practice of avoiding US taxes on tens of billions of dollars in overseas income. According to an article in The Hill : Cook acknowledged that Apple has more money overseas than any other company but said that two-thirds of the company's business is abroad. He said he'd love to bring the overseas money back to the U.S. but that doing so would not be prudent because of the tax rate the company would pay. "It would cost me 40 percent to bring it home. And I don't think that's a reasonable thing to do," he said. From the earlier article, it should be clear that the practice of avoiding taxes on overseas earnings is not limited to Apple. In December 2014, a major investigative report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) found that Disney and Koch Industries used complex schemes to limit their tax liabilities in the US and Europe by establishing a presence in Luxembourg. Ironically, with a certain measure of chutzpah, Koch Industries was airing ads emphasizing that the company was "proudly built on American values and skills" and "started in the Heartland" that year. Given that public and private companies across America were exploiting loopholes to limit their tax liability, it's understandable that Tim Cook felt unfairly singled out by Charlie Rose's question. However, the large scale of the problems with the current tax code also make reform more likely rather than less. It unfairly advantages large multinational companies over smaller and/or purely domestic ones. The Macroeconomic Benefits of Tax Reform The existing tax code discourages repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result, it incentivizes foreign reinvestment relative to repatriation and domestic reinvestment. Clearly, this is not in the national interest. Removing disincentives to the repatriation of capital can increase domestic re-investment and help promote economic growth. Loopholes that allowed for Google's transfer payment scheme or Koch Industries' "Swiss branch of a Luxembourg subsidiary" deprive the Treasury of much-needed near-term revenue while producing an effective tax rate for large multinational corporations that is below that of small businesses and startups. Lower top-line rates, and the elimination of loopholes that are exploited by the country's largest companies, can encourage small business capital formation while reducing the federal deficit and leveling the playing field between large multinational companies and local American startups and small businesses. According to a November article in Politico : In a speech to the House just before his swearing-in Thursday, (incoming House speaker Paul) Ryan named tax reform as one of his top priorities..."The cynics will scoff - they'll say it's not possible," he said. "You better believe we're going to try."..."He spent his nights dreaming about tax policy," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday, in a speech welcoming Ryan to the new post. The same article asserts that reform would be less likely in the 2016 Presidential election year, which pushes any effort into 2017, but also points out that Ryan is far more committed to tax reform than John Boehner was. Democrats also have warmed to the idea of tax reform. In 2011, the New Democrat Coalition (of right-leaning and moderate Democrats) released its tax reform principles . According to Bloomberg : Business-friendly House Democrats are urging Congress to overhaul the tax code by lowering corporate rates, removing breaks and easing the burden on U.S. companies' overseas operations, mirroring some Republican goals. Even unabashedly liberal Democrats, such as MA Senator Elizabeth Warren, agree that the current tax code is suboptimal and exhibits the problems enumerated above. Her website has an entire section devoted to tax policy , which states: An army of lobbyists helps create tax loopholes, and an army of lawyers helps these companies take advantage of them - and it's all perfectly legal. What does that mean for the rest of us? Small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage. We need serious tax reform to make the tax code fairer and simpler. The most profitable corporations should have to pay their fair share. The tax code should not be designed to encourage companies and jobs to go overseas. And those who already have made it big have a responsibility to pay a little bit forward - so the next kid coming along has a chance to make it too. From Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren, it seems there is widespread agreement that the tax code has major problems. That bodes well for the prospect of reform in the next administration (Republican or Democratic). With tax reform looking more like it could be a political reality after the next presidential election, it makes sense to consider the impact of lower statutory rates with fewer loopholes on companies' bottom lines. For illustration, below is a table of large, consistently profitable, multinational tech companies with their effective tax rates over the last five and three years. Source: Screener.co export from 12/26/2015 As the table above indicates, Apple's average effective tax rate over the last three years was actually higher than all of the high-tech peers listed in this table. In fact, Citrix's average tax rate over the last three years was less than half of Apple's. Apple has accumulated such a large amount of unremitted foreign earnings in large part because its annual earnings are also much higher than this peer group. Also notable is the fact that none of these companies are paying anywhere near the 35% statutory top-brakcet US tax rate on corporate earnings. In fact, Citrix and VMWare have three-year average tax rates that are actually below the bottom bracket, minimum, statutory rate of 15%. Meanwhile Google's (GOOG, GOOGL ) rate is below the 20% bracket that doesn't apply after the first $75,000 (no multiplier!) of corporate earnings. There is room to reduce the top-bracket tax rate while still increasing overall tax revenues. If tax reform becomes a reality, it is likely that the most tax-efficient companies will be forced to pay more in taxes (regardless as to whether the political solution is revenue neutral to the Treasury). Looking at the companies on the list above, Citrix, VMWare and Google would likely face the largest impact from tax reform but IBM, Oracle, CA and Microsoft, with sub 23% effective tax rates, might also face a significant impact. Apple with its ~26% rate actually appears less exposed than many of its high-tech peers. When forecasting future earnings, it's important to consider how future tax policy might impact the effective tax rates of companies with unusually low historical rates. In addition, the one-time impact from repatriation might also need to be considered. Let's use Apple as an example: Apple reported having $26.9 billion in deferred tax liabilities related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries in its 10-K filed for the year ended in September 26, 2015, (relative to $21.5 billion at the end of the prior year). That implies an absolute, and highly unlikely, "worst case scenario" in which a one-time repatriation tax on its legacy unremitted foreign earnings of $26.9 billion was coupled with an increased ongoing cash tax burden of roughly $5.4 billion a year related to foreign earnings (which the company is already booking as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet and was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets on the cash flow statement). However, Apple could weather even the "worst-case scenario" in stride. With $21.1 billion of cash and equivalents, $20.5 billion in short-term investments, and a whopping $164 billion of long-term investments on the same 10-K, Apple could satisfy its maximum tax burden without an adverse effect on its balance sheet (or liquidity). Furthermore, $5.4 billion in additional annual cash taxes sounds like a lot, but Apple generated a whopping $53.4 billion in net income in the most recent fiscal year (inclusive of the balance sheet impact of the increase in deferred tax liabilities). Given that tax reform would likely reduce top-line rates and reduce the burden of repatriating overseas assets, that "worst-case scenario" is likely far too punitive relative to what Apple would actually face under a new tax regime. Since the "worst-case scenario" will not materialize, it's actually possible that Apple's actual ongoing future tax liabilities will accrue at a lower rate than the company is accruing deferred tax liabilities today. Its ongoing net income could conceivably benefit, even as its cash flow might suffer. Hopefully, bipartisan tax reform will become a reality in the next presidential administration. While my preference is for tax reform that generates incremental revenue to the Treasury and helps to mitigate future deficits, in addition to solving the problems above, even "revenue neutral" tax reform would likely raise the effective rates on the companies with the lowest effective tax rates today. More fairness and certainty in the tax code would be beneficial for American businesses. Rather than railing against critics of current tax policy, responsible business leaders like Tim Cook should actively engage in the process and encourage Congress to act on tax reform.
