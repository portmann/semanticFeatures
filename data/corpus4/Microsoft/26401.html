Intel Earnings: Bad News Baked In, But One Longer-Term Problem - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Stock looks fairly valued, but sentiment is negative as expectations have fallen (again). Q2 2015 consensus tough compared to 2014's second quarter jump in PC biz. INTC's capex nut like running a marathon with piano on your back. The stock options could limit dividend growth - INTC needs to option incentives less. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), the microprocessor giant, reports its Q1 2015 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, April 14th, 2015. Analyst consensus is expecting $0.41 in earnings per share (NYSEARCA: EPS ) on $12.9 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 8% in EPS and 1% in revenue. (Given the preannouncement it surprised me that INTC was still going to show y/y growth, so the numbers were double-checked and they are accurate.) Since the Jan 2015 earnings release, the consensus EPS estimate has fallen from $0.48 to $0.41 while the consensus revenue estimate has fallen from $13.7 billion to $12.9 billion, or a cool $800 million. The gross margin guide of 60% was lower-than-expected then, and it will likely be lower when we see the results on Tuesday night. Q2 2015 consensus is expecting $0.48 and $13.5 for expected year-over-year declines of 13% in EPS on a 2% revenue decline. (Remember it was late June 2014 where INTC pre-announced positively on PC uptick thanks to Win XP reboot.) The positive pre-announcement last June and then the negative preannouncement this mid-March 2015 demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that INTC is still tied to the PC cycle and that the other investments were maybe all for naught? But INTC's bigger issue in my opinion is the $10 billion capex requirement for fab investment for what is a dying PC segment or at least mid-single-digit secular growth for the PC business, which I have always likened to trying to run a marathon with a piano on your back. Ins Sell % - shows the amount of insider selling relative to the share repurchase program. Analytically, it tells me how much of the share repo program is required just to prevent dilution from management selling stock options. Just since 2010, or the last 20 quarters, INTC's capex has averaged 50% of cash flow, which is a heavy weight to bear. You typically find that in the energy sector. If I go all the way back to 1998, the average is 47%. Here are some other interesting facts: From 1992 to 2000, INTC averaged 25% revenue growth From 2000 to 2009, INTC averaged 1% revenue growth From 2010 through 2017, which includes consensus estimates for 2015 through 2017, INTC is expected to average 8% growth and that is distorted by 2010 and 2011's 24% revenue growth rates. You can see why Brian Krzanich wanted to buy Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). Basically INTC is a business that the more product they can generate off that $10 billion capex investment every year, the more delta they can generate for EPS, just the same as any business with high operating leverage or high degree of fixed costs. There are other semi companies that have made this transition successfully, but they did it another way, i.e. they got out of the capex business, but that's another article for another time. With INTC's business model, they need to generate better than 3% revenue growth every year to satisfy shareholders. Valuation: INTC in the low $30s looks fairly valued as my estimate is closer to $35 while Morningstar's intrinsic value estimate is at $29, and thus the average is $33. The dividend yield at 3.1% looks attractive, but I think it could be capped since total dividend dollars is roughly 40% of INTC's free cash flow, and the most INTC can likely max that out at is 50% of free cash, given the stock options that have to be absorbed by the share repo plan. Intel, like many of the 1990 tech giants, has struggled to move away from its core competency and technologies. The Altera acquisition will give Intel access to new markets and products, although the deal looks to be off now. Still I think INTC needs to eventually pursue something to re-engineer the core technology away from microprocessors for PCs. INTC has been a very frustrating long for many years, and yet I think Brian Krzanich is a decent CEO capable of re-engineering INTC as Satya Nadella is doing with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). So often in business a company's incredible strength becomes an incredible weakness, as markets evolve, technologies change and "creative destruction" occurs.
