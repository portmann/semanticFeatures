Why Are Hedge Funds Dumping Apple, Disney, And Facebook? | Seeking Alpha Recent hedge fund disclosures reveal that hedge funds are decreasing their positions in AAPL, FB, and DIS while these stocks remain a favorite among investors. Aside from a handful of select technology picks, hedge funds are flocking to the financial sector. So far in 2016, the technology sector bet by private investors has far outperformed the financial sector bet by hedge funds. Recent hedge fund disclosures reveal surprising market behavior: firms are reducing their positions in investor-favored stocks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Based on data published by the financial accountability engine TipRanks , hedge fund holdings of Apple, Disney and Facebook stocks currently amount to roughly 25%, 10%, and 19.5%, respectively. These holdings together constitute the majority of U.S. based hedge funds, but the overall possession of these stocks has been significantly reduced by the firms. More specifically, for every two hedge funds that increased their positions in Apple last quarter, three reduced their positions. Disney and Facebook shared similar fates with a one to three buy/sell ratio among top hedge funds. What could be some of the decision factors separating hedge funds from private investors? Apple, the world's most valuable company, has dropped dramatically to $104.71 since its high of $134.54 last April. Based on simple metrics, it appears that Apple is a good buy. The P/E of 10.5 is very low compared to one of its largest competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), whose PE is 37.99. Additionally, Apple has a large amount of cash on hand (approximately $215 billion). The cash continues to be a safety net for investors should Apple's stock drop further. Investors are comfortable knowing that the company can afford to buy back shares and increase their dividends in the future. With its large and loyal user base, Apple continues to dominate the smart phone market while capturing a whopping 91% of the smartphone profits globally in 2015, despite its shrinking share of the market ( source ). Looking forward, investors have the iPhone 5se to look forward to. The 5se model has a smaller 4-inch screen with the functionality and speed of the iPhone 6s. At a lower price point and with a smaller screen, Apple can increase their market share in developing countries like India and appeal to customers who prefer a smaller and cheaper device. Despite the company's slowdown, some investors remain attracted to the loyal customer base and higher-end products that dominate the smartphone market. â€¦ While hedge funds are not as keen anymore to take a bite of the Apple Hedge funds seem to view the Apple case a bit differently. It appears that Apple can no longer maintain the strong gains that it has made in the past 5-10 years. The high-end smartphone market in which Apple competes is saturated and the iPhone is no longer a unique product, but rather a widely owned device. Without the vision of Steve Jobs, some could argue that Apple has lost its direction and its ability to continually innovate. The company's most publicized innovation of late is the Apple Watch, which flopped in the face of sales estimates. Lastly, Apple's push towards electric vehicles may turn off investors as the company plans to enter a market in which it has no familiarity or experience. Most notably, Carl Icahn 's hedge fund dumped $700 million in Apple stock in the fourth quarter. Several other hedge funds followed suit, including Larry Robbins and Chuck Royce. On the whole, over 25 hedge funds either reduced their position in Apple or sold out of the company completely. It appears that Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens might have given investors a glimpse into the future of Disney. The film grossed an astonishing $2.054 billion and helped Disney post a record $1 billion in the first quarter of operating income. This number represented an 86% increase to the Studio Entertainment division for Q4 of 2015. Additionally, the segments revenue increased 46% to $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion. Fortunately for Disney, Star Wars is not done releasing films and the potential to continue remarkable growth in revenue is realistic and even expected after the strong first film reviews and reception (90% favorable on RottenTomatoes.com). Private investors have disregarded some of the trouble surrounding cable cutting and the loss of ESPN subscribers in order to focus on the more familiar epic fantasy saga and overall brand name. Disney can continue to increase its bottom line with box office hits and revenue generated around its successful films; toys, licensing rights, spinoffs, and merchandise. Hedge funds look beyond the recent Star Wars box office hit towards a darker force in Disney's future. Some may consider Star Wars to be a Band-Aid on a cut that needs stitches. While Star Wars was a smashing hit, it only distracts investors from Disney's real problem: ESPN's slowdown and a loss of subscribers. Disney, according to the NY Times, has "the highest level of fixed costs (sports rights)," which can prove to be challenging if ESPN's bottom line continues to shrink. The transition towards "unbundling" is threatening Disney's grip on the cable entertainment. Companies like HBO and CBS are "unbundling," meaning they are breaking apart their packages and instead offering a monthly fee for select programing. The "unbundled" program fees are cheaper than the large packages that Disney relies on and are shrinking Disney's market share. In order to survive, ESPN may have to follow suit, but it appears that hedge funds want to reduce their exposure to this particular "package." Facebook continues to dominate as the world's beloved social networking site. With a portfolio including Instagram, face.com, WhatsApp, and Hot Potato, Facebook-owned platforms are omnipresent. Facebook's strong portfolio has helped position the company to expand and improve its already dominant products. Surrounded by the many success stories and potential VR success with the Oculus Rift, private investors are drawn to this stock. Facebook's familiarity factor and the overall attractiveness of the technology sector can be a strong decisive factor pushing investors to pour money into the company. Strong performances lead to high expectations. Facebook has established itself as the leader in social networking, but can it grow enough to justify its current 86 P/E ratio? In 2012, the company had 61% of online adult users on the website followed by 71% in 2013 and another 71% in 2014. In 2014 alone, according to Frank N. Magid Associates, Facebook lost 6% of its teen market share in 2014. The sheer size of Facebook may prove to be troublesome to maintain as the demand for new technology and features may outpace the company's ability to improve its products. Facebook is losing ground with teenagers as customers shift towards using Snapchat and Twitter. According to the Washington Post, Teenagers are drawn towards "erasable media - ephemeral photos, videos and comments which are here one minute, [and] gone the next." Facebook is operating in a fast paced and ever-changing industry, which proves to be volatile above everything else. Given the volatility, some may point to the fact that Facebook is overvalued. The company has a very high P/E of 84.46 when compared to the industry average of 47. The company has succeeded due to its simple and attractive user interface, addictive products, and huge user base, but how long can the company continue to grow? Can Facebook continue to grow ad revenue in the future? How many ads can Facebook place on its website before users become completely turned off? Will future generations use the site or will new trends threaten to take away the Internet Empire that Facebook has built? While Facebook is performing well at the moment, the company will eventually run out of steam and many hedge funds may not want to own the company when it does. Twitter lost 65% of its value and LinkedIn 55% in the last year, proving that unlike the banks, technology firms are never too big to fail. George Soros' hedge fund may have already gotten wind of this as Soros Fund Management reduced its stake in the social media giant by more than half in the fourth quarter. TipRanks quarterly hedge fund report, the GuruPortfolio, breaks down the top 10 stocks held by hedge funds. Data reveals very large investments in the financial sector. Hedge funds currently hold a huge 16% stake in Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), in comparison to the measly 5%, 4.4%, and 1.64% for Apple, Facebook and Disney respectively. Other financials starring in the top 10 are American Express (NYSE: AXP ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). A few technology firms also managed to take a top 10 position. These are Microsoft, IBM (NYSE: IBM ), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ). Hedge funds seemed well aware of the imminent downturn and preemptively shifted funds to the consumer goods sector. Making the top 10 in the consumer goods category? Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC ) & Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ). In the past it would have been easier to say that the hedge funds are likely in the better bet; however, for the last 2 years the performance has shown them to be as lost as private investors. Ultimately, it is time to notice the growing rift between the hedge funds and private investors. If the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates banks will be able to increase profits on loans, and a strong shift from the technology stocks to banking stocks might take place. With that said, so far in 2016 the technology sector bet by private investors has far outperformed the financial sector bet by hedge funds. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, FB, DIS.
