Premarket Biotech Digest: Apple In Healthcare, The Apple Gilead Comparison, 4 Phase I Trials - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha This article discusses what Apple is doing in healthcare, and what it can do. Also compares Apples and Gileads, (pun alert). Four phase 1 trials reported in this period. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long dabbled in healthcare. I can remember even 5 years ago when there were talks of developing apps to help senior citizens navigate through their medication regimen. Early this year, Apple teamed up with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Japan Post - Japan's largest health- and life-insurance company - to deliver an iPad and a set of IBM apps to senior citizens that can help them live healthier. Another development is Apple's HealthKit platform, which is being tried by various hospitals, including Mayo Clinic, "to collect real-time data from iPhones… and connect it to hospitals, doctors, and electronic medical records." One potential benefit of continuous symptom tracking will be lower number of hospital and doctor visits, thus trimming some of that $3 trillion that America spends annually on its healthcare. It can also enable doctors proactively advise patients demonstrating elevated symptoms through their Apple devices. According to a report on Reuters by Christina Farr, "those trying out Apple's service included at least eight of the 17 hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals, the U.S. News & World Report's Honor Roll…Apple's HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps and Wi-fi connected scales." Apple is also allowing researchers and healthcare startups to use its HealthKit and ReserachKit platform to develop useful apps. One such app, developed at the MIT Media Lab, is Ginger.io, which "uses sensor data collected through the phone and self-reported information to identify people who may need help." Another app developed at Stanford to study cardiovascular health had 11,000 subjects enrolled overnight, which, as Alan Yeung, medical director of Stanford Cardiovascular Health put it, "would take a year and 50 medical centers around the country." In yet another development, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research has co-developed an app that had 6000 users in a few days. CEO Todd Sherer says that while there are concerns about non-representative data, that is a concern in standard clinical trials as well. Having just spent over $60 million in a 5 year, traditional biomarker study, he thinks any technology that can enhance user engagement is worthwhile, especially since doing this the Apple way is so much cheaper, easier and quicker. It appears to me that so far Apple has concentrated its focus on healthcare data tracking and monitoring, which is a great thing. That can help patients, doctors, hospitals and insurance providers in a number of ways. One related but unexplored area is clinical study enrollment, where companies usually spend billions of dollars every year, and which is generally a great source of trial delay. Patient data usually comes from hospitals and clinics, however, various sorts of state and federal laws make access very difficult. Apple's huge network can certainly help. But data monitoring, while a good thing, isn't science fiction. Science fiction is data generation, which is what the iWatch tried to do, but didn't really succeed. If there was an iPhone-like device which could monitor blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, perform simple pathological tests, simple forms of imaging and endoscopies, and generate individual patient data that could be remotely monitored by a doctor, that would be next-generation science. The Apple iWatch was a very small step towards that goal, a step more in what it planned to accomplish, but failed, rather than in what it actually did. It was supposed to do a lot of things - blood sugar, blood glucose, blood oxygen levels - but it ended up as a gold-encased smartwatch that tells you when to run. Here's an extensive quote about what it tried, but failed, and may yet get done: Apple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It's not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a "black hole" sucking in resources, one of these people said. Development languished because much of the health-sensor technology failed to meet Apple's standards, these people said. Apple tinkered with sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, a concept used in polygraphs to gauge stress. The technology also showed promise for heart-rate monitoring such as an electrocardiogram, or EKG, these people said. But these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin. Results also varied depending on how tightly the person wore the Watch, they said. Instead, Apple opted for more pedestrian pulse-rate monitoring, these people said. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or the amount of oxygen in the blood, but the results were inconsistent. Moreover, if Apple interpreted the numbers to provide health or behavior advice, the company likely would have needed approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulators. These features were shelved for the first version of the watch, but they may be included in future models, the people familiar with the matter said. Focus Ticker: Apple and Biotech Stocks Performance Comparison Apple has returned 1647.34% over the last 10 years. In the same period, the NASDAQ has returned 131.12%. Rival technology company Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has returned just 68.34%. Indeed, it is very difficult to find a company the size of Apple having such stellar returns. The closest any stocks that would come to Apple in terms of returns would most likely be in the biotechnology sector. It must be noted that any comparison will not be ideal, given that Apple's market cap of $657.18 billion would dwarf nearly all companies in the biotech sector. For the purpose of comparison, I have chosen Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) (market cap of $170 billion) and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN ) (market cap of $129.3 billion). In a way both companies are similar to Apple when it comes to creating value for shareholders. In the same period that Apple shares have returned 1647.34%, Gilead has returned 986.59%. Interestingly, Amgen has returned just around 110%. Since the start of the millennium, Apple has returned more than 3000%. Amgen's return of 180% in the same period once again fall well short of Apple's. But Gilead has generated returns of 6710% in the same period. The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index ETF has returned 262% since the start of the millennium. The last 10 years has seen the index return 386%. Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ) is another large cap biotech. Its performance in the last 10 years has been impressive, returning 455%. But again this is dwarfed by the returns generated by Apple. Indeed, when comparing to some of the best performing large cap biotechs, the only stock that stands out against Apple is Gilead Sciences. Mylan Lowers Acceptance Condition on Perrigo Offer- Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL ) announced that it has formally lowered its acceptance condition for its bid to acquire Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO ). The acceptance condition has been lowered from not less than 80% of Perrigo ordinary shares to greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shows. While MYL said that the move to lower acceptance condition showed its commitment towards completing an acquisition, Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa was critical of the move. Papa said that the offer from Mylan already substantially undervalues PRGO and the latest announcement makes the deal even worse. Galectin Shares Rally on Patent News- Galectin Therapeutics (NASDAQ: GALT ) shares rose more than 13% on Thursday as the company announced the receipt of a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. PTO for patent application number 13/726,900. If issued , the patent will extend coverage of GALT's pectin-derived compounds to include treatment of kidney disease associated with the development of fibrosis, established kidney fibrosis, chronic lung disease associated with the development of fibrosis and established lung fibrosis. Innocoll Appoints New Chief Commercial Officer- Innocoll AG (NASDAQ: INNL ) announced the appointment of Rich Fante as its new Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Business Development. Fante will take charge on August 20th, 2015. The newly added role is an additional step in INNL's transition to a commercial-stage company. Fante was most recently involved with RF Consulting, a firm that helps emerging biopharmas in their commercialization efforts. Veloxis ( OTC:LFCYF ) had a labeling revision for Envarsus XR, a "calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release formulations in combination with other immunosuppressants." Approved dosage forms were .75mg, 1 mg and 4mgs. The company has a market cap of about $300 million, is priced at about 19 cents and has decent average volume, upto 54000. Hospira, now a unit of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), had an ANDA approved for Levofloxacin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic originally developed by Daiichi Sankyo ( OTCPK:DSNKY ). Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMS ) had a labeling revision and an efficacy supplement with clinical data to support for Sprycel, a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (NYSE: CML ) in chronic phase, and for adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. Sales Sprycel increased 17% in 2014 to $1.49 billion, despite challenges from generic manufacturers in countries like India, where BMS recently won a patent lawsuit against a local manufacturer wanting to develop low cost dasatinib. A Water Consumption Study of ALKS 5461 in Healthy Volunteers - Alkermes (NASDAQ: ALKS ). ALKS 5461 is undergoing multiple phase 3 clinical trials under an FT designation for major depressive disorder (MDD) and it is also being studied for treating cocaine dependence. Positive topline results from one study was announced in January, and final results from all studies are expected in 2016. "The first sales for this drug are forecast for 2016 ($25 million), rising to $350 million by 2019, and Alkermes is looking to outlicense the drug." Study to Evaluate Relative Bioavailability of, and Potential Effect of Food on a Test Lenalidomide Oral Suspension - Celgene . Lenalidomide is Revlimid, a derivative of thalidomide which is indicated for Multiple Myeloma, approved in 2006, and MDS. Revlimid had revenues of $4.98 billion last year. A Multiple Ascending-Dose Study of RG7625 in Healthy Volunteers - Roche ( OTCQX:RHHBY ). RG7625 is an early stage candidate in Roche's Immunology pipeline. Pharmacokinetics of Entospletinib in Adults With Normal and Impaired Liver Function - Gilead. Entospletinib is GS-9973, a highly selective and orally efficacious Syk inhibitor which is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for autoimmune and oncology indications. Syk inhibitors like fostamatinib have shown efficacy in multiple indications, but development has been hampered by side effects mostly because of off-target activity. Entospletinib is a more selective Syk inhibitor that is potentially indicated for various Hematological Malignancies. Merck and MD Anderson Cancer Center- Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK ) announced that it has entered into a strategic research collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to evaluate KEYTRUDA in combination with other treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or novel antitumor medicines. As per the terms of the agreement, collaborative studies will focus on tumors such as gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The first studies are scheduled to start enrolling later this year.
